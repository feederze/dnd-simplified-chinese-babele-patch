Their bodies seeth with an internal heat below the charcoal-gray scales that cover their forms. While the blazing light emanating from their empty eye sockets makes it appear as though ashsnakes can see, they rely entirely on vibrations to assess their surroundings.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Mysterious Origins</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Little is known about the origins of the ashsnake. They recently emerged from beneath the ashen plains of the Scorched Grove and appear to have an insatiable hunger. Ashnakes use the mounds of ash and dust in the Grove to conceal their presence, allowing them to close in on unwary prey and ambush them. While not particularly intelligent, ashsnakes possess predatorial cunning and survival instincts eerily reminiscent of the fauna that inhabited the Grove before its burning.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Sightless Worms</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Ashsnakes have no ability to detect sights and sounds in a traditional sense. They are, however, adept at sensing even the smallest vibration, and the slightest footfall is enough to draw their attention. Some scholars believe it may be possible to “disappear” from an ashsnakes “vision” by standing perfectly still, but finding volunteers to confirm this theory has understandably proven difficult.</p>"

The aspect is not only a creature of heat and energy, but also of destruction and rage, and it appears to draw strength from the forests its flames consume.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Primal Incarnation</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">A creature of legend, it is believed by some that this was the “being of fire and destruction” said to have caused the Great Calamity that created the Scorched Grove many centuries ago. The aspect possesses frightening power, enough to cause serious harm to the Wood and all those who inhabit it. Long has it been forgotten that the creature was conjured in a lost ritual. Shortly afterwards, it was sealed away beneath the Scorched Grove where its presence has continued to affect the region. Centuries of dormancy have weakened the aspect, as its essence has seeped into the surrounding land. Since being released, it has begun to amass power for itself by consuming plants, trees, and other living beings in flame. Once it attains enough energy to completely break the mystical fetters that tie it to the Scorched Grove, it will be an unstoppable force that could very well bring fiery ruin to all of Humblewood.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Stirring in its Slumber</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The strange occurrences of late have many prominent scholars baffled: unusually aggressive emberbats, the appearance of ashsnakes, the increased frequency of forest fires, and many other phenomena which have never been seen before in Humblewood. More than mere legend, the aspect is the reason for all of these. As a creature of primordial fire, it is inextricably bound to the plane of its element. Even as it slumbered beneath the Grove for generations, the aspect has stirred, its presence causing a weakening in the barrier which keeps the material plane separate from the plane of fire, allowing for weaker creatures to slip through.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The aspect’s essence has also seeped into the Scorched Grove, causing the landscape to take on far stronger elemental properties than before. The fundamental shift in the Grove’s nature has effectively thwarted the efforts of the Tenders, who have for so long sought to heal this burned land. As the aspect continues to grow in power, more of this harmful elemental energy will be released, and even more powerful creatures will arise from the flames. If this otherworldly power spreads across the forest unchecked, all of Humblewood might suffer the fate of the Scorched Grove.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" title=\"The Battle with the Aspect of Fire\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Aspect-Face-Off.webp\" />"

They also remain skilled with weapons they wielded in life, making them useful guards or servants.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Unnatural Life</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Animated skeletons are common among the practitioners of the necromantic arts. Even at the Avium, where necromancy is forbidden in practice, it is taught in theory. A common exception is the use of animated skeletons for menial tasks around the college. The reanimation of birdfolk who did not give their express consent in life is seen as a violation of their memory, so these skeletons usually consist of former college staff who desired to stay and help long past their own time. Not all scholars agree that even this relatively benign form of necromancy should be allowed, while others don’t see why permission from the dead should be necessary, believing that “dead is dead”. Though the consent policy remains in place, heady debates over the ethics of certain forms of necromancy have resulted in the shunning of more morally flexible scholars.</p>"

Rumored to have been originally devised by the mad necromancer Lathrus of the Night’s Call, cobblefrights are made by linking several birdfolk skeletons together to form one frightening creature with enhanced physical properties. Among those who have studied Lathrus’ research, only the most reckless have tried to create a cobblefright of their own, often to disastrous effect.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Horror of Horrors</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Cobblefrights are generally pieced together from the skeletons of five or six birdfolk. The combination of multiple bodies allows not only for a larger and more robust design, but also vastly increases the quantity of necromantic energies cobblefrights contain. This increased capacity for power provides cobblefrights with tremendous strength, as much as a dozen birdfolk combined. It also grants cobblefright bones greater durability. Their remarkable power and resilience is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as cobblefrights also require a large amount of necromantic energy to be sustained. The surviving records of cobblefright creators note that, quite unexpectedly, the creatures developed the ability to drain the life force of other living beings, replenishing their own energy in the process. This makes cobblefrights useful as independent sentries, so long as they have a steady supply of living beings to fuel them.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Chaotic Psyche</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The discordant parts that comprise cobblefrights exert tremendous strain on the bodies of these creatures. The source of this strain is rooted in the same magic that allows birdfolk skeletons to recall skills they once knew in life: the bones remember. Remnants of the soul such as memories, desires, fears, skills, and certain forms of knowledge are imprinted on the bones of the departed. When activated by necromantic energy, these conflicting impressions swirl chaotically within cobblefrights. Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator. However, necromancers must be careful to maintain control over these dangerous creatures. Damaged cobblefrights will readily harvest their maker as an immediate source of life energy.</p>"

The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Colonies of Combustion</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting. The real threat they pose lies in the remarkable coordination of their colonies.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Alone, an emberbat is no more dangerous than a candle. But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them. However, recently colonies of emberbats are acting aggressively towards travelers, harassing any who approach their expanding territories. Some swear they have seen emberbat supercolonies whose heat could be felt from yards away.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Fine Familiars</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Throughout Humblewood’s history, the docile nature of the emberbats have made them ideal familiars or animal companions, especially to masters who journey into dark places.</p>"

These cat-like beasts have the unique ability to grow leaves and moss on their spotted fur, allowing them to camouflage perfectly within the forest canopy.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Fable and Folklore</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">One of the reasons forest prowlers have attained such mythic status is due to their elusive nature. They are adept at moving unseen through the canopy where they hunt, and their skills as ambush predators means that few who see them live to tell the tale. In some communities the killing of a forest prowler is considered a rite of passage among beast hunters. The large fangs seen adorning the necks of Humblewood’s greatest hunters and warriors, and cloaks made from prowler fur, are trophies that showcase one’s prowess and skill.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Fierce Hunter</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Forest prowlers are apex predators. They can claim virtually any prey they desire, but usually target deer, elk, and other large herbivores. Prowlers use their powerful bodies and gripping claws to drag their kill up into their tree nests, where it can be consumed at their leisure. These felines are known to travel long and winding paths through the forest, residing in temporary shelters throughout the seasons. Although nomadic, the prowlers are quite territorial of whatever area they currently inhabit. Relatively passive in the winter, they are most active in the spring and summer during peak hunting and breeding seasons.</p>"

          "text": "<p class=\"hpp header-3\">Slimes</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Deep in the murky marshes of the Mokk Fields, where water lays stagnant and the stench of decay permeates all, the worlds of life and death intertwine. Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for scholarly innovation.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Three main types of slimes have been classified, but as magical creatures with strange properties, it’s speculated that more elusive slime species might exist somewhere in the remote swamps. The three documented types are: caustic slimes, shifting slimes, and sticky slimes.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"> </p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-beastiary.ZpNHEuM9NMTE8G8h]{Caustic Slime}</h3><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" title=\"Caustic Slime\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Slime-Caustic-Mask.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp para-2\">These pale green oozes have an astringent chemical odor, which mixes with the smell of liquefied flesh from their latest meal. Owing to the slow speed at which they digest their victims, the bones of partially-digested meals can be seen through their transparent exterior. Dissolving remnants move within the slimes in a macabre semblance of motion. This phenomena has earned them the nickname “green puppeteers”.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Natural Defenses</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Capable of producing a lethal acid that can eat away at stone and metal, caustic slimes are especially deadly. Even the slightest touch on exposed fur or feathers can be dangerous. Many would-be heroes have met a slow, grim demise after being engulfed by these strange creatures.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Scientific Interest</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Though hazardous, the acid produced by these slimes is also valued for its potential uses as a powerful sorcery reagent and an ingredient in potent potions. Some claim it can be distilled into practical applications, like a solvent for metallurgists and builders.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"> </p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-beastiary.O1E5F5WnFPAU9ShS]{Shifting Slime}</h3><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" title=\"Shifting Slime\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Slime-Shifting-Mask.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp para-2\">A type of large and fluid ooze, shifting slimes have an iridescent hue to them which seems to shift as they move. According to slime-wranglers, they can use magical energy to create an eerie bioluminescence. Shifting slime residue is a highly sought after potent reagent, but it is hard to come by. Despite their size, these slimes are elusive and generally spend their time below ground where visibility is low. They can be quite difficult to locate when they conceal themselves in the subterranean darkness, though these strange creatures are known to leave trails of bioluminescent residue to lure in prey.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Adaptive Defenses</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">This type of slime can harness magical energy within its form. Shifting slimes absorb and store magic passively over time, but are also capable of absorbing magical jolts from spells. It is unclear exactly how much energy they can store, or for how long.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Shifting slimes can develop a temporary immunity to various types of magic after exposure. This immunity in turn makes it exceptionally difficult to destroy the slimes with a single type of magical energy. Luckily for slime-wranglers, shifting slimes are only capable of containing one energy type at a time.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Manifestation of Stored Power</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">After absorbing magical energy, these slimes will change color based on the type of power absorbed. Because of the rarity of shifting slimes, only a handful of people have witnessed these changes. But, over generations, skilled slime-wranglers have managed to record which color a shifting slime will turn in response to different types of magic.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"> </p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-beastiary.dhOYowRoDrwjeFxU]{Sticky Slime}</h3><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" title=\"Sticky Slime\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Slime-Sticky-Mask.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp para-2\">A semi-solid type of ooze, sticky slimes are far more robust than their cousins. Experienced slime wranglers know never to attack them directly with weapons. The rubbery bodies of sticky slimes can suck a blade out of a wielder’s hands, leaving the attacker unarmed.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">True to Form</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Sticky slimes are wholly described by their name. They leave a trail of extremely thick adhesive residue in their wake. While the residue itself is harmless, it can trap adventurers where they stand, and sticky slimes tend to live in proximity of far more threatening monsters.</p>"

Covered in rocky protrusions that serve to protect as well as camouflage them, mountain lions possess special powers as a result of their ties to the elemental earth of their territory.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Mountain Stalker</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Mountain lions live and hunt in their craggy mountain homes. They are natural climbers and prefer to ambush unsuspecting prey rather than engage in prolonged chases across the treacherous cliffs. A pride of mountain lions is led and protected by a large female. Males compete for the right to mate, and work together as a hunting party. While not as adept at pack hunting as wolves, a few mountain lions working in tandem can take down dangerous creatures of unusual size, including basilisks and griffons.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Roar of the Earth</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Owing to the magic of the elemental earth, mountain lions can gain limited control over nearby rocks with their roar. Using this ability, they can cause rockslides to hinder their prey’s escape or inflict critical damage. The ability takes a great deal of energy, so many mountain lions use it sparingly, knowing it will be some time before they can call upon it again.</p>"

Their name originates from the powerful tidal waves their bodies cause, which pose a considerable threat to nearby vessels.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Ocean Tales</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Despite their size, wakewyrms are elusive, able to hide within the vast expanse of the ocean. The rarity of this creature has bred many rumors about the exact nature of wakewyrms. All sailors know at least a few stories about bizarre creatures of the sea, including fantastical accounts of wakewyrms that lurk in the ocean’s gloomy depths, able to sink an entire fleet of ships. Such tales are more often fabrications than not, as few have actually encountered these creatures.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Devourer from the Deeps</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Wakewyrms are more than a 100 feet long and weigh over 1000 tons. Their lashing tails, snapping jaws, and huge bodies can deal significant damage to a ship’s hull, though they prefer to swallow sailors whole, swiftly pulling them into the fathoms below with hardly more than a splash. Filling their gullet with as many creatures as possible, wakewyrms let their strong stomachs take care of their meals. While a fine tactic for devouring fish or other large marine creatures, wakewyrms that swallow adventurers whole sometimes find the snack too much to handle.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Though wakewyrms rarely encounter sailing vessels as they cross the ocean looking for food, the results are often violent. Afterwards, all that remains is nothing but a derelict phantom ship, found wrecked against the rocks of distant shores.</p>"

Only the skillful survive the forest, and the birdfolk have become masters of both the forest floor and the canopies above, creating several settlements (known colloquially as “perches”) throughout the Wood. Despite regional differences and cultural peculiarities among the different kinds of birdfolk in the Wood, the birdfolk races nevertheless share much of their culture, language, history, and origin myths. This solidarity has allowed them to work together and prosper, creating a harmony in the Wood which has lasted for an age.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">While a diverse group, adapted for a variety of environments within the Wood, birdfolk also share several physical traits which have allowed them to find common ground in the construction of their perches. Beyond the obvious physical similarities, all birdfolk possess arms covered in feathers, which extend into wing-like appendages. While incapable of true powered flight, the strong hollow bones and lightweight bodies of birdfolk allow them to easily use their feathered arms to glide, and unless severely encumbered, all birdfolk can recover gracefully from what would otherwise be a deadly fall. In some birdfolk races these wings have grown strong enough to bear their owners upwards in a mighty flap, while others instead developed talons which make for both deadly defensive weapons and useful tools for scaling tall trees.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">The birdfolk have established themselves as a political force to be reckoned with in Humblewood. They shaped their mighty capital from the great tree Alderheart, and from this bastion of safety their ruling body, the Birdfolk Council, makes decisions which impact all of Humblewood.

The term “humblefolk” is used throughout the Wood to refer to the non-birdfolk peoples who live a little closer to the forest floor. Unlike the birdfolk, whose shared language, histories, myths, and culture have allowed them to exist in harmony for most of Humblewood’s history, the humblefolk represent a disparate group of peoples, cultures, and ways of seeing the world, many of whom haven’t always seen eye to eye.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Ages ago, an accord was struck between the people of the forest floor to unite against roving bandits and quell the in-fighting that was wreaking havoc across the Wood. This accord was known as the “Humblefolk Treaty” and was witnessed by the birdfolk, who were just then beginning to shape the trunk of Alderheart. The birdfolk offered the humblefolk safety within their great city, and many accepted their offer. Over time, more and more humblefolk migrated to newly-established birdfolk perches, though many found birdfolk architecture to be restrictive for creatures without wings. In the same way, some groups of birdfolk, feeling too crowded within the booming perches, began to spread out and seek shelter within small woodland villages. Even today, the birdfolk who choose to live on the forest floor find themselves stigmatized, as a life in the canopy is considered proper in birdfolk society.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">After the establishment of the treaty, humblefolk began to live once again in small woodland villages beneath the trees, although now in more diverse communities alongside some ground-dwelling birdfolk. With the expansion of the Humblefolk Treaty to allow humblefolk to call upon Perch Guard garrisons in times of crisis, and the birdfolk militias keeping the roads safe for merchant caravans, the Wood truly entered a golden age. Life for many humblefolk was peaceful and prosperous…until the fires came.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">With the spreading flames, humblefolk villagers petitioned the overextended Perch Guard for aid, only to see help arrive too late, if at all. To make matters worse, after many years the divisions between the humblefolk communities have intensified: those who found prosperity in the birdfolk cities have adopted a perch-dweller’s perspective, while those who live in the woodlands face a constant threat from brigands and forest fires. Others have even left to join the newly reformed Bandit Coalition, seeing not only a path for survival, but a chance to get even with the perch-dwelling birdfolk for broken oaths and unequal treatment. Yet, where the treaty holds, vibrant humblefolk communities can still be found. The humblefolk are resilient, and each race will devise a way to survive in this dangerous wood.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\"><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Height-Humblefolk.webp\" /></p>"

Their reputation in birdfolk society is nothing short of villainous, and they are regularly cast as the antagonists of any given situation. It’s hard to say whether the corvums are distrusted because they behave the way they do, or if they behave the way they do because they are distrusted.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">For Personal Gain</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">It is widely believed that corvums only look out for themselves. Sometimes this presents as flexible morals, and at other times it simply means they follow a personal code instead of subscribing to general law. Either way, corvums are a crafty race and they tend to get what they want, one way or another.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Corvums are typically found in positions with a modicum of power, such as advisors or minor officials. The stigma they face usually prevents them from attaining too prominent a position in birdfolk society, but corvums are adept at working behind the scenes, spreading their influence subtly and to great effect.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Too Smart</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Corvums are commonly accepted, sometimes begrudgingly, to be among the smartest of birdfolk. Keen observers, they trade in information the way others trade goods. They are hungry for knowledge and leverage it to further their goals whenever possible. Their undeniable skill in matters of logistics and planning make them valuable to councils and powerful individuals alike.</p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Corvum Traits</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Ability Score Increase</span>.

Of the birdfolk, they are the most likely to be found living among the humblefolk. Gallus have a deep respect for nature and a love of gardening unmatched by other birdfolk. They value their social bonds above all else, and are always ready to help their neighbors and promote the common good. They are polite but have little patience for deceit and rudeness.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">A Varied Folk</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The gallus are a varied folk, resembling as many different varieties of wildfowl as there are trees in the Wood. Some are pheasant-like, others are grouse-like, while some resemble chickens or turkeys. There are dozens of variations of feathers, colors, and patterns even between gallus of the same subrace. The gallus are proud of their appearances but not to the point of vanity. Maintaining good grooming is akin to keeping a knife sharp and shows a level of respect for oneself.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Birdfolk are generally welcoming to other races, but the gallus are particularly well-known for their willingness to include virtually anyone in social or familial groups. In gallus culture, it is customary to always offer your seat at a table to guests. This is seen as the basis of a popular and hilarious children’s story about a meal growing too cold to eat as the gallus continually give up their seats to late arrivals at a party.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Salt of the Earth</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Gallus are a social and communal folk. They tend to form close-knit communities wherever they roost, and their sense of pride for their community runs deep. When tragedy leaves children in their village orphaned, it is customary for gallus families to take them in. Gallus value honest work, such as farming and smithing, and share labor equally between all community members. There is nothing a gallus would not give to their neighbors in a time of need.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While other birdfolk might look down on gallus for their common ways, the gallus have excellent interpersonal skills.

They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Touched</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">These inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Of Two Worlds</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities.

Resembling owls, their thick feathers, solid bodies, and broad wings have earned them a reputation as the most powerful of the birdfolk races. They value strength and endurance, traits they believe crucial for survival in the Wood. Although they are not necessarily prejudiced against those who are weaker, strigs are quick to call out when someone is not doing their best for the common good.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Strong and Brave</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While many birdfolk rely on their prowess or intelligence for superiority, strigs use their immense strength and stamina to endure even the most punishing assault. They make mighty warriors, and whether defending their perch or braving the Wood itself, strigs never shy away from a fight.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Strig culture is largely based on principles of strength and endurance above all, but not necessarily for the purposes of combat. Protecting and providing for others in hard times is considered just as impressive, if not more so, than winning a fight.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Woodland Survivors</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Strigs, more than any of the other birdfolk race, are most at home in the wild. Their mottled feather patterns, though not as bright or beautiful as others, allow them to easily hide in the forest. Due to this inherent advantage, along with their speed and power, strigs make excellent hunters and rangers.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Strigs prefer the relative simplicity of the forest to the machinations of society and politics. Despite these individualistic tendencies, they are capable of forming familial and community bonds that transcend a permanent or single physical home.</p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Strig Traits</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Ability Score Increase</span>. Your Strength score increases by 2.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Age</span>. Strigs reach maturity faster than most birdfolk races, around 15 years. They can reach a respectable old age by birdfolk standards, living around 80 years.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Alignment</span>. Strigs are normally good aligned, having a strong sense of fair play as well as a tendency to see the best in others. They also favor chaotic alignments, as strigs are a freedom-loving people who will usually put their personal morals above any imposed system of governance.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Size</span>. Strigs are muscular, imposing folk ranging from 4 to over 5 feet tall and weighing around 110 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Speed</span>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Glide</span>. Using your feathered arms, you can slow your fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose, although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you are encumbered.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Talons</span>.

          "text": "<p class=\"hpp header-2\">Cervan</p><h6 class=\"hpp subhead2-scratch\">enlightened leaders</h6><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Cervan-Priest-Mask-2.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Cervans are a versatile deer-like folk who make their homes in small, intimate villages throughout Humblewood. More insular than other humblefolk, cervans often reside deep in the most ancient parts of Humblewood’s vast forest, in tree stands and groves far from birdfolk perches.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Hale and Hearty</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Cervans have a robust physique and are rarely sick. They are one of the longest-lived races among the humblefolk. Though their wariness has earned them a reputation as timid, cervans are cautious because they remain active and alert, and generally prefer practice to contemplation. Cervans like to pursue skills independently in order to give themselves a sense of purpose. This striving is what propels some cervans to positions of great import throughout the Wood. A happy cervan is one who is hard at work.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Wary and Practical</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">One of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges. Even under such circumstances, cervans have maintained positions of leadership and delegated responsibilities to make sure that villages are run in accordance with the old cervan teachings, ensuring that work necessary for survival in the most remote villages is accomplished, so that all its inhabitants may be kept healthy and happy.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The ability to balance their innate caution with practical considerations is one of the cervans’ greatest strengths. Cervans teach that the best means of survival in any situation is to remain calm and weigh one’s options. The best cervan leaders favor this approach.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">The Sight</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Cervans have a unique ability to bounce back and survive a physical shock that might kill others. Occasionally, cervans who survive such traumas are granted mystical visions. Sometimes these are flashes of insight into the world around them, sometimes portents of doom, and other times visions of a far away future. Known among cervans as “The Sight”, this phenomenon is elusive, and out of the control of mortals. Cervans who have seen visions in this way are known as “The Sighted”, and after this initial event, some will suddenly find themselves receptive to visions of the past, present, and future.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">A cervan whose Sight has been triggered is encouraged to hone it, so that they might take on the role of a seer within their village. However, these efforts aren’t always met with success. The Sight will sometimes visit a cervan only once in their lifetime, with no amount of training granting a glimpse of such visions again. This is believed to be for the best, as cervans acknowledge that those who are truly Sighted carry knowledge that can be both a blessing and a curse.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">The Blessing of Cairith</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While it’s not unusual for some cervans to have small antlers or buds visible on their heads, only rarely is a cervan born who can grow a full set of antlers. These cervans are a different subrace—pronghorns—and are thought to be specially blessed by their Amaranthine Cairith, a sacred spirit of life and growth believed to watch over all cervans. Unlike other subraces, pronghorn and grove cervans are the same people. The arrival of a pronghorn cervan is an event to celebrate, as it can occur only once in a generation.</p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Cervan Traits</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Ability Score Increase</span>. Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Age</span>. Cervans reach maturity around 12 years. They live long lives compared to the rest of the Humblefolk, between 100 and 150 years, something they attribute as much to their way of life as the blessing of Cairith. Pronghorns generally live longer than grove cervans, which is considered a sign of Cairith’s favor.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Alignment</span>. Cervans are pragmatic in their thinking, and generally prefer to keep their philosophies flexible in order to prioritize what they believe is important for both themselves and their communities. They lean towards neutral alignments.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Size</span>. Grove cervans stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, and have light builds, weighing between 130 and 180 pounds. Pronghorn cervans are taller and tend toward heavier, more muscular builds, standing around 7 feet tall, and sometimes weighing over 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Speed</span>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Practical</span>. Cervans are eminently practical and like to spend their time learning useful skills for life in their woodland villages. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Athletics, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Surge of Vigor</span>. All cervans possess a great tenacity and will to survive, which allows them to bounce back from even the most devastating blows. If an attack deals over half of your current remaining hit points in damage, (even if your hit points are reduced to 0 by the attack) you immediately regain hit points equal to 1d12 + your Constitution Modifier. You can’t use this feature again until you have completed a long rest.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Languages</span>. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk, and speak Cervan (Cervan has no written component).</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Subrace</span>. There are two main subraces of cervans: grove or pronghorn. Choose one of these subraces.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-races.Item.0dH1QwaPjW7P52lW]{Grove Cervan}</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As a Grove Cervan, you are swift and agile, able to quickly maneuver out of harm’s way.

They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures. Despite their sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born of cowardice, their behavior stems from a desire to respect the feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be of utmost importance in hedge society.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Sensitive and Kind</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Hedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Hedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation, coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">One of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional wounds run deep with hedges.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">One With the Forest</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Gifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm, hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to the connection possessed by some gallus. This has granted hedges special magical gifts, such as the ability to speak with the smallest ground-dwelling creatures in the Wood, and the power to cause flowers to bloom. It is quite common for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share their home.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Hedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees. Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature, near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a few small gardens wherever they live.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Dressed for Comfort</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Hedges need special consideration when wearing clothes, and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other clothes which fit easily over their quills. When not actively flared out, these tough quills naturally flatten, becoming smooth to the touch. However, if suddenly frightened, their quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can ruin a hedge’s clothing.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Adventuring clothes made specifically for hedges are available in nearly every major city in Humblewood, and tailors throughout the Wood are familiar with making alterations to suit a hedge’s needs.</p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Hedge Traits</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Ability Score Increase</span>. Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Age</span>. Hedges take longer to mature than most other races, reaching adulthood around 20 years. They also live for a long time, with many reaching 120 years or more.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Alignment</span>. Hedges are compassionate, empathetic, and diplomatic, tending towards good alignments. They also favor neutral alignments, as hedges have a great respect for the balance of nature.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Size</span>. Hedges have short, rounded body shapes, standing between 3 and 4 feet in height, and weighing between 40 and 70 pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Speed</span>. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Natural Burrowers</span>. You have a burrowing speed of 15 feet. You are capable of burrowing through soil, but are unable to dig through anything more substantial with just your clawed hands.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Spiny Quills</span>. The backs of hedges are covered with spiny quills, which makes it impossible for hedges to wear armor. These quills provide exceptional protection, therefore you have a base armor class of 14 + your Dexterity modifier. Even though you can’t wear armor, you can still benefit from the armor class bonus provided by shields so long as you are proficient with them.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Curl Up</span>. You can use your action to curl up, exposing attackers to a wall of your toughened quills. While curled up you cannot move, attack, or cast spells with somatic components, and your base armor class becomes 19. You cannot benefit from any Dexterity bonus to armor class while curled up, but you can still use shields.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Any creature that misses you with a melee attack while you are curled up takes 2d4 points of piercing damage from your sharp quills. If a creature hits you while you are curled up, you are knocked prone in your space at the end of the turn. You may uncurl yourself at any point during your turn.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Forest Magic</span>. You have a deep connection to the magic of the Wood. You know the <span class=\"hpp italic\">druidcraft</span> cantrip. Additionally, you can cast <span class=\"hpp italic\">animal messenger</span> as a 2nd level spell once with this trait, and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Speak With Bugs</span>.

In proportion to the rest of their body, a jerbeen’s legs are long and powerful. Jerbeens can be found in a variety of places across the Wood, usually forming their own communities within birdfolk perches and humblefolk villages. Seldom do they live alone. A jerbeen’s home can contain several generations, including extended family and cousins living together under one roof. Jerbeens have a strong sense of family and like to surround themselves with good company wherever they rest.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Outsize Courage</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Jerbeens are the smallest inhabitants of Humblewood, dwarfed by nearly every kind of creature they encounter. While they are quick and nimble, and possess an affable attitude, they are not very strong, brave, or powerful on their own. When they stand with a group, jerbeens are emboldened: the presence of others reassures them, granting them the courage to face even the largest threats head on. They excel in team strategies, helping one another solve problems that could not be surmounted alone.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Community First</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The communal slant of jerbeens stems from more than just their love of good company: jerbeen are kind and considerate creatures, known for their joviality and charm. Being small and not particularly strong gives them a perspective that allows them to easily empathize with others, though not all jerbeens share this compassionate outlook. Some respond to the dangers outside their community by becoming insular and fearing all non-jerbeens. Jerbeens value privacy, but true isolation from friends, families, or loved ones is considered to be the worst possible fate a jerbeen could suffer.</p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Jerbeen Traits</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Ability Score Increase</span>.

They are crafty, hearty, and tough, but their true strength lies in the potential they see when looking at the world around them. Mapachs have incredibly light hands and a great degree of fine motor control that doesn’t diminish with age. They are also adept at climbing and sneaking. This, combined with their love of trinkets, has earned them an undeserved reputation as thieves. While there are exceptions, most mapachs are quite good-natured, if a little eccentric.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Resilient Opportunists</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Mapachs are adept at surviving tough woodland conditions, and at intuiting the right course of action when faced with a problem. They are also inveterate opportunists. Some may consider them brash, but mapachs know that opportunities rarely present themselves and are quick to act on them. Mapachs are alert and have a keen awareness of their surroundings. Only the truly foolhardy among them are taken in by obvious traps.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Canny Craftspeople</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">One of the traits mapachs are most well-known for is their ability to find a use for just about anything. This knack for creating functional or useful items out of debris, junk, or on-hand materials is known as “scroungecraft”, and is a cultural staple among mapachs. This activity is considered an art form among mapachs, on par with the high art of other peoples. Scroungecrafting demonstrates creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness, but is misunderstood by outsiders who see it as primitive or crude. Genius ideas created by mapach hands frequently began as scroungecraft prototypes. Many who have built such interesting or unique creations achieve celebrity status among mapachs, going on to showcase their skills in loosely-organized scroungecraft fairs.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Hubs of Invention</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Mapachs are often loners, but when they do establish communities with humblefolk or birdfolk, they have a habit of fostering innovation wherever they go. Mapach ingenuity was responsible for the contraption upon which Alderheart’s pulley system was based.

The item will be completely functional, even capable of passing for a disguise (if you crafted an article of clothing). Tools, along with any other item that would logically break on its first use (caltrops, arrows), will become useless afterward. Scroungecrafted items will otherwise last 1 hour before falling apart.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Depending on the materials available, a Game Master (GM) may rule that you cannot craft an item in this way. For example, a vial of acid might be easy to make if you happen to be near a nest of acidic beetle larvae, or bark can be bound into a makeshift flask, but it would be difficult to create a passable facsimile of silken robes from a pile of leaves.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Should you have access to the proper materials, you can spend 8 hours converting an item you have scroungecrafted in this way into a permanent version, so long as you start this process before the item falls apart. Items crafted in such a way will function exactly as a normal version of the item, and if you have proficiency in the tools used to craft them, they can even look professionally-crafted. Otherwise, they retain a rather rough, cobbled-together appearance.You can also use scroungecraft to repair broken equipment, provided you have the materials on hand.

One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn’t entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious. Sometimes their drive to succeed can make it difficult for them to empathize with others. Vulpins feel just as deeply as other folk of the Wood, but they possess a keen survival instinct which sometimes causes them to take courses of action that are selfish. Moreover, they are sharp and savvy, possessing an uncanny force of personality that allows them to easily sway the trust of others. In the right situations, vulpins can be true friends, and in the wrong ones, deadly enemies.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Artful and Cunning</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Vulpins are naturally intelligent, rivalled only by corvums. However, where corvums are studious, vulpins are more creative. They enjoy the arts and the pursuit of leisure. Some devote their lives to mastering an art form; learning sculpture, poetry, or refined swordplay. Even though vulpins come from every walk of life, they also have a reputation for being snobbish and looking down on others.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">All vulpins have a natural connection to the magic of the Wood, though they channel it in specialized ways. The right look from a vulpin can bewitch or terrify, and vulpins who are truly skilled can command an entire room through sheer force of presence.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Prodigious Predators</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Before the Humblefolk Treaty was signed, vulpins controlled a large part of the Wood outside the influence of the birdfolk, and bands of vulpin raiders provided their own kin with a wealth of plundered goods at the expense of birdfolk and other humblefolk alike. Those days are long since gone, but the memory of the sinister vulpin has yet to fade from the minds of the humblefolk, who endured great suffering at their hands.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">A few vulpins have attempted to change public opinion, but the majority are unconcerned with their notoriety. Vulpins learn from a young age that they are of two natures: the sophisticated and the savage. While sophistication and elegance are generally preferred, it is considered common sense that vulpins should know when to keep their fangs hidden and when to bear them.</p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Vulpin Traits</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Ability Score Increase</span>. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Age</span>. Vulpins mature at an average pace, and can be comparatively long-lived. They reach adulthood at 15 years, and live well past 90 years.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Alignment</span>. Vulpins aren’t innately evil, but their difficulty empathizing with others means they are only rarely good aligned. Most vulpins find strict authority distasteful, preferring chaotic alignments over lawful ones.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Size</span>. Vulpins cut dashing figures and are usually lean and muscular. They stand between 4 and a half and 5 and a half feet tall, but are relatively lightweight, weighing between 90 and 140 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Speed</span>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Darkvision</span>. You are adept at hunting at night.

You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Bite</span>. You have sharp fangs that enable you to make natural bite attacks. You can choose to bite as an unarmed strike that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage, which can be calculated using either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for both the attack roll and damage bonus.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Evasive</span>.

Here are a few tools to help you flesh out the look and feel of your character.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Sex &amp; Gender</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The sex or gender of a character doesn’t confer any special bonuses or penalties. Playable races do not exhibit physical characteristics based on sex, and traits such as plumage, markings, and size difference are not associated with a specific sex or gender. The most significant variations in physical appearance come down to a character’s subrace.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Height and Weight</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The table below can be used to decide your character’s height and weight. These are based on the information provided in each race’s description, and reflect the natural variation that occurs within the different folk of the Wood.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">To use this table, first locate your character’s race, and roll for their height modifier. Add this result in inches to the base height shown in the previous column. Next, using the appropriate column, roll for your weight modifier. Some races have a flat weight modifier. If this is the case, simply use the number provided in this column. Then, take the number you rolled for the height modifier, and multiply it by the weight modifier. Add this result in pounds to your race’s base weight.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">You may notice that the weights for birdfolk races are significantly lower than for humblefolk of similar size. The birdfolk have hollow bones, reinforced by special internal structures that act as struts. Along with other weight-reducing adaptations, this allows birdfolk to glide. Birdfolk characters are not negatively impacted by their lower weight.</p><div class=\"hpp hpp-table\"><h5 class=\"hpp header-table\">Random Height and Weight</h5><div class=\"hpp-table-row

Humblefolk</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Wood covers a vast area of different environments. As such, birdfolk and humblefolk can showcase a variety of different forms. At the discretion of the GM, your Humblewood character may look different than other members of its race. While not exhaustive, we’ve provided examples of suitable analogs for different kinds of animals from which a playable race could take inspiration. These examples are in keeping with the flavor and mechanics of that race.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Height-Mix.webp\" /><p> </p><aside class=\"hpp sidebar-primary\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-header\">Altering Race Size</p><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-1\">The sizes listed in the racial descriptions represent suggested averages of the various races. Players can adjust these sizes depending on the kind of birdfolk or humblefolk character they’d like to play. Some varieties of strig, a race that takes their physical characteristics from owls, could be smaller sized, around 3 feet tall, if desired. Similarly, raptors, a race whose physical characteristics resemble birds of prey, could reach around 5 feet in height. For the sake of simplicity we advise that, regardless of the physical measurements of a character, they follow the size category rules of their race (Medium or Small). In the lore, this can be expressed by saying that even a small strig is solid and strong, where even a taller raptor is light and agile. This will make calculating things that rely on size categories much easier, rather than having to remember which size variant a player has chosen for a race.</p><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-1\">Alternatively, if the races presented here are too big when placed in comparison to humans in other campaign settings, size categories can be adjusted accordingly. This is entirely a matter of taste. It is recommended to do whatever makes the most sense for the kinds of worlds you’d like to build and the kinds of stories you’d like to tell.</p></aside><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Cervan</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Cervan characters could be imagined as elk, moose, or antelopes. Any hoofed creature with horns would fit the bill, especially those native to forest or mountainous environments. While not every cervan has horns, the ability to grow them is seen as a blessing of Cairith, and is a part of their culture.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Corvum</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Birds which are known for their dark coloration, such as crows, blackbirds and grackles, would be a good visual fit. Despite typically being dark-feathered, a variety of colorful corvids exist. Jays, nutcrackers, and jackdaws are good examples.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">No matter which type of bird is being used for visual inspiration for your corvum, it is important that they have at least one black feather. Black feathers on a corvum are known as the “Mark of Gesme” and they are thought to impart some of Gesme’s reckless curiosity.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Gallus</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Gallus characters are usually represented by land fowl of all kinds, ranging from those with small rounded bodies, suited to ground life, to those with longer proportions. Waterfowl, such as ducks or geese, could be used as visual inspiration for communities of gallus living by Humblewood’s wetlands. Other fowl, such as peacocks, could also be used. While not closely-related to fowl, herons, storks, and bitterns could be a good reference for taller, marshland-dwelling communities of gallus.</p><p class=\"hpp hpp para-2\">Gallus characters with ostentatious, colorful plumage are generally better suited to the bright gallus subrace, while those with modest, earth-toned feathers might be better suited to the huden gallus subrace.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Hedge</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While inspired by hedgehogs, having a hedge character based on a quilled animal that inhabits forests, such as a porcupine, would also make sense. Although they would probably not be native to Humblewood, armadillos, pangolins, or echidnas would also work.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Jerbeen</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The jerbeens are inspired by jerboas, a kind of jumping mouse. Other small rodents with mouse-like proportions, including chinchillas, could be used for visual inspiration as well. Though a greater stretch, the jerbeen’s speed, size, and communal way of life would make them an ideal analog for races based on rabbits or hares.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Luma</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Lumas are inspired by doves and pigeons, but their size and high charisma means that small songbirds such as chickadees, wrens, sparrows, and cardinals would also be a good fit. A bird-of-paradise could be used as well due to their focus on performance, though they might be better suited for visitors to Humblewood from more tropical regions. Birds with brighter or more decorative plumage would correspond to sera lumas, while those with more muted feathers would be better as sable lumas.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Mapach</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Inspired by raccoons, mapach characters can reference members of the weasel family, such as ferrets and badgers. Mapachs are hearty and crafty, and possess a climbing speed, which means many members of this family, including polecats, would be good fits.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Raptor</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Raptors take after smaller birds of prey, like falcons and hawks, but using larger species, like eagles or vultures as a reference would also work for raptor characters. Maran raptors could also take visual inspiration from seabirds, notably petrels or shearwaters, due to their swim speed.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Strig</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Strigs usually resemble owls of all kinds. Owls comprise a very large and diverse family of birds, and examples can be found which are small, large, or unique in appearance. For larger, more intimidating strigs, the great gray owl or giant scops owl can provide a robust presence, while smaller strigs could take inspiration from the little owl, or boreal owl. Regardless of their size, stout strigs tend to be bulkier, with denser feathers, while swift strigs have more slender and streamlined bodies.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Vulpin</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Vulpins generally look like foxes, but an alternative visual reference would be wolves, coyotes, or other hunting canines that could be commonly found in a forest environment. Vulpins should be represented as wild animals, to illustrate the duality of their sophisticated yet savage nature. Breeds of tamed dogs would not be a good fit.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Languages of the Wood</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Race determines the language your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional language of your choice. You are free to select these from among the languages offered in other 5e material, but there are several languages which are specific to the Wood.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The standard languages listed below are part of common life in Humblewood, and are spoken widely. Sylvan, along with various dialects of Primordial (Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran) are uncommon languages known only by few in the Wood, but they can prove exceptionally useful in communicating with the various fey and elemental Humblewood residents.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Each birdfolk race possesses a unique and mystical connection to the element of air, which allows them to understand Auran from birth, although they are unable to speak it naturally. Birdfolk who wish to become fluent in this dialect must take the time to learn. Because Auran is a dialect of Primordial, birdfolk innately understand Aquan, Ignan, and Terran as well, though not perfectly. Compared to Auran, the other dialects of Primordial sound stilted or broken to birdfolk. While they can understand simple concepts presented in these dialects, more complicated matters are lost in translation.</p><aside class=\"hpp sidebar-primary\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-header\">Common and Birdfolk</p><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-1\">Birdfolk takes the place of Common in Humblewood. As the language of trade and custom, folk of the Wood take the time to learn it. Other 5e races who choose to visit Humblewood will want to know Birdfolk. Likewise, birdfolk or humblefolk characters visiting other lands should add Common to their language list.</p></aside><div class=\"hpp hpp-table\"><h5 class=\"hpp header-table\">Standard Languages</h5><div class=\"hpp-table-row hpp-table-subheader\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\"><p>Language</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\"><p>Typical Speakers</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\"><p>Script</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Language\"><p>Birdfolk</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Typical Speakers\"><p>Birdfolk, Humblefolk</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Script\"><p>Birdfolk</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Language\"><p>Cervan</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Typical Speakers\"><p>Cervans</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Script\"><p>—</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Language\"><p>Hedge</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Typical Speakers\"><p>Hedges</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Script\"><p>Sylvan</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Language\"><p>Jerbeen</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Typical Speakers\"><p>Jerbeens</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Script\"><p>Birdfolk</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Language\"><p>Mapach</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Typical Speakers\"><p>Mapachs</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Script\"><p>Mapach</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Language\"><p>Vulpin</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Typical Speakers\"><p>Vulpins</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Script\"><p>Vulpin</p></div></div></div><div><p> </p></div><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Birdfolk</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Birdfolk is a language of clicks, caws, and whistles. Though primarily oral, a system for writing Birdfolk in pictograms was developed long before the founding of Alderheart and has since transformed into a set of abstract glyphs representing different sounds. Birdfolk can be written quickly with a quill, or scratched easily with a claw, and has been widely adopted throughout the Wood.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Cervan</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Cervan is a complex language with no written script. It is seen as disrespectful to try and transcribe it using Birdfolk characters. Much of cervan history is preserved by village elders and passed down orally through the generations as stories, songs, and sayings. The adage, “What is essential to learn lies in the teaching”, is often invoked to illustrate this point.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Hedge</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Hedge is a language meant to be spoken softly. It confounds many who try to learn it due to the prevalence of passive voice and the deferential manners built into conversation. These are meant to ensure that everyone’s feelings are heard and respected. It is written using a variation of Sylvan script.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Jerbeen</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Jerbeen is a system of squeaks and clicks represented in writing by using a variant of Birdfolk alphabet. It is a polite but direct language designed to communicate information quickly and effectively between multiple listeners.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Mapach</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Mapach is a very technically dense language that often incorporates rough equations and estimations of physical properties in normal conversation. Awareness of one’s surroundings is key to survival, and the Mapach language emphasizes this. Mapach uses its own script of glyphs made of various lines, dashes, and dots.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Vulpin</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Vulpin is a language of growls, snarls, and yips. It is written in its own flowing cursive script. Speakers are taught to switch between low and high class versions of Vulpin depending on the context. The biggest stumbling block for new speakers is learning when to use which form.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Translation-Bottle.webp\" />"

Scofflaws might find their talents useful among the Bandit Coalition, and bards from the College of the Road can be found sharing tales around campfires and hearths all across Humblewood.</p>"

As inveterate jacks-of-all-trades, bards possess a variety of aptitudes in combat, magecraft, and general know-how, making them particularly well suited to learning a variety of different skills. It often happens that while traveling, a bard winds up sharing their campfire with a motley assortment of wandering adventurers who may impart valuable lessons in exchange for a lively song or a well-told tale. Compared to students of other Bard Colleges, a special kind of sensibility is important for the College of the Road. How effectively a bard of this College can apply what they have learned depends on their understanding and insight. The College of the Road is sometimes a harsh teacher, but bards who follow this path often find themselves rewarded with a diverse array of useful tricks and tactics. Those who underestimate a bard from the College of the Road soon find that these “graduates” are full of surprises.</p><div class=\"hpp hpp-table\"><h5 class=\"hpp header-table\">College of the Road Features</h5><div class=\"hpp-table-row hpp-table-subheader\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\"><p>Bard Level</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\"><p>Feature</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Bard Level\"><p>3rd</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Bonus Proficiencies, Wanderer’s Lore, Traveler’s Tricks (2 options)</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Bard Level\"><p>6th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Favorite Trick (1st), Improved Tricks, Traveler’s Tricks (3 options)</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Bard Level\"><p>14th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Favorite Trick (2nd), Improved Tricks, Traveler’s Tricks (4 options)</p></div></div></div><div><p> </p></div><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Bonus Proficiencies</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">When you join the College of the Road at 3rd level, you gain a few useful proficiencies picked up from your time on the road. Choose three of the following options (each option can only be selected once):</p><ul class=\"para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">You gain proficiency with a Gaming Set of your choice</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">You gain proficiency with a martial weapon of your choice</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">You gain proficiency with Herbalism Kits</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">You gain proficiency with Thieves' Tools</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">You gain proficiency with a skill of your choice</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">You learn two languages of your choice</li></ul><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Wanderer’s Lore</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 3rd level, you can share any useful tidbits of information you have come across in your travels to help others to see problems from a new angle. When a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die granted by you, they may make a single Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check with advantage. The creature may choose whether or not to add the Bardic Inspiration die to this roll.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Traveler’s Tricks</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 3rd level you already have several memorable experiences from your life on the road. You learn two Traveler’s Tricks of your choice (see Traveler’s Trick Options).</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">These Traveler’s Tricks represent skills, techniques, and useful pieces of knowledge picked up along the way. Each one requires you to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration, and takes a bonus action to use unless otherwise specified.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level and at 14th level you learn an additional Traveler’s Trick.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Improved Tricks</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th and 14th levels, your Traveler’s Tricks become stronger. By practicing the tricks you know, and encountering stronger adventurers who share their knowledge with you, your mastery over your tricks increases.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Favorite Trick</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, you have gained enough mastery over one of your Traveler’s Tricks that you can use it whenever it’s needed. You may choose one Traveler’s Trick that you know and designate it as your favorite trick. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration remaining, you regain one use of it. Any Bardic Inspiration gained in this way can only be used to perform your favorite trick.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level you can select a second favorite trick from among Traveler’s Tricks you know.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Traveler’s Trick Options</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Traveler’s Trick feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. Each one is associated with a different class, and those marked with an asterisk (*) are magical effects.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Unlike traditional bard abilities which rely on skill or panache to be properly executed, the greatest asset for picking up tricks along the road is common sense and an openness to learning new ideas. Wisdom affects how powerful your traveler’s tricks are, as well as how hard they are to counter. If an option requires a saving throw, your Traveler’s Trick save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Acrobatics Lessons. </span>A slick rogue once gave you some pointers on zigging and zagging. When you or an ally makes a Dexterity saving throw, you may expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and adding the result to the saving throw. An ally must be within 60 feet of you and able to see and hear you to benefit from this trick.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, if the target succeeds the saving throw against an effect that would deal half damage on a successful save, the target takes no damage instead.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level, even if the target fails their saving throw they only take half damage from the effect.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Armed Combat Lessons. </span>A seasoned fighter taught you how to use a simple combat stance to wield your weapons more effectively. When you select this option, choose from the following <span class=\"hpp bold\">Fighting Styles:</span></p><ul class=\"para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Archery: You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Dueling: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Two-Weapon Fighting: When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier.</li></ul><p class=\"hpp para-2\">When you make a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, adding your Bardic Inspiration die to the attack or damage roll. When you do this, you gain the benefits of your chosen Fighting Style for 10 minutes.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, you learn how to use your stance to chain your attacks together in deadly combination. Once, while your Fighting Style is active, you may attack twice, instead of once, when taking the Attack action on your turn.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level you have learned to shore up any weaknesses in your stance. You gain +1 to your AC for the effect’s duration.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Bind the Wound. </span>An experienced paladin instructed you in the basics of combat triage. When you or an ally within 5 feet of you receives healing of any kind, you may use your reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and provide extra healing equal to the number on the Bardic Inspiration die roll + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You must have at least one hand free in order to quickly staunch the target’s wound.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, you have learned to identify a selection of useful herbs that you can carry with you. When providing additional healing with this trick you may also remove the poisoned or paralyzed condition from the target.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level, you have developed a true knack for emergency triage. You may additionally remove a single disease affecting the target of this ability.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Boxing Lessons. </span>A wise monk was happy to share the basic form of the jab and weave. When you take the attack action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to quickly execute two unarmed strikes against one or more creatures you could target. You may use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of these unarmed strikes. The damage die used for these unarmed strikes is the same as your Bardic Inspiration die.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, you have finally mastered the “weave” portion of your technique. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity this turn.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level, your practice has paid off, granting you the use of a slightly ki-infused attack. When you hit with one of these attacks you may attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Conjure Woodland Spirit.* </span>A patient druid shared the secrets of forest magic with you. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration as an action to conjure a forest guardian spirit in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. The guardian spirit is Large, and takes the appearance of a spectral predatory cat. Any enemy that moves into or leaves a space adjacent to the guardian spirit must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking magical slashing damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die on a failure. The guardian spirit will remain for as long as you concentrate on it, up to 10 minutes.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, your bond with the guardian spirit grows even deeper. Any creature dealt damage by your guardian spirit has their speed reduced to 0 for the rest of the turn.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level, any Large or smaller creature who has their speed reduced to 0 by the guardian spirit is restrained for as long as you maintain your concentration, as your guardian spirit pins them in place. The target can break free by spending an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Traveler’s Trick save DC.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Dark Bargain.* </span>You made a shady bargain with a haggard warlock. When you select this option, choose a Eldritch Invocation from the Warlock’s list of class features for which you meet the prerequisites. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to gain the benefits of this Dark Invocation for 10 minutes. Doing this requires you to roll your Bardic Inspiration die and take an amount of necrotic damage equal to the roll.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, you have learned how to deepen your pact with the warlock you once met. You may choose to take double the necrotic damage you rolled on your Bardic Inspiration die to instead have the effect last for 1 hour.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level, your pact with the warlock unlocks frightening new power. When you reach 14th level, choose a single spell of 7th level or lower from the warlock’s spell list. You may cast the spell once during this effect without expending any spell slots, although you must cast it at the level of your highest spell slot. In exchange, the spell deals additional necrotic damage to you equal to twice the level at which it was cast.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Evocation Lessons.* </span>A venerable wizard shared secrets of evocation magic with you. When you select this option, choose a damage-dealing spell you can cast. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration when you cast this spell to change the type of damage it deals to your choice of either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder (chosen when you cast the spell). Add the number you roll on your Bardic Inspiration die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) to the damage dealt by the spell.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level you may choose to change the spell you had previously selected with this feature to another spell that you know.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level you may choose to change the spell you had previously selected with this feature to another spell that you know.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Hunting Lessons.* </span>A skilled ranger taught you how to use your magic to pinpoint your quarry’s weak spots. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to target one creature you can see within 90 feet of you as your quarry. For as long as you concentrate on this ability, up to 1 hour, all weapon attacks you make against the target deal additional damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, you have honed your skills to the point where you can easily track your quarry. For the duration of the effect, you are aware of your target’s approximate distance and direction from you, so long as you are on the same plane.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level, you can maintain this effect for up to 24 hours.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Reckless Tactics. </span>You learned from a hardened barbarian that sometimes you have to charge into combat with no regard for your own safety. When you make an attack with a melee weapon that has either the heavy, two handed, or versatile quality, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to gain advantage on the attack. Add the number you roll on your Bardic Inspiration die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) to the attack’s damage roll. Attacks made against you this round have advantage.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level you have learned, through practice, how to push your offense even further. You may impose a -5 penalty to this attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack’s damage.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level, your experience has taught you how to really go all in. If you have not moved this turn, you may voluntarily reduce your speed to 0 until your next turn to resolve this attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, making a separate attack roll for each target.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Warding Trick.* </span>A gentle cleric taught you how to channel your magic into a protective veil. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration as an action to grant an ally you can see within 60 feet of you a number of temporary hit points equal to your roll on the Bardic Inspiration die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). This ward lasts for as long as you maintain concentration on it, up to 10 minutes.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, your practice allows you to weave wards that retaliate against those who would harm your allies. Any creature who deals damage to an ally with temporary hit points granted by this effect must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature dealing damage takes an amount of radiant damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 14th level, you have learned how to make your ward even more resilient. For the duration of the effect, at the beginning of each round on your turn the target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your Bardic Inspiration die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). These replace any previous temporary hit points.</p>"

The power of the Gods of community is in the security of home and hearth, and the joy of good company. Many such gods teach the value of tradition and simple ways of living in harmony with the natural world. They also tend towards the rule of law, not as a kind of great bureaucracy, but as sacred traditions passed from generation to generation. Some gods advocate the removal of harsh or disruptive forces to this order, and proper sanctions for the violation of the goodwill that any community ought to provide.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Clerics of such gods value unity, and praise the strength that can be gained when people support each other.</p><div class=\"hpp hpp-table\"><h5 class=\"hpp header-table\">Community Domain Features</h5><div class=\"hpp-table-row hpp-table-subheader\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\"><p>Cleric Level</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\"><p>Feature</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>1st</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Domain Spells, Blessing of the Hearth</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>2nd</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Channel Divinity: Magnificent Feast</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>6th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Channel Divinity: Community Watch</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>8th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Divine Strike (1d8)</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>14th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Divine Strike (2d8)</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>17th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Paragon of the People</p></div></div></div><div class=\"hpp hpp-table\"><h5 class=\"hpp header-table\">Community Domain Spells</h5><div class=\"hpp-table-row hpp-table-subheader\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\"><p>Cleric Level</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\"><p>Spell</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>1st</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8dzaICjGy6mTUaUr]{Bless}  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Qf6CAZkc7ms4ZY3e]{Goodberry}</span></p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>3rd</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Opwh2PdX4runSBlm]{Aid}  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ge3Saet9zPTDyaoL]{Heroism}</span></p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>5th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.uCud2s4TjMfjiXUb]{Spirit Guardians}</span></p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>7th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pxpb2eOB6bv4phAf]{Banishment}  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.SAj03P2WBDiWu7zu]{Faithful Hound}</span></p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>9th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Pyzmm8R7rVsNAPsd]{Mass Cure Wounds}  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.uAwtVZkiSTyP6ORB]{Telepathic Bond}</span></p></div></div></div><div><p> </p></div><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Blessing of the Hearth</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">From 1st level, you gain the ability to conjure a small flagstone hearth with a simple iron cooking pot whenever you rest. This hearth helps warm you and your companions, and can be used to prepare hearty and nutritious meals on the road. If you or any friendly creatures you make camp with would regain hit points at the end of a short rest by spending one or more hit dice, each of those creatures may choose to re-roll one of their resting dice, taking the higher roll between the two.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Additionally, you gain proficiency with Cook’s utensils.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Channel Divinity: Magnificent Feast</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Starting at 2nd level, you may use your Channel Divinity to conjure a magical feast for the rough road ahead. By spending 10 minutes, you may create a number of delicious, well-prepared, yet simple food items equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). These food items will last up to 8 hours or until the end of a rest, and will never spoil. Eating food created in this way takes an action, providing whomever eats it with healing equal to 2d4 + your cleric level, and can remove either the frightened or poisoned condition from that creature (chosen by the creature when consumed).</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Channel Divinity: Community Watch</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to instill a feeling of vigilant protection in you and your allies. You grant yourself and a number of allies, up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), a boon from your deity. Allies must be able to see you and be within 30 feet to receive the boon. Once per round, a creature benefitting from this boon can roll a d6, adding the result to a skill check, saving throw, or attack roll. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 round). A creature can only benefit from this effect if it can see at least one of its allies.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Divine Strike</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon with the power to punish wrongdoing. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. Visions of the evil they have wrought upon others flash before their eyes. You choose whether any foe reduced to 0 hit points by this attack remains stable or dies. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Paragon of the People</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 17th level, your Community Watch grants an additional d6 to each affected ally. It also grants immunity to fear for the duration of the effect. Additionally, your Magnificent Feast produces twice as many foodstuffs, each of which can, when consumed, remove a single curse or disease affecting the target (including attunement to a cursed item).</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-sublcasses.Item.9pA6syXGiKyZNZpW]{Night Domain}</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The night is mysterious, and conceals many unseen dangers. However, the cover of darkness also brings protection from predators and shadows within which one can conceal themselves. The gods of night are varied, encompassing those who would use the cover of darkness to protect others from threats, to those who would use the shadows for wrong doings. The motives of night gods are often shrouded in mystery. Many teach their followers that it is only by peering through the darkness and looking beyond what is hidden that one can attain truth. Clerics of night do their best to keep themselves and their companions safe while journeying through the darkness.</p><div class=\"hpp hpp-table\"><h5 class=\"hpp header-table\">Night Domain Features</h5><div class=\"hpp-table-row hpp-table-subheader\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\"><p>Cleric Level</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\"><p>Feature</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>1st</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Domain Spells, Eye of Twilight, Ward of Shadows</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>2nd</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Channel Divinity: Invocation of Night</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>6th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Improved Ward, Eye of Twilight improvement</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>8th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Veil of Dreams, Eye of Twilight improvement</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>17th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Creature of the Night, Eye of Twilight improvement</p></div></div></div><div class=\"hpp hpp-table\"><h5 class=\"hpp header-table\">Night Domain Spells</h5><div class=\"hpp-table-row hpp-table-subheader\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\"><p>Cleric Level</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\"><p>Spell</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>1st</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{Sleep}  @UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-spells.A1AnFMTDruVqhGFc]{Veil of Dusk*}</span></p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>3rd</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.S7VbUetIfVT7B6Eq]{Darkness}  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.bV3yun6MIuFj71Er]{Moonbeam}</span></p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>5th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.aU62xVUBYkAQWIHv]{Nondetection}  @UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-spells.hZNTn73e8djoBiv9]{Globe of Twilight*}</span></p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>7th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9]{Divination}  @UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-spells.0ZXNFwB8qj0UOCur]{Stellar Bodies*}</span></p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Cleric Level\"><p>9th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Spell\"><p><span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.kSPRpeIx3w3nihrF]{Dream}  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.mbFw57uyfLkyiw5k]{Seeming}</span></p></div></div></div><p class=\"hpp para-1\"><span class=\"hpp italic\">Spells marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in this book.</span></p><p> </p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Eye of Twilight</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Beginning at 1st level, a divine blessing grants you the ability to see more clearly in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in magical or nonmagical darkness as if it were only dim light. You can’t discern color in the darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">When you reach 6th level, you can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in magical or nonmagical darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in the darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 8th level, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical within 120 feet.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Finally, at 17th level, your eyes are able to see the truth hiding within darkness. You gain the ability to call upon the powers of your deity to grant yourself truesight within 120 feet of you for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of 1 minute). Your truesight only functions while in conditions of magical or nonmagical darkness. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you have completed a long rest.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Ward of Shadows</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 1st level, you can create a ward of divine shadows to conceal yourself from an attacking enemy. When attacked by a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, as shadows envelop your form. An attacker that can’t be blinded is immune to this feature.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Channel Divinity: Invocation of Night</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2 _idGenParaOverride-1\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the powers of night, clouding the vision of your foes in a shroud of darkness.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As an action, you present your holy symbol causing any source of mundane or magical light within 30 feet of you to be extinguished. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature who fails the saving throw is blinded for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. A creature blinded in this way gets a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to remove the effect. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Improved Ward</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 6th level, you can use your Ward of Shadows feature whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature besides yourself.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Veil of Dreams</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">When you reach 8th level, you gain mastery over magical sleep. When you cast the <span class=\"hpp italic\">sleep</span> spell, add your cleric level to the dice you roll to determine how many hit points of creatures the spell can affect.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">You may choose the order in which creatures within the spell’s area are affected. If the first target chosen has too many hit points to be affected, the spell will instead target the next creature you have chosen that the spell could affect before affecting other targets.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Additionally, any creature you put to sleep cannot be woken until the start of your next turn. Otherwise, the <span class=\"hpp italic\">sleep</span> spell acts as normal.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Creature of the Night</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate a supernatural aura of deep night. It lasts for 1 minute, or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit heavily obscuring darkness in a 30-foot radius and lightly obscuring shadows 50 feet beyond that. The darkness and shadows overlap and smother existing sources of light. Only light produced by a 9th level spell or similarly powerful effect can negate the darkness and shadows.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Enemies within the shadows constantly feel the presence of hungry predators watching them, and become frightened as long as they remain inside the affected area. Enemies in the darkness are both blinded and frightened for as long as they remain within its area.</p><p> </p>"

Rules are made to be broken, and the Scofflaw extends this logic to their fighting style. Using every trick at their disposal to gain the upper hand against their foes, the Scofflaw cows their enemy into submission, or overwhelms their defenses with a single cheap shot.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Scofflaws eventually trust their notorious reputation to do much of the work for them, gaining the ability to cause foes to quake with a single threat. Scofflaws are a diverse bunch that run the gamut from graceful yet deadly knaves to bruiser thugs. What ties them together is their belief that there’s no such thing as a bad win.</p><div class=\"hpp hpp-table\"><h5 class=\"hpp header-table\">Scofflaw Features</h5><div class=\"hpp-table-row hpp-table-subheader\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\"><p>Fighter Level</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\"><p>Feature</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Fighter Level\"><p>3rd</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Bonus Proficiency, Intimidating Banter, Brutal Brawler</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Fighter Level\"><p>7th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Misdirection</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Fighter Level\"><p>10th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Blindside, Brutal Brawler Improvement</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Fighter Level\"><p>15th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Infamy, Blindside Improvement</p></div></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row\"><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item hpp-table-center u-Flex-grow030\" data-header=\"Fighter Level\"><p>18th</p></div><div class=\"hpp-table-row-item\" data-header=\"Feature\"><p>Two For Flinching, Brutal Brawler Improvement, Blindside Improvement</p></div></div></div><div><p> </p></div><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Bonus Proficiency</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">When you choose this Martial Archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth. Alternatively, you may learn Thieves’ Cant.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Intimidating Banter</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 3rd level, you are adept at integrating insults and barbs into your fighting style. So long as you are in combat, you may choose to use Strength or Dexterity to make Charisma ability checks.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Brutal Brawler</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 3rd level, your tavernside scuffles have honed your ability to deal damage with just about anything that’s handy. You have proficiency with improvised weapons, and treat any improvised weapon you handle as if it has the finesse quality.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Additionally, whenever you hit with an improvised weapon, you may spend a bonus action to break it over your opponent. Doing this destroys the weapon, but deals the maximum number each of the weapon’s damage dice could deal to the target. Any additional dice added to the attack’s damage roll are not affected by this ability.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 10th level, the improvised weapons you wield become even more lethal in your hands. When you spend your bonus action to break an improvised weapon over your opponent, add an additional 2d6 to the weapon’s base damage dice.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 18th level, you have advantage on attacks you make with improvised weapons.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Misdirection</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 7th level, you are adept at using words and gestures to taunt or fake-out your opponent, turning their lack of composure against them. This allows you to goad your foe into swinging in ways that can cause them to strike their allies, or which leave them open to a counterattack. As a bonus action you can misdirect an opponent within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. On a failure, they must spend their reaction to attack a creature of your choice within 5 feet of them. If no other creatures are present within 5 feet of them, they waste their reaction attacking the air where you once were.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">In order for you to misdirect a creature in this way they must be able to see, hear, or otherwise be able to understand you.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Blindside</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 10th level, you are truly skilled at exploiting the openings you create in combat, hitting off-guard opponents with precise blows that are swift and deadly. You may use this technique against any creature that hasn’t yet taken a turn in combat, or who you have successfully misdirected this turn. You may also apply this technique to any attack roll you make with advantage. On a hit, you exploit an opening in the target's defenses, dealing an extra 5d6 points of damage. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you have taken a short or long rest.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 15th level, the damage dealt by your blindside increases to 7d6.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 18th level the damage dealt by your blindside increases to 9d6. If you have no uses of this ability at the beginning of combat on your turn, you regain one use of it.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Infamy</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At 15th level, your reputation precedes you, making it easy for you to strike fear into the hearts of anyone foolish enough to oppose you. As part of your attack action, you can utter deadly threats to a single target within 30 feet of you, causing them to become frightened of you for 1 minute on a failed Wisdom saving throw. An affected target may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. The DC for this saving throw is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. A creature who has witnessed or heard tales of your ruthlessness makes this saving throw with disadvantage.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">In order for you to use this feature, a creature must be able to see, hear, or otherwise be able to understand you.</p><h6 class=\"hpp header-5\">Two For Flinching</h6><p class=\"hpp para-2 _idGenParaOverride-1\">At 18th level, you have perfected the art of exploiting your opponent’s weakness. Whenever you take the attack action against an opponent you have successfully misdirected this turn, or an opponent that is afflicted by a condition, you may make one additional attack against that opponent. You may only use this feature once per round.</p>"

When you cast this spell, roll two d20s, and record what you rolled. For each die, choose either attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. You can choose each option multiple times. For the next 24 hours, you may substitute any roll of an ally or enemy you can see within 60 feet with one of the recorded numbers that matches the type of roll you wish to replace (attack roll, skill check, or saving throw). The target still adds any relevant modifiers to this number, but otherwise treat the substituted number as the number they rolled.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">To do this, you must spend a reaction to present your holy symbol and invoke the name of the Amaranthine whose energies you called upon.

Additionally, if the plant is a bramble or capable of growing thorns, you may turn the affected area into difficult terrain, causing 2d4 points of piercing damage for every 5 feet moved through the area you shaped. You may also increase or decrease the number of flowers, vines, leaves, thorns, branches, or fruits produced by any plant you shape.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">After one hour, the magic of your spell fades, and the plant resumes its normal shape. If you can use speak with plants (or a similar ability) to communicate with the plant, you may persuade it to retain its new form. Different plants have different feelings and attitudes, and if the form is too different from its natural shape it is likely to decline.

He discovered records of its creation, penned by the wizard who crafted, stored it in the Avium’s lower library. Using these valuable notes, Odwald theorized a ritual that might utilize this artifact’s power to seal the aspect of fire. He had abandoned the ritual in favor of the cobblefright, because he couldn’t ascertain whether or not the records of the artifact were genuine.

The Elder Tenders of old needed to store the staff where the fire-aspected energies of the Scorched Grove could serve to keep <span class=\"hpp italic\">the Borealus’</span> dangerous energies sequestered. In times long past, Tenders wishing to join the leadership of their organization would come here to be tested for their worthiness; this practice was ended when a breach of the sanctum caused the Tenders to swear the location of <span class=\"hpp italic\">the Borealus</span> to secrecy and destroy records of its location. Only scant myths and snippets of information escaped the culling. Eventually, the last of those who possessed actual knowledge of the artifact died, and the dungeon has sat unused for hundreds of years.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp italic\">The Borealus</span> lies at the lowest level of the dungeon, where the flame energies are strongest.

Without the proper key, the entrance to the dungeon will not reveal itself. Read the following if the party is carrying the sprig of skyleaf with them:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">As soon as you and your companions arrive at the frog-shaped rock formation, the ground begins to quake. Five pedestals emerge from the ashes, one at each cardinal point around a flat disk that rises in their center. The fifth stands in the middle of the disk. One of the four outer pedestals is broken.</p></aside><img style=\"border:0\" title=\"Skyleaf\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Skyleaf.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp image-name-caption\">Skyleaf</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The pedestals rise from the earth, to a height of four feet. The ones to the west, east, and south have distinctive carvings and motifs, along with a domed receptacle on their top which opens like a mouth. The receptacles are large enough to fit the sprig of skyleaf. The fourth pedestal to the north is broken in half and exhibits obvious wear, as though it had been smashed long ago. The pedestal in the center of the disk has no domed receptacle or motif carved, only an inscribed Druidic rhyme. Druidic is a language known only by druids, but any character using the <span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.4dSvfvTy2ZIJ3K4k]{comprehend languages}</span> spell or a similar effect will be able to read this:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-1 hpp-table-center\"><span class=\"hpp bold\">The cycle of nature is death and rebirth,<br /><br />forests to ashes and ashes to earth.<br /><br />Stand in the compass and your proof there deliver, <br /><br />to the cleanser of forests, the sapling’s life-giver.</span></p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The motifs carved into the three intact pedestals represent elemental forces of nature. The one to the west has motifs of waves and rain clouds, the one to the east has gusting winds and blowing leaves, and the one to the south has flames and smoke plumes. Upon closer examination, the broken pedestal has worn geometric motifs, depicting fallen trees on fractured ground, most likely representing earth. At least one party member must stand in the middle of these pedestals when placing the skyleaf sprig into a receptacle. Whether or not the party chooses the correct answer, nothing will happen if no one is standing in the center of the “compass” when placing the sprig inside a receptacle.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The correct answer is to set the sprig in the receptacle of the pedestal with the flame motifs. This will cause the sprig to ignite with magical flames and the pedestals to recede, revealing the door to the dungeon.</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">The ashen field shifts again as the pillars recede beneath it.

The magma lies 60 feet below the island of rock, and any character that gets too near the edges of the island will feel its full heat. The heat isn’t enough to cause damage, but any creature that falls into the magma will almost certainly die, if they’re not immune to fire damage, taking [[/damage 6d10 fire average]] damage each time they enter magma for the first time on a turn, or end their turn there. Fortunately, under normal circumstances there are no dangers within this place that would cause a character to fall into the magma. Add such hazards if desired, but consider the risks carefully.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The bridge over the magma is 10 feet wide and 20 feet long. It appears to have small gaps at 5-foot intervals. Any player who steps onto the bridge’s surface will trigger the bridge’s main trap, which will cause a 20-foot-high jet of flame to erupt from the nearest gap. This jet remains for a few seconds, receding for a moment before flaring up again.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The party can tell that these flame jets aren’t made of magma, but that they are still dangerous. Any character who passes through one will need to succeed on a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check acrobatics 16 format=long]]</span> to avoid taking damage.

If they don’t take the opportunity to try and seal the aspect with the Borealus now, even if it is driven back, the aspect may become too strong to attempt sealing again.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Defenders of Alderheart will soon find their presence requested by the Council: the aspect of fire must be stopped before it reaches the Great Tree City. Its movement has stirred up ashsnakes, emberbats, and other fire creatures that are causing havoc in the surrounding forest. Give the party a chance to explain to the Council what they can do to help (the Council is receptive to most ideas), but if the party doesn’t mention sealing away the aspect, then either Odwald or the Dean (if Odwald is dead) will make the suggestion.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While the Council will listen to the Dean, Odwald will be looked upon more suspiciously, and the party may need to convince the members on his behalf. To keep the tension high maybe have the party roll Charisma checks for this. The Council will trust the Defenders of Alderheart, even if they don’t trust Odwald. However the Council is convinced, Speaker Bita will make it clear in no uncertain terms that the fate of the Wood is in the party’s hands.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Odwald will elaborate that in order to complete the ritual to seal the aspect, two mages must work together to weave a spell into the existing conjuration circle to strengthen and alter its magic. He’ll also remind the party of the importance of utilizing cold-type magics to subdue the aspect. Once it has been subdued, they will have only an hour before it regenerates, so it’s imperative that the character attuned to <span class=\"hpp italic\">the Borealus</span> brings it to the circle, so the mages can complete the sealing.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If a spellcasting party member volunteers to help the NPCs prepare the sealing ritual, they will be turned down. Preparing the ritual will be time-consuming and require such focus that the party member wouldn’t be able to fight the aspect at the same time. The mages who work the ritual need to rely on the Defenders of Alderheart to ensure their efforts aren’t interrupted. Odwald (or the Dean, if Odwald is dead) will explain that the second mage must have a good grasp of arcane theory and precise control over their magic. They will essentially serve as an additional power source and they therefore do not need to have the same familiarity with the ritual.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Odwald can think of only one other spellcaster he would trust with this ritual: Susan, and he will ask for her to accompany him (if she is alive). Otherwise, the Dean can help. The Dean has a strong desire to see this through to the end, and would gladly work with Odwald for the good of the Wood. If Odwald is dead, the Dean will need assistance for the ritual. Should Susan not be able to assist, a Council member will mention knowing of a talented spellcasting protégé within the Tenders who may be able to help. This is, of course, Havel.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If Odwald is conducting the ritual he will request to have the restraints inhibiting his magic removed, which will cause the Council consternation, but they will ultimately agree. If the party is still suspicious of Odwald’s intentions and unwilling to have his restraints removed, the Dean (who has been looking through Odwald’s notes) is familiar enough with the material to lead the ritual. Even so, he’ll insist they bring Odwald along, shackled or not, as the corvum’s knowledge could prove useful should something go awry.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The plan is to have the mages escorted to the conjuration circle, by either the Wildwood Brigade or the Perch Guard, to prepare the ritual. The rest of the Perch Guard and/or Wildwood Brigade will need to work together to keep the path to the aspect cleared for the party.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Whoever is leading the ritual indicates that someone will have to grab the aspect’s attention and lure it closer to the Grove. If the aspect is too far away when the ritual is completed, there’s no guarantee it will be sealed. Scouts report that the aspect is easy to provoke, but it'll be difficult to outpace, and luring it to the Grove will certainly place the volunteer in incredible danger. Riffin volunteers to help draw the aspect back to the circle if he’s here, otherwise a Defender of Alderheart has to volunteer for the task. Speed won’t matter as much as endurance, since they’ll need to be able to withstand whatever the aspect can throw at them in order to make it to the Grove.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As the party leaves the Council chambers, they will witness something special:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">The mood in the city is electric. Birdfolk and humblefolk from all walks of life work hand-in-hand, with the Perch Guard distributing weapons and armor to any who volunteer. Those who cannot fight are readying supply lines and bucket brigades to help people on the front lines combat forest fires and support the Defenders of Alderheart. Everyone in Alderheart is doing their best to pitch in however they can.</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If any characters are looking to prepare for the final fight, the party has a small window to resupply. Many of Alderheart’s shops have been closed or abandoned, but the armories of Alderheart are open to the party, allowing them to take whatever supplies they may need (Weapons, Armor, or Adventuring Gear). If they’re looking for a little extra, <span class=\"hpp bold-red\">Eliza’s Emporium table (pg. 106; @UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-encounter-rt.RollTable.OZNsT7iZxNoCVSOJ]{Good for Sale} | @UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-encounter-rt.RollTable.HhkESTnrzvP75Gm4]{Magic Items})</span> is always open, though even in such dire times the party won’t be able to get a magic item for free. Eliza is volunteering for the bucket brigade and plans on living through this. While she’s still willing to offer “friends-only” prices, and supply the party with any non-magical necessities they might need to complete their mission, she has no intention of giving up her livelihood out of fear.</p><img style=\"border:0\" title=\"Backpack\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Backpack.webp\" />"

This is necessary not only for the ritual, but because the abundance of available fuel in the forest makes the aspect functionally invincible there. Consider having a scout report that the aspect seems to flare up as it burns through the forest, as players may be unaware that the aspect can heal itself using the trees it consumes. While not a vital clue at this stage, this information about the aspect is essential to the fight. If not given the hint, players will have to deduce why the aspect is not weakening when fought in wooded areas.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If Riffin volunteered to lure the aspect of fire into the Grove, skip to <span class=\"hpp bold-red\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-campaign-setting.LyGXzY3U4QbOd7vr.JournalEntryPage.Ea91BcQFgST1Gd1M]{Facing the Aspect} (pg. 172)</span>.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If Riffin wasn’t around to volunteer, the player character who volunteered to bait the aspect will accompany a unit of Perch Guard or Wildwood Brigade scouts into the part of the forest where the aspect is advancing. In the meantime, the rest of the party and the mages will be escorted to the conjuration circle to ready for the aspect’s arrival. It isn’t necessary for more than one party member to serve as bait, and if multiple characters volunteer then either Odwald or the Dean will advise against it, insisting that the rest of the party will need their strength to fight the aspect.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Separated from their friends, read to the player that volunteered:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">Around you, you can see woodland denizens of all kinds fighting.

The scouts lead you further into the brush, until you can see the blazing form of the aspect lumbering toward Alderheart. It hasn’t yet spotted you or your guides in your hiding place.</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The aspect of fire will give chase as soon as it sees the volunteer character, hurling hunks of magma at the lone hero.

On a failure, have the player make a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/save dexterity 16 format=long]]</span>, taking [[/damage 4d10 fire average]] damage on a failure, and half as much on a success. The character being chased can take one other action in addition to making their check, but they can do nothing else since the rest of their energies are focused on the flight.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If a player decides to attack the aspect during this chase, resolve their attack as normal, but the aspect won’t take any damage. The character should see that once the aspect moves through a stand of trees, its fire consumes the trees, causing it to regain health and blaze brightly.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The character being chased must succeed on four of the above Athletics checks to lure the aspect toward the conjuration circle. Resolve each failure as it happens. Once the character being chased succeeds on two Dexterity or Strength checks, or is doing poorly, Riffin will appear, shielding the character from a hit and preventing the damage. From this point on, Riffin will protect the character from further harm.</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">As the fireball hurtles toward you, you see a flash of steel and suddenly find yourself shielded from the blast. Looking over, you can see Riffin, running alongside you with his shield held high. The face of his shield emits a barrier of wind which deflects the aspect’s flames. The small strig gives you a smile and shouts, “Sorry I didn't help sooner, but I’m not about to let the whole Wood burn!

To the south of the field is 40-feet-deep tree cover. The aspect will be led through a gap in the tree cover that is 20 feet wide.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Only the 40 feet of tree cover to the south is substantial enough for the aspect to heal using its “Fuel for the Fire” ability.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The conjuration circle is 20 feet in diameter, and it's located 40 feet from the tree cover and 80 feet from the eastern edge of the map.

The aspect is petrified only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t rekindle. The aspect can not rekindle for one hour after being petrified.

Give the injured character a chance to be healed. An NPC will act at the top of the round by rushing over and casting a cure wounds spell at 3rd level on the injured character (assume a Wisdom modifier of +3 for the spell) before retreating. The NPC can either be Tevor (if he’s alive), Havel (if not performing the ritual), or another NPC Tender.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Riffin will retreat, as the chase has exhausted him. While he longs to fight, he feels he would be more of a burden to them in his fatigued state, and insists they go on without him.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The task of facing the aspect of fire is up to the Defenders of Alderheart now.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At least one party member must attack the aspect each turn to hold its attention, otherwise the mages are at risk. If the party successfully keeps the aspect’s attention, it will fight recklessly, ignoring everyone but the party.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the aspect tries to attack the mages, the mages can spare some of the ritual power to create a shield against the aspect’s attacks, causing the mages to take no damage from any attacks for one round. This will only work three times before they can no longer defend themselves.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the aspect drops to half its hit points or lower, it will move as quickly as it can toward the treeline to try and refuel using the timber.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The battle ends once the aspect is petrified, at which point the mages will call to the character holding <span class=\"hpp italic\">the Borealus</span> and instruct them on what to do.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" title=\"The Battle with the Aspect of Fire\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Aspect-Face-Off.webp\" />"

However, even if they do Odwald will insist upon being the one to give up his life. It was his mistakes that got the Wood into this mess, so in his eyes it’s only fair that he forfeit his life. There is no time to argue, and if another character volunteers and refuses to back down, Odwald will appear to acquiesce, only to sacrifice himself at the last minute and save them.

          "text": "<p class=\"hpp header-3\">Alderheart</p><p class=\"hpp scratch-left\">the great tree city</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Long ago, druids of the Wood learned how to speak with trees and use magic to shape them into shelters in which they could make their homes. This process was considered deeply respectful, as a tree could not be forced to take any shape it didn’t agree to. So it was that specialist druids, known as shapers, became mediators between the will of the people and the will of the forest. Birdfolk shapers spoke to the tallest and most ancient tree in the Wood—Alderheart. The shapers obtained permission for birdfolk to build a home within Alderheart’s branches. Later, the great tree again gave permission to shape its trunk into homes for an increasing population. This burgeoning city took the name of the tree who so generously provided a home for the people of the Wood, and Alderheart became Humblewood’s capital. Known throughout the region as the “Great Tree City,” Alderheart, is a vibrant place and a cultural center, home to thousands of residents, some regional and some from the farthest corners of Everden.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Heart of the Wood</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Alderheart is home to every race of birdfolk and humblefolk. The thriving community attracts people from faraway lands, like traveling merchants, explorers, and foreign dignitaries. Citizens of the Humblewood who don’t live in the city routinely journey there to trade goods, stock up on supplies, engage in artistic endeavors, or simply to catch up on the latest news and gossip. Effectively everyone in Humblewood is connected to Alderheart.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Virtually anything can be found in Alderheart, if you know where to look. The majority of the city’s inhabitants are well-meaning, decent folk, but like any city there are dark alleys and back rooms. Crime here is usually kept in check by the Perch Guard, but while the city guards are vaunted as being among the best in the Wood, illicit activities continue under the cover of darkness.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Wide and Tall</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As Alderheart is massive, it is often difficult for visitors to tell they are in a tree at all. The Great Tree City is divided into three main levels where people live, work, and go about their lives: the canopy, the trunk, and the roots.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The canopy contains Alderheart’s most iconic structures, including the chambers of the Birdfolk Council, the headquarters of the Perch Guard, and the largest market in the Wood. This market boasts boutiques where patrons can find high-quality weapons, armor, and adventuring gear, the latest fashions, finest foods, and goods brought in from all across Everden. Outside the main market, smaller shops peddle wares off the beaten path. Some contain enchanted goods at a bargain, though any Alderheart socialite will recommend sticking to the more respectable shops.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The canopy contains Alderheart’s most iconic structures, including the chambers of the Birdfolk Council, the headquarters of the Perch Guard, and the largest market in the Wood.

Outside the main market, smaller shops peddle wares off the beaten path. Some contain enchanted goods at a bargain, though any Alderheart socialite will recommend sticking to the more respectable shops.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">City gates, located at strategic points around the canopy, are the only sanctioned ways to enter the city, and are monitored by Perch Guard watchposts. These gates are connected to lower levels of the tree and the forest floor by large winding stairways that allow travel by foot. Vast infrastructures for transportation are common in the canopy. “Branchroads”, specially-shaped wooden pathways, are the arteries of trade in Alderheart. Along with rope bridges, these roads allow couriers to move goods from place to place using hand carts. Pulleys connected to raisable platforms are used to lift freight from the forest floor. In the outermost branches, where such infrastructure cannot be supported, gliding platforms provide birdfolk, at least, with a means of crossing otherwise impassable gaps. Without the ability to glide, navigating this part of the capital becomes increasingly dangerous.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Buildings in the canopy are made from a variety of materials, including stone, wood, and brick. Most are stationed atop reinforced platforms to keep them stable. The more impressive homes are located in the Boughs District, just above the market. Those on the outer branches tend to be made of wood and have a more modest feel to them.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The largest section of the metropolis, the trunk, which acts as an intermediary zone between the prosperous canopy and the less affluent roots. Many humblefolk make their homes here, where there is stable floor beneath them.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The trunk can be one of the most confusing and disorienting areas of Alderheart for new travelers. Pathways split and diverge, sometimes tapering off into nothing. Systems of specially-designed cold lanterns serve as signposts along the main paths. These lanterns use either captured fireflies or motes of magic to provide light, depending on the neighborhood. In either case, lamplighters are tasked with making sure they stay lit during the day to provide a day/night cycle.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">In the trunk, another market thrives. Here, stalls of all kinds cluster around central support pillars shaped from Alderheart’s wood. They showcase unique wares and niche humblefolk-style foods and cultural goods not found in canopy markets. There are also curiosity shops and sellers of regional wares, such as crystals harvested from the backs of young basilisks. Additionally, the trunk market is home to inns, taverns, and public houses. This is the best place in Alderheart to find serviceable goods and adventuring gear for those looking to save coin. Near the market is a druidic grove of moss and fungi supported by the Tenders, who help care for the tree and train new recruits to their order.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Beyond the many shops and goods on offer in the trunk market, the central support pillars contain tenement style housing for the most cosmopolitan trunk dwellers. More affluent homes can also be found here, shaped out of the trunk, for Alderheart’s traditionally minded humblefolk nobility, as well as birdfolk aristocrats whose homes have been here since Alderheart was first shaped.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Down past the trunk market, pathways widen and wind, illuminated by knotholes in the tree that allow sunlight to filter inside. Although some homes in these bright hollows are built near the bark, where windows can be shaped out of the wood, most homes are shaped inside the dim pathways. A select few obtain permission to shape homes on the outside surface of the trunk. These special homes are connected to interior pathways via carefully fenced roads, and are considered a luxury that many cannot afford.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The farther down the trunk one travels, the more shabby and ill-kept the residences and infrastructure become. There are no officially authorized ways to leave or enter the tree by way of lower parts of the trunk, and Perch Guard are constantly on the lookout for smugglers.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Beneath the lowest parts of the trunk, a series of tunnels have been carved into the roots of Alderheart. At first, the roots were not considered to be official parts of the city, and their development was largely overlooked by city officials in the canopy, until word arrived of the illicit activities taking place there. Many were convinced that the tunneling would simply go away if druids were to heal the tree, but Alderheart itself took pity on those living here, and decided to allow the tunnels to exist rather than force people from their homes. The root tunnels have since been strengthened by druidic shaping, lit to be on par with the inside of the trunk, and a garrison of the Perch Guard was stationed nearby. Even with these improvements, the roots remain the poorest area in Alderheart: the slums of the Great Tree City. Here, the air is always dank and humid, and wild fungi grow rampant. The buildings are mostly cobbled together from scavenged materials, and some have been converted into community gathering places. These hubs help connect communities in the roots with helpful aid from the trunk district, and allow the people here to organize and plan neighborhood events. Life in the roots isn’t easy, but people are trying their best to keep their communities strong, as they petition the canopy for better living conditions. There are few shops here, and they typically traffic in smuggled and stolen goods. Crime is ever-present; many who dwell in the roots see it as necessary to survive.</p>"

It is dangerous living so close to the Grove, but the rewards make it worth the risk for the intrepid folk that call Ashbarrow home. The town takes its name from the small hill upon which it rests, and is inhabited by a mix of birdfolk and humblefolk who shelter within its low stone walls. A large watchtower near the town’s center serves as both a means of observing when the winds will bring ash from the Scorched Grove, as well as an observatory for seers who watch the stars for signs and portents.</p>"

The free transmission of knowledge is one of the Avium’s core principles, but the College nonetheless maintains a certain degree of secrecy regarding some of the more dangerous magical tomes it safeguards. All races are welcome within the Avium’s halls, although admittance is granted only by the will of the headmaster and a council of senior staff. Prospective students are tested for their skills, but also the motivation for their studies. The College takes great care to ensure its members will positively represent the legacy and reputation of the Avium out in the world.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Magic, Inside and Out</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Avium was once a living tree that was home to a perch known for producing some of Humblewood’s most legendary scholars. After the tree’s death, a group of wizards from this perch decided to found the Avium here. They used transmutation magic to artificially petrify the tree, and then shaped it into a building capable of housing the largest mage college in Humblewood. Controlled by magical fields, the College’s many structures float in circuit with one another: a collection of towers, courtyards, and observatories all hover around the huge central building, each equipped with a bridge that lines up with the main building at regular intervals. Those not gifted with the birdfolk’s limited form of flight must harness their magic for transportation, or wait until the archways align to allow for foot traffic.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Seat of Knowledge</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While the curriculum is diverse, the College does impose certain limitations, most notably regarding necromancy. As inhabitants of the Wood, the Avium’s primary staff members originate from a culture with great respect for nature and the cycle of life. As such, the necromantic arts are taught mainly in a theoretical sense. Practical application of necromancy at the College is highly regulated, and available only under strict guidance.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Students are, however, encouraged to explore other schools of magic to their fullest potential. Breakthroughs in elemental theorems, teleportation methods, and advances in practical transmutation have been pioneered at the Avium. Within these classrooms you will find future Tenders, council members, and protectors of the Wood. The application process is demanding, and the curriculum rigorous. Few make it to graduation. For those who prove their grasp of the arcane, endorsement from the Avium is among the highest of honors.</p>"

In the taller perches, fruiting vines and mosses are grown from the branches of the trees. The largest and most productive farming perch is Brackenmill. Considered a lesser perch due to its proximity to the ground, Brackenmill nevertheless consists of many proximate tree-farms that, after years of growth, melded into one another. It includes a central hub of shops, trade halls, and shipping platforms, all under the watchful eye of the local Perch Guard. Some of the farms have even begun to expand downward, encompassing small horticultural plots at the base of trees. The grounded farms produce luxury goods that can’t be grown along the branches, and house corrals for giant insects that produce goods ranging from silk to meat.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Practically every store, tavern, and supplier in Alderheart gets their goods from Brackenmill. The movement of agricultural products to vendors around the Wood is overseen by a powerful trade guild made up of prominent farm-owning families. The guild is comprised of elected leaders and legacy members from the most noble of these families. Legacy members inherit their position and tend to hold lifetime appointments.</p>"

It stands in stark contrast to the green forest at its base with sheer rock faces and huge boulders rising into the sky.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Desolate and Dangerous</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The mountain’s severe environment supports a variety of goats and small mammals that feast on hearty shrubbery growing between the crags. There are also several unique creatures native to the Crest. Griffons roost in the peaks and scour a wide territory around the mountain for prey. Basilisks feast on rocks, but have a special preference for creatures they have petrified with their deadly stone gaze. Giant eagles nest atop the highest cliffs, keeping their young safe from lowland predators. Mountain lions, powerful earth-aspected hunters, prey on goats, rodents, and occasionally more monstrous creatures.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Crest is dotted with structures built during different points in history by both birdfolk and humblefolk. In addition to garnering interest from archeological teams, some of these mysterious ruins have become home to a handful of intrepid folk who have taken to life in this dangerous and remote place.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Mighty Origins</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">An old tale relates how the Amaranthine Altus was challenged to a contest of strength by a giant made from living rock. To achieve victory, Altus is said to have lifted the earth up with his talons, proving his might and creating the mountains. In some versions, the frustrated giant challenges Altus to several rematches. They travel across the face of Everden, raising higher and higher peaks, until all the mountains in the world are created. Every adaptation agrees: Altus is always victorious, and is given dominion over the high summits of the world. The snowy, harsh environment of the mountains is said to be directly influenced by Altus, the Amaranthine of storms.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">It is a wonder that such a lush, expansive forest sits at the foot of these blustry peaks. Experts theorize that the formidable bulwark of rock helped the Wood thrive by shielding is from the bitter, salty winds of the ocean.</p>"

One of the most unconventional perches, Marshview is extremely disconnected from the goings on of the Wood. The location has basic amenities, like shops and an inn, but it is not a prime destination for travelers. Residents eye visitors with a mix of curiosity and suspicion, but are ultimately a kind and welcoming folk.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">A balanced mix of birdfolk and humblefolk inhabitants results in architecture unique to Marshview. A reflection of its population, walkways and staircases are more common here than in other birdfolk settlements. Several buildings are on the ground, and traditional farming takes advantage of the limited dry ground between the forest and the nearby swamp.</p>"

Meadowfen has been quiet for as long as anyone can remember, and life here goes by slowly. Its closeness to the marsh keeps it safe from attacks by emberbats and other fire-based creatures from the Scorched Grove. Its distance from the Mokk Fields ensures deadly slimes don’t stray into the village. </p>"

The water here gradually filters out to the Talongrip Coast and into the sea. Before it does, the still, muddy freshwater reservoirs allow the Mokk Fields to support a surprising array of life.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Uninviting Geography</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The fringes of the Mokk Fields are wreathed with reeds, water lilies, and pleasant greenery. Farther into the heart of the swamp, travelers find themselves inundated by stagnant, foul-smelling waters and muddy lowlands with poor footholds. Patches of dry stable ground are scarce, meaning that the slimy, gnarled trees that grow here are rarely suitable to support a perch.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Rare Goods</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Mokk Fields are not a popular travel destination, especially for birdfolk accustomed to towering trees and bustling perches. Still, some venture here seeking the area’s unique resources. Plants and creatures found only in the swamp are useful for potion brewing or magical reagents, and there is good coin to be made for people willing to brave the area’s many dangers. Of special note are the slimes, dangerous ooze creatures exclusive to this environment, whose residue has become a sought-after commodity for those with the skill to harvest it.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Mokkden Caverns</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">One of the more unlikely landforms of the Mokk Fields is the intricate, vast cavern system that runs beneath the swamps. Years ago, what was thought to be sinkholes were revealed to in fact be tunnel entrances to a series of caves. Scouts from Winnowing Reach have probed the depths to learn more about these caverns. The few who have returned reported a significant number of slimes. The damp, lightless caverns make a perfect home for the amorphous creatures that dwell here.</p>"

          "text": "<p class=\"hpp header-3\">Saltar’s Port</p><p class=\"hpp scratch-left\">gateway to the sea</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">History shows there was serious disagreement over the founding of Saltar’s Port. For many birdfolk, the idea of building a city on the ground is laughable in itself, but to build on the rocky coastline with the express intent of sailing ships was considered a gross misuse of resources. After heated debates, a group of birdfolk broke off and founded the port city on their own. The rift between the inhabitants of the Port and the rest of the Wood took many years to mend, and the relationship is still tense at times.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Saltar’s Port serves as the only access for ships coming to or leaving from Humblewood. It has sparked a vibrant trade business, offering the riches of the Wood to faroff cities and kingdoms. The port has also opened up Humblewood to overseas visitors and migrants, causing concern among the more consevative birdfolk.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Saltars-Port-Mask.webp\" />"

          "text": "<p class=\"hpp header-3\">Scorched Grove</p><p class=\"hpp scratch-left\">ash and flame</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Centuries ago, the area known as the Scorched Grove was once a lush forest of calm meadows and peaceful glades. Then, the Great Calamity came: a massive forest fire that swept through the Grove and reduced it to a smoldering, ashen plain. The Grove refused to heal. Stranger still, the soil beneath the ashen steppes still smolders with embers. The air here carries a supernatural heat which can exhaust travelers or even cause burns depending on its fierceness. This hostile landscape is home to a variety of curious fire-aspected creatures. Certain species, now considered native to Humblewood, only appeared after the Great Calamity. Most notable are the emberbats, which roost in the safety of the Grove during the day.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">A Scar on the Forest</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Accounts of the great blaze have been recorded in Humblewood’s history books, but the exact cause of the Great Calamity remains a mystery. The soils of the Grove were tested and found to be distinctively suited to channeling evocation energy, especially when used with fire spells.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">It was also discovered that the fire-aspected creatures of the Grove have extra-planar origins, giving rise to the theory that the Calamity was caused by magic. A popular myth told by forest-dwellers alleges that the Calamity was caused by the appearance of a great primal being of fire and destruction, which visited its wrath upon the Wood and then vanished as mysteriously as it arrived.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Whatever its origins, the fire devastated the area and displaced thousands of beasts and people from their homes. While the inhabitants of the Humblewood know that the death and rebirth is part of the natural order of the Wood, the Calamity that befell the Grove was clearly unnatural.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Each year, the Grove pushes on the boundary of the forest, growing slightly as its edges are set ablaze by windblown embers or fire-infused creatures. The expansion of the Grove leaves the newly-burned areas similarly affected, experiencing the supernatural qualities of the Grove. This gradual spread has increased with a recent spate of forest fires, making those who study the Grove nervous.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">A Watchful Eye</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Scorched Grove is cared for by a conclave of mystics and druids known as the Tenders. Many Tenders are talented thinkers and practitioners of natural magic, who have dedicated their lives to understanding the nature of the Calamity’s effect on the Grove and healing the damage it has caused. They believe that through study and communion with nature, the natural balance of the energy in the wood can be restored, healing the Grove back into the tranquil forest it once was.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">There is much debate about the intent and success of the Tenders. High-society perch-dwellers are inclined to think of the Tenders as nothing more than “odd-birds,” embarking on a fool’s errand. These detractors claim that the Scorched Grove is simply a quirk of Humblewood’s natural magic. Much of the populace agrees with this point of view, despite educated claims to the contrary. Still, given the affinity between nature and the cultures of the Wood, Tenders are generally respected for the care and reverence they give to the forest.</p>"

These small settlements are sparsely decorated, focusing on stability and protection from the salty winds of the ocean. Homes are chiseled out of the rock faces, with wooden platforms serving as walkways between them. On more vertical slopes, buildings are connected by a veritable forest of ropes and cables used to get from place to place.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Life Over the Water</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Citizens of coastal perches and villages are primarily folk who wish to remain close to the water. Sea raptors, mapachs, and jerbeens have carved out space for themselves along the coast, sometimes literally. These seaside settlements focus on fishing and salt drying, exporting their cured fish to the rest of the Wood.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The weather here is volatile. It can turn from clear and sunny to black and stormy with one gust of the wind. Most of the coast’s inhabitants can spot these changes easily, knowing when to retreat to shelters. Living near the shore means enduring the occasional hurricane, windstorm, and tidal wave. Those who make the coast their home are known for resilience.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">Deadly Neighbors</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">A number of dangers face the people who live along the coastline. Large predatory lizards hunt and scavenge the sandy shores, and giant crabs have been known to drag victims to a watery grave. Rarest of all are the dreaded wakewyrms. Most professional fishing outfits employ hunters to stand guard, and guides and mercenaries are often hired by merchants hauling goods across the treacherous coastways. Those who wish to avoid the cost of protection can attempt the journey alone, but many grim fables describe foolish travelers who were too stingy to take the proper precautions.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Jerbeen-Dwelling-Mask.webp\" />"

It started as a modest outpost, a last stop for researchers and slime-wranglers bound for the Mokk Fields. When folk began disappearing in the swamp, it was decreed that a more permanent settlement be constructed to hold a small contingent of Perch Guard. To this end, the perch was hastily constructed within a small stand of willow trees. In contrast to standard perches, a decent portion of the homes and facilities here were built entirely on the ground. This closeness to the earth creates a feeling of unease and general distaste for birdfolk accustomed to the high perches, but the other races that make up the population appreciate the easier access to research stations and support buildings.</p><h4 class=\"hpp header-4\">The Slime Industry</h4><p class=\"hpp para-2\">South-west of the Winnowing Reach are the damp slime-filled caves of the Mokkden Caverns. Initially considered a hindrance, slimes quickly became a valuable export for the Reach. Thanks to the profits from slime-wrangling, Winnowing Reach has grown to include businesses specializing in harvesting and shipping slime residue. The trade is mainly with the Avium for educational, research, and experimental purposes, but other buyers are appearing at a steady pace. Alchemists across the Wood find the substances useful in a variety of potions, and some healers are beginning to test the medicinal application of various slime-based concoctions.</p>"

          "text": "<p class=\"hpp hw-title\">Religion in the Wood</p><p class=\"hpp hw-subtitle\">pulse of the forest</p><p class=\"hpp drop-cap-main\">In the beginning, there was only the sound of wings. Faint at first, the distant beats were easy to miss, but as time passed they grew stronger, faster, until they could be heard across the great unending dark. Then, with a single flap, creation burst forth: fire, ice, air, water, soil and sky, all came from the sound of feathers that resonated throughout the cosmos. This is the Great Rhythm, and by the Great Rhythm are all things moved. The Rhythm tells the sun when to set, and the moon when to rise. The Rhythm tells the seeds when to flower, the trees when to shed their leaves, and the snows when to fall. The essence of everything there is comes from the Great Rhythm. One day, the Rhythm may cue the end of creation—but there will be no end to the Rhythm itself. As every downbeat has an upbeat to follow it, so too will the cycles of nature eventually start again—for even though the Rhythm can be faint at times, it is everlasting and eternal.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Every denizen of the forest, from the large to the small, from predator to prey, knows of The Great Rhythm: the beating force that is the pulse of life itself. To the birdfolk, the Rhythm began with the sound of beating wings, but other folk of the Wood tell that it began with the thundering of hooves, the padding of paws, or with a tiny heartbeat. Birdfolk believe that two great spirits emerged from the Rhythm. They were the first Amaranthine: Ardea, whose wings usher in the dawn, and Tyton, whose wings are the shadow of night. They are the avatars of life and death, and keepers of the Rhythm.</p><h2 class=\"hpp header-2\">The Amaranthine</h2><h6 class=\"hpp subhead2-scratch\">guardians of the rhythm</h6><p class=\"hpp quote\">Just as we need a heart to make our pulse pound, so too does the Rhythm require a drummer. The heart of the Rhythm lies within the Amaranthine. They are the immortals, who have been given new life by the Rhythm, and act as its guardians, maintaining the balance of nature.</p><p> </p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Amaranthine are the gods of Everden. They are entrusted with maintaining the cosmic balance known as the Great Rhythm. Unlike gods in other settings, the Amaranthine rarely squabble with one another, for any strife between the Amaranthine is a threat to the balance of nature itself. The Amaranthine tend to keep to themselves, and rarely meddle in each other’s affairs.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Though each Amaranthine is a powerful being in their own right, holding a great degree of autonomy over their dominion, each understands that they are but a small part of a greater whole. Like the themes of a concerto, the Amaranthine are the harmonies that create the Great Rhythm.</p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Birdfolk vs. Humblefolk Amaranthine</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Amaranthine are venerated by all races of Humblewood, although birdfolk and humblefolk worship them differently. The five whose origins are described in the “Tales of the Amaranthine” (Altus, Clhuran, Gesme, Reya, and Hanera), are primarily worshiped by birdfolk, and they (along with Ardea and Tyton) form the most common pantheon worshiped across the Wood.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While humblefolk still recognize the birdfolk pantheon, most worship Amaranthine specific to their culture and heritage. Belief in these Amaranthine is not as widespread, but their power is just as real.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The humblefolk Amaranthine are less cohesive, with each having varied tales, origin myths, rather than a single origin story. Many fables are told of the humblefolk Amaranthine, such as the time Kren tricked Gesme into dropping her flaming staff to flush game out of a bush, or when Henwin sheltered Gaspard from a great monster.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">To humblefolk who live outside of birdfolk perches, Ardea and Tyton are known as Dawnmother and Nightfather. They are depicted in forms that closely resemble the features of the humblefolk who worship them.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">In the perches, humblefolk Amaranthine tend to be viewed as a folk religion alongside the primary birdfolk pantheon. Occasionally, perch-dwelling humblefolk will have small shrines in their homes, or in their shops dedicated to their Amaranthine.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While these Amaranthine go largely overlooked by most birdfolk, some who have taken the time to learn their legends pay homage to the featherless Amaranthine. This bothers a few humblefolk, but the priests of these Amaranthine understand that each one is but a reflection of the Great Rhythm, and welcome any birdfolk to learn from them.</p><img

She is the Amaranthine of the sun who watches over the flora and fauna of Everden and provides them with light and energy to grow.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Ardea’s light is present in all living things, from the tiniest sprouting seed to the mightiest beast. Her light also represents love and kindness, which every creature is believed to possess. All birdfolk are said to be Ardea’s children, and many think she appears as a stork to demonstrate her maternal love for them—although she is speculated to appear in a different form to each woodland race.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">When she vacates the sky she rests in a plane of pure light and life. There, great celestial storks carry out her will, and act as her messengers in the mortal world. An old folk story relates that Ardea sends these storks to fly unnoticed into Everden, where they place her animating light into unhatched eggs. This is why birdfolk often refer to her as “Mother Stork”.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">She is worshiped by good aligned characters of every sort: poets write of the love she has bestowed upon the world, priests ask her to watch over the newly born, and farmers pray to her for good harvests and light winters.</p>"

It is believed he ushers the night in by spreading his wings over the sky. Tyton also governs time, memory, and death. As the sun must set, so too must the light of life give way to the darkness of the grave. Rather than being seen as a frightful figure, Tyton is looked upon as kind; he greets the old, the frail, and those at the end of their lives as familiar friends, guiding their souls peacefully back into the Great Rhythm, where they will be reborn, in time.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">When not occupying the sky, it is believed Tyton resides in the lands of death. Not an afterlife, rather this is a part of the Great Rhythm where everything is cold, dark, and eternally still. His abode lies beyond the parts of the Rhythm associated with life, a divide impossible for mortals to cross. Even other Amaranthine find travel to the lands of death difficult, except for Altus, who resides there with Tyton for most of the year, only leaving to bring winter storms across the land.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">In addition to guiding the souls of the dead, Tyton is associated with the coming of old age, and the keeping of memory. When Tyton is invoked at funerals, it is to remember those who have passed, and to recall their lives and deeds. He watches the living, patiently observing all beneath him. Tyton can learn all there is to know of your life by watching your dreams. Because Tyton watches the living from birth to death, he is known as “Father Owl”.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tyton frowns upon those who would seek to enslave the souls of the dead using necromantic magics, and those who would desecrate the tombs of</p>"

Altus is a pragmatic Amaranthine, believing that strength is cultivated through enduring hardships, overcoming challenges, and testing mortal limitations. Stories of Altus’ tenacity and endurance abound, including the time he captured the moon as a gift to Ardea, and the time he made the mountains by lifting the earth. Themes of bravery and strength are common in his myths.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Altus resides with Tyton in the lands of death. Legend says that every year Altus makes the long and arduous journey to bring winter storms and foul weather. According to myth, this is as much to test the endurance of his people as it is to test himself by crossing the divide between life and death, which binds the Great Rhythm. Summers with especially bad weather are credited to Altus, who made the trip early to keep his people strong and vigilant.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Altus is the patron Amaranthine of the strig, and is celebrated by them annually in a great winter festival. Games and activities during this festival challenge entrants with feats of strength and endurance. No official winner is declared, and all who participate are lauded for their courage and given a special place at the feasting table.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Altus usually finds veneration among warriors or athletes, but also among common people who pray for strength to withstand personal hardships, bad harvests, and natural disasters.</p>"

He is commonly represented in dual profile: on one side as a jester with bangles and bells, carrying a marotte, and on the other as an executioner, weilding an axe. Clhuran’s double profile illustrates his fickle nature, and the nature of fate. Clhuran’s tales are of his luck, mirth, and jest, though he is also known to be a capricious Amaranthine. His normally pleasant demeanor can shift at a moment’s notice to melancholy or jealousy.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Clhuran teaches that everyone is tied to the web of fate by invisible strands. Each thread extends out into the cosmos, darting and weaving as it moves to the Rhythm. Clhuran’s wisdom is to allow yourself to be moved by the threads of fate, to feel the pull of possibility around you, and to act in accordance with their whims. Even misfortune may lead one to an important place, or so Clhuran says. Good times and bad times are all part of the tapestry of fate, and there is a strength that can be drawn from accepting one’s destiny. According to his teachings, good luck is nothing more than being open to change, and following the will of the universe.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Lumas are seen to be Clhuran’s chosen, because of their connection to the threads of fate, which manifests as a natural magical talent. Arcane spellcasters, seers, and fortune tellers pray to Clhuran for insight into the will of the universe. Bards, artists, and writers also pay homage to Clhuran, because of his wild moods and connection to emotion.

She represents fire, the spark which both inspires and destroys. She acknowledges that delving into the unknown requires the courage to be burned.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Gesme is depicted as a raven, whose body is alight with the flames of knowledge. In her talons she carries a staff of burning oak which lights the way for scholars. Gesme is best known for stealing fire from Ardea’s sun and bringing it to Everden, burning her feathers black in the process.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Her stolen flame brought fire and the light of reason to the world. While this act earned her a place among the Amaranthine, many feel it was a folly to give fire to mortals.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">She is the patron spirit of the corvums. Legend has it that all corvums have at least one black feather, symbolic of Gesme’s seared plumage.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Gesme teaches that chaos and innovation are part of a great cycle. Each discovery spawns a new mystery, which leads to further discovery in a never-ending loop, in which the old becomes fodder for the new. She is a symbol of all that birdfolk can achieve if they dare to push boundaries and harness their creativity.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">First among her followers are those who study the arcane arts or experiment with magical forces, such as scholars and mages. She is also revered by artisans, and craftspeople of every kind. Blacksmiths in particular understand the danger and power of working directly with flames and pay her special reverence. Her followers pray to her for the spark of creativity that will ignite the fires of creation.</p>"

She holds dominion over all things that grow within the earth. While Ardea is the animating force of life, Hanera is the guiding heart that gives life purpose and meaning. She encourages birdfolk to see the world not only from the treetops, but from the loam and all the tiny living things beneath. Everything, Hanera teaches, is connected as part of a vast continuum of life stretching back to the earliest ancestors.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Hanera is depicted as a pheasant with feathers that fade to green as they morph into plants and flowers. She is the patron Amaranthine of the gallus, and is invoked when growing anything from the soil.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">As a spirit of both earth and hearth, Hanera governs the bonds that connect people to one another and to nature. She is celebrated at feasts, and during ceremonies involving the sharing of food.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Her generosity and kindness are renowned, as is her intolerance for evil. It is Hanera’s will that evil be challenged wherever it is found. Not with violence, but with acts of compassion. Those who harbor darkness in their hearts require the warmth of friends, family, and shelter to heal, and so Hanera teaches birdfolk never to give up on each other. Even the most wicked among us can be healed with love.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Hanera is worshiped by farmers and druids, but many clerics tend shrines in her honor, mostly in modest woodland villages. Her holy symbol is often hung above the doorway, inside a home, to bless the dwelling and all those within.</p>"

Reya embodies this freedom. Her spirit glides through trees, over mountains, and out to the four corners of the world. She is the Amaranthine of exploration; her holy symbol forms a compass. Free-spirited folk who feel an insatiable urge to wander and roam the lands have been touched by her winds.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Reya is a skilled hunter, credited with the invention of the bow, a gift she passed down to the birdfolk. She is also honored for her skills in navigating wild country and surviving off the land. Travelers undertaking long journeys pray to be blessed by a portion of her talents, to assist them in the perilous wilderness. Reya watches over those who embark on daring expeditions, protecting travelers and presenting them with challenges to make their journey all the more memorable.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Reya is worshiped by hunters, travelers, sailors, and explorers.

The energy that Cairith oversees is the cause of slow, steady growth and longevity. In living beings, this force manifests as the ability to run, jump, grow, and become strong. Ancient forests, where plants cover the trees and giant beasts are endowed with the intelligence to speak, are seen as signs of Cairith’s blessing. Cairith teaches that adversity brings strength, but his teachings differ from those of Altus. Altus encourages his followers to seek out challenges, where Cairith sees life itself as a perpetual struggle. The true test of survival is always against oneself and one’s own limits. By persevering in spite of these limits, Cairith counsels his adherents to triumph over the forces of death. This struggle must one day end, of course, and so the followers of Cairith seek to honor the daily triumphs of life as they happen. An existence is considered well-spent if it was lived unflinchingly, even in the face of sorrows and hardships. Cairith adamantly opposes necromancy as those made undead truly cannot appreciate life’s struggles.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Cairith is described as a mighty stag with antlers covered in moss and flowering vines. He is massively tall, and wherever he walks plants sprout from the earth. Where others see a tangle of vegetation, Cairith sees the plan of nature unfolding. All cervans profess a kinship to Cairith. But rather than claiming him as a direct ancestor, he is seen as a guardian spirit. Some say he was the first to be born from the land when the Dawnmother gave Everden life.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Cairith guided the first cervans, and blessed them with many gifts so that they might survive in the primitive forest. One of these gifts, the power of The Sight, is attributed to Cairith. Certain cervans are gifted with The Sight, and this allows them to glimpse events that have occurred in the past, present, and future.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Cairith finds reverence among rangers, druids, healers, and community leaders. Paladins invoke his dogma to give heart to those they defend. Cervan diviners gifted with the Sight call upon Cairith in their rituals. Cairith also has many followers among common people, especially humblefolk who have suffered hardships.</p>"

In life, Gaspard was a great jerbeen leader. Upon his death, the Great Rhythm took him, and his spirit ascended as an Amaranthine. It is believed he was chosen to serve as an example of greatness, one to inspire others for generations to come. Tales of his mortal adventures have earned him renown. He traveled the whole of Everden, with his closest companions, slaying monsters, unseating tyrants, and bringing peace and prosperity wherever he roamed.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Gaspard’s followers believe the actions of an individual ripple outwards, affecting those around us, which in turn can embolden anyone to achieve greatness. The example of Gaspard teaches jerbeen to affect others with acts of courage, heroism, and kindness.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">At times, Gaspard has been at odds with other Amaranthine. Before he ascended, there is a tale of him meeting Kren, where he was forced to show no sign of fear, lest she eat him and his companions. Thankfully, his composure kept his group strong, and in turn their bravery kept him strong. They escaped with their lives.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Gaspard’s example has lead many to heed the paladin’s call. Gaspard is worshiped by warriors who seek to match his exploits, as well as bards who seek to inspire others through the telling of heroic tales.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Humblefolk hold summer festivals in his honor. These holidays include storytelling, puppet shows, and magnificent jousts where armored jerbeens mounted on tamed wolves put on a spectacle of courage and daring before the crowds.</p>"

In spite of this conflict, Hath is revered by the mapach. According to them, Hath was a constellation of stars who listened carefully to the Nightfather. In ancient times, the Nightfather spoke and spread his vast wisdom across the primordial darkness. He spoke of night, of time, and of the worlds beyond life. The constellation listened and grew wise, too wise to remain as stars. Thus, it became a part of the Great Rhythm as the Amaranthine of fear, doubt, and secrets. This is why, the tellers say, the Nightfather no longer speaks.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Ever since, Hath has whispered its unsettling secrets to the creatures below, speaking quietly so the other stars cannot hear. Mapachs were not the first to hear its voice, but they claim to be the first to truly make use of its secrets. While priests of Hath do not necessarily “hear” the words of the stars, mapachs believe that Hath speaks in subtle ways. Those frightened while traveling at night or caught in dangerous situations are bestowed with cautious and crafty thoughts by Hath. If heeded, one may survive. If ignored, one may die. Either way, Hath, The Uncaring, is apathetic.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">The stars teach the importance of trusting in oneself and keeping your wits about you, even in dire situations. When a mapach gets a shiver of premonition, something they could never have known, it is said to be the whispers of Hath they have heard.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Hath has few followers, and most are mapachs. Rangers and travelers passing through dangerous parts of the Wood at night often pay homage to the All-Knowing Stars. While some pray to this Amaranthine for guidance, others hope not to hear Hath’s voice, as the stars only whisper to those in peril. Warlocks make pacts with this Amaranthine for knowledge of the worlds beyond life. Most consider this practice to be rather reckless—The Uncaring is known to exact a terrible price for such secrets. Some lose their mind delving into the vast reservoir of knowledge that Hath is all too eager to supply.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\"><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Gods-Hath-Jail-Transparent.webp\" /></p>"

They are the Amaranthine of balance, and teach that all things in the forest must be respected, as all are connected in a great web of kindness. It is thanks to the sun that the plants grow, and because the plants grow, all living things have food. Decayed food turns into soil, which nourishes more life. The teachings of Henwin ask followers to take into consideration the many kindnesses which brought each of them into being and nourished them throughout their lives.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">It is only fitting, then, that Henwin is said to be a hedgehog who spends their life in the forest. Storytellers say that they reside in an ancient part of the world, hidden from the eyes of most mortals, where they inhabit a tangle of roots from every forest that has ever grown. Here they tend to a garden of moss, fungi, and insects, helping to keep the living roots healthy. Henwin ensures that even the husks of withered plants can provide for the vegetation and creatures who rely on dead things for sustenance.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Unlike other Amaranthine, Henwin is not described as male or female. Being a spirit of balance, they are considered to possess traits of all genders. They are often depicted carrying a yellow rose, which is their symbol. When a yellow rose blooms, it is said to be Henwin, blessing a forest with the beauty of their quiet grace. These roses are often given as tokens of friendship.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Henwin teaches understanding, and respect for the web of kindness that connects all life. If death is dealt indiscriminately, the web may become damaged. Although it is resilient, the web is still as fragile as one made from spider’s silk. It is the duty of all who follow Henwin to strengthen the web and to help maintain the balance which supports all living things.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Henwin is followed by druids, who take the message of nature’s web of kindness to heart. Henwin’s druids can be found protecting groves and leading communities, keeping both safe from those with harmful intentions. Priests of Henwin often invoke the Amaranthine Henwin’s name to protect the fauna, flora, and folk under their care. Gardeners honor Henwin by keeping plots filled with a diverse array of complementary plant and insect life.</p>"

The only known parts of her form are her fangs and her eyes, glinting as they catch the light. Kren appears in many tales, as often a villain as a hero, and even then it is rare that her motives are laudable. Yet, one can learn from Kren, for her stories often demonstrate how hubris can be exploited, how heroes can be laid low, and how there is no weapon so deadly as flattery.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">The patron spirit of the vulpin, Kren teaches them to walk the line between savagery and sophistication, and how and when each should be used. For many other humblefolk she demonstrates the value of cunning, showing that no creature is so wise or mighty that they cannot be taken advantage of.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Stories of her origin are often vague and contradictory. A popular vulpin myth tells that Kren came from a time before life existed on Everden. That she was an ancient force, ready to feast on a world full of new and fresh meat, who simply awoke when the Dawnmother and Nightfather set creation in motion. Others believe she was the first vulpin, who ascended from an ordinary fox. As the story goes, Kren tricked the Dawnmother into allowing her to watch over the Amaranthine’s two divine feathers. Kren ate a single feather and became the Amaranthine of guile. This is why the Dawnmother only carries one feather in her beak.</p>\n<p class=\"hpp para-2\">Kren isn’t worshiped in the same way as other Amaranthine. Rather, Kren is invoked in stories to teach the dangers of vainglory. Many outlaws keep shrines to her patronage. These individuals include thieves, smugglers, and purveyors of black market goods. Priests of Kren use her stories to teach others how to be crafty and cunning, but also to be cautious of the wiles of others. There are those, however, who invoke Kren for dark rites and rituals to gain power for themselves. Kren is always ready to make bargains with such supplicants, but all who do are fated to be devoured by her when their lives finally come to an end.</p>"

She had observed the great orb of fire that Ardea had placed high in the sky, and how Ardea had positioned it a great distance from the land and its creatures, so it would warm them gently without burning them. But Gesme also saw that the sun vanished with the coming of night, when the creatures of the dark began to prowl, and thought: “How remarkable would it be to have some of that fire in the world?”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Other birdfolk laughed at Gesme as she spent days plotting, and reading the sky. She examined every tree, from the great ash to the supple willow. Each day she carried a new branch in her beak, dropping many in frustration. The birdfolk were puzzled, but dismissed her actions. Then, one day at dawn, when the sun was at its lowest point in the sky, Gesme appeared with an oak branch in her beak. Without a word, she took off straight into the horizon. She flew for what seemed like ages, but the oak branch was light and did not trouble her. As she neared the sun her feathers, talons, and beak began to blacken in the heat. Still, she persisted. The oak was hardy and spry, and did not wither. Finally, she stuck the tip of the branch into the sun, igniting it. Hastily she flew back toward the ground, with the branch burning bright in her talons. The oak was patient, and did not burn up, keeping the flame steady as Gesme returned from the sky.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">See what I have brought here!” she bragged, as the astounded birdfolk looked upon her scorched feathers. “This will keep us warm on the cold days of winter, and safe through the long nights!”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Ardea was at first concerned at the presence of fire in the world, for she knew the forests could burn, and that misuse of the fire would bring harm to Everden. But, when she saw the birdfolk gather around the fires, and felt the gentle warmth a small flame could provide to her children, she was overcome with happiness.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“This,” she declared, “is worthy of a boon.”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">And thus was Gesme changed. Set ablaze with the flames of knowledge and creativity, she became an Amaranthine. The forms of her followers changed too, and they became the first corvums. They were gifted with a bit of her cleverness and foresight, but Ardea gave them all black talons, feathers, and beaks as a reminder of the price Gesme paid to bring fire into the world.</p>"

Though she was small, she was nimble, swift, and wise in the ways of the forest. Reya was capable and reliable, but birdfolk deemed her too independent to be a leader. She would travel the length and breadth of the land on her hunts, sometimes not returning for weeks at a time.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">During one of her journeys Reya encountered a stranger. The traveler’s true form was hidden under a cloak, but they could fly and clearly felt as comfortable in the trees as any birdfolk. They had heard of Reya’s skill in racing, hunting, and navigating the forest, and proposed three challenges, to which Reya agreed.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">For the first event, the pair moved to a patch of open sky overlooking rugged plains. There was a rocky outcropping in the distance; whoever flew there first would be the winner. The race began, and Reya immediately fell behind, the cloaked figure moving faster than Reya had ever seen.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Reya summoned all her strength to keep up, beating her wings like never before. Yet the traveler kept inching forward, and she was unable to close the gap in time.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Reya steeled herself for the next challenge. They flew to the meadows, where small creatures grazed, and it was decided that the first to catch five hares would be the winner. Reya moved with purpose, confident no one could best her skills with a bow, a tool of her own creation. Each of her shots found its mark, until she had but a single hare left to catch. But when Reya looked over at the traveler, she was shocked to see them waiting impatiently with a full complement.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">For the third and final event, the pair flew to the center of the forest. The first to emerge into the open fields beyond would be the victor. These were forests Reya knew well, and she was certain she would win. As soon as they had started though, Reya saw the traveler alight, darting through the trees as if weightless. Reya kept pace, using every trick she could to give herself an advantage. Still the traveler pulled ahead, if only by inches, and emerged victorious.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Reya landed on a nearby branch and cursed her lack of skill. After a moment of pause however, she regained her composure, and thanked her competitor. Yet the traveler laughed, a sound so familiar, Reya wondered why she hadn’t noticed before.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“You have nothing to be ashamed of, birdfolk. I see your skills are real. You are the first to so nearly best me in every event, and this is no easy feat.” The traveler removed their cloak, and Reya could not believe her eyes. She had been challenged by the wind itself.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“You have nothing to be ashamed of, birdfolk. I see your skills are real. You are the first to so nearly best me in every event, and this is no easy feat.” The traveler removed their cloak, and Reya could not believe her eyes. She had been challenged by the wind itself.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">It swirled, spinning a cloak out of the very clouds, which it placed around Reya. “Consider this a gift, for providing me with such sport.” Reya thanked the wind, and with that, it departed, caressing Reya’s feathers in a familiar breeze.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">When the time came to present a gift, Reya offered Ardea her cloak of clouds, along with the story of her adventure. As Reya told her tale, Ardea could see the eyes of the other birdfolk light up with excitement. When Reya had finished, Ardea returned Reya’s cloak to her, saying the story of her adventure was the rarer gift. Reya was changed, and became the Amaranthine of wind, archery, and exploration. Those she inspired became the first raptors. They began to take on a nomadic lifestyle, finding their fortune day by day as Reya once did and told tales of their own adventures by the light of the campfire.</p>"

Rather than live in the trees with other birdfolk, Hanera made a home for herself below the canopy. She cared for the soil and the earth, and in return the earth gifted her with wisdom. From the earth, Hanera learned to speak with plants—knowledge she used to better care for them. She soon earned fame among the birdfolk, as one who grew the largest and best-tasting crops.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“These crops,” Hanera thought, “are the finest gift I could offer to our Mother.” And so she set about planting a large garden, its bounty reserved for Ardea.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">One day, while tending to her garden, Hanera saw a family of haggard travelers making their way out of the woods. When they saw Hanera, the mother begged her for aid.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“Please, kind sister, we are in great need. We were traveling through the forest when a creature attacked me and wounded my wing. We escaped, but I cannot fly. Please, help us, we are terribly hungry.”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Hanera knew that she couldn’t feed herself and this family while storing crops for Ardea. Even still, she could not turn them away in their desperate state. She offered to share her home and her food for as long as the travelers needed, making sure their needs were met before saving any food for Ardea.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The travelers stayed with Hanera for many nights while the mother healed. Each day, Hanera would prepare the family meals, telling the plants of their plight. The plants understood, and were honored to nourish the weary and wounded birdfolk. In return, Hanera ensured their seeds were saved and planted again, so their lives would continue indefinitely.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">At night, Hanera applied medicine to the mother’s wound made from the leaves of kindly herbs. By the end of the season the mother had healed, the family was in good health, and they gratefully flew away.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">When the day finally came for birdfolk to present their gifts, all Hanera could offer Ardea was a few fruits and vegetables. She wove them together along with flowers she had grown, attempting to make her offering look more cheerful.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“I’m sorry, Mother Stork,” Hanera said. “I had meant to present you with a great harvest, but this is all I could provide.”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Ardea took the wreath, and spoke gladly: “You have given me more than enough, for you see my child, I received your compassion for an entire season.” As Ardea spoke, celestial messengers appeared by her side, and together they transformed into the birdfolk family Hanera had so tenderly cared for.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">For her charity, Hanera received the Amaranthine’s boon: her feathers turned green and grew into vines and shoots, adorned with the most beautiful flowers. Other birdfolk stared in awe, and those who followed Hanera became the first gallus, blessed with her inspiring kindness, as well as her closeness with the earth and all growing things.</p>"

Altus felt pure joy when overcoming obstacles. He loved the cold seasons and challenged himself by hunting at night. His nocturnal existence granted Altus a perspective other birdfolk lacked.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“What if I gifted Ardea something she has never seen before?” he thought. “Yes! I shall hunt the moon, and present it to her, so that she may see its lovely glow.” This would be unthinkable to any other birdfolk, but Altus was resolute, confident his gift would please Ardea.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">However, he was neither as skilled or nimble as Reya, nor as clever or cunning as Gesme. His arrows would not scratch the moon, and despite his great strength, he could not move it. But Altus was stubborn, for many nights he tried and failed to bring down his quarry. The more he tried, the more frustrated he became. Altus even thought he could hear the moon’s laughter reflected in the babbling brooks and rippling ponds, mocking his futile efforts. Still, Altus remained determined.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tyton, intrigued, observed Altus as he struggled. “Why do you persist in this task, my child?” the Amaranthine of night asked. “You must know you will not succeed.”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tyton was touched, not just by the sentiment but by the incredible will of this birdfolk.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“Your resolve does you credit” Tyton said. “To capture the moon, you will require this.” He said producing a lidded chalice, intricately carved from the wood of an alder tree. Tyton gave it to Altus, then the Amaranthine of night disappeared.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Altus was puzzled, until the moon appeared from behind a cloud. He heard its laughter in the pond behind him. When he turned, he saw it: the moon’s reflection set perfectly in the still, clear waters. Without delay, Altus filled the chalice with water. With the moon clearly reflected within the chalice, he quickly shut the lid. The moon was caught.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As dawn began to break over the horizon, Tyton appeared once again before Altus, “Let my sister gaze upon my creation, but return it by day’s end. The night has need of it,” old Father Owl said, before departing for the lands beyond life.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">And so it was that Altus presented Ardea with the moon. He became the first strig, and his people were gifted with his great strength and indomitable will. He kept his oath to Tyton, returning the moon that very evening. For this, Tyton gifted all strigs with the ability to see clearly under its light. Tyton welcomed Altus as a guest in his home, deep within the lands of death. Altus found the cold there bracing, and decided to share it with the people of Everden. This is why the weather is so inclement in winter; Altus returns each year, carrying storms of sleet and snow in his chalice, to test the birdfolk’s endurance.</p>"

Clhuran had no desire to lead. He was whimsical and impulsive. He had wild moods, and was never able to focus on one task for too long. He also had incredible luck. Most saw him as little more than a bumbler, someone who floated their way through life. In truth, Clhuran was full of mirth and cunning. “Where I am,” he oft remarked, “is simply where I am meant to be. I follow the flow of the universe.”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">For all his mirth, Clhuran was notoriously fickle; he was a trickster, who delighted in humbling birdfolk who boasted about their cleverness. This earned him many admirers, and just as many enemies.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Clhuran never intended to compete in the gift-giving contest.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“What should I care what others think of me,” he harrumphed, “So long as I am happy?” Some birdfolk, bitter at having been fooled by him, claimed Clhuran could never hope to win such a contest. Clhuran tried to pay them no heed, in his heart he felt the barbs hit their mark.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">“Who am I kidding,” Clhuran sighed. “I am not strong, nor smart, nor skilled, nor leaderly...I couldn’t possibly produce a gift worthy of Ardea.” With this last thought he sank into a bitter melancholy.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">It was only when a young boy approached him that he regained his confidence. “Please Clhuran, won’t you show us what you can do?” the small birdfolk said. “Many of us love your tricks, and your jokes. You bring joy to all birdfolk! Surely if you try you can do it!”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Clhuran saw the sincerity in the boy’s eyes, and suddenly he knew what to do. “Fine, fine,” he exclaimed in mock annoyance. “I suppose I shall entertain you.”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">With newfound confidence, he approached Ardea. All of the birdfolk were gathered, and when Clhuran looked upon the crowd he saw both enemies and friends. Thoughts of those friendships allowed Clhuran to reach deep within himself, and from the depths of his soul he felt a beat, like the Great Rhythm itself. Channeling this energy, Clhuran opened his beak and brought forth a most beautiful gift: a song.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">It was a song so perfect, so harmonious, that no birdfolk could deny its charm. Ardea beamed.“My child, you have within you a rare gift. May all of your kin be blessed by it.” With those words, Clhuran became the first luma, the Amaranthine of all fortune, good or ill. His peculiar connection to fate is shared by all his kin.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Ever since Clhuran’s performance all birds sing, hoping that they might imitate the perfect song he sang to Ardea. While some sing pleasantly, Clhuran made it so those who mocked him can only trill, shriek, or caw artlessly. This is why it is always important to show respect for others, no matter how odd they may seem.</p>"

Where once there was nothing but barrens, the land came alive with the coming of the Amaranthine, and the world began its endless cycle of life and death. Their arrival split the formless sky into day and night. They created the sun and the moon, and the succession of light and dark which emerged from their movement across the heavens told all life when to act and when to rest. Ardea and Tyton were born from opposite parts of the Great Rhythm. Each knows of the other’s existence, but they keep to their separate spheres, meeting only in the early hours of dawn and the late hours of dusk to exchange dominion over the sky. In seasons of warmth, Ardea has a greater reign over the sky, while in seasons of bitter cold, Tyton’s power increases.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The two Amaranthine created much of the life in Humblewood. Ardea suffused the days with sun-loving flowers, plants, and animals, while Tyton baptized the night with insects and animals that embrace the dark. They birthed sentient races, and from them originate all birdfolk, the first of their children, followed shortly after by the humblefolk.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Originally, all birdfolk were the same. It was difficult to distinguish them from the birds of the forest, as they even possessed the ability to fly. One day, the entire flock of birdfolk decided on a grand contest of gift-giving, to prove which of them was the most worthy to lead. Ardea agreed to act as judge; whoever could present her with the greatest gift would become leaders among her children. For an entire season, birdfolk searched and scrounged, gathered and hunted, returning with trinkets, baubles, gifts great and small. Though Ardea commended all her children for their gifts, only five were truly deserving of her boon.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Gesme, Reya, Hanera, Altus, and Clhuran: these five became leaders of the birdfolk. They inspired tales, devotion, and gave the birdfolk races their distinct forms and skills. These great ones went on to become part of the Great Rhythm as keepers of nature’s balance and protectors of birdfolk across Everden, eventually ascending and joining the Amaranthine. The followers of each of the five were granted new forms and great gifts, to match their leader’s exploits. Yet, to accept these gifts, something needed to be lost. This is why the birdfolk of today can only glide: their gift of flight was taken as the price for becoming something new.</p>"

Perch Guard forces should also come to chase off Krall if he’s victorious, though he won’t stick around for too long.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If Krall wins, he’ll settle for humiliating the heroes by stealing something of value from each party member. Retrieving these items could be the basis of a whole side adventure all its own.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Krall seeks revenge, but he isn’t so foolhardy as to risk death here. If the party seems amenable, he’ll beg for mercy and turn himself in. He has connections in Alderheart’s criminal underbelly, and he would rather be imprisoned than dead. If the party doesn’t seem like the merciful sort, Krall will order his forces to scatter into the forest when things look grim. Once he enters the forest, the party has only 2 rounds to capture him before he leads his pursuers into a prepared escape burrow where he will pull a lever which snaps a wooden portcullis over the entrance. The portcullis can be broken by spending an action and succeeding on a <span class=\"checks-and-saves\">[[/check strength 15 format=long]]</span>, but in this time Krall will already have traveled down one of the many branching pathways of the tunnel and made a clean getaway. His followers don’t know about the escape burrow, and they can be easily captured.

This will include combat medics who can help tend to the party’s wounds. The Perch Guard have orders to take a share of any treasure recovered from either Krall or his bandits back to Alderheart.

These structures slowly rotate around a leafless and branchless tree trunk made from solid stone.

She explains the Dean is expecting them, and then leads the party to the large central gate, which appears to be the only entrance into the structure. She withdraws a an amulet with the Avium’s crest upon it from the folds of her robe and presents it to the giant wooden double doors. After a brief moment the same symbol etches itself in light across the entrance. Then, with a heavy creak, the doors begin to part, revealing an interior lounge.</p><img style=\"border:0\" title=\"Avium Insignia\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Avium-Insignia.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp image-name-caption\">Avium Insignia</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">A main desk sits near the far wall, behind which a scribe is busy with tottering piles of paper.

A few windows occasionally zip by on the way up, showing glimpses of the Wood and just how high the party is traveling. The platform stops halfway up the structure, and the party finds themselves in an area next to a busy atrium. Following Professor Birchwalker, everyone arrives at the Dean’s office.</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">You and your companions enter into a round stone office. It is surrounded on all sides by windows, through which several spires and large circular terrariums can be observed slowly floating by.

He will apologize profusely and clear a few tomes off his desk before moving to give each party member a firm handshake and an official welcome to his College. The Dean will then cut right to the chase: he knows why the party is here and what they’ve come for, thanks to messages from the Council. He is eager to help them find whatever they need to stop the aspect of fire. The Dean will tell the party:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">“You won’t find information on something that old and powerful in just any library. Thankfully, the Avium was built upon the greatest store of knowledge in all of Humblewood… literally! Beneath the main building is the oldest structure here, a library with a collection of tomes, folios, and manuscripts gathered from all over Everden. With any luck, that’s where you’ll find what you’re looking for. Now, a disclaimer—some of the tomes in there are a little… uh, deadly. But worry not, our librarians are experts. They’ll help point you in the right direction while steering you clear of the more… ‘advanced’ materials.”</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">He will then give each of the characters a small amulet with the insignia of the Avium. These appear to be of lesser quality than Professor Birchwalker’s, and Dean Windsworth will inform the party that these are amulets, made especially for guest researchers. The party will then be free to roam the grounds.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Dean knows the importance of their mission, but he also knows they’ve had a long journey. The amulets will give the party access to dormitory chambers that have been prepared specifically for them. The room will have exactly the right number of bunkbeds for the playgroup. The party won’t need to worry about food either, as their guest amulets grant them free meals at the campus dining hall. Characters are also free to sit in on any lectures they wish to attend around campus, as well as to peruse the more conventional libraries housed in the orbiting structures.</p>"

Each structure which orbits the trunk does so at varying heights and speeds, between one rotation every 10 minutes, and one rotation every half hour.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The orbiting structures each have gliding platforms and moveable bridges, which correspond with bridge sections on other structures and connect at regular intervals to form complete overpasses. These structures stay aligned for 10 minutes, allowing for crossing by foot. For humblefolk students, knowing when to cross can make the difference between missing a class and arriving on time. But for birdfolk, the entire aerial campus can be traversed with ease. If ever in doubt about how long it will take for the route to an orbiting structure to connect, roll [[/r 3d10]] and use that number in minutes to decide when the next favorable rotation will be.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">There are many places in the Avium for characters to explore, and characters can spend their time here however they wish. Those who so desire can learn new spells or concoct potions. To track the party’s activities, let the players know that each day they spend in the Avium consists of eight hours within which they can benefit from all the College has to offer. After this time, several campus areas close their doors to students, and only those with special faculty amulets can get past security. Studying at the College can grant one of the following benefits:</p><ul class=\"hpp para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Wizards who study here can add any spell on the wizard’s spell list to their spellbook, but they still require the necessary amount of coin and time to do this. Spells are only granted to wizards deemed worthy of their power, meaning only spells of a level the wizard could cast will be made available.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">By spending a full day studying and practicing, any bard, ranger, sorcerer or warlock can swap one spell they have learned previously for another of the same level that is on their class spell list.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Additionally, any character proficient with a herbalism kit can avail themselves of the campus potions laboratory, which stocks reagents needed for potion making. Creating a potion can be done for the normal cost (to help cover the expenses associated with growing so many magical herbs) and only takes one day of brewing instead of the normal amount of time it would take to craft such an item.</li></ul>"

Quite a few books have had pages torn out and these seem to reference prophecies of some kind, but it’s unclear exactly what they pertain to.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The following passage was found:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">… regardless of the origin of the Calamity, whether or not the rumors of an elder elemental being hold any truth to them, a magical event of incredible significance is almost certain to have taken place.

Other research topics could lead characters here as well. This is a broad category, and even when pared down to tomes on elemental summoning, it would take time to sift through. After four days of research, a character will learn the following:</p><ul class=\"hpp para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Anything as big as the aspect would require huge amounts of energy to seal. It would take tremendous effort on the part of a creature, even one as powerful as the aspect of fire, to break free. This likely couldn’t have been done without the seal being weakened by some outside force.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">A large conjuration circle would be needed in order to seal away anything as massive as the aspect of fire. The circle may have become obscured over time, but it is impossible for the aspect to have been kept dormant all this time without it.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">After finding the previous piece of information, further research will lead the party to a cryptic tome: a treatise by a conjurer who attempted to calculate the location of the postulated conjuration circle within the Grove. The conjurer’s treatise is based on painstaking research on energy readings, topography, ley lines, and other academic esoterica. However, while the complex formulae of his calculations remain, the pages that actually specify the location have been ripped out (see The <span class=\"hpp bold-red\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-campaign-setting.VS0iVIiMTnwqZDs5.JournalEntryPage.BT4amOSysE7bB1oU]{The Old Classroom}, pg. 149</span>). Without the missing page, the conjurer’s calculations could be worked through to find the location of the circle, but it would be incredibly challenging, taking at least a full day of research by someone proficient in the Arcana skill. At the end of the day, the researcher must make a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check arcana 21 format=long]]</span>. On a success, the character calculates the circle’s postulated location in the Grove, which is on its eastern edge, at a point between Winnowing Reach and Alderheart. On a failure, the character must repeat the process, requiring another full day of calculations. Other characters can help with this roll, granting advantage to the character rolling for the check, but only if the supporting characters are also proficient in the Arcana skill.

The party’s suspicions should be aroused when they start their research and realize much of the information they require is missing. In most cases, books have had pages torn out. The tomes were vandalized by Odwald while in a frantic state, before he took <span class=\"hpp bold-green\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-npcs.Actor.yujmGvEvgnlNpsWf]{Mordane Swiftgale} (see Appendix B, pg. 203)</span> hostage and assumed his appearance.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As Librarian Swiftgale, Odwald now has access to all of the highly regulated books in a part of the College known as the lower library (see <span class=\"hpp bold-red\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-campaign-setting.VS0iVIiMTnwqZDs5.JournalEntryPage.5QiqH91WeyyjOGDF]{Into the Library}, pg. 139</span>). He can manipulate the records to account for missing books and place suspicion on others.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">During his research, Odwald has uncovered a frightening truth: the <span class=\"hpp bold-blue\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-beastiary.yCHIroWNOwHdh6EO]{aspect of fire}</span> is immortal, its energies have seeped into the Scorched Grove over centuries, creating a well of power it can use to reconstruct its form if it is ever destroyed. However, evidence of his earlier panicked search still remains, and Odwald worries that the heroes may use it to expose him.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The torn-out pages contain information necessary for the party to defeat the aspect of fire, but the players won’t be able to find this out until they discover Odwald’s secret chamber in the library, where he has been using the information he stole to plan a way to kill the aspect. Odwald has been dabbling in dangerous necromancy, and he’s created a <span class=\"hpp bold-blue\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-beastiary.60wefHduHk4SHFxI]{cobblefright}</span> to aid in his research, seeking to study its soul siphon ability in order to recreate the effect as a large-scale spell. If it works, such a spell might drain the vital energies that make the aspect immortal, ending its threat to the Wood once and for all. The cobblefright is a threat to all who currently live and study in the Avium, and the party will need to uncover Odwald’s secret laboratory and dangerous monster before he loses control of his creation.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">There are many pathways players can follow throughout this investigation, and many ways for the party to come across important information. The party doesn’t need to know everything to find out the location of Odwald’s lair, but the more they know, the more complete their picture of the happenings at the Avium will be. Because there are many connections players can make between different leads, clues, and avenues of investigation, some sections will cross-reference others that might be relevant.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the players are lost or unsure where to go, an NPC can deliver one or more of the following hints to move the narrative along:</p><ul class=\"hpp para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Only faculty members have access to tomes dealing with high-level or forbidden magic, and even then it’s solely intended for research purposes. Removing one of these dangerous books from the lower library, or practicing the knowledge they contain, is grounds for termination from the Avium.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">One tenured librarian, Mordane Swiftgale, has always been an odd one, but lately he’s been keeping to himself even more than usual.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Secret rooms were built into the Avium, and many remain undiscovered to this day.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">A lot of odd things seem to be happening in and around the lower library.

By the end of their time at the Avium players should know the following:</p><ul class=\"hpp para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">The aspect of fire is immortal. There is no known way to destroy it without it simply regenerating.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">The aspect of fire consumes living forests for energy.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">The aspect of fire is weakened by cold damage, which may cause it to cool and become immobilized.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">In the past, the aspect of fire was sealed away using a conjuration circle somewhere in the Grove.</li></ul>"

He’ll try to use a necromantic ritual ripped from one of the tomes he stole in an attempt to scare the party off. He’ll wait until the party members are absorbed in their tasks before acting. When no one is watching him, he will use <span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.tEpDmYZNGc9f5OhJ]{Greater Invisibility}</span> to move unseen and unheard between the large stacks, then cast the ritual slowly and quietly. Once Odwald completes the ritual, he’ll discard the useless ritual page in a place where the characters can find it, attempting to frame another necromancer on campus. If characters search the area where the shadows appeared, they will find the page. A <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check arcana 16 format=long]]</span> will reveal the dark runes scratched upon the parchment to be associated with particularly foul necromancy. All the magic in the runes has been spent.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Odwald’s ritual curses the characters, causing their <span class=\"hpp bold-purple\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.QGcQYZbVl4bWzi4E]{shadow}</span> to detach and become an undead creature in the character’s likeness. The shadows each attack the character to which they are closest, and if in an area of dim light they will use their bonus action to hide immediately before making their attack. Party members in the main areas of the library will be in conditions of bright light, while those between the shelves will be in areas of dim light. If anyone calls for help, Odwald, still disguised as Mordane, will hear it but ignore their pleas.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Once the shadows are defeated, Odwald will arrive and make excuses for his absence at the onset of battle. He’ll tell a story about having to return some terribly fragile evocation scrolls to a far-away section of the library. If any characters doubt this story, have them make opposed <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">Wisdom (Insight) checks</span> against Odwald’s <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">Charisma (Deception) check</span>. Odwald makes this check with advantage. He knows this library like the back of his talon and can easily lead the characters to the exact section where he placed the tomes earlier to set up this alibi.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If a party member succeeds, let it be known Mordane is hiding something, but don’t reveal exactly what. A good thing to note is that a party member’s success should put him on a list of potential suspects for the strange occurrences on campus, not force the final encounter early. If pressured, Odwald would likely keep up his ruse, and even call security on the party if they try a heavy-handed tactic like resorting to intimidation.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Regardless of the conversation, Odwald will ask if the party requires aid, and if any have been injured he will use his faculty amulet to contact Avium security and medics. The party members will be escorted to the infirmary, where healers will tend to their wounds and examine them with divination magic. The healers will ask any characters who’ve taken Strength damage to finish a short rest in the infirmary, to make sure the curse of undeath is fully purged. Characters should return to normal after completing a short or long rest.</p><aside class=\"hpp sidebar-primary\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-header\">Unmaking the Mystery</p><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-1\">This isn’t recommended, but should the decision be made to force the final encounter early—if the party isn’t the type for mysteries—this section will detail how they can proceed from this point.

He’s received odd reports from across campus, and believes them to be the result of some as yet undiscovered magical defense built into the Avium being accidentally triggered. He has a few leads that might help the party find out what’s happening. Normally, the Dean would trust such investigations to the Perch Guard, but he has so little to go on at this point that he’d rather not involve them if it turns out to be something minor. If the party mentions anything suspicious on the part of the faculty, the Dean will insist they gather sufficient proof first. He trusts his staff and will need hard evidence before he can even consider the possibility of one of them being to blame. The Dean outlines three leads for the party to follow-up on:</p><ul class=\"hpp para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">A poor student, <span class=\"hpp bold-green\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-npcs.Actor.jtB99gHhDtBd8d6j]{Figory Figgins} (see Appendix B, pg. 196)</span>, is a skittish jerbeen who recently applied for sick leave. He filed reports about experiencing something unusual and frightening on campus. Most people think he’s exaggerating to gain a medical exemption from classes, but the Dean believes something scared Figory. In truth, Figory was attacked by the <span class=\"hpp bold-blue\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-beastiary.60wefHduHk4SHFxI]{cobblefright}</span>, and was afflicted when it drained some of his vitality.

He’s a brilliant scholar, but also a bit of an oddball. It would be of great help if the party could check in and see what exactly the old corvum has predicted. It might be related to the events on campus.

On a failure, he won’t talk, and if the party continues to push he’ll ask them to leave immediately, warning the group that he will call for campus security if they don’t. If the party can get him to speak, this is the story Figory tells:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">“It was a cold night. It was raining.

Four big red eyes. It opened its mouth and… I think I passed out. When I woke up I felt sick, and it—it was just gone. You probably think I’m crazy… don’t you?”</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the party asks around to see if other students heard or saw anything, there will be no corroboration. It was raining heavily, and even Figory will admit to only being able to hear the creature faintly through the downpour. If anyone in the party casts detect magic on Figory they will find that he has a faint aura of necromancy about him, as though he was recently affected by necromantic magic.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Figory isn’t interested in getting too involved in the investigation. He explains that he has to focus on his health in order to be ready for the next semester, but it would be a great comfort to know the party has caught the creature he saw before it can hurt someone.

These are leftover from the transmutation magic Odwald used to cover up the damage done by his escaped cobblefright creation.

Such a character would also be able to tell that whoever covered up these markings wasn’t a specialist transmuter: there are differences in the way the magic was used here, and a true master of this magical school could have blended these markings seamlessly.

In this case, she will admit to some wrongdoing, but ask the party to keep her experiments a secret. As an expert on both the good and evil sides of necromancy, Professor Nightseed assures them that while her research is not strictly permitted, she is not using any sinister magics to achieve her results. She is simply researching ways to resurrect the dead at a lower cost of both materials and magical energy, and these experiments are key to crafting cutting-edge magics. The impressions remaining within the servitor skeletons may hold the solution to successfully completing her research.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If forced into combat, Professor Nightseed’s primary goal is to restrain the heroes and escape to call security.

The characters might not be aware of it yet, but every person they talk to will unwittingly provide a clue pointing toward Odwald’s involvement. Their continued investigation will push an already skittish Odwald over the edge, and prompt him to lay a trap for the party, hoping to put them out of commission for the rest of their stay at the Avium.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">A day after the party meets with Glinda Nightseed (if she was not arrested), or two days afterward (if she was arrested), a note will be slipped under the door of the party’s dormitory room.

You find yourself in an unusual woodland with several types of trees that don’t look quite right beside one another.

Some might even have been altered by magic. The central building has no door, simply a wide archway that leads into the interior of the domed structure. This is a museum, and behind glass panels the party can see fossils, as well as magical recreations of extinct plants. The west and east wing both contain fossils and skeletons of animals from different points in the natural history of Humblewood. The sound of chanting carries over from the east wing. When the party enters the east wing read the following:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">You see a shadow moving in the distance, and hear the sound of sharp footfalls on the smooth stone floor.

The retreating figure is an undisguised Odwald, who needed to be nearby to reanimate the skeletons. Odwald’s robes are enough to conceal his features, but any character within 5 feet of him will be able to tell he is a corvum. If anyone follows the sound of his footsteps, they will end up outside where they witness a dark hooded figure leap from the terrarium’s edge, feathered arms outstretched. Within a round, Odwald will use a scroll of <span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.yfbK8gZqESlaoY5t]{fly}</span> he has prepared to hide in the darkness within the rotating spires of the College.

Any character who succeeds on a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check investigation 16 format=long]]</span> will discover a scroll which was accidentally dropped by Odwald in his retreat. This heavy vellum scroll bears necromantic symbols. It is also clearly marked as material belonging in the lower library. A character can attempt a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check arcana 18 format=long]]</span> to decipher the spell, but a Wizard of the Necromancy Arcane Tradition rolls with advantage. On a success, the character will deduce that these sigils form a spell designed to control large numbers of simple undead, such as the Avium’s servitor skeletons. Characters who fail this check can take this scroll to Professor Nightseed (if she hasn’t been arrested) or to the Dean, either of whom will be able to decipher it and tell the party that this is scroll forbidden to leave the library.

An assortment of bones lays strewn across the tables, and foul-smelling liquids bubble in pots. The stench of death is gut-wrenching. A terrifying creature lurches towards you, a hulking monstrosity of bone and sinew. It appears to be comprised of hundreds of birdfolk bones, jumbled together to form a roughly humanoid shape. The arms end in several talons intertwined into circular claws, and the creature’s face is made from the top halves of two birdfolk skulls, one atop the other. It gazes at you with its four empty red eyes and emits a shriek.</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As long as Odwald is near, the cobblefright won’t go on the offensive unless the order is given, but it stands ready to defend itself or its master. Have Odwald say:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">“You don’t understand what you’re doing. Stay out of my way!”</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Given the chance, Odwald will explain his plans, detailing his creation of the cobblefright from deceased birdfolk, and telling of how he stole the information he needed to stop the aspect. The aspect is immortal, and the only sure way to defeat it for good is to drain its vital energies through necromancy. To Odwald, stopping the aspect is worth any risk. He is condescending to the party at every opportunity. He is arrogant, and doesn’t think the Defenders of Alderheart could possibly understand what he sees as necessary steps to stop the aspect. He is also deeply afraid for the future of the Wood, and doesn’t believe the party can be trusted to defeat the aspect on their own.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Depending on if the party hears him out or not, it may be possible to talk Odwald out of moving forward with his plan. Even if they may not be able to argue logic with Odwald, he might listen if the party can make an emotional appeal. Though Odwald acts as if his plan has been well-considered, he is entirely motivated by fear, and he hasn’t actually given himself time to think through the consequences of his actions. Any character who can convince him that he’s not thinking clearly may help him recognize his folly.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the party manages to reason with him, create tension by having Odwald lose control of the cobblefright just as he is about to surrender quietly. Fearing for his life, Odwald’s cowardice will compel him to flee, apologizing as he leaves the party to fight his mistake. Though, if reasoned with, Odwald will return after the battle to face his demons, and offer to let the party turn him in to the Dean.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the party attacks Odwald, or fails to reason with him, he will order the cobblefright to hold them off while he flees. Though he intends for the cobblefright to do this nonlethally, the creature’s corrupted and evil nature will cause it to attack with maximum violence.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Should the players have difficulty with this fight, have Odwald experience a change of heart and come back to assist against the cobblefright. With this change of heart, Odwald will allow the party to turn him over to the authorities.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If a character attempts to capture a retreating Odwald, allow the character following him as he flees to try and catch up to him, but give Odwald a 60-foot head-start. Odwald won’t bother attacking his pursuer unless it’s absolutely necessary to avoid capture. Instead, he will turn invisible and attempt to lose any character chasing him in the winding passageways.</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-yellow\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-header-3\">TREASURE</p><p class=\"hpp para-1\">The Defenders of Alderheart are celebrated for uncovering Odwald’s scheme and putting a stop to his creation before things got any worse.

The Avium is home to the only teleportation circle in Humblewood, which is a closely-guarded secret.

At the Dean’s behest, any banned characters may be granted restricted, temporary access to the Avium. The Avium will still provide any aid the Defenders of Alderheart might require to quell the threat of the aspect, but only under strict supervision.

However, as Odwald explains the gravity of the situation, the Dean will take a moment to consider. Odwald will mention his research has yielded results: if the aspect can’t be destroyed, the party may be able to re-seal it in such a way that its harmful energies are contained. It’s a long shot, but he knows a seer of great talent, who can help them find an item that could theoretically be used to stop the aspect.

She reached down to confirm and pulled back in pain immediately. Her feathers were seared slightly. The season had been unusually dry, but this was a frightening temperature. After a closer look, it seemed like the ground was glowing.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">CRACK! Leya’s eyes went to the sound. The large tree she’d played in as a child had fallen, and smoke rose from its remains. “Go!” her mind yelled, and she listened, rushing towards home. “Get to them before—”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Suddenly, flames burst forth, travelling at an unearthly velocity towards Leya’s perch. Her perch meant the world to her, but in the vast expanse of the Wood it was small and unimportant. Too insignificant for a Perch Guard outpost of its own. Her heart tightened knowing the remote settlement wouldn’t be warned in time, and that aid would not be close by.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Leya’s hands began to move without thought as she whispered the words of her grandmother. It wouldn’t be enough, but she wouldn’t be able to live with herself if she didn’t try. When taught to her, the spell was meant to help farms through rainless seasons. It wasn’t intended to be used defensively. Droplets of a lost cause formed between her fingers.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Conjured water fell to the ground, evaporating as soon as it hit the steaming forest floor. As she concentrated, a strong warm gust touched Leya’s face. It’s Altus, it must be! Leya thought. The Amaranthine of storms was bringing rain to quench this hateful wildfire. She looked to the sky, frantically searching for more signs of changing weather.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Barely able to register what she saw, her arms dropped to her sides in defeat. Flying balls of fire were filling up the sky. A swarm broke off, headed in her direction. Leya sank to her knees, hoping with her last thoughts that someone would save Humblewood before it all burned.</p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Free Resources</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\">To supplement your Humblewood adventure, handouts, maps, tools and more are available at: <a href=\"https://hitpointpress.com/collections/free-content\">HUMBLEWOOD.COM/RESOURCES</a></p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Running the Campaign</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The following chapter contains a full adventure set in Humblewood that takes characters from levels 1 to 5.

It is a mystical, secluded place that gets by quite well without much trade from the outside world, due to the fertility of the soil and an abundance of natural resources. The Wood has many skilled workers and artisans, and this, coupled with the supply of raw materials, makes Humblewood a great exporter.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Wood has a diverse population, but the true power in Humblewood are the birdfolk. At the heart of their nation lies the great capital of Alderheart. The seat of commerce, art, and political power in the region, Alderheart has long been a refuge for those seeking fame, fortune, or protection.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Players will encounter some locations that are not extensively explained in this chapter. It is recommended that the information in the <span class=\"hpp bold-red\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-campaign-setting.Q6BBp6uGgs9KHDYN]{Traversing the Wood} (pg. 76)</span> chapter be used to help players understand their surroundings.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hp bold-italic\">Monster and NPC Cards</span>.

For ease of play, the adventure has been structured with the milestone leveling rules in mind. Characters will level up automatically at the end of key story moments. For those groups using the standard XP rewards, there are experience point rewards for the social, puzzle, and other non-combat encounters provided alongside the milestone rewards. Otherwise, award standard XP for defeated foes as the players progress through the adventure.</p><h3 class=\"hpp header-3\">Overview</h3><p class=\"hpp para-2\">There have been disturbing signs over the last few months, signalling that something is wrong in Humblewood. The troubles appear to originate from activity in the Scorched Grove, an ashen plain that was ravaged many centuries ago by a destructive fire. Whatever caused the fire has scarred the land with elemental magic, making it inhospitable to all but strange fire-based creatures. Of late, the Grove has begun to expand. At first, it was hard to notice the slow expansion, but those in tune with nature (especially the Tenders) could see the imbalance in the elemental forces of Humblewood. For many common folk, this imbalance has been experienced as unseasonal dryness, which has led to crop failure and an increased frequency of forest fires. There have also been a number of unusually aggressive emberbat clouds reported far outside of their natural ranges.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The true nature of the danger still remains hidden from the people of the Wood. A corvum necromancer named <span class=\"hpp bold-green\">Odwald Ebonhart (see @UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-campaign-setting.JournalEntry.aItGsmTwgPMr0cjC]{Appendix B}, pg. 194)</span> has stirred the elemental <span class=\"hpp bold-blue\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-beastiary.yCHIroWNOwHdh6EO]{aspect of fire}</span>, which has lain dormant beneath the Scorched Grove since its first burning. The aspect’s energies have begun to empower fire-based creatures within the Wood. The increased range of emberbat swarms have brought fires that have expanded the Grove. Many forest-dwellers, who have been left without homes, have turned to banditry to survive. Soon the elemental incarnation will break free, and players must find a way to stop the aspect of fire before it reduces the Wood to ashes.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Gaspard-Party-Transparant.webp\" />"

While military monikers are used to refer to bandit leadership, more than combat prowess is needed to maintain order in these volatile organizations. A dominating personality and charismatic voice are as necessary as a swift blade and a sharp mind.

Benna lived a tranquil village life until her mother, a respected village elder and seer, foretold that the flames would come. Word was sent to Alderheart’s Council, asking for supplies and aid, both of which were denied because the Council didn’t believe in the power of the seer’s visions. When the flames had all but consumed the village, birdfolk support arrived, but it was too late. Benna lost her family. She also lost her left eye and left ear due to the burns she sustained while helping others escape from the blaze.

The promise of seeing lost loved ones again, or raising an army of powerful minions, can sometimes be difficult to resist. The birdfolk of Humblewood are not immune to that lure. To help curb this curiosity, professors at The Avium teach necromantic theory only. But some intrepid students have been known to pursue the practical applications in secret.

Odwald has a sharp mind but a faint heart. A member of the illustrious Ebonhart family, a noble house that dates back to the founding of Alderheart, Odwald was an arcane prodigy who grew up in a world which expected him to be brilliant. While magic always came naturally to him, the pressure of his family’s expectations weighed heavily upon him, and filled him with a deep-seated fear of failure. Months ago, he was tricked by an unknown entity into weakening the seal that held the aspect of fire beneath the Scorched Grove. Ever since he has blamed himself for the worsening conditions in the Wood. He has no solution for stopping the aspect, and this terrifies him. Shortly after saving his friend Riffin, desperation drove him back to his alma mater, the Avium, where he has since worked with forbidden magics in secrecy. Using a secret door he discovered during his time as a student, Odwald converted several inaccessible and defunct classrooms into a makeshift laboratory where he toils tirelessly, experimenting with dark and dangerous magics in the hopes of discovering a way to stop the aspect.

Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society.

After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there.

She represents a serious threat to the party, but won’t take interest in them unless she has a reason to believe the characters are a worthy challenge.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Assuming the party doesn’t want to fight, the bandits will leave if bribed. They are reasonable robbers, and will gladly relinquish the cart if the party can offer a worthy sum. Negotiations start with Fray evaluating the cart’s contents. She and her crew will simply walk away for 10 gp each. Players can roll <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">opposed Charisma (Deception) or (Persuasion) checks</span> against a Wisdom check made by Fray to negotiate for a lower price, but the bandits won’t leave for anything less than 5 gp each.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Believing they have the upper hand, the bandits won’t hesitate to attack if they sense trepidation or suspect that the party might be up to something. Any threats or posturing from the characters will be met with an attack from the three mapach bandits. This fight shouldn’t be too difficult, as the party likely outnumbers the bandits and are probably better equipped.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Fray will stay back and let the party fight the bandits for a round or two. She will intervene after two rounds or when a bandit is brought down. Fray will target the character who looks to be the most capable in single combat. If the party is larger than four players, she will engage in combat from the start, ordering her underlings to deal with the others.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Vulpin-Captain-Fray.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp image-name-caption\">Fray</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">Joining the fight, the bandit captain says, “Intriguing. You look like you might actually give me a proper fight!” The vulpin smirks and draws her blade, tracing intricate patterns in the air as she rushes into battle.</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Fray is a deadly foe, but she wasn’t prepared to have her heist interrupted. She won’t risk her life needlessly if the odds turn against her. If at least two of the mapach bandits go down, she will make a tactical retreat into the dense forest, where she can easily disappear in the foliage. While escaping, she will swear revenge and leave any unfortunate underlings to the party’s mercy.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The terrain is difficult for the party, but not for Fray, who is familiar with the area. Any character trying to pursue Fray on foot will quickly lose her in the forest unless they can make a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check perception 15 format=long]]</span> each round. The dense forest also makes gliding difficult. Most birdfolk can’t glide through the trees, but Small birdfolk characters can attempt to glide after Fray, avoiding trunks and branches with a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check acrobatics 15 format=long]]</span>.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Failure on either the Wisdom or Dexterity check means the character has lost sight of Fray and ends the chase for that character. A character successfully chasing Fray through the woods means the party catches up with her, at which point she will surrender. If four rounds have passed since her retreat, the party has lost Fray.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Should the party choose to try and locate Fray by continuing down the road, they will arrive at a clearing where a river separates them from a dense forest on the other side. A heavy log sits with one end on riverbank and the other end in the water, preventing the party from crossing the river and chasing Fray.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the party continues through any forest terrain, they will need to make regular survival checks to avoid becoming lost in the trees. Use the <span class=\"bold-red\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-encounter-rt.RollTable.t3ui5wGQihQDw9v1]{Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)} table (pg. 216)</span> for an especially persistent group. Make it clear that the vulpin has made her getaway, covering her tracks well enough that following her is fruitless.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the encounter should go horribly awry, the bandits won’t bother capturing the party or finishing them off. Rather, they will retreat, stealing as much from the hand-cart as they can carry. After all, the bandits aren’t sure there won’t be reinforcements coming to the rescue. If a player consents, their character can earn a scar from their battle with Fray in order to heighten anticipation for the rematch later.</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-yellow\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-header-3\">TREASURE</p><p class=\"hpp para-1\">The mapach bandits are wearing worn leather armor and each one carries a poorly-kept short sword.

We throw dice onto surfaces made of trees whose history we are woefully clueless of. Did the tree have a story, or a family of owls living in it, or a fox kit that sheltered a storm beneath its branches? We don’t know these tales as we weave our own, but the connection is still there. We’re still tromping through the wilderness and smelling the fresh air and fearing its dangers, even if it’s in our imagination. </p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Storytelling on its own has always been connected to nature. Legends of animals as gods or animals as human-like protagonists permeate all cultures. The Native American stories of the trickster Raven, the Medieval fable of the Owl and the Nightingale, or something as obvious and simple as Grimm’s Fairy Tales are all examples of how the natural world around us has shaped storytelling. The magic of animals and their usually unseen lives intrigues us, sparks our imagination, and we see a lot of ourselves in them when we finally slow down enough to look. Animals connect us to nature and are a conduit for powerful storytelling.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">This is why I believe roleplaying games have had such a resurgence in the past few years, because we’re looking for a connection to the world around us. We’re looking for a way to get away from screens, to forget about our complicated lives, and to live as heroes with problems we can solve, not just listen to on the news and worry about. We can help people, we can be heroes, and we have magic. Even in the imagination, these things are incredibly powerful.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">In Humblewood, we’re going back to our roots as storytellers, using nature and the animals around us to adventure in a world of fantasy. We have so much technology surrounding us every day, getting out into nature isn’t an option for many. Our jobs are time consuming, our lives are hard and complicated, our food is grown in places we will never see and sits on a shelf for our consumption wrapped in plastic. These things disconnect us from the story of nature, from the story of life and the changing of seasons and our connection to the world around us. In reality, even the humble pigeon has an interesting life, we just don’t see it as we pass them on city streets without giving them a second look.</p><img style=\"border:0px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Strix.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp para-2\">I’ve loved birds since I can remember, they’ve always been how I connected to nature. I’ve rescued birds since I was 10 and I’ve worked with the smallest of hummingbirds to the massive moody, Red Tailed hawk named Ivan whose mew I cleaned in college. When I lived in Los Angeles, I began rescuing pigeons because they were everywhere, forgotten pets of colonists and invasive to the habitat they lived in. These birds were smart, funny, and ignored by almost every animal shelter you took them to. They were the lost and forgotten of the animal world, and that’s why I fell in love with them. They had stories to tell, and every one of them has their own personality and quirks.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Humans are not that different from animals. If we pay attention to them, we can understand them, save them, live with them, and honor them. The more compassion we have for animals the better our world will be. Telling their stories is just as important as telling our own, and helps us connect to and have compassion for the other creatures on our planet. So I encourage you to make your own legends in Humblewood, and then go to the forest and see them for yourself. Maybe they’ll have a story of their own to tell you, too.</p><p class=\"hpp para-1\"><span class=\"mpp bold\">Holly Conrad</span></p><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Holly%20Conrad-Signature.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"147\" /><p class=\"hpp para-1\">Twitter: @HollyConrad <br />Twitch: @commanderholly</p>"

The driving force behind Humblewood as a concept was the desire to create a visually compelling world that felt alive, and that meant a world that could feel wonderful and welcoming, magical and mysterious. It also meant a world full of secrets, hidden dangers, and obstacles for a party of adventurers to overcome.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">When I was young, the films and books I devoured with the most enthusiasm were the ones that appealed to audiences both young and old, whose characters may happen to be adorable woodland animals, but still bravely explored a mosaic of complex, confronting themes that we continue to puzzle over well into our adult years. These are the stories that left a significant impression on me, that I continue to revisit to this day.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Roleplaying games are wonderful for many reasons, one being that they can provide a form of escape, or they can mirror reality. They can help us understand and process experiences in our own lives through an entirely different lens, and they give you a unique kind of freedom to be whoever or whatever you want to be, options for which there is no shortage in Humblewood—whether you are a sneaky mapach, a brave little strig, or a cunning corvum with a secret heart of gold, the only limit, as ever, is your imagination.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As artists we have to give careful consideration to every facet of the world, certainly the designs of our main characters and our myriad of monsters, but also what a character’s home might look like, what kind of fabrics they might wear, and how should we design this bottle of vintage vulpin-crafted elderberry wine? We have illustrated forests flooded with beams of light, tangled and treacherous swamps you must battle your way through with determination, and cosy interiors where you can almost smell the jerbeen-sized loaves baking in the oven. The love is very often in the details, just as some of the most significant moments in a campaign can be the quiet ones, the small words exchanged at the campfire, or the tiny clues indicating a much larger mystery to unravel.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Creating this project has been an unforgettable journey, full of as many surprises, twists and turns as the overgrown paths of Humblewood itself. I have had an affinity for nature and animals my entire life, which has been my primary source of inspiration for much of my personal work. I remember when I first sat down and sketched the first iteration of a brave little knight owl, who we have now named Riffin, and I could never have imagined in that moment how the idea behind this little owl would evolve into a fully realised world, lovingly crafted by our team of designers, writers and artists, for players to explore.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">I am beyond excited for you all to take your first steps into this world, uncover some of its secrets during your adventures, experience its stories, and come away with many of your own stories to tell!</p><img style=\"border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Leesha-Hannigan_Signature.webp\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /><p class=\"hpp para-1\"><span class=\"hpp bold\">Leesha Hannigan</span>, <br />Art Director</p><p class=\"hpp para-1\"><br />Twitter: @LeeshaHannigan</p><p class=\"hpp para-1\"> </p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Knight-Owl.webp\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" />"

This is the Humblewood, an ancient and magical place that hums an endless song, sung to the Great Rhythm of life and death. The Wood, as it is known to its inhabitants, is not like any other forest. The trees are old and powerful, with rare specimens that reach as tall as small mountains. Here familiar beasts grow to unusual sizes, bearing markings and patterns unique to the Wood. This region is also home to two groups of animal-like humanoid races, the birdfolk and the humblefolk. Together they share the Wood and its bountiful resources.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">In the early years, the birdfolk and humblefolk lived close to each other in small villages around the forest. These isolated communities were vulnerable to an organization of brigands and marauders who called themselves the “Bandit Coalition.” To protect themselves from the Coalition, the birdfolk built fortified cities in the forest’s canopy. Joining forces with the humblefolk, the birdfolk army, known as the “Perch Guard”, drove back the bandits, bringing peace and security to the region. Over time, birdfolk culture spread, and the capital city of Alderheart became the most politically influential place in the Wood.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">But the Wood has also known sorrow. Not long after the founding of Alderheart, a massive forest fire known as “The Great Calamity” burned a portion of the Wood. The origins of the fire are unknown, but it left the area permanently damaged. To this day, it is called the “Scorched Grove,” an arid field of ash that has since become home to many strange flame-infused creatures.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Tenders, an organization of druids and mystics, dedicate themselves to healing the Scorched Grove with natural magics. Set up in conclaves around the Wood, they provide aid whenever forest fires strike. Yet, since the Grove’s burning, the Wood has known relatively few fires. Nature’s balance, though, can be disrupted by a single spark.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Recently, fires have begun to rage through the Wood with a strength and fury not seen since ages past. Forest-dwellers are again being displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in Alderheart, and perch-dwellers are doing what they can to keep themselves safe up in their canopy sanctuaries. Relations between the humblefolk and birdfolk are tense. Moreover, a newly invigorated Bandit Coalition swells in numbers. Its sights are set upon Alderheart, where those displaced by the flames seek a means of survival.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">You are a citizen of the Wood, caught up in this turmoil. Or perhaps you are a storyteller from another world. Either way, the future of the Wood is yours to write. Within this book you will find all the tools you need to build your character, travel the land, and create your own Humblewood story.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Whether or not Humblewood is able to survive the flames is up to you. Go forth and adventure! Only you can restore balance to the Wood.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"> </p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tiny-Owl.webp\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" />"

I recommend you make yourselves comfortable and enjoy the splendor of the city.” After a short pause, Gregor raises his head and continues, “But, if you are interested, and are willing to hear me out, I might ‘accidentally’ submit your request ahead of the others. These things do happen, you know.”</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the party agrees to help, the Magistrate will tell them about a group of jerbeens that have been causing trouble around the trunk’s market district. People down there have been filing complaints, and he would like to see the matter dealt with. Supposing the party can ensure Gregor never has to hear about this problem again, he’ll grant them an early audience with the Council.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">You can have the party come up with their own solution for finding the jerbeens, but if they’re stuck, advise them that asking around the market might be an easy way to locate them. Inquiring around the market will require a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check investigation 13 format=long]]</span>, which will lead the party straight to the jerbeen hideout on a success. A failure will require another hour of searching before coming across someone who knows where the hideout is.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">There are four jerbeens, all of them siblings.

The other three, being far less skilled, use the stat block for a bandit, but halve the bandit’s hit points (add jerbeen traits to these NPCs if desired).

A <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check persuasion 14 format=long]]</span> will convince them their current lifestyle is too dangerous, but it won’t solve their problems. Have the characters roleplay to find a solution. Any character with a background that grants them connections to a temple, business, or other such institutions in the city could likely help the jerbeen orphans secure work.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The party can give the young thieves some gold, solving their financial problems temporarily. Any amount of gold will help them for a time: five gold pieces will provide the siblings enough security to look for honest work, while a payment of one gold piece could result in the jerbeens resorting to stealing again, once the gold runs out. In the latter situation, the characters may cross paths with the Magistrate later, at which point he will report that “The thieves are at it again!”</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The orphans can also simply be fought. If one or more of them are reduced to 0 hit points, the rest will flee. This humbling experience could result in them aligning with the bandits to survive. The Magistrate may never hear from the orphans again, but the party might meet the jerbeen orphans again during an encounter with bandits.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Whatever the party decides to do, after confirming the player’s actions through some of his connections in the city, the Magistrate will tell the party they can expect to have their audience granted the following day.</p>"

As you approach, you notice they are connected to a squat and sturdy fortress, which stands in lonely vigil among the crags. A few distant shapes can be seen patrolling the parapets, and banners with the crest of the Bandit Coalition hang proudly from the walls.</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Entering the fortress proper will be a challenge. It has 100-foot-high stone walls with guard posts stationed around the perimeter. Behind the perimeter, the fortress opens into a square, 120-foot-long inner courtyard consisting of barracks and training areas. A narrow wagon-road leads from the north of the courtyard to a wooden palisade with a set of double doors. Beyond that, a meeting hall has been dug into the mountain itself, and serves as the inner keep.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Connecting the courtyard to the outside is a single large entrance on the front wall: a massive wooden door behind an iron portcullis, which can be lowered like a drawbridge for wagons. A smaller, 5-foot-wide door to the side allows for single-file entry and is guarded by two well-armored mapachs who are big for their kind. These two each use the stat block for a <span class=\"hpp bold-blue\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-npcs.Actor.L7REDEtUwrikNYeP]{mapach bandit (adjusted stats)}</span> that includes the following changes:</p><ul class=\"hpp para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\"><p>They have 21 HP each</p></li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\"><p>They have a Strength score of 14 (an additional +1 to attack rolls)</p></li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\"><p>They are wearing chain mail (AC 16)</p></li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\"><p>They are wielding greataxes (1d12 + 2 damage per hit)</p></li></ul><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Storming this entrance will almost certainly raise an alarm and incur attacks from the four archers walking the walls (use the stat block for a mapach bandit). The archers each benefit from three-quarters cover thanks to the parapets. Even though the stat block of the mapach bandit can be used for many of the least-skilled members of the camp, they come from a variety of humblefolk races. Hedges, cervans, jerbeens, and vulpins can all be found within their ranks.</p><aside class=\"hpp sidebar-primary\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-header\">Captured!</p><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-1\">There are many ways things could go badly for a party of adventurers here. If by chance they are overwhelmed by bandits, remember that Benna won’t necessarily want them dead. She’ll want to question them first, so the party will be placed in the fortress’ prison until she’s satisfied she has the answers she wants. If Benna has any reason to believe some of the characters are valuable hostages, she’ll happily keep them alive in order to ransom them to the Birdfolk Council at Alderheart and continue filling the Coalition’s coffers. If any of the party members are humblefolk, she might even try to convince them to join the Coalition. Birdfolk have had power in these lands for too long. If the character accepts her offer, once her plan to get revenge on the Council is complete, she’ll be sure they share in the spoils.</p></aside>"

The bandit ranks have grown steadily over the last few months, and new arrivals to the fortress are common. A birdfolk can attempt to bluff their way in, but this will be a little more challenging, requiring a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check deception 14 format=long]]</span> to fool the bandits. A few “odd birds” have sided with the bandits, but their numbers are low enough to make the guards suspicious. Unless they are being introduced as “prisoners” rounded up by the humblefolk, birdfolk characters infiltrating the base will need to be careful of catching Benna’s eye.

While there aren’t many bandits here who would recognize it as Fray’s sword, any character openly wearing this weapon will need to be careful around Benna. She knows her captains well, and this will draw immediate suspicion.</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While the fortress walls are high, they are still surmountable with at least 100 feet of rope and a grappling hook, but the party will need to approach this option with caution. Spending a few hours on a stakeout will reveal the guard patrol patterns well enough to attempt to infiltrate the fortress with advantage on the <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check stealth 15]] group check</span> required to avoid the sentries.

She also blames them for the suffering of all those who have lost their homes to the flames, as the Council has chosen to hide behind the bastion of Alderheart instead of reaching out to help folk in need. However, Benna has begun to find solace in the act of caring for others. Building a community here, using her combat experience to teach others to defend themselves, and inspiring the once hopeless people of the Wood has ignited a passion within her, and she desperately wants to do right by her people.

The party will need to spend some time convincing the Council of the good Benna has done, and the benefits of treating with her and her organization. It will take some heated discussion, but the Council members will consent to meeting with her provisionally. After hearing Benna’s story, the Council’s disposition will soften. They will agree on the need to provide aid to the humblefolk who have lost their homes to the fire.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Bandit Coalition will keep control of the fortress. Either Benna will retain command, or she’ll support a new leader being appointed for the Coalition—this could be the characters (if they so choose), or someone selected from among Benna’s captains. The Council will work with whoever leads the Coalition, provided the party (if they don’t take over themselves) can vouch for the leader’s good intentions and agrees to keep them in line. Spurred by a new purpose, the criminal elements of the Coalition will be put to an end, and the organization will turn into a relief network for those displaced by the fires.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">With the Coalition’s supply networks and Alderheart’s resources working together, response times for relief efforts will be greatly improved. While some members of the Coalition will abandon the cause for their own gains, many will be willing to help it transition into an organization dedicated to helping fight the spreading fires and provide relief and shelter to those in need. The Birdfolk Council will release a decree: they will become the Humblewood Council, and new representatives from major humblefolk villages in the regions and within Alderheart itself will be added to their numbers, effectively giving humblefolk across the Wood a voice in governance for the first time. This significant change will take the span of the adventure to resolve, but by the end, the Humblewood Council will lead the way to a new era of unity in Humblewood. Now dedicated to peace, Benna will show her gratitude by presenting the party with the blade of the wood* she once wielded.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">If Benna was killed</span>, between losing their camp near Alderheart and their mountain stronghold, the Coalition will be dealt a heavy blow and the bandit menace will no longer pose the same threat to the region. Many will lose hope and desert without Benna, but others will see her as a martyr and rally under a surviving captain. Members will work from safehouses in the forests, doing their best to keep the Coalition command structure intact, and continue to cause problems for the Wood after the events of this adventure. Perhaps peace can be achieved someday, when the wounds of losing their beloved leader aren’t so fresh. But, without Benna, the Coalition won’t trust or treat with outsiders.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Once the bandit general has been defeated, the Council will send an armed force to secure the stronghold. Should the players wish, this could become their base of operations. The Council will happily grant this boon to the party as they have proven themselves to be valuable allies and defenders of the realm. A small contingent of guards and hirelings from the Birdfolk Council will oversee the upkeep and protection of the fortress while the party is away.

We hope you will hear our pleas and offer us your aid in this most dire of circumstances.”</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Speaker Bita continues by describing clouds of emberbats, in larger numbers than have ever been seen. She speaks of strange fire creatures sighted in the Wood, and how they have injured many travelers. She then talks about the missing Tenders and the reports of a huge, unknown creature stalking the ash plains of the Grove. Something must be done, which is why the Council has called upon the help of the Defenders of Alderheart. Bita offers whatever information she can, but this creature is a new discovery and the Council has little to go on.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tevor is called up before the head table. He was the most recent Tender to encounter the massive beast in the Grove. He recalls seeing the ash of the plains seize up, as if something were burrowing through. The creature never broke the surface, so he was unable to get a good look at it. It must have grabbed his instructor, though, as Tevor saw him get sucked under the ash. Tevor ran, until he was safe on the edge of the Scorched Grove.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tevor is obviously shaken after the account, but Havel places a hand on his shoulder, which seems to comfort him.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tevor points out on a map where this most recent sighting took place. Bita will mention that the Grove is a dangerous place, and ask Havel to look for someone to guide the party. At first, Tevor simply raises his hand to speak. It’s clear that he is conflicted and his fear is getting the better of him. Despite this, he’ll firmly state that he will guide the party to where he last saw the creature.

He’ll also add that such entities are only found in the deepest parts of the Grove, and it’s unheard of to see one so far from the Grove itself. The Tenders are taught to leave them be, as they will dissipate once they have fulfilled their purpose, which usually consists of re-enacting a memory from the life of the victim.

Make this check easier or harder depending on how well players did on the first check. If players succeed at this check, their character flees at a sufficiently quick pace to avoid being in range of the creature’s attacks. Particularly dire failures on this check could result in characters falling <span class=\"hpp-enricher-noindent\">&amp;Reference[prone]</span>.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As the aspect marches, it indiscriminately hurls massive boulders of magma and rock into the forest.

Either way, many volunteers, both humblefolk and birdfolk, will sign up to help quell the still-raging flames and assist those injured in the blaze. The party can choose whether or not they wish to aid in this effort, but nobody will begrudge them if they need to rest after their ordeal.</p><img style=\"border:0\" title=\"Around the Campfire\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Heroes-Campfire.webp\" /><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-yellow\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-header-3\">TREASURE</p><p class=\"hpp para-1\">The party will be given a special requisition from the Council to aid in fulfilling their mission to stop the creature. Characters will be able to use this unassuming piece of parchment, stamped with the seal of Alderheart, to requisition up to <span class=\"hpp bold\">500 gp</span> worth of equipment from any shop in the city. This can be used in separate stores, or all at the same place. Likewise, it can be used to pay for a portion of an item, such as a weapon or piece of armor, with the rest needing to be paid in coin.</p><p class=\"hpp para-1\">In order to obtain this discount players must explain how the requisitioned goods will aid them in their mission.

This can be altered with a difficult skill check using a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.cG3m4YlHfbQlLEOx]{forgery kit}. However, modifying the document constitutes thievery, and any character caught doing this will be arrested and brought before the Council to face punishment.</p><p class=\"hpp para-1\">Characters will also be rewarded with a <span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-items.mYGOmQmv3doaYifH]{feathered helm}</span>* from the Tenders for their good work.
