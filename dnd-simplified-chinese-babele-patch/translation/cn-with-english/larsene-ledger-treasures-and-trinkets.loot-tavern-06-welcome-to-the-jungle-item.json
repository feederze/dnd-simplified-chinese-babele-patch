Made from a shapeshifting species of carnivorous plants, this red and green cloak pulses, moving around your body of its own accord. Yet the metamorphosis is far from perfect; this cloak constantly hungers for flesh.</p><p><i><b>Lunch Break.</b></i> As an action, you can put the cloak on a flat, nonmagical surface up to 5 feet wide and 10 feet long. It adapts to the surface and matches its appearance. If a creature uses its action to examine the area the cloak is in, the creature can spot the hidden carnivorous item with a successful <b>DC 15 Wisdom (<span id=\"was-tagged\">Perception</span>)</b> check. If a creature enters the space occupied by the cloak, it must make a <b>DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</b>, taking <b>[[/r 3d10]]</b> piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Afterwards, or if a creature that has spotted the item uses its action to make a <b>DC 15 Dexterity check</b>, the cloak shifts and detaches from the surface. You automatically succeed on this check.</p><p><i><b>Take-Out.</b></i> When a creature enters a space within <b>10 feet</b> of you, you can use your reaction to have the cloak pounce and wrap around the creature if the cloak is within 10 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a <b>DC 15 Strength (<span id=\"was-tagged\">Athletics</span>)</b> or <b>Dexterity (<span id=\"was-tagged\">Acrobatics</span>)</b> check or become <b><span id=\"was-tagged\">grappled</span></b> (<b>escape DC 15</b>) by the cloak.

When a creature frees itself, the cloak falls to the ground and moves <b>10 feet</b> closer to you at the start of each of your turns, until it reaches you. Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><i><b>Curse.</b></i> The cloak must feast on the corpse of at least one Small or larger creature every 24 hours. Failing to do so causes it to slowly digest you during a long rest. When you finish a long rest, you recover one less Hit Die and take <b>[[/r 2d6]]</b> acid damage upon waking up. Removing the cloak fails to end the curse and it always seems to find its way back to you by the end of a long rest.</p>"
