Arnulf intends to stage a fake assault on the Banites surrounding the arena, drawing away defenders and creating a window for the characters to infiltrate the arena.</p><p><em><strong>Infiltrate the Arena. </strong></em>The Ashen Faithful control the region around the arena.

A human, Faenzel the Exalted Flame (Medium, Lawful Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultistHierop]{Cultist Hierophant}</strong>), exhorts followers in the stands from the northern skybox as two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGladiator0000]{Gladiators}</strong> prepare prisoners in the middle of the arena.

The Zhentarim has found the site’s location.</p><p><strong>Hook. </strong>Folavani Ladril, a wood elf scout and Harper, tried to defend the tomb but had to flee. Exhausted and due to report to her leaders, she asks the characters to go to the tomb and bring back the cursed items.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Site Features.</strong></em> The site, its magic weakened but unbroken, has endured more than a century. Harpers left various clues in each area; a character who takes a &amp;Reference[Study] action and succeeds on a [[/skill 13 history]] check recognizes a Harper clue’s meaning.</p><p><em><strong>Entryway.</strong></em> Zhents found the tomb, its door hidden in a small cave. Signs of an explosion (caused by a discharged <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGlyphofWar]{Glyph of Warding} </em>spell) mar the cave and the broken doorway, once carved as a graceful tree. Zhentarim corpses lie scattered on the floor. A <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWraith0000000]{Wraith}</strong> drifts out of the tomb and initiates combat.</p><p><em><strong>Nethertide Leavings.</strong></em> Orc equipment and bones form a pile near a bronze floor plate that reads, in Common, “Along Selûne’s path they did walk, leaving no stone unturned.” This is a Harper clue, and a character who recognizes it knows it refers to “Moonlight Paean,” a famous ballad. A character who recites the ballad causes silver light to bathe the chamber, revealing a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgShieldOfMissi]{Shield of Missile Attraction}</em> and a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.equipment.Item.dmgSwordOfVengea]{Sword of Vengeance}</em> lying among the bones. Other treasures and art objects here amount to a CR 4 random treasure hoard. Disturbing these items without first reciting the ballad causes bones to animate and ambush the characters (two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSwarmOfCrawli]{Swarms of Crawling Claws}</strong> and seven <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCrawlingClaw0]{Crawling Claws}</strong>).</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Silver Light</h3><p>A Light is pre-placed in the Scene and can be toggled to bathe the room in silver light.</p></article></section><p><em><strong>Dragon Statue.</strong></em> Two pressure plates trigger this @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgFirecastingSt]{fire-casting statue} (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.content.JournalEntry.dmgDmsToolbox000.JournalEntryPage.RLB1MPQRqYDR0CtI#fire-casting-statue]{chapter 3} of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>). A wall carving of a musician playing, notes issuing from his lute while he dances around the statue, is a Harper clue. Characters who recognize it know the tune depicted: “Coggin’s Reel.” Playing or humming this tune disarms the trap.</p><p><em><strong>Tomb.</strong></em> This stone coffin is locked with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplArcaneLock]{Arcane Lock}</em> spell. Its lid reads, in Elvish, “To shine a light on the future.” This is a Harper clue. A character who recognizes it knows the response: “Study the past.” This phrase is the password for the arcane lock. Within the coffin is <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgDemonArmor000]{Demon Armor}</em> that animates and fights; use the stat block for a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCambion000000]{Cambion}</strong>. If the proper phrase was spoken, the armor starts the combat &amp;Reference[Bloodied].</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> Folavani helps remove curses from cursed characters.

Use the table in @UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifCh3DmsToolbox.JournalEntryPage.9ssPanaCADIxmuSY#wilderness-encounters]{Wilderness Encounters} earlier in this chapter for one encounter as they travel. At the prison, they take custody of Vargrazt the Wretch.</p><p><em><strong>A Violent Rite.</strong></em> On their return to Easthaven, Vargrazt enters the Terror at sunset to perform the ritual. Vargrazt absorbs the chardalyn’s evil but destroys his own soul and becomes a violent <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWraith0000000]{Wraith} </strong>(the wraith is placed as a Token in the entrance).</p><p><em><strong>The Terror.</strong></em> Captain Imdra Arlaggath asks the characters to ensure the Terror is safe. It is the size of a small building, and half of it is buried below ground level. It is inhabited by two duergar <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSpecter000000]{Specters}</strong> and one duergar <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPoltergeist00]{Poltergeist}</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Slime on the Walls.</strong></em> Arlaggath asks the characters to keep watch in the Terror overnight as a last precaution. During the night, three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGrayOoze00000]{Gray Oozes}</strong> creep up a hidden passage from the Underdark and fight any living thing in the Terror.</p><p><em><strong>Muck Monster.</strong></em> The oozes leave a path of slime to a hidden, locked trapdoor. The lock is Simple (1 action to pick) and of Good quality ([[/tool 15 thief]]). Below lies a pit of filth inhabited by an <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifOtyugh0000000]{Otyugh}</strong>. The otyugh heaves itself up through the trapdoor, so characters above aren’t safe from its hunger.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion. </strong></em>After the characters clear out the restless spirits and Underdark monsters infesting the dragon’s remains, Arlaggath entrusts the party with the Terror’s care, allowing them to convert it into a shared Bastion once they reach level 5. Vargrazt’s ritual absorbed the chardalyn’s power, rendering crystals inert and the Terror safe to inhabit. At your discretion, though, Zlan might still be able to monitor the characters while they’re in the chardalyn remains.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.KAfE6WxPNBCBOG7b caption=false]</p>"

Alternatively, a character can get this information by spending an hour interrogating petty criminals and succeeding at a [[/skill 15 itm]] or [[/skill 15 per]] check.</p><p><em><strong>Safe House.</strong></em> Use the @UUID[Scene.aifSafeHouse0000]{map} below. Doors begin closed. See “Hallway Fights” below for additional guidance:</p><p><strong>1: Stairs.</strong> Yathla is at the foot of the stairs talking with four of her <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifTough00000000]{Toughs}</strong> near the front door.</p><p><strong>2: Gambling Room.</strong> Four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSpy0000000000]{Spies}</strong> in Yathla’s employ play cards here.</p><p><strong>3: Prisoner Room.</strong> Rendel is tied to a chair here. Two of Yathla’s <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifTough00000000]{Toughs}</strong> relax and talk in the room to the south.</p><p><strong>4: Trap.</strong> A tripwire on the upper floor triggers a fusillade of poison darts in the space marked “T” on the map. Creatures in the 5-foot-by-10-foot space directly north of the trap are affected by the poison dart trap from chapter 3 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>, scaled for level 5 characters.</p><p><strong>5: Vault.</strong> The door to this room is locked with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplArcaneLock]{Arcane Lock}</em> spell, opening only for Yathla. It contains a CR 5–10 treasure hoard, plus a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifSpellScrollDi]{Spell Scroll of Dimension Door}</em>, which Yathla intends to use to escape the safe house.</p><p><em><strong>Hallway Fights.</strong></em> Any criminal in the house can shout an alarm, so characters are likely to face enemies simultaneously charging out of various rooms. At the same time, Yathla flees up the stairs towards the vault, leading characters following too closely into the trap on the upper floor. A session might involve the party splitting up, some chasing Yathla while others deal with the gang and search for Rendel. Track Initiative for everyone even as they spread out around the house.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion. </strong></em>If Rendel is rescued, each character’s Renown Score with the Zhentarim increases by 1.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.RMVx5iJ4jhDVBtDT caption=false]</p>"

Though her physical form is as fluid as the ocean itself, she typically presents as a marid crowned in coral, with her lower half lengthening into a sinewy, eel-like tail.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Before becoming ruler of Maran Saya, Biha Babir worked as a spy. She has traveled across Calimshan, infiltrating rival genie courts and eliminating remnants of the Twisted Rune. Some accounts even tell of her fighting alongside Sultana Songal during the Night of Fleeing Shadows.</p><p>Biha Babir took up leadership of Maran Saya after the previous ruler, her father, retired. People know her as a shrewd ruler, preferring battles of wit over clashes of swords. Of the genie leaders in Calimshan, Biha Babir maintains the strongest spy network, and she is rumored to have informants in every major city of the region.</p><p>For years, Biha Babir has searched tirelessly for the Calimemnon Crystal (see chapter 8), the legendary prison of the powerful genies Calim and Memnon. She believes obtaining that crystal would allow her to wipe Calimshan off the map and seize control of whatever genie empire rises from the wreckage.</p><h3>Personality</h3><p>Biha Babir’s demeanor is like the ocean: seemingly placid on the surface, but dangerous and fierce deep below. Her amiable attitude hides a cunning mind. Biha Babir is politically savvy and prefers to outsmart her opponents rather than battle them, though she doesn’t shy from combat if necessary.</p><p>Biha Babir covets opulence, but she also values information and learning just as much as material wealth. Offering valuable information is a surefire way to gain an audience with the her, but those caught lying to her are severely punished.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h2>Using Biha Babir</h2><p>As the leader of Maran Saya, Biha Babir is a well-known public figure. The characters might encounter her in an official capacity where she is stern but pleasant, particularly around others she wants to impress.</p><p>Biha Babir’s more significant campaign role, however, is as a spymaster. Her agents scheme to bring Maran Saya more influence and Biha Babir more personal power. Biha Babir can be pulling the strings behind efforts to free the genies Calim and Memnon from the Calimemnon Crystal or to otherwise sweep modern Calimshan away and install genie rulers.</p><p>The characters might meet Biha Babir more than once without even realizing it, as she takes on different forms to suit her whims. The characters might meet Biha Babir in her marid form in the courts of Maran Saya and again in the guise of a well-intentioned courtier.</p></aside>",

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p><p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</p><p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the <em>Greater Restoration</em> spell.</p><p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p><p><strong>Spell Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</p><p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.</p><p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</p><p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.</p><p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em> to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a [[/r 1d3cs1]]{33 percent chance} that you are unable to cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p><p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</p><p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the <em>Greater Restoration</em> spell.</p><p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p><p><strong>Spell Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</p><p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.</p><p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</p><p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.</p><p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em> to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a [[/r 1d3cs1]]{33 percent chance} that you are unable to cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

              "description": "<p><em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p><p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</p><p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the <em>Greater Restoration</em> spell.</p><p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p><p><strong>Spell Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</p><p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.</p><p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</p><p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.</p><p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em> to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a [[/r 1d3cs1]]{33 percent chance} that you are unable to cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a [[/r 1d100cs&lt;26#Vehicle is capsized]]{25 percent} chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow. </strong>You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions.

She is Indifferent to the characters, watching them carefully and probing for information on Sultana Songal.</p><p><strong>Prince Sadir. </strong>Sadir is a Hostile <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifDao0000000000]{Dao}</strong> envious of his fellow genies. He tries to trick the characters into embarrassing or humiliating the other ambassadors.</p><p><strong>General Nirmalya. </strong>Nirmalya is an <strong>@UUID[Actor.mmEfreeti0000000]{Efreeti}</strong> and Indifferent to the characters. She enjoys revelry and demonstrating her magical powers. She is quick with compliments but equally quick to anger.</p><p><strong>Sovereign Firtina. </strong>Firtina is a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifMarid00000000]{Marid}</strong> with many titles, but his favorite is Sovereign of the Seventh Wave. He is proud, whimsical, and Hostile to the characters. Firtina is an old rival of Biha Babir.</p><p><em><strong>Uninvited Guests. </strong></em>On the second day of the festival, the feast is infiltrated by a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifVampireNightb]{Vampire Nightbringer}</strong> named Eshku, who is accompanied by two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifVampireSpawn0]{Vampire Spawn}</strong>. The vampires are members of the Twisted Rune, and they’ve come to kill the characters. If the characters defeat the vampires, their Renown Score with each of the four genie factions increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>The Festival Ends. </strong></em>At the conclusion of the three days festival, attendants spot a falling star, landing in the Calim Desert; the “falling star” is the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifMagicItems000.JournalEntryPage.scYl0dzFOmzP1rPQ#calimemnon-crystal]{Calimemnon Crystal}</em> (see chapter 8). Determine which character has the highest Renown Score with any of the genie factions. The ambassador from that faction becomes Friendly to the party and confides to them that the meteor is actually the <em>Calimemnon Crystal. </em>The ambassador can’t allow any of their rivals to get the Artifact, so they give the party a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.svzgBtXiKLNShpAQ]{Spell Scroll of Teleport }</em>and ask the party to acknowledge the ambassador’s assistance to Sultana Songal.</p><p><em><strong>Hunting for the Crystal. </strong></em>The <em>Calimemnon Crystal</em> crashed to the ground like a meteor, breaking through into subterranean tunnels that subsequently flooded. Use the @UUID[Scene.aifCalimemnonCon]{Volcanic Caves} map in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for this part of the adventure, replacing lava with dark, icy water. Each of the three largest pools is guarded by one of the following groups:</p><ul><li>A <strong>@UUID[Actor.mmGraySlaad00000]{Gray Slaad}</strong> and a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifRedSlaad00000]{Red Slaad}</strong></li><li>A <strong>@UUID[Actor.mmGreenSlaad0000]{Green Slaad}</strong> and a <strong>@UUID[Actor.mmBlueSlaad00000]{Blue Slaad}</strong></li><li>Three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifRedSlaad00000]{Red Slaadi}</strong></li></ul><p>The <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifCalimemnonCry]{Calimemnon Crystal}</em> lies at the bottom of one of the pools (your choice).</p><p><em><strong>Final Confrontation. </strong></em>When the characters find the <em>Calimemnon Crystal</em>, <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBihaBabir0000]{Biha Babir} </strong>(see chapter 9) arrives and tries to take it from them. On Initiative count 20 of the second round of combat, the ambassador who helped the party at the end of the festival appears to help fight Biha Babir.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion. </strong></em>Once the party recovers the <em>Calimemnon Crystal</em>, they’ll have to decide what to do with it. If they reveal all that’s occurred to Sultana Songal, she rewards each of them with [[/award 10000gp]] in coins and gems, then asks for the Artifact. She intends to hide it somewhere safe. Alternatively, the characters might decide to keep the Artifact for themselves. Regardless, the genies of Calimshan won’t stop trying to acquire it!</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.XfSqSGBhSyvmuBhW caption=false]</p>"

Bott was last seen heading up the coast.</p><h4>Encounters</h4><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Frozen Sacrifice.</strong></em> An hour from town, three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWolf000000000]{Wolves}</strong> scavenge from a fishing boat frozen in thin ice. The boat holds Bott’s corpse, marked with snowflake symbols left behind by cultists of Auril.</p><p><em><strong>Easthaven Killings.</strong></em> The killers are a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultistFanati]{Cultist Fanatic}</strong> and three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultist000000]{Cultists}</strong> wearing white masks. Until the characters solve the killings, a body marked with snowflakes is found every [[/r 1d6]] days.</p><p><em><strong>Caer-Dineval.</strong></em> The people of Caer-Dineval worship Auril, and the village is the next settlement up the coast from Bott’s boat. When the party arrives to investigate, three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifImp0000000000]{Imps}</strong> break free from the castle to fight the party. Later, Yldreth and Nymetra explain that Auril protects their village from the fiends in the castle. They deny knowledge of the killings.</p><p><em><strong>Cold Court.</strong></em> The cult operates out of an abandoned wooden tower outside Caer-Dineval. Characters might be led to the tower through rumors, tracking cultists in the snow, or divination magic. Each time the characters enter a distinct level of the tower, roll on the following table, ignoring duplicates. As the party explores, they eventually find a ritual table and list of future sacrifices approved by “Ice-Knife Nymetra.” Their own names are listed.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.tables.RollTable.aifEncColdCourtX rollable classes=\"caption-top\" resultLabel=\"Encounter\" caption=false]</p><p><em><strong>Ice-Knife Nymetra.</strong></em> Nymetra (Medium, Neutral Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBerserker0000]{Berserker}</strong>) lives in the tower.

The other guests scatter and try to hide or escape.</p><p><em><strong>Eomanes.</strong></em> The Eomanes roam the house separately. The family members are as follows:</p><p><strong>Dolandre Eomane. </strong>Dolandre (Medium, Lawful Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPerformer0000]{Performer}</strong>) relishes in the violence, with a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBarbedDevil00]{Barbed Devil}</strong> named Mister Pointy Hugs at her side.</p><p><strong>Nysene Eomane. </strong>Nysene (Medium, Lawful Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifNoble00000000]{Noble}</strong>) pulls animals from a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgRustBagofTric]{Bag of Tricks}</em> (rust) to torment her quarry.</p><p><strong>Russora Eomane. </strong>Russora (Small, Neutral Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifMageApprentic]{Mage Apprentice}</strong>) instructs four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifImp0000000000]{Imp}</strong> minions to help her fight.</p><p><strong>Trentellar Eomane. </strong>Trentellar (Medium, Neutral Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultistFanati]{Cultist Fanatic}</strong>) commands four bloodthirsty <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSpy0000000000]{Spies}</strong> who consider him a divine agent of Bhaal.</p><p><em><strong>The House.</strong></em> Doors and windows exiting the house can’t be opened and have Immunity to all damage.</p><p><em><strong>The Survivor.</strong></em> Before the party, the Eomanes ritually murdered their hirelings—whose corpses adorn various rooms—but they missed a human hireling named Bilwen (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGuard00000000]{Guard}</strong>) who is hiding in the barracks. Bilwen shares that the only escape involves climbing down the outside of the house from the rooftop garden.</p><p><em><strong>Ghost in the Garden.</strong></em> The Lawful Neutral <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGhost00000000]{Ghost}</strong> of the former owner of the house, Fellumbur Delce, haunts the garden at night. The Eomanes murdered him when they moved in. He can be put to rest by sharing the house’s deed, which he hid in the library before he died. (The Eomanes don’t know about it.) Fellumbur promises the deed to those who kill all four Eomanes. Killing them also unseals the house’s exits.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> If the characters defeat the Eomanes, they can keep the manor as their Bastion.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Foundry Note</h3><p>Location of the NPCs:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Trentellar Eomane</strong> is in the Arcane Study on the east side of the house next to the library.

Some of the gods memorialized there don’t want to be forgotten and cause chaos to remind the world they exist.</p><p><strong>Hook.</strong> The characters are visiting the temple when screams of panic and fleeing patrons signal a crisis. The high priest of the temple slams the doors to the Forgotten Wing and breathlessly asks the characters to investigate.</p><h4>Encounters</h4><p>Use the Temple of a Thousand map earlier in this chapter for this adventure. Four wayward deities are causing the disturbance in the Forgotten Wing. Each deity was represented in the temple by a statue; the deities have manifested in these statues, which have transformed into monsters. Most can be talked down through social interaction or tests of skill. The deities are as follows:</p><p><strong>Motanwe.</strong> Motanwe is a hunting god once revered by an extinct tribe of steppe nomads. He manifests as a Large stone statue of a horned humanoid (use the <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifHelmedHorror0]{Helmed Horror} </strong>stat block). He is Indifferent to the party but is angrily grieving his long-dead people. He admires warriors and those with hunting skill.</p><p><strong>Nimbus. </strong>Nimbus is a god of the sun who resents being overshadowed by, or even considered an aspect of, Lathander. Nimbus manifests as a flying orb of light three feet in diameter (Celestial, Chaotic Good <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifEmpyreanIota0]{Empyrean Iota}</strong>). Nimbus responds to hopeful, optimistic people and being shown it can still be relevant or useful.</p><p><strong>Korus. </strong>Korus is a deity of music who manifests as a Celestial <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPerformerMaes]{Performer Maestro}</strong>. Korus’s music is stately and formal, out of current fashion. Korus loudly insists artistic skill is the only true measure of a person’s value but really just wants to inspire people again.</p><p><strong>Sholoban. </strong>Sholoban is a deity of knowledge, riddles, and magic. She manifests as a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCouatl0000000]{Couatl}</strong>. Sholoban knows deities fade in time and is resigned to her fate, but she wants to make sure mortal society has learned something from her time as a god. She engages in riddle contests and tests of ancient lore with knowledgeable characters.</p><p><strong>The Hukh. </strong>The Hukh is a mysterious, hungry deity propitiated only by blood and sacrifice. It manifests as a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifShadowDemon00]{Shadow Demon}</strong>. The Hukh lurks in the shadows and avoids the party, fighting if a character approaches. Other deities fear the Hukh and won’t help the characters defeat it, but they’re relieved if the characters destroy it.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion. </strong></em>If three of the five deities are propitiated or destroyed, the surviving deities return to their enshrined locations in the Forgotten Wing and vanish, leaving only inanimate statues. The high priest thanks the characters with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.equipment.Item.dmgDecanterOfEnd]{Decanter of Endless Water}</em> and [[/award 100GP]] each.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.nfXSk57nEziyeJxT caption=false]</p>"

The characters can explore these locations in any order, but the Zhentarim Foes encounter concludes the adventure.</p><p><em><strong>Harrow House.</strong></em> Harrow House, an old mansion far outside the village is haunted by Gunter Weiss, a wizard who died and returned as a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifVampireNightb]{Vampire Nightbringer}</strong>. Use the @UUID[Scene.aifHarrowHouseCo]{Spooky House} map in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for Harrow House. Gunter’s various Undead minions—[[/r 1d4]] <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifFlameskull000]{Flameskulls}</strong> and [[/r 2d6]] <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifShadow0000000]{Shadows}</strong>—patrol the house.</p><p><em><strong>Wizard’s Tower.</strong></em> Freedale was once home to a wizard named Morganth the Mysterious. His tower stands on the east side of the village; use the @UUID[Scene.aifWizardsTower0]{Wizard’s Tower} map in appendix B of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. The tower is trapped with the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.content.JournalEntry.dmgDmsToolbox000.JournalEntryPage.RLB1MPQRqYDR0CtI#fire-casting-statue]{fire-casting statue trap} described in chapter 3 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. Morganth’s <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifShieldGuardia]{Shield Guardian}</strong> still patrols the tower; the controlling amulet is on Morganth’s corpse in the tower’s dungeon, where a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGhastGravecal]{Ghast Gravecaller}</strong> now hides, along with three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGhoul00000000]{Ghouls}</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Temple of Lathander.</strong></em> The Cult of the Dragon secretly performs ghoulish rites by night in this abandoned temple. If the four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultist000000]{Cultist Acolytes}</strong> and their <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifDeathCultist0]{Death Cultist}</strong> leader can be routed, the characters could reopen the temple and earn the goodwill of Freehold’s citizens.</p><p><em><strong>Zhentarim Foes.</strong></em> As soon as the characters arrive, Zhentarim agents discourage them from staying and threaten violence. Eventually, the Zhents make good on that threat, attacking Freedale when the Bastion is near completion.</p><p>Stage this assault in multiple waves, and describe additional hostile forces fighting any Bastion Defenders the party might have. First, the characters must face a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifToughBoss0000]{Tough Boss}</strong> who leads a force of two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifTough00000000]{Toughs}</strong> and four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifDireWolf00000]{Dire Wolves}</strong>. Then, the Zhents send a shock force of four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBeardedDevil0]{Bearded Devils}</strong> against the characters. If the devils are defeated, the Zhentarim leader (<strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAssassin00000]{Assassin}</strong>) and five <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifTough00000000]{Toughs}</strong> fight the party.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.3Qe4mqUcRdTPNtUy caption=false]</p>"

But his guards are monsters in disguise intending to lure the caravan to its destruction.</p><p><strong>Hook.</strong> Shezar hires the characters to escort his caravan to Calimport. He offers the characters [[/award each 100gp]] now and another [[/award each 100gp]] when the caravan reaches its destination.</p><h4>Encounters</h4><p>This adventure takes place over a week as the caravan follows the Trade Way south across the desert. The caravan includes dozens of camels carrying precious goods, but Shezar’s prize possession is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifBrazierofComm]{Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals,}</em> which he keeps packed away on his camel.</p><p>Shezar has hired eight guards aside from the characters; he doesn’t know they’re <strong>@UUID[Actor.mmJackalwere0000]{Jackalweres} </strong>in humanoid form. Their leader is named Thukir. Thukir and the other jackalweres work for a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifLamia00000000]{Lamia}</strong> named Selim who covets Shezar’s magic brazier. Shezar assigns Thukir and the other guards to remain with the caravan every day while the characters scout the path ahead.</p><p><em><strong>Desert Encounters.</strong></em> Each day, as the characters scout, roll on the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.tables.RollTable.aifEncCalimDeser]{Calim Desert Encounters} table. The characters spot any encounters from far off, so they can flee from threats too dangerous for them to handle and redirect the caravan along a safer route.</p><p><em><strong>Jackalwere Treason.</strong></em> The “guards” keep to themselves and avoid interacting with the characters. Thukir does the talking for the group. The jackalweres maintain their deception for as long as possible, but if they sense the party is onto them, they try to ambush the party one night in camp. Use the @UUID[Scene.dmgCaravanEncamp]{Caravan Encampment }map in appendix B of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for this encounter, replacing the wagons with bundles of goods offloaded from the caravan’s camels.</p><p><em><strong>Sandstorm.</strong></em> On the fourth day, a furious Calim sandstorm (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifDesertSurviva.JournalEntryPage.KJvjdQTQMmNOvQLN]{Environmental Effects”} earlier in this chapter) approaches the caravan. The characters can seek shelter for the caravan or, failing that, shelter in place. If the jackalweres haven’t yet been revealed, they try to steal the brazier. Should the jackalweres get the brazier toward Selim’s tower (see below).</p><p><em><strong>Selim Strikes.</strong></em> The <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifLamia00000000]{Lamia}</strong> Selim lairs in a desert tower near the south end of the Trade Way. On the second-to-last night of the journey, Selim sneaks up to the camp and steals the brazier. If the jackalweres haven’t yet been confronted, they join with Selim to seize the camp. Shezar begs the characters to recover the brazier from the lamia.</p><p><em><strong>Selim’s Tower.</strong></em> Use the @UUID[Scene.dmgWizardsTower0]{Wizard’s Tower} map in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for Selim’s lair. The tower entrance on level 1 is guarded by a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWarriorVetera]{Warrior Veteran }</strong>and their pet <strong>@UUID[Actor.mmLion0000000000]{Lion}</strong>. Replace the central chamber on level 2 with a pool housing a <strong>@UUID[Actor.mmWaterWeird0000]{Water Weird}</strong> Selim has imprisoned. Selim is on level 4, along with a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifFireElemental]{Fire Elemental} </strong>he’s summoned using the brazier.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> When the party brings Shezar safely to Calimport, he pays them the promised reward and gives them the magic brazier, insisting it has brought him nothing but woe and misfortune.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.aEewjd28aKSjtuBh caption=false]</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.EoOSGpQIgcWDR9O5 caption=false]</p>"

Now they stop travelers and demand a toll. They’ve even taken prisoners, demanding ransoms for the prisoners’ release.</p><p><strong>Hook. </strong>A middle-aged human trader named Rolf Twyrtho (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCommoner00000]{Commoner}</strong>) has received a ransom note for his brother Adon, held by the bandits. Rolf offers each character [[/award 50GP]] to bring Adon home and teach the bandits a lesson.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.D1UR6xSwVTsxuDRS caption=false]</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The adventure consists of these encounters. All the bandits are human and Medium size.</p><p><em><strong>Bandit Stronghold.</strong></em> Use the @UUID[Scene.dmgDungeonHideou]{Dungeon Hideout} map—an arch over the roadway once connected these watchtowers. The western stairway on level 1 leads to level 2’s secret exit tunnel and the few rooms directly along it; ignore the rest of level 2. Bandits have lived in this hideout for weeks, and characters traveling the road spot campfire smoke from the west tower. The robbers aren’t bloodthirsty—if they defeat the characters, they’re content to rob them and figure out if anyone is worth ransoming.</p><p>Characters who search the area more broadly might discover a hidden entrance to the lair of the robbers. This hole in the hillside, covered with brush, is the secret exit found on level 2 of the map.</p><p>Mardon Rueh (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSpy0000000000]{Spy}</strong>) is the bandit leader. He carries keys to the locked areas on level 1. His sister, Wendi Rueh (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPriestAcolyte]{Priest Acolyte}</strong>), tries to prevent anyone from dying, even hostages or the characters. The Ruehs were once aristocrats and were ruined by the Eomanes, a rival family the Ruehs accused of devil worship. Mardon intends to use money gained from banditry to hire mercenaries and take revenge. If given the chance, Mardon tells his story to the party and he might even hire the characters to be his agents. For more on the Eomanes, see the “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifBaldursGateGa.JournalEntryPage.NQ1uNs56RPWjf6kN#other-sites]{Eomane House}” section and the adventure “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifBloodNight000]{Blood Night}” in chapter 6.</p><p><em><strong>Fallen Archway.</strong></em> Caldwell (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifTough00000000]{Tough}</strong>) and his pet <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifMastiff000000]{Mastiff}</strong> keep watch on the road. A total of three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBandit0000000]{Bandits}</strong> and one <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifScout00000000]{Scout} </strong>lurk in the ruined guardhouses to either side, but they’re bored and &amp;Reference[Indifferent], talking to each other and occasionally leaving the building to speak with Caldwell or play with the dog. Caldwell is &amp;Reference[Hostile] and demands a toll of 3 GP from each passerby, but he’s willing to barter. At any impasse in talks, the robbers insist on more money. If the party doesn’t relent, the robbers reluctantly begin combat.</p><p><em><strong>East Tower.</strong></em> Mardon lives in a rough office and bedroom set up in this tower. In the northeastern barrack, three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBandit0000000]{Bandits}</strong> rest. A room in the southeast corner built around the oiled, polished stump of an ancient oak houses Wendi Rueh, Mardon’s sister. She reveres Oghma and has placed a wooden symbol of Oghma atop the stump. Battle sounds bring everyone into the fray. Journals and other documents in these rooms tell the story of the Rueh family and their vendetta with the Eomanes.</p><p><em><strong>West Tower.</strong></em> Three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBandit0000000]{Bandits}</strong> and one <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifMastiff000000]{Mastiff}</strong> relax around a campfire in this tower, which is in much worse condition than the eastern one. They keep a lax watch on the stairway down, which they’ve covered with wooden boards. The stairway is unstable. Characters who move at no more than half their Speed on a turn use it safely. Otherwise, the stairs crumble and all creatures on the stairs fall 10 feet to level 1, alerting everyone in west level 1 (below).</p><p><em><strong>East Level 1.</strong></em> The eastern section of the hideout houses castoff junk and three locked prison cells with one prisoner, Adon Twyrtho (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWarriorInfant]{Warrior Infantry}</strong>). Adon is eager to escape, but he admits to being treated well while he waited to be ransomed. He points out that the bandits pass through this area when they change shifts.</p><p><em><strong>Central Level 1.</strong></em> To the east of this pillared hall, rubble chokes a stairway. To the west, a similar stair leads to an escape tunnel with a brush-covered entrance on a hillside. A locked southwestern room holds most of the bandits’ loot and supplies, including the following:</p><ul><li>[[/award 380cp 630sp 120gp 26pp]]</li><li>Six @UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifTigereyeGem00]{tigereye gems}, worth 10 GP each</li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPotionOfClimb]{Potion of Climbing}</em></li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifSpellScrollSe]{Spell Scroll of See Invisibility}</em></li></ul><p><em><strong>West Level 1.</strong></em> One <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifTough00000000]{Tough}</strong>, one <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifScout00000000]{Scout}</strong>, one <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifMastiff000000]{Mastiff}</strong>, and three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBandit0000000]{Bandits}</strong> rest or socialize in the barrack here. These combatants respond quickly to the sounds of fighting or a shouted alarm from the floor above.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> If the party agrees to help Mardon and Wendi get justice on the Eomanes and regain their rightful position in Baldur’s Gate, Mardon releases Adon. As long as Adon is freed, Rolf makes good on his promised payment.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.D1UR6xSwVTsxuDRS caption=false]</p>"

An aspiring drug lord, Dyan Komar, accidentally reawakened the plague while conducting alchemical experiments.</p><p><strong>Hook. </strong>A local healer, Kestra Alara, pleads with the characters to meet with the town’s three criminal syndicates and enlist their help to locate the source of the plague. She offers [[/award 5000gp]] for the party’s assistance.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Meeting of the Minds.</strong></em> Kestra has arranged a meeting with syndicate leaders at dusk at a tavern called The Rotting Gull.</p><p><strong>Boss Sneed</strong> (Medium, Neutral Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBanditCrimeLo]{Bandit Crime Lord}</strong>) is the human leader of the Shaker Gang.

He respects fighting ability and challenges one of the characters to non-deadly single combat. If the character wins and doesn’t kill Finchley, Finchley and his gang will help them.</p><p><strong>Walenna Eventide</strong> (Medium, Chaotic Neutral <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPirateCaptain]{Pirate Captain}</strong>) is the wood elf leader of the Stallions. The <em>Sea Stallion</em> is in need of repairs. If the characters promise to make it seaworthy again, she will help them. Repairing the ship requires 5,000 GP. Alternatively, characters can do the work in 100 days, divided by the number of characters working on the repairs.</p><p>See @UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifDalelandsGaze.JournalEntryPage.yuxHgo0GOPjQsg0O]{Scardale Town} in chapter 2 for more information on these individuals and their followers.</p><p><em><strong>Finding the Source.</strong></em> The source of the plague is a filthy warehouse in the harbor district. It takes [[/r 3d4]] days of searching to find the warehouse. Reduce this by [[/r 1d4]] for every gang the party recruits; if they recruit all three gangs, they find the warehouse before sunrise. Your players might come up with novel strategies to quickly find the source of the plague.</p><p><em><strong>The Warehouse.</strong></em> Use the map below for the warehouse, which contains Dyan’s alchemy lab. Characters searching the lab are exposed to the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifShakingPlague]{Shaking Plague} (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifDalelandsGaze.JournalEntryPage.uDg31v9jS2ij43MN#shaking-plague]{chapter 2}). Four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifRevenant00000]{Revenants}</strong>, victims of Dyan’s alchemical testing, wander the warehouse and fight intruders. Within each of the southern labs lurks a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifVioletFungusN]{Violet Fungus Necrohulk}</strong>. When either of the necrohulks is disturbed, it begins combat, waking the other, which bursts from the room it’s in.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> Burning the warehouse to the ground eliminates the source of the plague, and the town slowly recovers. Each gang leader recruited by the party gives the characters an Uncommon magic item as thanks for saving the town.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.4KrDiuKnfWtDzDnM caption=false]</p>"

Khran, as the dragon is often called, lairs near Ormpur. Complicating matters, Khran wears an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgAmuletOfProof]{Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location}</em>. Her lair is protected by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplForbiddanc]{Forbiddance}</em> spell that damages Celestials.</p><p><strong>Hook. </strong>Zimrir Chay (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifArchpriest000]{Archpriest}</strong>), a human devoted to Torm, asks the characters to acquire the sword from Khran. While the party could negotiate, he prefers that the dragon be destroyed, freeing the region from her sway. If the characters agree to slay the creature, Zimrir provides each character with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgSupremePotion]{Potion of Healing} </em>(supreme) and a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifPotionOfResis]{Potion of Fire Resistance}</em>.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Saffron Slayers.</strong></em> The people of Ormpur know the location of Khran’s lair, east across the Shaar in the Dun Hills. But the dragon has countless well-paid eyes and ears in the city, so the party’s fame and purpose quickly spread. Elite forces of a gang in Khran’s employ—a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBanditCrimeLo]{Bandit Crime Lord}</strong>, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSpyMaster0000]{Spy Master}</strong>, and two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAssassin00000]{Assassins}</strong>—ambush the characters and urge them to leave Ormpur for good.</p><p><em><strong>Burning Shaar.</strong></em> More of Khran’s allies hear of the party and their quest, pursuing them into the Shaar and then the Dun Hills as the characters approach the lair. The elf Naedrin (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultistHierop]{Cultist Hierophant}</strong>) flies in on the back of Aphusso, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifYoungRedDrago]{Young Red Dragon}</strong>. Naedrin talks first, using his magic to turn would-be dragonslayers from their path. Failing that, Naedrin calls forth two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifFireElemental]{Fire Elementals}</strong> and initiates combat. If the battle takes place in the Shaar, an @UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.actors.Actor.dmgInferno000000]{inferno} (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.content.JournalEntry.dmgDmsToolbox000.JournalEntryPage.lVkdQivhFHqVmxg7#inferno]{chapter 3} of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>) results.</p><p><em><strong>Ash Lands.</strong></em> Khran greets the party from a hilltop the party must pass. If battle ensues, she leaves as soon as she can, with a parting invitation to join her later for a fine meal.</p><p><em><strong>Khrangyrdis’s Lair.</strong></em> Use the @UUID[Scene.aifHeartOfFireDr]{Dragon Lair} map in appendix B of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. This structure is an old temple to Tiamat, destroyed during the Spellplague. Khran prefers level 3, but she doesn’t want her servants slain and fights intruders when she becomes aware of them. Khran’s lair is further detailed below:</p><p><strong>Level 1.</strong> Bizarre yet elegant formations of sharp, melted stone make up the scorched ruins that top Khran’s hill. An unscathed shrine to Tiamat remains in the northeastern corner, outside two stone doors, each with a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSalamander000]{Salamander}</strong> guard. These guards allow visitors to enter the site. Beyond the doors, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSalamanderInf]{Salamander Inferno Master} </strong>tends an ancient pool of molten stone for Khran’s enjoyment. Once the party is inside, the master and guards ambush them.</p><p><strong>Level 2.</strong> Walls and pillars carved with images extolling the glory of the Dragon Queen make up this firelit level. Four red <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifHalfdragon000]{Half-Dragons} </strong>live and work here, guided by a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifFiendCultist0]{Fiend Cultist}</strong>. These loyal minions fight intruders.</p><p><strong>Level 3.</strong> Khran dwells and stores her hoard, including <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifHolyAvenger00]{Chalsembyr’s Heart}</em>, here.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> Tormtars celebrate characters who return <em>Chalsembyr’s Heart</em> to the House of the Hand. Priests offer the sword to a character who serves Torm and is willing to search for the lost realm of Chalsembyr, which Torm ruled as a mortal.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.AnOSlwqGPrUk91RD caption=false]</p>"

He doesn’t realize his test subject was a Guild informant, and now the Guild wants both Flurn and his mechanical creation destroyed.</p><p><strong>Hook.</strong> A smith offers the characters a discount in exchange for checking on his former boss, the inventor Flurn Eightspoke, at his Heapside workshop. The smith has heard rumors that Flurn ran afoul of the Guild but can’t imagine what the good-natured inventor could have done to deserve this attention. Alternatively, mechanically oriented characters hear that Flurn has completed a great invention and stop by to check it out.</p><h4>Encounters</h4><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Eightspoke Workshop.</strong></em> Use the @UUID[Scene.aifClockworkMemo]{Roadside Inn} map in appendix C of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>. Use the ground floor only; the upper floor is a rooftop patio and a single room where Flurn sleeps. The workshop is a cluttered, noisy place that smells of cut wood and wet metal. Apart from Flurn Eightspoke (Small, Lawful Neutral <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPriest0000000]{Priest}</strong>), eight <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCommoner00000]{Commoners}</strong> work as apprentices throughout the workshop.</p><p><em><strong>Clockwork Guards.</strong></em> Six <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifNimblewrightG]{Nimblewright Soldiers}</strong> (see chapter 9) patrol the workshop grounds, including its roof, in pairs. They ignore the characters as they patrol.</p><p><em><strong>Meeting Flurn.</strong></em> Flurn meets the characters. He has a perpetually puzzled look on his face but a friendly demeanor. Flurn gives the characters a quick tour, concluding with his planning room. He is oblivious to Guild agents who have recently been casing his workshop, and he knows of no trouble.</p><p><em><strong>Storage Barn.</strong></em> The covered barn to the west looks like a stable but it holds supplies: iron ingots in one stall, lumber in another, screws and bolts in another, and so on. A suit of <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAnimatedArmor]{Animated Armor}</strong> keeps inventory on a slate board bolted to its chest.</p><p><em><strong>Assembly Room.</strong></em><strong> </strong>The workshop’s goods are assembled on the three tables in this room. At least some of Flurn’s apprentices are here around the clock. A mechanical fox named Flywheel (use the <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWeasel0000000]{Weasel} </strong>stat block, except it’s a Construct rather than a Beast) prowls this room, demanding frequent head pats.</p><p><em><strong>Forge.</strong></em> The room south of the assembly room is a hot, crowded forge. Molds for several sizes of clockwork gears are stacked haphazardly. A small office connected to the forge holds plans for metal pieces, out of the way of errant embers.</p><p><em><strong>Planning Room.</strong></em> The large room to the east has several drafting tables. The walls and tables bear hundreds of half-finished schematics that demonstrate Flurn’s genius. The planning room holds two items of interest: a brain in a jar that Flurn is using as a model (it belonged to an accountant who knew the secret identity of Heapside’s shadowy kingpin), and a mechanical person with its clockwork brain exposed (use the <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifFleshGolem000]{Flesh Golem}</strong> stat block). The brass and iron brain is a whirring marvel. Flurn has the mechanical person sit up and asks it to solve a few complex equations on a notepad, but before the demonstration gets too far, the Guild makes its move.</p><p><em><strong>The Guild Strikes.</strong></em> The Guild attack comes in two phases: first, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBanditDeceive]{Bandit Deceiver}</strong> and two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSpy0000000000]{Spies}</strong> come to the workshop’s west entrance to loudly complain of shoddy work. The apprentices try to mollify them, but when Flurn approaches, the Guild agents try to kill him and any characters accompanying him. Meanwhile, an <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAssassin00000]{Assassin}</strong> sneaks over the roof to locate and destroy both the physical brain and the mechanical person. The assassin is disguised as an innocent apprentice. The ruse lets him slip past the workshop’s nimblewright guards. The assassin fights if confronted or if given the opportunity to complete the mission.</p><p><em><strong>The Guards Activate.</strong></em> Once any attempt is made on Flurn’s life, his nimblewrights become Hostile to everyone who doesn’t work at the workshop. Their programming compels them to hunt intruders, which includes the characters. You can use the nimblewrights in pairs or even as a big group to challenge the characters—or to help them if the characters struggle against the Guild intruders.</p><p><em><strong>Valuable Memories.</strong></em> If the characters save Flurn and his mechanical person, the mechanical creation takes the notepad and writes, “They came for me because I know Gregor Undarin, flower merchant, is secretly Guild kingpin of Heapside.” The mechanical person might also share details of Gregor’s shady accounts or the location of Gregor’s hidden vaults of ill-gotten treasure, leading to future adventures. Either way, this knowledge earns the characters the Guild’s enmity for as long as Gregor is in power.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.YsJCgr3GXtV3IU2X caption=false]</p>"

Dain claims he has heard the dragon is huge and has reddish scales; he doesn’t admit Cylrotanth is a copper dragon. He offers the party [[/award 2000gp]] to complete this mission on the cult’s behalf, and he pays half up front.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Travel to the Lair.</strong></em> Cylrotanth’s lair lies 135 miles north of Soubar. Each day, use the appropriate encounter below:</p><p><strong>Day 1. </strong>Wrathful riders (five <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifFlamingSkelet]{Flaming Skeletons}</strong> riding <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifNightmare0000]{Nightmares}</strong>) burst from the Fields of the Dead to reenact a fateful charge, targeting the characters.</p><p><strong>Day 2. </strong>Three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifTroll00000000]{Trolls}</strong> try to make a meal of the party.</p><p><strong>Day 3. </strong>Two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifYoungGreenDra]{Young Green Dragons}</strong> stalk the party through the Forest of Wyrms.</p><p><strong>Day 4. </strong>A <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGrickAncient0]{Grick Ancient}</strong> ambushes the characters, and six <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGrick00000000]{Gricks}</strong> drop from trees to join in.</p><p><strong>Day 5. </strong>Near Thlohtzin, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifYuantiAbomina]{Yuan-ti Abomination}</strong> and four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifYuantiMalison]{Yuan-ti Malisons (Type 1)}</strong> try to take the party prisoner.</p><p><strong>Day 6. </strong>Cylrotanth’s friends—Kergan, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCyclopsOracle]{Cyclops Oracle}</strong>,<strong> </strong>and Serteus, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.mmCyclopsSentry0]{Cyclops Sentry}—</strong>confront the characters with foreknowledge of their intent. They are Indifferent but defend themselves if the characters fight them.</p><p><em><strong>Cylrotanth’s Lair.</strong></em> Cylrotanth welcomes the group to his lair and asks if they’ve met his cyclops friends (see above). He becomes Hostile if he learns the group harmed the giants, but he doesn’t fight. He’s willing to trade for his orb, which is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgCrystalBall00]{Crystal Ball}</em> worth 40,000 GP.</p><p><em><strong>Cult Ambush.</strong></em> Assuming a fight with the dragon has weakened the group, Dain betrays the party in an attempt to take the orb for himself.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p><p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</p><p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the <em>Greater Restoration</em> spell.</p><p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p><p><strong>Spell Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</p><p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.</p><p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</p><p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.</p><p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em> to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a [[/r 1d3cs1]]{33 percent chance} that you are unable to cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

A year of tragedy—in which he lost his adventuring companions, his lover, and his good looks—broke Taydan’s heart. Reyla (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAberrantCulti]{Aberrant Cultist}</strong>), a tiefling who reveres Beshaba, led Taydan to blame Sune and steal a ruby rose from Sune’s Temple of Beauty in Waterdeep. Reyla and Taydan destroyed every street-corner mirror shrine to Sune they passed while fleeing the city and headed to the Passion Pools, a Sune pilgrimage site that houses reflecting pools sacred to the goddess. The pools are located in Westwood, 100 miles north of Waterdeep and 30 miles northwest of Amphail.</p><p><strong>Hook. </strong>Clergy in the Temple of Beauty in Waterdeep learned Taydan headed to the Passion Pools from a boastful note he left in which he vowed to “break all mirrors” in his path. Lei Kuvun, a human priest of the temple, asks adventurers to chase Taydan down and stop him from fulfilling his vow.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.XfSqSGBhSyvmuBhW caption=false] </p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Night Stalkers.</strong></em> Two <strong>@UUID[Folder.YySpKr79bxpjTUR8]{Incubi}</strong> servants of Beshaba stalk the group. If discovered, they call two hulking elk with sharp, bloody antlers to assist them in battle (use the <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGiantBoar0000]{Giant Boar}</strong> stat block, but the elk are Fiends instead of Beasts). If the incubi pursue the party to the Passion Pools, they and their elk minions fight the party there.</p><p><em><strong>Passion Pools.</strong></em> These caves in the forested foothills of the Sword Mountains protect geothermic pools laced with salts that color the waters various hues of red. The air is steamy and smells foul. Use the @UUID[Scene.aifVolcanicCaves]{Volcanic Caves} map in <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> appendix B, treating lava as water and placing areas where priests and visitors live and work.</p><p><em><strong>Love’s Warning.</strong></em> The <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGhost00000000]{Ghost}</strong> of Baranys Dwyll, once an aasimar priest of Sune, manifests soon after the party enters the pools, warning the characters of the site’s dangers.</p><p><em><strong>Foul Waters.</strong></em> The ritual Reyla and Taydan are performing has befouled the pools. Any creature that enters a pool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]] or have the &amp;Reference[Poisoned] condition until the end of its next turn; a creature makes this save only once per turn. Those who gaze into the pools see unnerving reflections of themselves and must succeed on a [[/save cha 15 format=long]] or suffer the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplBane000000]{Bane}</em> spell for 1 minute.</p><p><em><strong>Bad Toad.</strong></em> Moro, Reyla’s <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifQuasit0000000]{Quasit}</strong> familiar, keeps watch within the pools and might be discovered by characters at any time. Moro claims to be an innocent awakened toad in need of protection. If allowed to accompany the party or taken along with them, Moro causes “accidental” trouble until it has an excuse to join a fight against the party. For example, Moro might make noise when the party is trying to be sneaky, or it might profess to know the way through the pools and then lead the party into an ambush. If left behind or attacked, Moro turns &amp;Reference[Invisible] and harasses the group unseen.</p><p><em><strong>Pool Exploration.</strong></em> Each time characters enter a major area, roll on the table below or choose an encounter, rerolling duplicates.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.tables.RollTable.aifEncPoolExplor rollable classes=\"caption-top\" resultLabel=\"Encounter\" caption=false]</p><p><em><strong>Polluted Pool.</strong></em> Using Abyssal reagents gathered from demons at the site, Reyla and Taydan are performing a vile ritual to corrupt the Passion Pools and dedicate them to Beshaba. They pause to destroy intruders. Three swarms of fiendish cockroaches (<strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSwarmOfLarvae]{Swarms of Larvae)}</strong> scuttle in the fetid room and protect the two villains. Both Reyla and Taydan are Hostile, but as an Influence action, a character can make a [[/check Persuasion 15 format=long]] to try and dissuade Taydan from his evil course, convincing him to turn on Reyla on a successful check. Reyla carries the ruby rose.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> When the characters return to the Temple of Beauty with the ruby rose, clerics instruct them to keep it. It now functions as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgRingOfProtect]{Ring of Protection} </em>when worn. Each character also receives two <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifPerfumeofBewi]{Perfumes of Bewitching}</em>.</p>"

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form (see appendix B), though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.</p><p><strong>Telepathic Connection.</strong> While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.</p><p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.</p><p><strong>Combat.</strong> The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p><p><strong>Disappearance of the Familiar.</strong> When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p><p><strong>One Familiar Only.</strong> You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.</p>",

While exploring a magical castle at its summit, he was confronted by evil fey who demanded a performance. Because his music was so good, they won’t let him leave.</p><p><strong>Hook.</strong> In desperation, Braelin wrote a plea for help, sealed it into a wine bottle, and threw it into the sea. The characters find this message, which provides directions to the isle’s current location, warns of evil fey, and promises vast rewards if Braelin is rescued.</p><h4>Encounters</h4><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Reaching the Island.</strong></em> The island has moved, requiring characters to chase it down. Once they arrive, they spot Braelin’s <em>Windskiff</em> on the beach. A <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifChuul00000000]{Chuul}</strong> lies in wait and begins combat when the characters investigate.</p><p><em><strong>Entering the Castle. </strong></em>Use the map of the castle below. The castle is visible from everywhere on the island. Two Indifferent elf sentries (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifKnight0000000]{Knights}</strong>) guard the gate.</p><p><em><strong>Finding Braelin. </strong></em>The castle is inhabited by fey who make up the court of a mysterious evil queen.

If the characters defeat her, the Hostile occupants of the castle surrender and leave. The characters can claim the fey castle and its wandering isle as their Bastion.</p><p>The fey used areas of the castle for a variety of tasks, such as the sanctuary crowning the south tower and the smithy at the castle’s center. If the characters use the castle as a Bastion, some of the rooms in the map below make for excellent locations of Bastion facilities of the same name.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.71pLBo6f7b396Pbd caption=false]</p>"
