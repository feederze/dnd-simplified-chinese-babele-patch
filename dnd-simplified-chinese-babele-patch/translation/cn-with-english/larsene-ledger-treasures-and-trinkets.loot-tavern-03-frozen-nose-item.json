This thread, known as Gleipnir, was crafted from the sound of a cat's footfall, the roots of a mountain, and the breath of a fish, amongst other things. With the leftover material, the Weapons of Binding were made. The <em>suneater axe</em> is one such weapon, a depiction of the wolf Sköll, who the dwarves believe will one day devour the sun.</p><p>You gain a <strong>+1 bonus</strong> to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Instead of a melee weapon attack, make a ranged weapon attack against a target within <strong>30 feet</strong> of you, using your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and it must succeed on a <strong>DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</strong> or become <span id=\"was-tagged\"><strong>grappled</strong></span> (<strong>escape DC 15</strong>) as the thread wraps itself around it. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is <span id=\"was-tagged\"><strong>restrained</strong></span> while it is <span id=\"was-tagged\">grappled</span> in this way. Huge or larger creatures have <strong>disadvantage</strong> on the saving throw. The <span id=\"was-tagged\">grappled</span> creature or a creature within reach of it can attempt a <strong>DC 15 Strength</strong> check, ending the grapple on a success. The grapple also ends if you pull the axe's blade back towards the weapon (no action required) or if you let go of the axe. While you have a creature <span id=\"was-tagged\">grappled</span> in this way, you can't attack with the <em>suneater axe</em>.
