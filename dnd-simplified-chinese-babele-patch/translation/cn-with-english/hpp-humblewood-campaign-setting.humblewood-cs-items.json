      "description": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Artifact (requires attunement by a wizard)</em></p><p>This legendary tome of dark necromancy was penned by the mad corvum necromancer Lathrus, of the Night’s Call. The book is one of a kind and contains terrible necromantic secrets.</p><p>The <em>Necronomicon Ex Corvis </em>is a spellbook, and as such only wizards can truly benefit from studying the dark secrets within.</p><p><em><strong>Abyssal Secrets</strong></em>. By spending a full week studying the dark secrets in this tome, your Intelligence score increases by 2. These secrets gnaw at your mind, however, and your Wisdom score decreases by 1. </p><p><em><strong>Grasp of Shadows</strong></em>. By spending at least a minute reciting a ritual listed in this book, you can summon forth [[/r 1d4 + 2]] @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.QGcQYZbVl4bWzi4E]{Shadows}. These creatures are loyal to you and can understand any instructions you give them. They will carry out these instructions to the best of their ability. This property can only be used once per week.</p><p><em><strong>Knowledge Beyond Reason</strong></em>. You may add the spells listed below into your spellbook. However, the tome removes the restriction that requires you to be able to prepare and cast these spells. In effect, you can copy these spells to your spellbook now, though they will only be available to prepare once you reach a level at which you can cast them. </p><p>Additionally, rather than pay gold pieces to copy any spell within into your spellbook, you may deal one point of damage to yourself and take one level of &amp;Reference[Exhaustion]{Exhaustion} to scribe the spell in your own blood.</p><p> </p><table style=\"width:100%\"><thead><tr><td style=\"width:10%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\"><strong>Level</strong></td><td style=\"width:90%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\"><strong>Spell</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:10%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\">3rd</td><td style=\"width:90%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.oyE5nVppa5mde5gT]{Animate Dead}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pO4zGe5LmFIYqJiL]{Bestow Curse}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.UfHQhA54M4323gVO]{Vampiric Touch}</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:10%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\">4th</td><td style=\"width:90%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pybg5MNc3lkerH4Y]{Blight}</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:10%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\">6th</td><td style=\"width:90%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.KeunEkg1JYbOCOhV]{Circle of Death}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ej6wyY4G1gOcb1U6]{Magic Jar}</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:10%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\">7th</td><td style=\"width:90%;vertical-align:top;text-align:left;padding:5px\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.HPvZm8YJO91k6Qdg]{Finger of Death}</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p><em><strong>The Corvum’s Curse</strong></em>. After copying at least one spell from this tome into your spellbook, you must succeed on a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom saving throw</strong> or become cursed (as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pO4zGe5LmFIYqJiL]{Bestow Curse}), with the effect of the curse being decided by the GM. </p><p>The curse persists for [[/r 2d4]] days, but its duration resets anytime you copy a spell from this book. Otherwise, only a remove curse spell cast using a 5th level or higher spell slot can rid you of this effect.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying the Book</strong></em>. Unlike other artifacts, the book is not immune to damage. Pages removed from the book will lose their magic within a day. Additionally, exposing the book to direct sunlight for at least 8 hours will cause the dark magic within to dissipate, rendering it useless.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-TMATfxogvIgGBzWz\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>An Active Effect is located in the Effect tab of your character sheet to enable the INT bonus and reduce the WIS stat.</p></section>",

By using your action to touch the staff to a surface, you can cause a barrier of ice to spring into existence from a point you can see along this surface within 200 feet of you.

You can’t use this property again until 3 days have passed. </p><p><em><strong>Cruel Winds</strong></em>. Wherever the staff goes, a bitterly cold boreal wind accompanies it. The wind gusts intermittently within 30 feet of the attuned character and extinguishes all non-magical flames it comes into contact with.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying the Staff.</strong></em> The staff can be destroyed through exposure to flames from a fire elemental of equal power to the being it was crafted from. After centuries of exposure, it will melt away into nothing. </p>",
