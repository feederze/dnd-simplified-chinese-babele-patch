With a lengthy reload time and complete lack of accuracy, this matchlock-augmented polearm is usable at only one range: point blank. It also comes with a lovely ribbon and neat basket to hold all your spare shot. Cute.</p><p>You have a <strong>+1 bonus</strong> to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Point Blank Shot.</strong></em> When you hit a target with an attack using a loaded <em>gunnspier</em>, you can use a bonus action to pull the trigger, firing a plum-sized leaden ball at the target. The attack deals an additional <strong>[[/damage 2d8 bludgeoning]]</strong> damage.</p><p><em><strong>Backfire.</strong></em> When you use Point Blank Shot and roll an 8 on both of the additional bludgeoning damage dice, the <em>gunnspier</em> backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a <span class=\"heliana-mecha-koboldzilla Checks-and-Saves\">[[/save dex 15 format=long]]</span> or take <strong>[[/damage 4d6 piercing]]</strong> damage as shrapnel erupts from the weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Reload.</strong></em> As an action, you can reload the <em>gunnspier</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Thrown.</strong></em> If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p><p><em><strong>Versatile.</strong></em> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>",
