      "description": "<p>Grown in fey soil, these wrought-iron bows are used by Unseelie fey in conflicts against their Seelie cousins. Turquoise fruit sprouts from the metallic branches; bulbs of liquid fire ripe to erupt and scour the ground for a new generation of growth.</p><p>This bow has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.</p><p>The first attack you make with this bow on each of your turns wreathes the arrow in blue flame and deals an extra [[/r 1d4]] fire damage on a hit.</p><p><strong><em>Unseelie Lights.</em></strong> As a bonus action while carrying this bow, you can expend 1 charge to imbue your next attack with it with the ghostly light from the bow's bulbs. If you hit a creature with it, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or come under the effects of the faerie fire spell for 1 minute. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>"
