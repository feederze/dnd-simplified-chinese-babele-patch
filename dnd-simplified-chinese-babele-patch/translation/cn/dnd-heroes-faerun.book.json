A place of varied cultures and peoples, Faerûn contains diverse realms, including kingdoms, city-states, and carefully maintained alliances of rural communities. While many of these realms are ruled by humans, who are the most populous species in Faerûn today, people of all sorts—including dragonborn, goliaths, orcs, tieflings, and more— mingle in those realms, as well as mountainous dwarven kingdoms, hidden elven enclaves, and other communities. Except in the most remote or insular places, Faerûnians are accustomed to seeing people of different cultures, ethnicities, and species.</p><p>A great deal of adventure is to be had in the Realms. The routes between cities and nations often cross into the territory of brigands or marauding monsters. Every forest, swamp, and mountain range has its own perils, whether lurking bandits, malicious fey, or mighty creatures such as giants and dragons. Ruins of ancient, forgotten realms dot the landscape, and these ruins often conceal expansive subterranean dungeons that wind beneath the surface. In these places, long-lost treasures await intrepid adventurers.</p><p>Faerûn is filled with rich history and wondrous tales of adventure and magic, but day-to-day life in Faerûn is that of a medieval society. Rural farmers grow food and herd livestock that gets sent to market in towns and cities, where crafters and other tradesfolk gather. News and gossip are carried by caravans, ships, and traveling minstrels. Adventurers also spread news—when they’re not creating it!</p><p>Most of the people who populate the continent have little or no knowledge of lands outside Faerûn. Only the more educated or well traveled among the populace are aware that Faerûn is but one continent and that Toril is the whole of the world. For most, “Faerûn” is quite large enough.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Nearly every major power of Faerûn has its own currency minted within its borders that represent both its influence and material wealth. Most coins of pure composition and standard weight are accepted across the continent, though not every city-state or nation bothers to mint every sort of coin. The standard used to set the weight and value of coins is Waukeen’s <em>Golden Coin</em>, a relic that lies on sacred scales in the city of Schamedar in Calimshan.</p><p>Some of the most commonly found and widely accepted currencies in the Realms are summarized below. Each grouping is arranged in order of value: copper, silver, electrum, gold, and (when present) platinum. Most people refer to coins by whatever name the issuing government uses, regardless of origin, except for Zhentil Keep—for some reason, Zhentarim coins have unflattering epithets associated with them:</p><p><strong>Amn:</strong> Fander, taran, centaur, danter, roldon</p><p><strong>Calimshan: </strong>Unarche, decarche, centarche, bicenta, kilarche</p><p><strong>Cormyr: </strong>Thumb, falcon, blue eye, golden lion, tricrown</p><p><strong>Sembia: </strong>Steelpence (an iron coin), hawk, blue eye, noble</p><p><strong>Silverymoon:</strong> Glint, shield, sword, dragon, unicorn</p><p><strong>Waterdeep: </strong>Nib, shard, sambar, dragon, sun</p><p><strong>Zhentil Keep: </strong>Fang (“dung-piece”), talon/naal (“flea-bit”), tarenth (“hardhammer”), glory (“weeping wolf”), platinum glory (“flat metal gem”)</p>"

Children are told stories of great adventurers like Storm Silverhand, Drizzt Do’Urden, and Alias. While most people eventually put away their dreams of heroic adventure in favor of more practical matters, a few leave their homes to embark on a life of peril, hoping to become heroes who find great rewards. Individuals who suffer great tragedy in their lives might turn to adventuring out of desperation. Some adventurers are forced into the occupation when they or others are placed in sudden danger. A few individuals simply grow bored with their lives and dream of something more, becoming adventurers to reinvent themselves or find new meaning in their lives.</p><p>The common folk of Faerûn look on adventurers with a mixture of admiration, envy, and mistrust. An adventurer willing to risk their life on behalf of a complete stranger deserves applause and a reward, and many are envious that adventurers live their lives on their own terms, untrammeled by custom or convention.</p><p>But adventurers are also dangerous, possessing skills and magic beyond the reach of Faerûn’s common folk. Their lives are violent, and where they go, chaos follows. Many adventuring parties have descended into an ancient crypt only to unwittingly release a horrifying evil on an unsuspecting world. And a successful adventurer amasses wealth and power very quickly—perhaps too quickly for rulers to monitor or for the law to handle.</p><p>Regardless, authority figures often turn to adventurers to solve unusual problems. Towns and cities typically have a budget set aside for hiring adventurers.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Although a number of means exist for marking the days and the passage of time during a year, nearly all folk in Faerûn have adopted the Calendar of Harptos.</p><p>In the Calendar of Harptos, a year on Toril consists of 365 days, divided into twelve months of thirty days, loosely following the cycle of Selûne, the moon. A month is made up of three tendays, also known as rides. Five annual holidays, falling between the months, complete the calendar. Once every four years, Shieldmeet occurs as a leap day following Midsummer.</p><p>Individual days of a tenday have no special names. Instead, they are denoted by counting from the beginning of the period (“first day,” “second day,” and so on). Days of the month are designated by a number and the month name (for example, “1 Mirtul” or “27 Uktar”). People might also refer to a given day by its relationship to the current date (“two tendays from today”) or the nearest holiday (“three days past Greengrass”).</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Calendar of Harptos</h3><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\"><p>Month</p></th><th scope=\"col\"><p>Name</p></th><th scope=\"col\"><p>Common Name</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">1</p></td><td><p>Hammer</p></td><td><p>Deepwinter</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Annual Holiday: Midwinter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">2</p></td><td><p>Alturiak</p></td><td><p>The Claw of Winter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">3</p></td><td><p>Ches</p></td><td><p>The Claw of Sunsets</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">4</p></td><td><p>Tarsakh</p></td><td><p>The Claw of Storms</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Annual Holiday: Greengrass</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">5</p></td><td><p>Mirtul</p></td><td><p>The Melting</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">6</p></td><td><p>Kythorn</p></td><td><p>The Time of Flowers</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">7</p></td><td><p>Flamerule</p></td><td><p>Summertide</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Annual Holiday: Midsummer</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Quadrennial Holiday: Shieldmeet</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">8</p></td><td><p>Eleasis</p></td><td><p>Highsun</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">9</p></td><td><p>Eleint</p></td><td><p>The Fading</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Annual Holiday: Highharvestide</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">10</p></td><td><p>Marpenoth</p></td><td><p>Leaffall</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">11</p></td><td><p>Uktar</p></td><td><p>The Rotting</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Annual Holiday: Feast of the Moon</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">12</p></td><td><p>Nightal</p></td><td><p>The Drawing Down</p></td></tr></tbody></table></aside><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.ox0LAi1ry8lB4TRc caption=false classes=\"float-right size-three\"]</p><h3>Special Calendar Days</h3><p>Every realm, faith, and culture across Faerûn has its own special festivals and holidays, the observances of which are governed by the cycles of the sun, the moon, the stars, or some other event. In addition, the Calendar of Harptos specifies five annual festivals keyed to the changing of the seasons and one quadrennial festival that are observed in almost every land, with particular celebrations varying based on local traditions and popular faiths.</p><h4>Midwinter</h4><p>The first festival day of the year is Midwinter, though some people name it differently. Nobles and monarchs of the Heartlands call it the High Festival of Winter, a day to commemorate or renew alliances. Commoners in the North, the Moonsea, and other colder climes celebrate it as Deadwinter Day, the midpoint of the cold season, with some of the worst days now past.</p><h4>Greengrass</h4><p>The traditional spring festival, Greengrass is celebrated with freshly cut flowers (grown in special hothouses where necessary) given as gifts to the gods or spread among the fields in hopes of a bountiful growing season.</p><h4>Midsummer</h4><p>The midpoint of summer is a day of feasting, carousing, betrothals, and basking in the pleasant weather. Storms on Midsummer night are seen as bad omens and signs of ill fortune, and sometimes interpreted as divine disapproval of the romances begun or marriages promised that day.</p><h4>Shieldmeet</h4><p>The great holiday of the Calendar of Harptos, Shieldmeet occurs once every four years immediately after Midsummer. It is a day for plain speaking and open council between rulers and their subjects, renewing pacts and contracts, and forging treaties. Many tournaments and contests of skill are held on Shieldmeet, and most faiths mark the holiday by emphasizing one of their key tenets. The next Shieldmeet will be in 1504 DR (see the “Realms Timeline” sidebar).</p><h4>Highharvestide</h4><p>A day of feasting and thanks, Highharvestide marks the fall harvest. Most people give thanks to Chauntea on this day for a plentiful bounty before winter approaches. Many who make their living by traveling long distances by road or sea set out immediately following the holiday, before winter blocks mountain passes and harbors.</p><h4>Feast of the Moon</h4><p>As nights lengthen and winter winds approach, the Feast of the Moon is the time when people celebrate their ancestors and honored dead. During festivals on this day, people gather to share stories and legends, offer prayers for the fallen, and prepare for the coming cold.</p><h3>Keeping Time from Day to Day</h3><p>Most people don’t keep track of the time of day beyond notions such as “midmorning” or “near sunset.” If people plan to meet at a particular time, they base their arrangements around such expressions.</p><p>The concept of hours and minutes exists mainly where wealthy people use clocks, but mechanical clocks are often unreliable and rarely set consistently. If a local temple or civic structure has a clock that tolls the passing of the hours, people refer to hours as “bells,” as in “I’ll meet you at seven bells.”</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Realms Timeline</h3><p>This timeline provides a summary of Faerûn’s history. Dates are provided in Dalereckoning (DR). Beginning with the year –700 DR, years have a name found in the Roll of Years, prophetic writings by the Netherese mage Augathra and expanded by Alaundo of Candlekeep:</p><p><strong>Days of Thunder (–35000 DR to –30000 DR). </strong>Water recedes to reveal the supercontinent of Merrouroboros, eventually inhabited by the so-called creator-races.</p><p><strong>Dawn Age (–30000 DR to –24000 DR). </strong>The empires of the creator-races fade, replaced by realms of dragons and giants. These two great peoples wage mighty war for centuries.</p><p><strong>First Flowering (–24000 DR to –12000 DR).</strong> Elven civilizations supplant those of the dragons and giants. In –17600, elven high magic creates Evermeet and brings a cataclysm to Toril known as the Sundering.</p><p><strong>Crown Wars (–12000 DR to –9000 DR).</strong> Elves war with each other for generations.</p><p><strong>Founding Time (–9000 DR to –3000 DR).</strong> As elven influence declines, other realms arise, including Imaskar, Netheril, Rashemen, and Unther. The genies Calim and Memnon are bound.</p><p><strong>Age of Humanity (–3000 DR to 1000 DR).</strong> Realms ruled by humans—including the Mulhorand, Narfell, and Raumathar empires—spread across and dominate Faerûn.</p><p><strong>Present Age Begins (1000 DR).</strong> The present age is one of conflict, adventure, and global crises.</p><p><strong>Time of Troubles (1358 DR). </strong>Deities wander the land as mortals and war against each other.</p><p><strong>Netheril Returns (1372 DR).</strong> The floating city of Thultanthar returns to Anauroch from the Shadowfell, and Shadovar begin rebuilding their empire.</p><p><strong>Spellplague (1385 DR).</strong> Cyric and Shar murder Mystra, triggering a series of disasters. Toril is briefly merged with the world of Abeir.</p><p><strong>Second Sundering</strong> <strong>(1482 DR to 1489 DR). </strong>Abeir and Toril separate again, and over several years, many of the effects of the Spellplague are reversed.</p><p><strong>Present (1501 DR). </strong>The current year is the Year of the Shining Mythal.</p></aside>"

          "text": "<p>This book is your comprehensive guide to creating and playing a character in the awe-inspiring Forgotten Realms.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofCh1CharacterO]{Chapter 1: Character Options}</h2><p>Chapter 1 helps you create the next hero of the Forgotten Realms. In addition to new character options—subclasses, backgrounds, and feats—this chapter provides an overview of the species of Faerûn and each one’s place in the world.</p><p>Adventuring is a well-known occupation in Faerûn, and there’s no shortage of common sellswords or petty mages rummaging around in old ruins hoping to find hidden treasure or a long-lost spellbook. And yet, in the Forgotten Realms, characters stand out among these adventurers as epic figures, even beginning at level 1.</p><p>Throughout the history of the Forgotten Realms, epic heroes are distinguished from everyday adventurers by their extraordinary natures. Alias, hero of <em>Curse of the Azure Bonds</em>, is an artificial person created by an alliance of evil spellcasters that included a lich and cultists of Moander, god of corruption and rot. Karlach, one of the heroes of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, has a magical <em>Infernal Engine</em> for a heart, which grants her incredible power but brings unusual, life-threatening complications. Several heroes of the Forgotten Realms, such as Tristan Kendrick and Randall Morn, have been heirs to a throne. You can use the nature of these heroes, and others who’ve adventured across Faerûn, as inspiration for your own character’s epic nature.</p><p>Beyond their nature, an epic character is distinguished by their destiny. Perhaps your character is fated to wield a powerful Artifact or become the ruler of a realm. When creating a character for a Forgotten Realms campaign, work with your DM to develop an epic destiny for your character. <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em> has additional guidance on crafting epic characters and how their stories might play out in a campaign.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofAGuideToTheRe]{Chapter 2: A Guide to the Realms}</h2><p>Every corner of Faerûn has a distinct flavor born out of local stories, traditions, notable personalities, and memorable locales. Chapter 2 describes many locations across Faerûn that might have played a crucial role in your character’s origins—perhaps where your character grew up or where they learned their adventuring skills. The backgrounds in chapter 1 can connect your character to those locations.</p><p>For example, a Sorcerer might have mastered wild magic while studying under the Simbarchs of Aglarond, a land that’s been ruled by sorcerers for generations. A Fighter might have gained bitter battlefield experience serving Sembia in border disputes with the Dalelands or Cormyr.</p><h3>A Living History</h3><p>The Forgotten Realms are littered with ruins of ancient civilizations that fell millennia ago. These once-mighty societies still play a role in everyday life in Faerûn. A tall tower from the giant kingdom of Ostoria might have been scavenged for stones that now make up a humble crafter’s cottage. An ancient relic of Narfell demon worshipers is now used by a blacksmith to stoke their forge. Sheep graze in the shadow of once-mighty Myth Drannor. What contact has your character had with these fallen realms, and how did that contact influence your character’s motivations and behaviors?</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.bIlxMPuWcxjmOXsw caption=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofGodsOfFaerun0]{Chapter 3: Gods of Faerûn}</h2><p>Faerûn is a land of many gods, and chapter 3 describes many of these gods. Most folk offer prayer or other forms of worship to several gods, though they might feel closest to a particular deity that is a patron of their occupation or to which they have some other special connection. For example, a merchant who gives daily obeisance to Waukeen, the god of trade, might offer up a propitiatory prayer to Umberlee, god of the sea, when faced with a long and difficult voyage.</p><p>Every city boasts multiple temples to various gods, and shrines can be found in the smallest village, along roads, or even deep in the wilderness. Temples and shrines are staffed and maintained by priests, most of whom have minor spellcasting abilities, but Clerics, who channel their magic directly from the Outer Planes, are rare.</p><p>Think about your character’s relationship with the gods. Which gods does your character consider especially important or relevant? For example, a character who is a Ranger or has the Farmer, Guide, or Hermit background might feel a personal connection to Chauntea, a god of agriculture, or Mielikki, a god of the forest. Are you—or do you aspire to become—one of your god’s Chosen?</p><p>Conversely, what gods does your character especially resent or avoid? Your character might seek to thwart those who carry out those gods’ divine agenda. Such deities might embody the opposite of your character’s values. For example, a character that reveres Chauntea or Mielikki might despise Malar, a god of the hunt, or Auril, a god of winter, both of which represent nature in an evil, destructive form. Or you might carry a special enmity toward one of Malar’s Chosen.</p><p>While most ordinary people in Faerûn speak to deities only through priests or the occasional divine messenger, characters in a Forgotten Realms campaign might meet a deity face to face, though the deity might have been in disguise. If your character wields divine magic, they might have gained their connection to the Outer Planes when they met a deity.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofAurorasWholeR]{Chapter 4: Aurora’s Whole Realms Catalog}</h2><p>No adventurer is complete without a wide array of adventuring gear. Chapter 4 provides an excerpt from the famed <em>Aurora’s Whole Realms Catalog</em> to help equip your characters with new gear. Aurora was a former adventurer who outfitted heroes across Faerûn, and the business she founded is now led by her descendant.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.VMiT64U6wMD9urwm caption=false]</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofMagicOfFaerun]{Chapter 5: Magic of Faerûn}</h2><p>Magic is woven into the very fabric of Faerûn. Chapter 5 discusses how magic works in the Forgotten Realms, including new spells, and introduces circle magic—a way for characters to cooperate in casting spells.</p><p>The fundamental framework through which magic functions is called the Weave. Mages, priests, and druids who work magic draw upon and manipulate the Weave, and damage to the Weave can be catastrophic, as was the case in the Spellplague and other disasters.</p><p>The vast majority of magic in the Realms is humble and geared toward practical matters: healing wounds, assisting with a craft, entertaining crowds, or accomplishing menial tasks. Mages are common, creating a large demand for magical academies across Faerûn. While many mages turn their command of magic into a professional career, others retreat from society to a life of study and magical experimentation.</p><p>Magic affects everyone in Faerûn, from common farmers and crafters to adventurers and monarchs. Even if you’re making a character that doesn’t cast spells, magic might have affected your character’s life, their family, or their occupation. Perhaps your family has a magical heirloom that’s passed down through the generations, or perhaps a magical creature—like a dragon, genie, or lycanthrope—is lurking somewhere in your family tree. Does your character view magic as a mystery worth exploring or simply as a utilitarian method of solving difficult problems?</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofFactionsOfThe]{Chapter 6: Factions of the Realms}</h2><p>Faerûn is home to powerful, realm-spanning organizations that can be powerful allies or fearsome foes. Faerûn’s factions are described briefly below and detailed further in chapter 6:</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofCultOfTheDrag]{Cult of the Dragon}. </strong>Although this faction is most known for evil plots, the worship of Tiamat, and turning dragons into dracoliches, adventurers can get caught in their schemes.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofEmeraldEnclav]{Emerald Enclave}. </strong>This organization of druids, rangers, and others protects the wilderness and those traveling through it.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofHarpers000000]{Harpers}. </strong>The Harpers are a legendary band of do-gooders who combat tyranny across Faerûn while keeping a low profile.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofLordsAlliance]{Lords’ Alliance}. </strong>A coalition of independent cities along the Sword Coast, the Lords’ Alliance stands for peace, trade, and mutual self-interest.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofOrderOfTheGau]{Order of the Gauntlet}. </strong>An organization of warriors motivated by faith in gods of goodness and justice, the Order seeks out evil and destroys it with force of arms.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofPurpleDragonK]{Purple Dragon Knights}.</strong> Cormyr’s legendary knights now travel Faerûn on dragon steeds, hunting Aberrations and furthering the cause of their queen.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRedWizards000]{Red Wizards}.</strong> Although their home is in the eastern realm of Thay, Red Wizards travel throughout Faerûn to increase their personal power, seeking out magic in all its forms.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofZhentarim0000]{Zhentarim}.</strong> This vast criminal syndicate provides everything from mercenary work and travel services to murder-for-hire, operating openly in cities throughout Faerûn.</p><p>Many of these factions have associated character backgrounds presented in chapter 1. By taking one of those backgrounds, your character becomes a member of that faction. But characters can also be a member of a faction without taking a particular background, and many characters join a faction later in their adventuring career.</p><p>What faction might your character be a member of or aspire to join? And what faction might they oppose?</p><h2>Other Resources</h2><p>No single book could include every detail of the Forgotten Realms, a setting many decades in the making. <em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn</em> is only part of Faerûn’s grand story.</p><p>Your most important companion to this book is <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em>. There, you’ll find five chapters that expand on five regions of the Forgotten Realms, providing much more detail on locations, people, and the environments therein, as well as showcasing the unique kinds of adventures that take place there:</p><p><strong>The Dalelands</strong>, home to classic fantasy adventure (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.lrG0hZ4y4gGV9hm9]{Heartlands}” in chapter 2)</p><p><strong>Icewind Dale</strong>, a frigid land of survival horror (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.yZ5xT59147vpYT3a]{The North}” in chapter 2)</p><p><strong>Calimshan</strong>, a high magic setting of genies and magical innovation (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.Yf67N3CqAiJ9uqt9]{Lands of Intrigue}” in chapter 2)</p><p><strong>The Moonshae Isles</strong>, filled with fairy stories and tales of adventure at sea (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.h0kXnfziUK0UMaVb]{Trackless Sea}” in chapter 2)</p><p><strong>Baldur’s Gate</strong>, an urban setting of morally ambiguous heroes and antiheroes. (See “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.LNXJszscTv3MeV0z]{Sword Coast}” in chapter 2.)</p><p>That book also includes new magic items and monsters, as well as many adventures set in the Realms, including a complete starting adventure to launch a new campaign.</p><p>Two digital products have been designed to supplement this book and your games in the Realms. You can find these titles on DnDBeyond.com:</p><p><em><strong>Astarion’s Book of Hungers</strong> </em>focuses on Astarion, the elf vampire from the <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>video game.</p><p><em><strong>Netheril’s Fall</strong></em> provides insight into the ancient empire of Netheril and its magic. (See “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.txXoVRFe1w35Mi83]{Anauroch}” in chapter 2.)</p><p>Many books in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons line detail locations in the Forgotten Realms, which can be helpful if you want to make a character from that region. Here are some of those books:</p><p><em><strong>Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus</strong></em> provides further detail on the city of Baldur’s Gate.</p><p><em><strong>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</strong></em> has additional details on Ten-Towns and the North.</p><p><em><strong>Tomb of Annihilation</strong></em> describes the jungles of Chult.</p><p><em><strong>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</strong></em> explores the city of Waterdeep on the Sword Coast.</p><h3>Novels</h3><p>Hundreds of novels have been set in the Forgotten Realms. A great place to start is the <em>Legend of Drizzt </em>series by R.A. Salvatore.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><p><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is an epic game set in and around the city of Baldur’s Gate (described in the “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.LNXJszscTv3MeV0z]{Sword Coast}” section of chapter 2 and in more detail in <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em>). The <em>Neverwinter</em> massively multiplayer online roleplaying game is another way to play in the Forgotten Realms.</p><h3>Movies</h3><p>The movie <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> takes place in the Forgotten Realms and includes factions such as the Harpers and the Red Wizards, places such as Neverwinter and Icewind Dale, and infamous characters such as Szass Tam and Themberchaud.</p>"

Others, like the greedy Zhentarim or the power-hungry Red Wizards, oppress their victims and focus on amassing power. Your character can join any of these factions, earning rewards for loyal service. Or, your character might oppose a faction and brave its ire.</p><p>Welcome to the Forgotten Realms, a world of epic characters and adventures!</p>"

Although born to parents throughout the Forgotten Realms, aasimar are so unusual that no realm, city, or town is made up primarily of aasimar. Instead, individual aasimar grow up within the society and culture of their parents, and their outlook is shaped by the tension between that culture and the aasimar’s connection to the Upper Planes.</p><h4>Fish out of Water</h4><p>In much of the Realms, an aasimar often feels like an outsider. When aasimar are children, their celestial nature easily goes unnoticed or is hidden by concerned family members. But eventually that nature becomes impossible to conceal. This is a dangerous time for aasimar, for Shar and other evil deities—and their worshipers—prey on innocent aasimar ignorant of their true nature and full power.</p><p>Throughout an aasimar’s life, they frequently receive visions, prophetic dreams, or powerful feelings that hint at their destiny. Sometimes these prophetic instincts are sent by the aasimar’s angelic ancestor, but they can just as easily be uncontrolled manifestations of <br />celestial power.</p><h4>Celestial Patrons</h4><p>Many aasimar are found or adopted by followers of a good deity, such as angels or animal lords—or even by a good deity themself. Their connection to this celestial being informs the aasimar’s life separate from the culture into which they were born.

But dragonborn are as old as Toril and have long lived in the shadow of dragons and other folk.</p><h4>Abeir and Tymanther</h4><p>Dragonborn were widespread on the world of Abeir, notably in the realm called Tymanchebar. When Abeir and Toril merged during the Spellplague, Tymanchebar came to Faerûn, displacing the realm of Unther. From this devastation, dragonborn of Tymanchebar and refugees from Unther formed the realm of Tymanther. Tymanther’s culture was a fusion of Tymanchebar’s customs and the ways of the Old Empires, valuing honor, tradition, and family.</p><p>But the Second Sundering saw Unther return, and Tymanther is no more. Many dragonborn who once lived there have scattered across Faerûn, bringing Tymanther’s ways with them.</p><h4>Hidden in History</h4><p>Not all dragonborn come from Tymanther and Abeir. They are, however, rare and have often been mistaken for other species of similar appearance. After all, Faerûn has never had a shortage of dragons, and uneducated folk might easily mistake dragonborn for lizardfolk, troglodytes, or any number of other creatures.</p><p>Dragonborn trace their origin to the god Io; in Faerûn, Io is known as Asgorath the World Shaper, Creator of Dragonkind. Asgorath’s worship is extremely ancient, going back to the Dawn Age, and dragonborn were far more prevalent in Faerûn during that time.</p><h4>Dragonborn Today</h4><p>Dragonborn can now be found throughout Faerûn. Many reside in the Old Empires, in villages and towns settled primarily by refugees from Tymanther, and there they preserve Tymantherian customs. Dragonborn have also adapted easily to the intense heat of the Calim Desert; some live in the cities of noble genies, while others serve in Sultana Songal’s honor guard.</p>"

While some settlements and regions are dominated entirely by a single clan, it’s not unusual to find clans living alongside each other, especially in cities. The Dwarvish language uses a set of runes called Dethek.</p><h4>Shield and Gold Dwarves</h4><p>The two most common dwarven ethnicities are shield dwarves and gold dwarves.</p><p>Shield dwarves are common in the North and Sword Coast regions. Their greatest surviving city is Citadel Adbar, near Silverymoon. Shield dwarves have a long experience with war, which has made them slow to trust but steadfast in their loyalty. Their creations are sturdy and practical, lacking in decoration but designed for long, reliable use.</p><p>Gold dwarves, in contrast, are more populous in south and east Faerûn, including the Great Rift south of Unther. These lands have grown up in relative peace and prosperity, and so gold dwarves embrace trade and travel while welcoming strangers. The work of gold dwarf artisans often includes elaborate designs and embellishments that don’t get in the way of a tool’s usefulness.</p><h4>Duergar</h4><p>Duergar (as seen in <em>Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</em>) are dwarves shaped by the Underdark and the horrifying threats that dwell there. For millennia they were experimented upon by mind flayers.

Prominent communities exist in Amn, in Chondalwood, and along the Sea of Fallen Stars.</p><h4>Surrounded by Big Folk</h4><p>Halfling history is colored by the constant presence of bigger, threatening species that surround halfling communities. While some folk might turn inward in the face of constant threat, halfling tradition is to embrace the cultures of larger neighbors, befriending them and blending in. History teaches that eventually halflings become inconspicuous, and in this way halfling communities survive and thrive.</p><h4>Lightfoots and Stronghearts</h4><p>In the Forgotten Realms, halflings broadly divide themselves into the lightfoot or strongheart lifestyles. But these categories are permeable, and halflings might move from one group to the other many times in their life.</p><p>Lightfoot halflings (never call them lightfeet) live on the move. They seek out new experiences and new company, exploring and making new friends. Lightfoots travel light, and they need to be resourceful and quick to adapt to changing conditions.

Because humans are so numerous, most settlements, factions, and institutions in Faerûn are made up mostly of humans, even if their leadership is another species. But the simple fact that humans are so numerous belies their countless cultural divisions. Human culture varies widely from one realm to another. They speak dozens of different languages and war on each other more than any other species.</p><h4>Ancient Origins</h4><p>Humans are unusual in that they are among the most ancient species on Faerûn, but for much of that time they went largely unnoticed and had no great influence on world affairs. No one is quite certain where they came from; one theory, based on the Common language’s origin in Sigil, is that humans came to Toril from the Outlands.</p><p>Regardless, more than thirty thousand years ago, humans inhabited the supercontinent of Merrouroboros and lived in the shadow of the creator races. They had no permanent settlements, no written language, and no tools more advanced than the club.</p><p>But slowly this changed as humans came into contact with dragons and giants and then with elves, dwarves, and other peoples. By the Founding Time, approximately nine thousand years ago, human cultures were building cities and empires. In the time since, humans have spread across Faerûn and played an outsize role in history.</p><h4>Diverse Ethnicities</h4><p>War and trade have spread humans across Faerûn. The cataclysmic war between the Narfell empire and the Raumathar people scattered refugees throughout the east. The Raumathar became the Rashemi, settling in the Arcane Empires, while survivors from Narfell settled around the Sea of Fallen Stars and became the Damarans.</p><p>In the west, Chondathan humans established trade routes and settlements, their culture changing rapidly from one region to the next. Humans along the Sword Coast formed the seafaring Illuskan culture while, to their south, humans escaping the tyranny of genie overlords became the Calishites.

But for the most part, orcs coexist peacefully with all manner of folk, especially in difficult and dangerous environments where their natural gifts prove the difference between life and death.</p><h4>A Wandering People</h4><p>Orcs first came to Toril from other worlds. Legends tell that when Faerûn was divided among the various species, dwarves claimed the mountains, elves the forests, and so on, until no land was left for orcs when they arrived. Undeterred, Gruumsh simply declared his people would live everywhere, and they’ve been a wandering people ever since.</p><p>They founded settlements in lands too inhospitable for other folk, especially in mountainous regions such as the Spine of the World and the Sword Mountains, near Waterdeep. But over the centuries, orcs have departed these homelands, individually or in bands, to travel the world and seek out new places to live.</p><h4>Kingdom of Many-Arrows</h4><p>The greatest orc realm in Faerûn’s recent history was established in 1371 DR by King Obould Many-Arrows, a Chosen servitor of Gruumsh.

Even in cities, tiefling communities are small enough for everyone to know each other and share methods of coexisting within the larger non-tiefling population.</p><p>A few regions, however, have been home to significant populations of tieflings for centuries. Aglarond, a land associated with sorcerers and training in sorcery, has long been a haven for tieflings eager to control their fiendish powers. The presence of gods and demigods throughout the Old Empires region has made tieflings almost common there, and tieflings with an infernal legacy have adapted easily to the harsh environments of Calimshan and can often find a place in the court of efreet living in the Calim Desert.

Members are referred to as soldiers and are treated as an elite military order, with defection punished by death.

Still others contend that Xanathar isn’t an individual but rather a metaphor for a set of villainous ideals.

The cult recruits new members in major cities, where many cultists engage in legitimate business or are assigned to ordinary academic research. Only a few serve as thieves, assassins, and spies.</p><p>At its outset, the Cult of the Dragon primarily concerned itself with the creation and worship of dracoliches—powerful undead dragons the cult believes will inevitably rule Faerûn—through rituals detailed in the <em>Tome of the Dragon</em>. More recently, however, the cult has splintered, with many within the cult committing themselves to Tiamat, the evil Queen of Dragons. This splinter group elevates Tiamat above other divinities and looks forward to the Dragon Queen’s return, believing that she—not dracoliches—will destroy civilization, usher in a glorious reign of dragons, and reward those who helped bring about draconic rule.</p><p>Dragon-themed symbolism and iconography pervade the cult’s regalia: a cape or cloak cut to resemble dragon wings, plus clothing, jewelry, and draconic accessories reflecting the wearer’s favorite type of dragon. Masks—especially masks of dragons—are common at cult gatherings, and many cultists craft their own masks.</p><p>Cultists avoid wearing this regalia in public, but anyone who knows what to look for can often pick an incognito dragon cultist out of a crowd.

          "text": "<p>The cult has a simple hierarchical structure, consisting of initiates on the bottom, four ranks for cultists, and one highest rank for the Wearers of Purple—the leaders and cult masters of particular locales. The cult is ruled by secretive Wearers of Purple called wyrmspeakers—a term of respect given to those whose bond with dragons is supernaturally strong.</p><p>Rank in the cult is based on merit and fanaticism. As raw recruits, initiates have no rank and follow the orders of their superiors. Only initiates that prove their worth can advance. A Wearer of Purple can promote an initiate along the track of dragonclaw (first rank), dragonwing (second rank), dragonfang (third rank), and dragonsoul (fourth rank).</p><p>Cult operation groups vary in size, from a few low-ranking cultists operating on their own to hundreds of cultists of various ranks under the control of multiple Wearers of Purple, depending on their assigned tasks.</p><h4>Cells</h4><p>The Cult of the Dragon consists of countless cells spread across Faerûn. Each cell is led by one or more Wearers of Purple who report to the cult’s wyrmspeakers, typically via magical correspondence. Cells have their own agendas but must conform with the wyrmspeakers’ doctrine or else face expulsion from the order.</p><p>Low-ranking cultists have little reason and few opportunities to interact with cultists outside their own cell.</p><h4>Recruitment</h4><p>The Cult of the Dragon is always seeking to expand its ranks. New recruits are encouraged to bring trusted family members and friends for conversion. The next most common form of recruitment is tried-and-true abduction combined with cult indoctrination. Cultists also sometimes recruit undead, fey, or other monsters.</p><p>Cult leaders aren’t opposed to hiring mercenaries for specific jobs or when ranks are thin. The cult casts a wide net with vaguely worded fliers on job boards or shadowy brokers posted in dark tavern corners; higher-ranking cultists then cherry-pick the most promising (that is, manipulable) prospects. In this way, countless soldiers of fortune, run-of-the-mill toughs, and even seasoned adventurers have unwittingly undertaken missions for the cult. Some complete their job none the wiser of their involvement in the cult’s schemes. Others discover the ruse in time to flee. An unsavory few catch on to the true nature of their work and use the opportunity to seek admission to the cult.</p><h4>Wearers of Purple</h4><p>The Wearers of Purple stand at the top of the cult’s hierarchy, and their word is law for the cultists in the cities, strongholds, and lairs they command. They are the only members of the cult to wear purple, and most are proud enough to flaunt the color. The Wearers of Purple have an affinity for talking to and negotiating with dragons—the gift of wyrmspeaking. Dozens of Wearers of Purple are spread throughout the Cult of the Dragon, and all can marshal the cult’s resources at will.</p><p>Only the cult’s inner circle can promote a dragonsoul to a Wearer of Purple, granting that character a base of operations and funds. Most new Wearers of Purple have already developed a working relationship with a dragon or dracolich as part of their power and authority. Those who don’t cultivate this relationship are sometimes demoted. Several priests of Tiamat have recently been made Wearers of Purple and are establishing temples for her open worship in Faerûn.</p><p><em><strong>Wyrmspeakers. </strong></em>Five Wearers of Purple conduct the cult’s farthest-reaching plans. The members of this inner circle each wear a different colored dragon mask that hides their true identities. They call themselves wyrmspeakers, and members of the cult fear their power over dragons. Each wyrmspeaker has an affinity for a particular color of chromatic dragon. They treat with dragons of those colors to recruit more dragons to the cause, and plan cult missions that advance the cult’s plots.</p><h4>Leaving the Cult</h4><p>Once initiated, a cultist belongs to the cult for life. Those who escape the cult spend the rest of their days fearful of every shadow and stranger, for the cult doesn’t take kindly to deserters. In exceptionally rare cases, a cult member might be excommunicated yet allowed to live. The price of this mercy is never cheap; exiled cultists must usually give up all their memories to mind-obliterating magic or commit some unspeakable act the cult can later use as blackmail if needed.</p>"

They quarrel with followers of Lathander over whether Lathander is an aspect of Amaunator or is a separate deity. Either way, Lathander represents the optimistic light of dawn, while Amaunator represents the sun in all aspects. At times, the sun is warm and encouraging; at others, harsh and unforgiving. What matters most is that it reliably rises each day and sets each night.</p><p>When Amaunator sends a messenger, its presence is unmistakable: a <strong>Couatl </strong>or a seemingly ordinary bird with gleaming eyes like miniature suns descends from the heavens in a shaft of bright light.

If she deigns to speak to a mortal, her voice whispers like icy needles on the cold wind, or she sends a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmYeti0000000000]{Yeti}</strong> or an <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmAirElemental00]{Air Elemental}</strong> to speak on her behalf.</p><p>Auril is worshiped in regions affected by deep winters, notably Icewind Dale during the supernaturally long night known as the Everlasting Rime. Individuals propitiate Auril with offerings and prayers for mercy. Few favor Auril, except those who make their livelihood from winter or those who truly love the season. Worshipers stock food, fuel, and other sources of comfort and warmth, which they sacrifice to Auril for deliverance from harsh winters. In times of deep desperation, however, sapient beings might be left in the deadly cold as a sacrifice to the Frostmaiden.</p><p>Auril’s priests tend to be people who would, but for their status, be outcasts from their communities. They avoid personal relationships, remaining aloof when not serving in their official capacity. Her priests warn local residents to prepare for winter and stock extra provisions so they have offerings for Auril.</p><p>The rituals of Auril’s worship seem cruel to outsiders. In Luskan, Auril’s temple is the Winter Palace, a roofless array of pillars and arches carved of white stone. Visitors gather here to watch a ritual in which supplicants don garments packed with ice. These supplicants then journey between six white pillars known as the Kisses of Auril, dispersed throughout the city. The worshipers move from pillar to pillar, chanting prayers to the god. On reaching a pillar, a supplicant must climb it and touch the rusty iron plate at the top. In winter, these events resemble frantic footraces, with the added risk of frostbite and injuries caused by falling from the slippery pillars.</p><p>Auril’s Chosen are spies or assassins who root out the agents of her enemies. She has invested few known Chosen, the most prominent being the Harper agent Artus Cimber.</p>"

Where Mystra is a god of magic in all its forms and manifestations, Azuth is the lord of spellcasting, the Art of giving shape to the raw power of the Weave. As the Aphorism of the High One says, “Where Mystra is force, Azuth grants form.” His priests claim that spellcasters who meditate on the Aphorism reach new understanding of the Art.</p><p>The myths of Azuth portray the First Magister as being deeply in love with Mystra, which his priests say isn’t idle gossip but the proper approach of any magic-user to magic itself: the Art must be wooed and treated with equal parts adoration and reverence, cultivated like a lifelong love. But Azuth is less concerned with good and evil than Mystra, and he tolerates evil spellcasters as long as they don’t deceive or spread chaos. Azuth is friendly with Oghma, who shares his neutral outlook. Azuth wields the <em>Old Staff</em>, an Artifact of incalculable arcane power marked with sigils and topped by a shape-changing crystal. He communicates with his worshipers through a manifestation of the <em>Magic Mouth</em> spell with a gray beard and mustache, by sending a gray animal such as a cat or owl, or—in extreme cases—a sphinx.</p><p>Azuth has few dedicated temples, but every temple to Mystra contains at least one shrine to Azuth within it or a chapel dedicated to him. His priests, the magistrati, host magic fairs and collect rare and unusual <em>Spell Scrolls</em> so the death of a spell’s inventor doesn’t leave their creation lost to time. Magistrati give away spellbooks to people with the potential to become spellcasters but who can’t afford to pursue their study. Some magistrati teach at schools of magic. Azuth’s priests spread and enforce the magebond, a social covenant among Faerûn’s spellcasters. The magebond stipulates that personal disputes between spellcasters shouldn’t attract the attention of or disturb mundane society. It encourages spellcasters to handle such issues among themselves, preferably in a peaceful way.</p><p>Azuth’s Chosen are called his Favored; they push the limits of magical research and arcane innovation, creating new ways to interact with and strengthen the Weave.</p>"

A tyrant who can seize power must do so; not only does the tyrant benefit, but so do those under the tyrant’s rule. When a ruler succumbs to decadence, corruption, or decrepitude, a stronger and more suitable ruler will rise. Bane is one of the Dead Three, a trio of gods including Bhaal and Myrkul who attained divinity when they absorbed the divine station of a former death god, Jergal, and were then slain during the Time of Troubles. Bane was the first of the three to return and has risen to a more prominent position than he ever held before his death.</p><p>Although Bane’s worshipers have committed dark deeds in his name, most of them don’t do so out of malice. Bane represents ambition and control, and those who have the former but lack the latter pray to him to give them strength. Bane favors those with drive and courage, and he aids those who seek to become conquerors, carve kingdoms from the wilderness, and bring order to the lawless.</p><p>Whatever form Bane takes, he is marked by his jet-black right hand. If he wishes to conceal his identity, he wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand. He appears to mortals in dreams as a powerful, shadowy figure in armor wearing a black, jeweled gauntlet. When he sends an emissary, it is usually a <strong>Horned Devil,</strong> or it could be a possessed <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmKnight00000000]{Knight}</strong> with pitch-black eyes who remembers nothing of the encounter later.</p><p>At many times and in many places in Faerûn, the faithful of Bane have been heralded as saviors for slaughtering raiders, throwing down corrupt rulers, or saving armies on the brink of defeat. But just as often, the worship of Bane has created or supported cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile monopolies, or subjugated entire populations. Priests of Bane wear a black-enameled gauntlet on one fist. Cults of Bane are particularly active in Baldur’s Gate, where noble patriar families are easily enraptured by Bane’s promises of power.</p><p>The power-hungry Chosen of Bane become warlords or otherwise amass followers to help them seize and consolidate power. Bane’s Chosen also act as whispering advisers, tempting and driving rulers to greater acts of cruelty and domination.</p><h4>Knights of the Black Gauntlet</h4><p>The Knights of the Black Gauntlet is a military order of crusaders dedicated to Bane. Based in the city of Mintar on the shores of the Lake of Steam, this organization is ruled with an iron fist by the Lord Knight Imperceptor of Bane. The Black Gauntlet’s roster boasts warriors and militant priests who are experienced in commanding troops and who are, in turn, prepared to execute orders without question.</p><p>Hopefuls join the order as soldiers (regardless of their class or background) and can expect to be treated as such. The rigid hierarchy of the Black Gauntlet ensures that only those who thrive in and master its unyielding structure can rise in rank. Soldiers follow their commanders on expeditions to secure borders, quell uprisings, and stamp out lawlessness that threatens stability.</p><p>Soldiers who show obedience to their superiors, demonstrate leadership, and inspire loyalty or fear might receive knighthood. Candidates for knighthood must demonstrate their leadership on a successful expedition without undermining the Black Gauntlet’s hierarchy. Those who are found worthy are promoted and given a contingent of soldiers to oversee. Many don a black gauntlet on one hand.

According to myth, Tyche became corrupted and died, but her essence then manifested in Beshaba and Tymora, two sisters who share influence over Tyche’s divine portfolio. Beshaba is petty and spiteful, and her actions and whims seem perplexing even to her followers. When Beshaba speaks directly to a mortal, her voice whispers from broken mirrors.

He lends power to those whose slaughters invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal inspires fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death. He is a member of a trio of deities known as the Dead Three alongside Bane and Myrkul.</p><p>Bhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his manifested form. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form: a hulking figure armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this hairless form, he wears only a tattered loincloth and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood. When he sends emissaries to carry his word, he usually tasks a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmDoppelganger00]{Doppelganger}</strong> in the guise of someone the recipient later learns was dead during the conversation, or he sends a vicious <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmMezzoloth00000]{Mezzoloth}</strong>.</p><p>While the folk of Faerûn don’t normally pray to Bhaal, some propitiate him when they want to commit murder. A person might have an understandable reason to resort to murder, such as when they’re unable to redress an injustice through lawful means, but it’s far more common for prayers to Bhaal to be uttered by murderers motivated by jealousy, greed, or wrath. It’s rare for anyone but assassins or compulsive killers to take Bhaal as a patron.</p><p>Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each led by a charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but organized worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely uncommon. Temples and shrines are similarly rare. Those who erect a shrine to Bhaal usually do so to thank him for a successful murder. Such shrines feature a skull or a severed head surrounded by drops of blood (both from the murdered victim). As with the other members of the Dead Three, Bhaal’s cult has infiltrated Baldur’s Gate on the Sword Coast, where a vast temple to the Lord of Murder is said to brood in the tunnels beneath the city.</p><p>Chosen of Bhaal are blood-soaked terrors with little or no capacity for empathy.

As a god of agriculture, she is especially popular among farmers and rural communities. The hearth and home also fall under her purview, and as such, people in cities pray to her at mealtimes or before the birth of a child. Some say Chauntea blessed the world with life when it was first formed.</p><p>Grand spectacles and displays of power hold no interest to Chauntea. She prefers quiet and small acts of devotion. The Grain Goddess seldom appears directly to mortals, nor does she send divine messengers. On the rare occasions when she communicates with her followers, she does so through words scrawled on freshly tilled soil or the rustling sound of wind through crops, sounding faintly like whispered speech.</p><p>Some worshipers of Chauntea celebrate fertility festivals each Greengrass, wherein they arrange freshly cut flowers in beautiful arrangements as offerings for the god in exchange for a speedy growing season. Later in the year, folk across Faerûn express gratitude to Chauntea on the holiday of Highharvestide, thanking her at sunset for the past year’s plentiful bounty as winter approaches.</p><p>Chauntea’s teachings are full of agricultural aphorisms and farming parables. Her faith teaches folk to nurture, tend, and plant wherever possible; anything torn down must have something new planted in its place. Temples of Chauntea are repositories of practical lore concerning farming and cultivation. Chauntea’s priests work closely with rural communities to ensure plentiful harvests and are happy to roll up their sleeves and dig their hands into the dirt. They dress humbly, wearing shades of beige and muted green.</p><p>It’s rare for Chauntea to select a Chosen, and it’s even rarer to spot one. They usually dress and comport themselves no differently than any other member of her following.</p><h4>Seeds of Cultivation</h4><p>The Seeds of Cultivation is a nomadic order of Chauntea dedicated to easing the pain of communities experiencing blight or famine. These worshipers travel wherever they are needed. Many know crop-yielding spells such as <em>Plant Growth</em>, but the cause of a blight or famine is often more complicated than a simple lack of fertile soil. The origin might be a mysterious curse on the land, or the dastardly work of cultists of Talona—in which case, swords or skulduggery often prove more useful than spells. For this reason, the Seeds welcome folk with all manner of abilities in their ranks.</p><p>The group typically recruits from farming communities. If a city dweller or other aspiring recruit unfamiliar with pastoral life seeks to join the order, the prospective member must first spend at least one year tending to crops in a rural community. At the end of the year, a representative from the Seeds visits the community to survey its people. If the folk vouch for the aspiring recruit’s work ethic and character, the Seeds of Cultivation welcomes the recruit into their ranks with open arms. (If your campaign uses renown, the Seeds of Cultivation might waive this requirement for characters who have a Renown Score of 5+ with the order.)</p><p>Like Chauntea herself, the Seeds of Cultivation cares little for pomp and circumstance. When initiating a new member, a group of Seeds makes a humble home-cooked meal and enjoys it with the recruit. At the end of the meal, the Seeds bestow on the recruit a wooden brooch depicting the symbol of Chauntea: a blooming rose over a sheaf of grain. Members of the Seeds of Cultivation wear these brooches prominently over their otherwise unassuming attire.</p><p>Anyone who grows crops recognizes the Seeds of Cultivation, and members of the order can lodge at any temple of Chauntea for as long as they wish.</p><p>Pestilence-bringing disciples of Talona rank among the Seeds’ foremost enemies, along with followers of Talos who bring about destruction for destruction’s sake. The Seeds typically count worshipers of nature deities among its allies, but the organization occasionally clashes with extremist druids of Silvanus who aim to turn cultivated farmland back into untamed wilds.</p>"

He went on to slay several other gods, stealing their portfolios. Aided by Shar, Cyric killed Mystra and caused the Spellplague. Today, many of the deities slain by Cyric have returned and wrenched back their portfolios. Ever petty and megalomaniacal, Cyric still believes himself the most powerful being in the universe. He whispers to his followers in haze-filled dreams and sends Undead riding <strong>Nightmares</strong> as his messengers.</p><p>Cyric’s faith is strong in any area where evil plots flourish. Individuals who seek to gain control over others flock to his worship. Cyric’s faithful believe he won’t hear their prayers unless they first make a blood sacrifice. Good folk don’t invoke his name, even when trying to deceive others; they call on Leira instead. “The Dark Sun” has become a colloquialism for strife in the Realms.</p><p>Temples to Cyric are forbidden in most nations, although they thrive in Amn. Cyric’s faith fits in well with the nation’s culture of ambition, self-reliance, and deception. Priests of Cyric dress in black or dark purple robes trimmed with silver and wear belts or jewelry adorned with the stamped skull-and-starburst symbol of their god. They spend much of their time scheming against each other, with each priest striving to strengthen their personal power.</p><p>The lies of Cyric’s Chosen go undetected even by powerful magic, as if the Chosen had cast the <em>Glibness</em> spell. Spells that would otherwise compel the Chosen to tell the truth, such as <em>Zone of Truth</em>, have no effect.

Words on a page rearrange themselves into messages, a quill writes on a blank page of its own accord, or the crease between an open book’s pages splits into a papery, whispering mouth.</p><p>It’s common practice for someone who writes a letter or records information to pray to Deneir to avoid mistakes. While many artists worship gods of creativity like Lathander or Milil, illustrators who strive to convey concrete information or realism in their work favor Deneir. They acknowledge Deneir before beginning and on completing paintings, particularly illuminated manuscripts, tapestries that relate stories, and any attempt to use visual art to capture the truth.</p><p>Followers of Deneir consider literacy one of the god’s most important gifts. His priests teach people how to read and write, free of charge. Deneir’s priests tend to be individualists, united by their shared faith but unconcerned with religious hierarchy and protocol. They seldom establish temples of their own, instead operating out of temples of Oghma, schoolhouses, and libraries, or visiting folks in their homes.</p><p>The <em>Tome of Universal Harmony</em> is the seminal text of Deneir’s faith.

Despite this protection, some priests of Eldath avoid conflict entirely, while others quickly step in to soothe strife and disharmony.

He is the foremost god worshiped on Lantan; over a century ago, he appeared on that archipelago in the form of a gnome and granted its islands the secrets of smokepowder.

These priests rarely stay in one place for long, believing that to stagnate physically is to stagnate mentally. They wander the land in saffron vestments; belts of large, linked metal medallions; and enormous sunhats. A traveling priest of Gond offers services to distant villages as a tinker and civil engineer.

He is venerated by those who must remain watchful for enemies or danger. Helm is a favorite deity of those who make a living by protecting someone or something, such as bodyguards, members of the city watch, and the guards of a treasury vault.</p><p>Helm embodies the spirit of watchfulness without regard for good or evil. In legends, he is honorable and keeps his word to a fault. During the Time of Troubles, he guarded the celestial stairways, preventing the gods from ascending them and ensuring they continued to walk Faerûn. Helm appears as a towering figure in full plate armor with a concealing visor. When he speaks to mortals, he materializes in as a massive armored figure or sends a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmPlanetar000000]{Planetar}</strong> to deliver his word.</p><p>Helm’s faith has known dark days. He was slain in a duel with Tyr—a tragic injustice some say was arranged by Cyric. But worship of Helm never faded. Most of his followers believe the Watcher can’t be vanquished, and his return after the Second Sundering verified that belief.</p><p>Helm’s priests teach followers to be vigilant, aware, and prepared for one’s enemies. Patience, clear thought, and careful planning will always defeat rushed actions. Those who favor Helm strive to be alert, clearheaded, and true to their word. These traits don’t necessarily make them nice people, however, and many consider the faithful of Helm to be inflexible and merciless.</p><p>Chosen of Helm—called Sentinels—arise from any walk of life, as the Watcher chooses those who stand against overwhelming peril for the sake of others. Occasionally, Helm looks into the heart of a mortal in the path of a great calamity and—if he judges them worthy—invests them with his power.</p><h4>Everwatch Knights</h4><p>The Everwatch Knights is a mercenary knighthood formed by Helm’s faithful. The Everwatch makes Helm’s vigilance readily available and generates income for the greater faith. While battle-savvy characters such as Clerics, Fighters, and Paladins fit among the Everwatch, these knights also prize the cunning of Bards, Rangers, and Rogues.</p><p>Recruits to the Everwatch Knights are called seekers. They train through partnerships with established knights. Contrary to much of Helm’s priesthood, the Everwatch Knights keeps a loose rank structure. While traditional knights begin as squires, learning from a single knight for years, Everwatch Knights have no squires, and seekers learn from many knights in succession. Experienced knights support this system by passing on their skills and wisdom.</p><p>For a seeker to be chosen for knighthood, they must establish a reputation for upholding contracts and defend themself in an armed encounter with enemies of Helm. A seeker tapped to ascend to knighthood must hold vigil at a post for a day, taking no food or rest with only water to drink. Once a seeker completes the vigil, they are knighted and join the ranks of the Everwatch. (If your campaign uses renown, a character must also have a Renown Score of 3+ with the Everwatch Knights to be knighted.)</p><p>Everwatch Knights train their martial skills and hone their alertness by studying stealth and infiltration techniques.

He is a god of the oppressed and the unjustly treated.</p><p>If he had his way, Ilmater would take all the suffering in the world onto himself to spare others. Since he can’t, he blesses those who endure on others’ behalf, and he alleviates suffering when he can. Martyrs are blessed by Ilmater with a final rest and reward in the god’s afterlife. Ilmater speaks to mortals in moments of despair and agony, where his voice soothes their hurt and fear. He sometimes sends a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmShieldGuardian]{Shield Guardian}</strong> to protect a mortal in need and shows favor by growing daisies and white roses or sending peaceful animals.</p><p>Ilmater’s priests take in the sick, the starving, and the injured, and his temples give away most of what they receive to offset the suffering of the world. His followers provide succor when they can, using force to end torture and the suffering inflicted on others. Ilmater’s priests travel to unfortunate places, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, the forgotten, and the poor. They put others ahead of themselves, share all they have, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the welfare of the material body.</p><p>Priests of Ilmater wear hair shirts, vests of coarse fur.

Even warlike groups avoid attacking a peaceful priest of Ilmater, as long as the priest administers to their fallen warriors.</p><p>Chosen of Ilmater become martyrs eventually, as they’re driven to step between victims and the source of their suffering. The divine power coursing through them allows the Chosen to intervene in brutally perilous situations, pushing them closer to the embrace of the Crying God.</p><h4>Broken Ones</h4><p>The Broken Ones is a monastic order of temple and caravan guards dedicated to Ilmater.

Superiors evaluate the supplicant for endurance and compassion. A supplicant who passes these trials must then endure a period of fasting and carefully inflicted pain before being welcomed as a full member of the Broken Ones. Many inductees have scars, previously broken bones, and other lingering signs of the suffering they endured during their supplication.

When death occurs, Kelemvor takes a soul by the hand and leads it to the proper afterlife. Death isn’t a thing to be feared in Kelemvor’s eyes, but a natural part of life that must be accepted in its time. When Kelemvor speaks to his worshipers, he does so in dreams appearing as a silver-haired man wearing black, hooded robes and a silver funeral mask, or he speaks through the body of a person who recently died.</p><p>Priests of Kelemvor—the most elite of whom are known as doomguides—provide people with peaceful transitions into death. Priests sort the dying’s affairs, counsel bereaved mourners, and officiate funeral rites. The tenets of Kelemvor’s faith compel his followers to forestall or prevent untimely deaths whenever possible, and to eliminate the scourge of the undead. Several organizations outside the formal priesthood focus on these tenets in different ways. The Vital Breath concentrates on stopping the spread of plagues and magical contagions, the Judge’s Vigil focuses on the prevention of murder, and the Knights of the Eternal Order search for and destroy powerful undead.</p><p>Their vehement opposition to undead puts Kelemvor’s followers at odds with necromancers, priests of Myrkul, and others who create undead, but it also causes conflict in unexpected ways. For instance, priests of Kelemvor routinely destroy writings about the creation of undead—an act that offends those who value knowledge for its own sake, such as the faithful of Oghma and Deneir. Undead of good alignment exist, but Kelemvor’s devotees seek even their destruction.</p><p>Chosen of Kelemvor embody the natural course of death and are optimistic and jubilant.

He is a god of dawn and the potential that comes with new beginnings. Spring, birth, youth, creativity, and renewal fall under his domain.</p><p>Although occasionally given to excess, abundant enthusiasm, and vanity, Lathander is above all an optimistic deity. An early morning visit from an exuberant songbird might be a good omen from the god. He also sends pixies with iridescent wings the colors of sunrise.</p><p>Since Lathander is a god of beginnings, people pray to him before undertaking journeys or endeavors. His priests officiate weddings and births, and his name is invoked to seal alliances and launch new ventures or companies. As a result, Lathander is popular among merchants, and his faith has benefited accordingly. Temples to Lathander are wealthy and unafraid to show it—sometimes to the point of gaudiness. Some feature elaborate stained-glass windows on every wall, while others have parapets designed to look like the spread wings of a rising phoenix. Lathander’s temples pay Faerûn’s best artists handsome amounts to create colorful statues and murals within their walls. Temples of Lathander hold a special ceremony called the Song of Dawn on Midsummer morning and at the equinoxes. During this event, priests and the faithful sing praises to the Morninglord.</p><p>Lathander’s followers include athletes, nobles, artists, and the young, all of whom often dress in flamboyant fashions. The Morninglord’s priests wear shades of rose pink, orange, and gold­—the colors of the dawn. They teach others not to wallow in negativity, that life comes from death and every morning offers a chance to turn a setback into a success. Priests and followers of Lathander despise undead, seeing them as both a corruption of the natural order and a disavowal of new beginnings because undead cling to their old existence rather than move on.</p><p>Chosen of Lathander wield powerful magic of light and life and spend their time lending these services to other good deities on Lathander’s behalf. Some theorize that these acts of benevolence are Lathander’s way of apologizing to the gods for the Dawn Cataclysm—an eons-old incident in which Lathander foolishly attempted to remake all deities in his image, leading to the deaths of several gods whose names have been nearly forgotten.</p><h4>Dawnbringers</h4><p>When the destructive forces of Faerûn bring a town or village to its knees, Dawnbringers help the survivors rise from the ashes. This order of Lathander dedicates itself to helping people start anew. That often means finding refugees new homes and teaching them the skills they’ll need to thrive.</p><p>Dawnbringers find folk who need their help through word of mouth, divination magic, or omens from Lathander. When necessary, Dawnbringers recruit adventurers or mercenaries to help them reach people in need.</p><p>Dawnbringers wear distinctive tabards. The back of each tabard is dark gray, and the front is dyed any combination of sunrise-hued colors, as a symbolic reassurance that people’s worst days are behind them. To become a Dawnbringer, one must be trusted by Lathander’s followers. (If your campaign uses renown, a character must have a Renown Score of 5+ with the Dawnbringers to join the organization.) The typical Dawnbringer is gentle yet courageous, grounded yet optimistic. People who demonstrate these qualities are welcomed into the order. Many initiates undergo a renewal of their own by shedding their old name and picking a new one.</p><p>When they aren’t helping displaced people, Dawnbringers connect with town leaders. By strengthening these connections, finding out which leaders are receptive to outsiders, and gently encouraging those that aren’t amenable to change, they lay the groundwork for future refugees to find homes. High-ranking Dawnbringers attend dinners and meetings with town mayors and city councils, although this glamorous perk can distract members from their order’s goals. In realms such as Thay where Dawnbringers don’t have a foothold, they usher folk across long distances to safer lands.</p><p>Dawnbringers count Selûne’s followers among their staunchest allies, which pits them against the forces of Shar.

On her return, Leira reclaimed most of her portfolio, but not all of it. The folk of Faerûn now attribute everyday dishonesty to Leira, categorizing particularly heinous deception as the work of Cyric—though the boundary between such types of falsehood is rarely clear cut. Leira isn’t viewed as malicious or a trickster, but instead as a mysterious recluse. She seldom communicates with her followers or manifests on the Material Plane. Nevertheless,<strong> Displacer Beasts </strong>are sometimes seen as omens of her will, especially when encountered in places beyond the ordinary reach of fey influence.</p><p>Some folk perform a swirling motion with a finger behind their backs when telling a lie as a way of beseeching Leira for aid.<strong> </strong>Her faithful keep their secrets close and refrain from telling the truth when falsehoods or half-truths would serve them better. Only among fellow worshipers of Leira do they feel comfortable enough to speak plainly.</p><p>No images or statues of Leira grace her temples, since her priests know it is useless to presume the true appearance of a god of illusion. Her temples are disguised as other sites, marked with signs that only the faithful recognize. Leira’s temples are filled with a white mist that normally remains low but can rise to fill the room and thicken to obscure vision if the temple’s high priest desires.

Joyful <strong>Empyrean Iotas</strong> or dancing pixies are Lliira’s messengers of choice. Lliira is especially popular with satyrs. Several of the songs, dances, and prayers associated with her can be traced back to communities of these fun-loving fey.</p><p>Dancers and hedonists are among the Lliira’s most devoted worshipers. Some of her followers train in bardic techniques of the College of Dance to better express their devotion. Her followers wear at least one item of clothing in a bright, cheerful color.

Lolth considers herself the true god of drow, though other members of the drow pantheon disagree. Lolth is a cruel god who encourages her followers to backstab and betray each other, reveling in their treachery.</p><p>Lolth was once known as Araushnee, spouse of the elven deity Corellon Larethian. After attempting to overthrow Corellon with an army of spirits, Araushnee was banished to the Abyss. There, she fashioned an arachnid form for herself and took her current name. Spiders of all kinds are seen as omens of Lolth, especially in the Underdark. Lolth often sends <strong>Yochlols</strong>, her signature demons, as messengers or spies.</p><p>Lolth’s worship has an iron grip on the social structure of many drow cities in the Underdark. Recently folk unassociated with the Underdark have heard the spider god’s call, guided by trails of spiders to join aboveground cults dedicated to Lolth. Disciples of Lolth proudly wear web-patterned clothing and practice blood sacrifice, preferring unwilling creatures. Their doctrine teaches them to find and kill nonworshipers. Lolth’s followers aren’t permitted to pray to other gods apart from Kiaransalee and Selvetarm, Lolth’s two allies in the drow pantheon.</p><p>The stone walls of Lolth’s grandest temples are adorned with floor-to-ceiling bas-reliefs of webbing. As a reflection of the matriarchy of spiders, Lolth’s faith permits only women to rise to the priesthood. In the Underdark, drow priests of Lolth rule the noble houses of drow cities like Menzoberranzan, where they wield absolute power. Some of these cities’ residents despise the tyranny of Lolth’s organization, fleeing to the surface or to drow communities that serve more lenient gods of the drow pantheon.</p><p>When one of Lolth’s worshipers shows great promise, Lolth summons them to the Demonweb Pits for a test of faith and strength. Those who fail the test are transformed into <strong>Driders</strong>, but those who succeed become Yor’thae, Chosen of Lolth. Yor’thae exercise divine mastery over spiders and carry out Lolth’s machinations.</p><h4>Silken Stewards</h4><p>Certain disciples of Lolth don’t always kill their victims, instead putting them to sleep with Lolth’s Sting (see chapter 3 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>). The victim awakes cocooned in sticky webs, suspended from the ceiling of a dark temple or underground room. In a matter of hours, a swarm of tiny creatures begins to wriggle in the victim’s chest. The last feeling the victim experiences is a hair-raising, tickling sensation that quickly turns to agony as baby spiders chew their way out of the ribcage, killing the host.</p><p>Lolth’s worshipers who practice this method of spider-egg incubation call themselves the Silken Stewards. The practice was pioneered by House Auvryndar, one of Menzoberranzan’s ruling noble houses. The drow of this house found that implanting spider eggs into Humanoid hosts and performing a ritual to Lolth over the body caused the eggs to hatch in mere hours, rather than weeks. A <em>Lesser Restoration</em> spell cast on the host kills the spider eggs, ending the threat.</p><p>Silken Stewards provide other disciples of Lolth with a steady supply of spiders used as mounts, trackers, sentries, and front-line forces in service to the Spider Queen. The Stewards raise all sorts of arachnids: <strong>Spiders</strong>, <strong>Giant Spiders</strong>, and even <strong>Phase Spiders</strong>. Silken Stewards wear gloves made of the finest spider silk, and their clothes bear brooches depicting the stylized image of a curled-up spider inside a white spider egg. High-ranking members oversee the implantation of eggs and the accompanying rituals. Middle-ranking members capture Humanoids to use as hosts. Lesser-ranking members rear the hatched spiders and train them.</p><p>Followers of Eilistraee are among the Stewards’ greatest foes, particularly Eilistraee’s militant orders. They lead raids into the Stewards’ hatcheries, killing spiders, freeing captives, and curing infested hosts. Silken Stewards are ever vigilant for Eilistraee’s adherents infiltrating their ranks. Underdark-dwelling followers of Silvanus also oppose the Stewards, viewing the Stewards’ methods of spider incubation and domestication as a blasphemous affront to the creatures’ natural life cycles.</p>"

All pain is holy, from the crudest brutality to the emotional suffering of the heartbroken or the betrayed, and is proof of Loviatar’s attention. Pain—the ability both to inflict it and to endure it—is a path to power. Loviatar’s followers consider a cold, cruel demeanor ideal because that best emulates Loviatar herself, and for the same reason her faithful appreciate beauty, cultural refinement, and skill at manipulation.</p><p>Though temples to Loviatar are rare, her faithful are numerous. Loviatar is a preferred deity of those who inflict pain as a matter of course, including torturers and others who need to break the will of their victims.

During the tenday leading up to Highharvestide, priests of Malar hunt tirelessly for as much game as they can find. They then invite members of the community to join them at a great feast on Highharvestide called the Feast of the Stags. They keep quiet the dreaded High Hunt ritual, in which priests of Malar choose someone to become their prey for a day and a night. If the prey survives, they gain a favor from the priests of Malar, but death is a far more likely outcome.</p><p>Malar’s Chosen are gifted trackers, sometimes blessed with lycanthropy.

Courtiers and diplomats invoke Mask’s name in hope of a smooth negotiation.</p><p>Mask takes the form of a quick masculine being wielding two shadowy blades, his identity hidden by a mask. Sometimes he takes the form of masks that others might wear. When he speaks to his followers, he does so by claiming a mask as his temporary face, or he sends a living shadow (Neutral Evil <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmShadowDemon000]{Shadow Demon}</strong>).</p><p>Those who favor Mask practice thievery and try to acquire what belongs to others, engaging in pickpocketing, burglary, mugging, and con games. Ordinary folk pray to him so he’ll avert his eyes from their valuables, but cautious individuals employ “Mask’s purse,” a small, cheap cloth pouch worn in plain sight containing a small offering of coin. By convention, a pickpocket pilfers Mask’s purse when encountering another person wearing one and considers it a gift from the god, while the one who lost the purse is grateful to Mask for accepting this respectful sacrifice. Of course, nothing prevents another pickpocket from targeting someone who has lost Mask’s purse, and anyone with the ill luck to attract multiple pickpockets in a single outing has probably earned Mask’s ire anyway.</p><p>Priests of Mask are thieves by profession and serve as higher-ups in the local underworld or a criminal syndicate. They go by the title of demarche and wear veil-masks when acting in their priestly capacity.</p><p>The foremost organization serving Mask is the Shadowmasters of Telflamm, a criminal syndicate in the land of Thesk.

Instead, they assemble in peaceful wooded glades to worship her or create shrines in her honor. A typical shrine to Mielikki is a dead tree trunk into which has been carved the likeness of her holy symbol: a unicorn or unicorn’s head. Such a shrine marks a point in the forest beyond which locals know not to cut timber or hunt; in this way, followers thank Mielikki for the forest’s bounty.</p><p>Priests of Mielikki protect the forests of Faerûn, using magic to communicate with and protect the animals and plants within. Mielikki’s priests wear capes of leaves to match the seasons: verdant green in the summer, burnt orange in autumn, and dotted with flowers in the spring. In winter, they forgo the capes and wear crowns of twigs. Whatever the garb, they wear Mielikki’s holy symbol over the heart, carved of ivory or bone or stitched in silver thread.</p><p>Mielikki is allied with Silvanus but she takes pity on hurt creatures Silvanus ignores. Mielikki has a close bond with Lurue, god of unicorns, and Lurue serves as her mount when Mielikki goes hunting in the Beastlands. Rangers of Mielikki serve as a line of defense against marauders and followers of the god Malar.</p><p>On Greengrass and Midsummer, Mielikki blesses her followers with an event called the Wild Ride.

Milil’s followers need not be entertainers themselves, but simply appreciate good music. His followers tend to be hedonistic in comparison to those of other gods.

Known as the Red Fellowship, her priests traveled throughout southwestern Faerûn sharing their wisdom. Many leaders they approached turned them away at first, but it soon became apparent that those who accepted the counsel of the Lady of Strategy gained a distinct tactical edge.

In truth, Silvanus represents the entirety of nature: deserts as well as forests, sharks as much as deer. In legends he commands other nature deities, dealing out rewards and punishments to them as he sees fit.</p><p>Interpretations of Silvanus’s personality vary wildly. Many see him as a vengeful god, looking with aloof disgust on the inhabitants of Faerûn as a shopkeeper regards an infestation of rats. However, worshipers of Silvanus believe that Silvanus doesn’t hold people in disdain but rather wishes to maintain the balance of nature. Wilderness is brutally fair when it comes to matters of life and death, and so is the Oak Father.</p><p>Whenever he wishes, Silvanus can bring the natural world to sentient life, with streams finding their own courses and trees uprooting to walk around. When he needs to communicate directly with his followers, he sends a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmDryad000000000]{Dryad}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmTreant00000000]{Treant}</strong>, or <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmTwigBlight0000]{Twig Blight}</strong> as a divine messenger.</p><p>Druids make up most of Silvanus’s following. His creed dictates that nature’s glory must be preserved not merely because nature is beautiful, but because wild nature is the true state of the world. Nature refreshes and revitalizes the mortal soul, giving breath to the world. His faithful oppose the expansion of settlements into wild places and consider the excessive consumption of natural resources to be not only wasteful but blasphemous.</p><p>The oak leaf is Silvanus’s symbol, and villagers might dedicate a grove of oaks nearby as a shrine to him. In places where oak trees don’t grow, an oak leaf etched into the bark of another kind of tree signifies a sacred site. Official temples to Silvanus are few and far between and likely to be hidden away in the depths of a forest rather than in a bustling urban center.</p><p>Silvanus tasks his Chosen with presiding over a forest, a desert, a lake, or another natural region. Some develop spiritual relationships with their assigned domain, not unlike a dryad’s link to its sanctuary. When their domain flourishes, these Chosen become invigorated; when it suffers or comes under attack, they feel the pain.</p>"

She is the god of beauty in all its forms—not just pleasing sights, but also enchanting sounds, luxurious tastes and scents, and exquisite sensual pleasures, from a lover’s caress to the whispering brush of silk on the skin. Her worshipers seek out these pleasures in life, not out of mere decadence, but because the experience of pleasure is an act of worship.</p><p>Sune appears as a woman of unearthly beauty. Regardless of what features she takes on, her hair is always impossibly long and fiery red. When she doesn’t speak in dreams or visions, she sends a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmCouatl00000000]{Couatl}</strong> or <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmDeva0000000000]{Deva}</strong> to act as muse on her behalf.</p><p>The followers of Sune have a reputation as hedonists. Her priests foster beauty in the world by creating art or acting as patrons for promising talents. Her priests consider loveliness to be one of their greatest callings and train in comportment, fashion, and cosmetics.</p><p>But beauty is more than skin deep, say Sune’s followers; it issues from the core of one’s being and shows one’s true face to the world. The followers of Sune believe in romance, true love winning over all, and following the heart to its true destination. Fated matches, impossible loves, and embracing beauty beyond the physical are the purview of Sune.</p><p>Temples dedicated to Sune serve as public baths and places of relaxation. A temple features a mirrored and well-lit salon where individuals can enhance their appearance, as well as see others and be seen. In remote locales or in parts of sprawling cities far from a temple, small, roofed shrines to Sune provide her followers convenient access to beautification resources. Each shrine bears a mirror and is stocked with free perfumes and cosmetics.</p><p>Sune’s Chosen exemplify some aspect of beauty. For some, this is physical loveliness, but others create beauty through art, music, writing, or other creative endeavors. They inspire through expression and show that beauty exists in all facets of the world.</p><h4>Sodality of the Ruby Rose</h4><p>The Sodality of the Ruby Rose is a knightly order dedicated to Lady Firehair and tasked with guarding Sune’s temples and holy sites. The Sodality also accompanies Sune’s priests and those questing on the Lady’s behalf. Anyone with a drive to protect beauty and oppose those who seek to tear it down find acceptance in the Ruby Rose.</p><p>Prospective members are called Hopefuls. A Hopeful who demonstrates adherence to Sune’s ideals accompanies knights on simple assignments. When the Hopeful wishes to pursue initiation, they keep vigil in a temple of Sune for one night. If the god shows her favor by granting a vision or other boon, the Hopeful is accepted as a Sodalis, also known as a Companion.</p><p>To win Sune’s acceptance, a Hopeful must have protected a meaningful aspect of beauty from something that would destroy it, whether through ignorance or malice. Once inducted, the Companion is granted an enameled red rose brooch and joins the order. Members of special distinction bear brooches with ruby petals. (If your campaign uses renown, a character must have a Renown Score of 3+ with the Sodality of the Ruby Rose to join the organization.)</p><p>Companions of the Ruby Rose are trained in battle, presentation, and poise. Companions receive a free Comfortable lifestyle when staying at holdings of Sune’s faithful.

Sune’s nature ensures that most people, even followers of other gods, are unlikely to remain in conflict with her for long, though the Ruby Rose occasionally clashes with the faithful of Talona, Talos, Tempus, and Umberlee.</p>"

She craves propitiation from mortals and pursues it by any means necessary.</p><p>Talona is a fickle god. She is more petulant than conniving, more reactive than active. Though she receives many prayers, Talona has almost no temples or cults dedicated to her, and she resents the neglect. When she lashes out with plagues, blights, and magical contagions, victims desperately pray to her for respite, placating her for a time. But once the contagion ends, prayers dwindle, and it isn’t long before the neglected god lashes out again.</p><p>When Talona communicates with mortals—usually to demand some sort of propitiation—she sends a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmVulture0000000]{Vulture}</strong>, a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmGiantRat000000]{Giant Rat}</strong>, or the corpse of a creature infested by insects. Whatever method she chooses, her messenger is shrouded in a sickly yellow-brown glow.</p><p>Rituals to placate Talona involve three drops of blood or three tears dropped into a well that has gone bad, dripped into the handkerchief of someone beset by coughing, dropped into a fire made by burning a withered crop, dripped into the mouth of a plague sufferer, and so on. It’s common practice to mark a container of poison with her holy symbol, three droplets in a triangle. During epidemics, this image is painted on the homes of the infected.</p><p>Talona’s priests rarely enter into her service willingly. Some are forced into the role by their communities, while other individuals simply have nothing else to live for. This latter category includes the sole survivors of harrowing magical contagions, or people who have lost loved ones to Talona’s whims. They dedicate their lives to the priesthood to make sure the same fate doesn’t befall others. A priest of Talona maintains a small shrine instead of a temple. Despite the priest’s best efforts, people often lavish these shrines with offerings during tough times while neglecting them in times of health and abundance.</p><p>Devoted followers of Talona brew poisons in her name and summon magical contagions to unleash on the people of Faerûn as punishments for neglecting the Mistress of Disease. Among these fanatics, her Chosen are gifted with immunity to poisons and magical maladies.</p>"

He is best known as a god of storms, but he is also associated with forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and general destruction. Raiders, looters, and brigands flock to his worship.</p><p>The Storm Lord’s actions seem petty and vengeful, motivated by rage, anger, and the need to posture among other gods. Talos is an ancient god who sprang up from the wreckage of the first battle between Selûne and Shar. Religious art often depicts him as a broad-shouldered, bearded man with an eye patch, but the folk of Calimshan know him by the name Bhaelros and depict him with a genie-like appearance. Talos rules over the gods of fury—Auril, Malar, and Umberlee—though it’s said Malar would kill him if he could. The Raging One manifests to mortals as bellowing laughter in the heart of strong winds or as red lightning strikes in a storm.</p><p>Day-to-day worship of the Storm Lord is outlawed in most of Faerûn, though folk make desperate offerings to save themselves from natural disasters. Talos’s faithful love destruction, and they call storms on towns and cities in the name of their deity. Many become brigands, wandering from place to place demanding loot and threatening destruction. Sometimes Talos’s faithful forgo any ultimatum, causing wanton destruction for destruction’s sake. They are taught that life is chaos and that each person should seize what they can when they can—after all, who can say when Talos will strike and bring them to the afterlife?</p><p>Priests of Talos have few temples, instead traveling like a wayward storm.<strong> </strong>They wear ragged robes and cloaks shot through with jagged lines of gold and silver. Many wear an eye patch in deference to their god. Priests and other devout worshipers of Talos make pilgrimages to a canyon called the Gulf of Storms in eastern Amn. The peculiar iron ore in the canyon’s walls attracts electrical charges, making the chasm prone to spectacular, deadly arrays of crisscrossing, leaping lightning bolts. This energy develops into storms that race down the valley to lash across Amn and Tethyr.</p><p>Talos’s Chosen bring terror to Faerûn. They wield incredibly powerful destructive spells such as <em>Storm of Vengeance</em>, <em>Earthquake</em>, and <em>Meteor Swarm</em>, unleashing annihilation on cities and villages that don’t bend to the Storm Lord’s will.</p>"

The Foehammer is friendly with Gond for his war machines and was once Beshaba’s lover. Tempus sponsored the Red Knight’s ascension to divinity.</p><p>This god of war is random in his favors, meaning his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Tempus might be an army’s ally one day and its enemy the next. When he manifests before a battle, he can appear to either side in the conflict. If he rides Veiros, his white mare, the army will succeed. If he rides Deiros, his black stallion, defeat is certain. Most often, he rides with one foot in each mount’s stirrup, signifying the unpredictable nature of battle.</p><p>In such visions, Tempus is a powerfully built warrior dressed for battle in the style of those who see him. When he speaks to mortals directly, his voice reverberates in a clash of weapons, or he sends a Celestial <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmBerserker00000]{Berserker}</strong> to carry his will.</p><p>Over the centuries, Tempus’s priests have spread and enforced a common code that encourages rules of war, respect for reputation, and professional behavior on the battlefield. This code, called Tempus’s Honor, encourages conflicts to be brief, decisive, and as safe as possible for bystanders. The rules in the code include the following: arm anyone who has need of a weapon, disparage no foe, acquit yourself with bravery, train all for battle, and don’t engage in feuds. Those who poison wells, taint fields, kill noncombatants, or engage in torture in the name of war are considered enemies.</p><p>Worshipers of Tempus are a legion, and soldiers carry his name in their hearts. His priests are tacticians skilled in the art of war. Many of his priests serve as battlefield chaplains with armies and mercenary companies, encouraging fellow soldiers with word and blade. Priests of Tempus teach that war conducted properly is fair because it impacts all sides equally, with each soldier poised for both death and glory. Mortals shouldn’t fear war but should see it as a natural force—the storm that civilization brings about by its existence.</p><p>The Chosen of Tempus are masterful tacticians, fearsome warriors, and powerful leaders. They find their way to battlefields with such certainty that many suspect the Chosen’s presence causes battles to break out.</p><h4>Stormknives</h4><p>Mercenaries loyal to Tempus have long identified themselves through the symbol of a rusty dagger dripping four drops of blood. In recent years, these mercenaries have organized around a common code of conduct beyond Tempus’s Honor. These individuals call themselves Stormknives.</p><p>A warrior who wishes to become a Stormknife simply declares themself to be one. They carry a dagger at all times—even while sleeping or bathing—and wear a patch bearing four drops of blood. When these individuals sign a mercenary contract, or any other binding agreement related to war or conflict, they add four red marks to their signature, signifying the commitments of a Stormknife.</p><p>Each of the four drops of blood in the Stormknives’ symbol represents a commitment, ranked in ascending order of importance. The first of these represents loyalty to the sword and signifies the Stormknife’s obligation to seek out battle at every opportunity. Whenever a Stormknife is given a choice between violent and nonviolent methods to solve a problem, they should choose violence.</p><p>The second drop represents loyalty to the client. A Stormknife respects the wishes of the individual they’re working for, obeying them whenever possible. A client, for example, might order a Stormknife to put away their weapons and retreat from battle, and the Stormknife is obliged to obey.</p><p>The third drop represents loyalty to the contract, emphasizing the letter of the contract over the client’s wishes. If, for example, a client instructs a Stormknife not to loot a body, but the contract includes such plunder as the Stormknife’s right, the mercenary can disobey the client in favor of the contract.</p><p>And finally, the fourth drop represents loyalty to Tempus. The wishes and whims of the Lord of Battles supersede other rules, even a written contract. But it’s up to individual Stormknives to determine what Tempus’s will might be, leading to corruption and abuse. Some Stormknives use this part of their code as an excuse to break a contract or disobey a client’s wishes, claiming such deeds are the will of Tempus and thus unavoidable.</p>"

He is a patron god of many Paladins, embodying the tenets of the Oath of Devotion.</p><p>Torm’s name carries gravitas and strikes fear into treacherous hearts, but his heart is filled with goodness. In legends, he is kind and gentle when dealing with faithful friends, the weak, and the defenseless. But he is stern and righteous against the forces of evil and injustice.

They strive to maintain peace and order while opposing unjust laws and standing alert against corruption. Though many of Torm’s followers are warriors, skill in combat isn’t required to uphold Torm’s ideals. For instance, a council member who worships Torm advocates for what is just, even if this puts their position at risk. Torm’s followers believe every failure of duty diminishes Torm and every success adds to his luster. The faithful know everyone stumbles from time to time, but they never cease aspiring to Torm’s standards.</p><p>Followers construct fortress-temples dedicated to Torm on defensible heights. These structures offer drilling grounds, stables, and austere quarters for residents and visiting knights. Lion statues and armored figures feature in these temples’ decor, with the coats of arms of fallen heroes decorating the white-granite walls. The priesthood of Torm is friendly with the priesthoods of Tyr and Ilmater: together with Torm, these gods make up a trio of deities called the Triad. Torm’s priests are also allied with the Red Knight and Lathander.</p><p>Chosen of Torm dedicate themselves to the fight against evil, especially against the forces of Bane. Torm and Bane battled each other to their mutual destruction during the Time of Troubles—both gods have since returned, and the animosity between them still seethes.</p><h4>Order of the Golden Lion</h4><p>East of the Dalelands, the city of Tantras is home to the greatest concentration of Torm worshipers in Faerûn. There, Torm manifested and slew Bane during the Time of Troubles. While this era was a time of great pride for Torm’s followers, it also became one of great shame. After returning to his godly state, Torm was disgusted to find that Tantras’s priests had been persecuting believers of other gods, and that this practice had spread throughout the Dalelands and along the Sea of Fallen Stars. As punishment, Torm dictated a series of responsibilities and obligations—the Penance of Duty—for his followers to perform as atonement. Over a century has passed since this decree, and Torm’s followers have regained trust in the regions around Tantras. Still, a select group of Torm’s faithful vowed to continue the atonement of the Penance of Duty, and those people are known as the Order of the Golden Lion.</p><p>The Order of the Golden Lion involves righting three Debts: Persecution, Dereliction, and Destruction. Typically knights of the Golden Lion devote themselves to righting a single debt. Those who choose the Debt of Persecution aid good religions wherever possible. Followers of the Debt of Dereliction atone for abdications of duty by seeking out and eliminating cults of Bane, as well as routing the Zhentarim. Adherents to the Debt of Destruction are obliged to report and repair areas of dead magic and wild magic throughout Faerûn as penance for the destruction to the Weave caused by Torm’s battle against Bane.</p><p>The Order of the Golden Lion is most active in the Dalelands and the region around Tantras, but faithful as far as the Sword Coast have picked up the mantle. The order is largely composed of warriors, and members wear the order’s signature article of clothing: a pair of golden pauldrons, each carved in the shape of a lion’s head. To become a member of the Order of the Golden Lion, an individual must prove their dedication by completing a holy quest for a temple of Torm.

Long ago, the Netherese revered Tyche, the god of luck, whose influence extended over both good luck and bad. Tyche perished, but Beshaba and Tymora manifested soon after, each commanding half of Tyche’s portfolio.</p><p>The battle cry of Tymora is “Fortune favors the bold.” Folk pray to Tymora before any endeavor in which a little good luck would help. One common method of divining the future is to toss a coin to a stranger and ask if it’s heads. If it is, the coin is left with the stranger as payment for Tymora’s favor. If it’s not, the stranger can keep it (and the bad luck that comes with it) or return it.</p><p>Those who favor Tymora—as distinct from those who merely invoke her name whenever they roll dice—are daring sorts.

It’s common practice for her followers to set aside a tithe of ten percent of their profits, but rather than being given to a temple, the money is spent to help a struggling business, to finance a new endeavor, or, if all else fails, on frivolous fun.</p><p>Chosen of Waukeen possess their god’s keen understanding of contracts and agreements and can rival powerful devils at unwinding convoluted terms. They intervene when the wealth of nations is at stake.</p>"

Forest defenders dismantle a war camp polluting a vital river. A circle of druids enacts a rain ritual for a drought-stricken village. These are but a few examples of how the Emerald Enclave makes the world a peaceful, hospitable place for people and nature alike.</p><p>The Emerald Enclave is an organization of survivalists and nature worshipers who refer to themselves as Caretakers. Members of the enclave maintain the balance between wilderness and civilization and reinforce what they call “the natural order.” This natural order is exemplified by places where people and nature live in harmony—places where neither settlements nor wilds threaten to overwhelm the other. Caretakers protect such areas with their lives. To the Emerald Enclave, individual sacrifice is worthwhile if it means the preservation of the whole.</p><p>Caretakers wear green clothes made from natural, foraged materials such as plants and animal hides. The most powerful members have magically bright-green eyes. Most Caretakers are constantly surrounded by animals and can walk seamlessly between civilization and the wilds.</p><p>Members of the Emerald Enclave are loosely organized into diffuse subfactions called circles. Some Caretakers from the same circle might work together in small bands, but many operate in isolation. These lone wolves rely on the animals and plants around them to monitor other Caretakers (and non-Caretakers) in their vicinity.</p>"

          "name": "Goals and Activities",
          "text": "<p>Caretakers preserve sacred natural sites by guarding them from logging, mining, and other exploitation. In areas where the natural order has already been compromised, the enclave restores the land so it is once again fruitful and hospitable. The enclave’s spellcasters draw on nature magic to expedite labors such as planting trees and cleaning litter-filled waterways.</p><p>In dire situations—such as an undead-riddled battlefield—the Emerald Enclave leads coordinated assaults to root out the land’s defilers. When necessary, Caretakers put impenitent evildoers to the sword. Members of the enclave don’t relish violence against nature’s children, but they know destruction is sometimes necessary for healing to begin. Caretakers do, however, proudly raise arms against unnatural forces such as aberrant monsters, reanimated dead, and machines of war. Members of the enclave believe such creatures exist to threaten the natural order and must be destroyed.</p><p>When they aren’t healing broken lands or fending off the forces of chaos, Caretakers study and promote the ways that fauna and flora peacefully coexist in nature. Some spend time in settlements to forge new connections and encourage communities to tend the world around them. The enclave is always in search of allies, for, as one Caretaker saying puts it, the herd is strongest when its numbers are great. Thus, wise Caretakers hone their communication skills, knowing that a compelling speech or poignant adage can help others connect to the land.</p><h4>Lunar Rituals</h4><p>The cycle of the moon and seasons is important to the Emerald Enclave’s rituals. New Caretakers are initiated to the enclave each month on the full moon. New moons are reserved for tribunals, when judgment is passed on enemies taken prisoner or on Caretakers who’ve failed to uphold their duties. Many Caretakers plan sojourns to coincide with the lunar cycle so that they venture away from home while the moon wanes, then return while it waxes.</p><p>Just as the enclave shares in times of bounty, so too it shares the onus of performing necessary evils. When a tribunal demands capital punishment or a lunar ritual requires animal sacrifice, the tribunal selects an executioner through a casting of holy stones or sacred sticks or the summoning of a nature spirit that temporarily possesses an individual. In this way, no single Caretaker must bear the entire weight of the grisly work that must be done.</p>"

Storied Caretakers have multiple epithets, which are then appended to one another; for example, a veteran enclave member named Krodar might be referred to as “Caretaker Krodar, Axe Breaker, and Tamer of Owlbears.”</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.ssS68fKwFSKRLq5u]</p><h4>Enclave Circles</h4><p>A circle of the Emerald Enclave is a collective of Caretakers who study and practice the teachings of a particular aspect of the natural world to achieve the enclave’s goals. Circles act independently, but they might seek one another’s expertise when dealing with large-scale or far-ranging challenges.</p><p>There is some overlap between enclave circles and druid circles. But not all druids belong to the Emerald Enclave, and not all enclave members are druids. A druid of the Circle of the Moon, for example, might go their entire life without encountering the Emerald Enclave’s circle of the same name, even though both groups practice similar teachings and rituals.</p><p>Each circle is led by its longest-serving and most accomplished members: sage rangers and ancient druids known as Verdant Ones. Verdant Ones lead lunar rituals, train new Caretakers, and coordinate missions with other circles. Often, a Verdant One passes judgment on issues where the balance between natural forces is unclear.</p><p>These are just a few of the enclave’s circles in Faerûn:</p><p><strong>The Circle of Air </strong>believes the world’s eons-long natural cycle requires similarly lengthy study to fully comprehend.</p><p><strong>The Circle of the Ancients</strong> is the oldest and most influential circle, tapping into primordial secrets.</p><p><strong>The Circle of the Giants</strong> reveres the titans of the natural world: dinosaurs, dragons, and megafauna.</p><p><strong>The Circle of the Land </strong>is the largest circle, protecting nature in all its forms and helping others survive in the wilderness.</p><p><strong>The Circle of the Moon</strong> aids those who travel at night, and those threatened by nocturnal forces.</p><p><strong>The Circle of Wildfire </strong>understands destruction is a fundamental part of the natural cycle and individual sacrifice is necessary for the greater good.</p><h4>The Three</h4><p>The leaders of the Emerald Enclave are called the Three. These legendary druids provide guidance to other enclave circles and pass judgment on the most serious offenses. They occupy and protect a sacred temple to Silvanus called Oakenhall. Rarely the Three might visit another sacred site; such visits are never announced and rarely portend good news.</p><p>Though rarely spoken of as individuals, the Three are sometimes identified by the leaf-shaped masks they wear: the Oak, the Elm, and the Willow. The Three began as ordinary people, but when an individual dons one of these three magical masks, the mask merges with their flesh and transforms the wearer into a faceless, ageless being of no known species—nine feet tall and identical to the other members.</p><h4>Sacred Sites</h4><p>All over Faerûn, Caretakers congregate at meeting grounds called sacred sites. Except for Oakenhall and a few other notable temples, the Emerald Enclave’s sacred sites are naturally occurring locales of spiritual or magical import. The Emerald Enclave considers these sites—and any other locations where nature has worked its miracles—symbolically important and worth guarding closely. The following are a few notable sacred sites.</p><p><em><strong>Coltree. </strong></em>In the foothills around the Spine of the World grows a massive fir called Coltree. It rises from a white granite slope ribboned with thick veins of exposed coal that give the landscape a zebra-like appearance.</p><p><em><strong>Moraeire.</strong></em> Moraeire is a blue-tinted stone column in a valley of similar pillars off the west coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The valley is flooded most of the year, creating a unique ecosystem that’s part bog, part canyon.</p><p><em><strong>Silver Tear. </strong></em>The Silver Tear<strong> </strong>in Anauroch is an underground oasis at the center of a massive grotto. Its exact location is secret, but the entrance lies somewhere at the bottom of a steep gorge riddled with red caves.</p>"

They quietly perform acts of devotion at shrines in their households or neighborhoods, or they visit temples dedicated to a god when they feel the need to demand the god’s attention.</p><p>Forms of worship include verbal prayer—giving thanks for favor shown, acknowledging the god’s dominion and influence, and offering praise for the deity’s interventions, large and small. These prayers are typically accompanied by postures of supplication or praise, and sometimes by offerings of incense, burning herbs, small animals, or monetary gifts.

Worshipers visit temples to spend personal or family time in a space consecrated to a deity or to seek the aid of the priests for personal reasons.</p><p>Small shrines and private chapels are common throughout Faerûn, particularly in areas that lack an official temple. Shrines tend to be unstaffed, kept up by the locals and visitors who use the place for prayer. A shrine might be as modest as a roadside well where traveling merchants can drop a coin to request good fortune from Waukeen, or as grand as a statue of Amaunator surrounded by braziers in a pavilion in the middle of a village.</p><p>Traveling priests visit these sites, which serve as meeting places for the faithful.

For that reason, many people in Faerûn think of their gods as having a fixed gender and even a certain physical appearance, remembered from that cosmic event.

Better yet is depriving bad actors of power in the first place, such as by securing dangerous magical weapons before they fall into the wrong hands.

To someone who says, “Give folks a fish, and they’ll eat today—teach them how to fish, and they’ll eat for the rest of their lives,” a Harper says, “Why not both?”</p><p>When it comes to disarming evildoers, Harpers monitor political powers and employ covert action when necessary. They don’t rush into confrontation when there’s time to study the situation and develop a cohesive plan. On the other hand, no Harper would hesitate to help someone in imminent danger. A Harper balances the desire to gather information and the need to act quickly.</p><p>Harpers’ secondary goals are many, and the prioritization of these goals is a matter of individual discretion. Silver-tongued Harpers focus their talents on the advancement of the order’s virtues, especially fairness and equality. Harpers with a penchant for magic undertake missions to protect or destroy potentially harmful magic items. And, of course, Harpers who simply want to punish the wicked and save the innocent have no trouble finding opportunities to do just that.</p><h4>Harper Code</h4><p>Harpers follow a loose set of guiding ideals called the Harper code. Like the order itself, the code is in a state of constant flux, growing, shrinking, and changing to fit the needs of the time. But some tenets, such as fairness and equality, remain much as they were when the order was first founded.</p><p><em><strong>Watchwords. </strong></em>The Harper code is organized into a system of phrases called watchwords. Harpers coin and recite watchwords to guide their actions in uncertain situations. Harpers exchange watchwords with one another as pass phrases or to verify identities. Senior Harpers pass down watchwords in their sacred rites of initiation and in the training of new recruits.</p><p>Some Harpers carry a small book in which they collect or pen watchwords, but the Harper code has no official canon. Still, a few watchwords are so common that all Harpers can be expected to know them. Examples include the following:</p><ul><li>No one is free until all are free.</li><li>Whatever it takes, a Harper will do.</li><li>Study the past to preserve the future.</li><li>For freedom to flourish, there must be balance.</li></ul><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.ZZhOrR4rWXA61WAF caption=false]</p>"

Rather, they consist of many small cells and lone agents who operate within a vast, loose network. This open and resilient structure has enabled the Harpers to form, disband, and re-form many times in the history of the Realms.</p><p>As befits their ethos, there is no one leader of the Harpers. Authority and responsibility are shared equally among members. That said, veteran Harpers have broader access to useful contacts and greater knowledge of goings on simply by virtue of having been around longer, and novice Harpers tend to take missions and receive counsel from their more experienced peers.</p><p>Harpers have strong bonds with their fellow Harpers. Feuds or even friendly rivalries among members are rare. A Harper never hesitates to help a fellow Harper in need.</p><h4>Harper Cells and Strongholds</h4><p>Although they range across Faerûn, Harpers aren’t a unified force. Some Harpers act mostly independently, but many belong to a local Harper cell—a collective of Harpers who share information and undertake missions together. These cells are differentiated by the location of their strongholds (if they have one), their local notoriety, and what parts of the Harper code they consider most important.</p><p>The Harpers of Twilight Hall in Berdusk, for example, work in coordinated groups to achieve long-range plans. Harpers based out of Silverymoon, on the other hand, emphasize the responsible use of magic and securing dangerous Artifacts. Yet another example is Harpers like those led by Storm Silverhand in Shadowdale: lone wolves who conduct themselves like secret agents.</p><h4>Joining the Harpers</h4><p>A person doesn’t simply become a Harper—they have to be chosen by a Harper to receive the honor. Harpers observe potential candidates from afar to assess their words and deeds. Candidates deemed worthy are approached by a Harper in disguise who poses a test of the individual’s character. This test is typically a fabricated moral dilemma or a veiled choice between self-enrichment and self-sacrifice. To ensure their motives are true, a candidate shouldn’t know they are being observed or tested.</p><p>A candidate who passes the secret test is eventually apprised of the gambit and invited to the Harpers. To join the order, the individual must swear an oath before a council of senior Harpers to uphold the Harper code. Once an individual swears this oath, they must uphold it for life.</p><p>Ex-Harpers are rare for two reasons. First, the process for testing new Harpers is rigorous enough to weed out most candidates unwilling to maintain the oath. Second, the punishment for betraying the Harpers is severe, summarized by this watchword: Traitors must die. The few Harpers who abandon their oath—or who commit an offense that doesn’t warrant death—are cast out of the order. Atonement is sometimes possible, but it is a long and arduous endeavor.</p><h4>High Harpers</h4><p>Harpers are equal in rank with one notable exception: the High Harpers. These mysterious figures are responsible for the Harpers’ long-term planning and the order’s greatest campaigns against evil. High Harpers are voted into their position by a secret ballot among other High Harpers, who select candidates from among the order’s most accomplished and capable individuals.</p><p>The High Harpers rarely convene, and when they do, it is a truly momentous—or dire—occasion. Someone who seeks an audience with the High Harpers might wait many moons before receiving their counsel, if it is ever granted. But the wait is worthwhile; the High Harpers’ favor is a great honor and a tremendous resource.</p>"

Cities in the alliance frequently sponsor tournaments, festivals, and fundraisers to increase the perception of a unified North.</p><p>Many within the Lords’ Alliance believe the best defense is a strong offense and that the alliance should proactively eliminate threats.

          "name": "Leadership and Organization",
          "text": "<p>Each member of the Lords’ Alliance has an official representative on the alliance’s governing body, the Council of Lords. Typically this representative is the settlement’s ruler. When necessary, a representative can select a proxy to stand in the representative’s place.</p><p>Representatives convene several times per year for a Lords’ Assembly. These assemblies occur around the same time as the festivals that mark the changing of the seasons. Alliance members take turns hosting assemblies, with preference given to cities that have suitably large (and secure) forum spaces. During times of crisis, such as war or catastrophe, an emergency assembly might be called.</p><h4>Alliance Members</h4><p>Following are descriptions of some of the members of the Lords’ Alliance and their representatives on the Council of Lords. New members join occasionally, and members sometimes leave the alliance or are expelled.</p><p><em><strong>Amphail.</strong></em> Rivaling Longsaddle for the honor of the alliance’s smallest settlement, Amphail is best known as a playground for bored nobles from Waterdeep. Petty family feuds are the order of the day in Amphail, as are minor catastrophes caused by the unabashed negligence of haughty aristocrats. Lord Warder Dauner Ilzimmer speaks for Amphail on the Council of Lords, but like most nobles in Amphail, he has little interest in matters that don’t endanger his cushy lifestyle.</p><p><em><strong>Baldur’s Gate.</strong></em> The massive city of Baldur’s Gate is one of the Sword Coast’s most powerful trading ports, and Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard’s outsize influence on the Council of Lords reflects this. In Baldur’s Gate, criminals, cultists, and corruption hold as much (if not more) sway as the city’s nobles. The city requires frequent aid from the Lords’ Alliance to maintain order within its walls.</p><p><em><strong>Daggerford.</strong></em> Lady Morwen Daggerford oversees the small, walled town of Daggerford, surrounded by floodplains and pastures. It is a key stopover for caravans headed to Waterdeep or Baldur’s Gate, and this function as a watering hole and supply outfitter makes Daggerford a vital member of the alliance. Daggerford is the kind of idyllic town that settlements in the North aspire to be, with lively taverns and merry festivals that draw visitors from all around.</p><p><em><strong>Longsaddle. </strong></em>Longsaddle is an unassuming hamlet of ranchers, butchers, and farriers famous for a family of wizards, the Harpells, who call it home. Dowell Harpell is Longsaddle’s representative to the Lords’ Alliance, though the wizard exhibits little interest in foreign affairs and rarely speaks during assemblies.</p><p><em><strong>Mirabar. </strong></em>Humans and dwarves are the primary residents of Mirabar, an ancient city built partly belowground. The city’s lifeblood is its gem mines, and Marchion Selin Ramur jockeys for resources from the Lords’ Alliance to protect Mirabar’s vast stores of wealth.</p><p><em><strong>Mithral Hall. </strong></em>Mithral Hall is the ancestral home of the famous Battlehammer dwarven clan. Despite its status as an alliance member, Mithral Hall is more of a stronghold than a settlement, with tunnels to other dwarf holds hidden deep below its mines. Queen Dagnabbet Waybeard represents Mithral Hall on the Council of Lords; a bold leader and a fierce warrior, she firmly supports Mithral Hall’s membership in the Lords’ Alliance despite other dwarven settlements’ reluctance to join the coalition. The queen’s proxy on the council is Ambassador Connerad Brawnanvil.</p><p><em><strong>Neverwinter. </strong></em>The City of Skilled Hands is no stranger to the threats that the Lords’ Alliance was formed to rally against—ancient monsters, agents of Thay, devils from the Nine Hells, and more have endangered Neverwinter in the course of its history. Those who call it home are a serious, resilient folk. Dagult Neverember is the city’s present lord protector, and he commands the people’s respect.</p><p><em><strong>Silverymoon. </strong></em>The peaceful city of Silverymoon is a bastion for scholars, treasure hunters, and anyone who seeks respite from the harsher realities of the North. It is a famous haven for the Harpers and is known for its schools, shrines, and great library. The city’s current leader, Lord Methrammar Aerasumé, is a gruff tactician and Silverymoon’s proxy to the Council of Lords, but the city’s representative is Methrammar’s predecessor, the wise Lord Taern Hornblade.</p><p><em><strong>Waterdeep. </strong></em>Many Waterdhavians become agents of the Lords’ Alliance to represent not Waterdeep as a whole but rather one of Waterdeep’s many power-hungry lords. For her part, the open lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand, uses spies to assess visiting adventurers. Those who show potential receive invitations from the city guard to undertake quests for the Lords’ Alliance.</p><p><em><strong>Yartar. </strong></em>Yartar is a fortified town best known for its impressive barge-building operation and annual hiring fair, the latter of which attracts adventurers and patrons from across the North. Yartar’s leader and alliance representative, Waterbaron Nestra Ruthiol, is an underhanded, cunning aristocrat. Her vengeful schemes and petty rivalries typify the sorts of internal strife that limit Yartar’s potential influence in the alliance.</p>"

They embody virtue for its own sake and model ideals of bravery and piousness for the common people they protect.

But knights also acknowledge that zealotry can lead to fanaticism, and they caution each other to be wary of straying from the path of good.</p><p>A knight follows the order’s creed, the Code of Scales and Weights.

Its knights use every resource available, including armed reconnaissance, magical scrying, and divine consultation with higher powers. To ensure they can act swiftly against the forces of evil, knights maintain fortified strongholds along border lands, keep well-stocked armories, and practice daily to remain in peak fighting condition.</p><p>The Order of the Gauntlet strives not only to expand the boundaries of just society but to maintain justice in lands where it has already taken root. Knights of the order strengthen their presence by establishing chapters—fortresses and strongholds from which knights venture on missions.</p><p>In keeping with their mandate for swift, tough action, knights of the order are neither subtle nor discreet. In fact, many knights view any amount of deceit or trickery as cowardice unbefitting a member of the Order of the Gauntlet. “There is no shame in doing what is right” is a popular axiom used to encourage knights to serve the order openly.</p><p>The order emphasizes retribution rather than proactive measures. Its knights don’t try to predict evil or preempt it, believing the practice of trying to preempt villainy, even if well meaning, is the first step on the road toward tyranny. As one line in the Code of Scales and Weights puts it, knights of the order should strive to “punish evil actions, but not evil thoughts.” The order insists on personal freedom, believing that every individual, regardless of their past or associates, can act morally and honorably if given the choice.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.xM1HAtpzl7iG00Eb caption=false]</p><h4>Code of Scales and Weights</h4><p>To enact judgment quickly and with certainty, the Order of the Gauntlet relies on a lengthy list of crimes and punishments called the Code of Scales and Weights. The Code defines crimes against the order (“scales”), as well as appropriate punishments (“weights”).</p><p>A written version of the Code is available at every chapter of the Order of the Gauntlet. However, as every knight knows, evildoers won’t wait patiently for a law enforcer to consult their notes. Thus, to be initiated to the order, every aspiring knight must commit the Code to heart and recite it before an audience of other knights.</p><h4>Role in War</h4><p>In times of war, the order’s troops are among the toughest, most steadfast soldiers on the Sword Coast. City-states and small nations call on the order to aid their campaigns against injustice. However, the order lends its sword only in conflicts of good versus evil; the order is reluctant to choose sides in morally ambiguous feuds or petty territorial disputes.</p><p>In addition to serving as infantry in their own units, veterans of the order act as sergeants or commanders for other units. Soldiers have few qualms taking orders from a knight of the Order of the Gauntlet; many know the leadership and tactical expertise of the order mean the difference between a disorganized defeat and a glorious victory.</p>"

It’s possible, though rare, for a knight to skip one or more ranks when ascending the order’s hierarchy.</p><p>Members of the order must respect and follow their superiors. Failure to do so is punished by expulsion from the order. This strictness cuts both ways: a high-ranking knight discovered abusing their station is tried in the order’s private judicial system, the Court of Justice, and punished severely.</p><h4>Trials and Justice</h4><p>The Order of the Gauntlet judges evildoers summarily and punish them promptly. To determine punishments, knights refer to the Code of Scales and Weights or, if in doubt, use a spell such as <em>Commune </em>to ask a divinity (typically Tyr or Torm) for guidance. Only in the most morally gray situations will knights arrest an offender. Arrested suspects are taken to the nearest chapter to undergo a Court of Justice.</p><p>A Court of Justice includes interrogations, cross-examinations, and follow-up investigations. Knights of justice use magic such as the <em>Zone of Truth </em>spell to determine the facts and identify wrongdoing. Suspects not convicted within a tenday are released.</p><p>Knights of justice monitor other knights and the order’s larger activities, keeping an eye out for corruption and fanaticism.</p><h4>Chapters, Leaders, and Faiths</h4><p>The Order of the Gauntlet’s bases are called chapters.

These cults are ancient and appear on every world. Whenever and wherever the cults manifest, heroes or gods usually seek to destroy them in due order. But the elemental cults never truly die, eventually returning in some fashion.</p><p>The elemental cults venerate a mysterious force or principle called Elemental Evil. Each cult worships Elemental Evil in its own way, favoring one of the four primordial elements: air, earth, fire, or water. The cults operate independently from one another, and each believes itself superior to the others.</p><h4>Air</h4><p>Cultists of the Howling Hatred venerate the element of air. To them, powerful winds are the ultimate expression of power. Air cultists are among the most vengeful and petty members of the elemental cults, seeing slights in every social encounter and brooding on ways to get back at their rivals. The cult’s numbers frequently include assassins, illusionists, and spies.</p><h4>Earth</h4><p>The Cult of the Black Earth aims to destroy civilization by exerting the inexorable power of the land. Earth cultists conduct rituals to bring about mudslides, sinkholes, and earthquakes in the effort to wipe the world clean of those who defile it. This cult counts miners and quarry workers among its enemies and burrowing beasts like ankhegs and bulettes among its allies.</p><h4>Fire</h4><p>The followers of the Eternal Flame cult worship the destructive power of fire in all its manifestations. Their ideal world is a wasteland of ash and cinders—a world purified by flames. Fire cultists tend to be reckless and brash. They launch themselves into dangerous situations with no regard for their own safety, seeking only to inflict as much damage as possible. To fire cultists, it is better to burn brightly and briefly than to live a long life of mediocrity.</p><h4>Water</h4><p>Cultists of the Crushing Wave believe that all life is simply water waiting to be set free by way of bloodshed, drowning, or pulverizing pressure. Members of this cult are opportunistic and pragmatic, exploiting enemies’ weaknesses whenever possible. They seek out wealth and magic items to advance their schemes. Among those who hear the call of Elemental Evil, fishers, sailors, and others who feel at home on water are typically drawn to this cult.</p>"

          "name": "Leadership and Organization",
          "text": "<p>The Purple Dragon Knights have a simple rank structure. The leader of the organization is the Grand Knight, currently Dunstan Cormaeril, who has served in this role since the re-formation of the Purple Dragon Knights a decade ago. Dunstan is assisted and advised by the spirit of Eldenser, whose incorporeal form dwells inside Dunstan’s magic sword. Because Dunstan doesn’t have a living amethyst dragon partner, he can’t travel around Faerûn as easily as other knights can, and his duties keep him at Purplemont, the knights’ fortress in Suzail.</p><p>The Grand Knight is assisted by a council of twelve High Knights, experienced warriors whose loyalty to Cormyr is beyond question. They lead other knights of Cormyr in battle.</p><p>Most Purple Dragon Knights are simply knights, with no other rank. While knights aspire to become High Knights, few ever achieve that rank. Knights might be assigned quests by the Grand Knight or the queen, but between missions they live as knights errant. They travel Cormyr or anywhere their dragon takes them, pursuing justice for the oppressed, protecting the weak, and furthering the goals of Cormyr.</p><p>New knights carry the title of knight novice for a year and a day. During this time, they follow the orders of other knights and master the art of riding a dragon. But because the Purple Dragon Knights are few, knight novices must often rise to the occasion by undertaking perilous missions with only their dragons and fellow adventurers for allies.</p><p>Purple Dragon Knights sometimes take squires—aspiring knights who have not yet earned their dragon partner.</p><h4>Taking the Purple</h4><p>An individual who wants to join the Purple Dragon Knights—or “take the purple,” in Cormyrean parlance—must get the attention of a knight and ask to become the knight’s squire. For citizens of Cormyr, this is relatively easy; an aspiring squire who goes to Purplemont in Suzail can usually attract a knight’s attention in short order. But the legend of the Purple Dragon Knights has spread far and wide in recent years, and people from Icewind Dale to Calimshan dream of riding an amethyst dragon across Faerûnian skies. For these people, finding a knight can be a significant quest.</p><p>Knights decide who to take as a squire. Most knights expect a squire to demonstrate fighting skill, courage, a willingness to follow orders, and a keen sense of right and wrong. More eager candidates exist than there are amethyst dragons, so knights select only the best to become squires. Since it’s considered bad luck to accept a squire who has already been refused by another knight, few aspirants continue their quest for knighthood after facing rejection.</p><p>Squires usually train for a few years before they’re made a knight, but proving their courage, skill, and character in extraordinary circumstances can expedite their knighthood. But before a squire can become a Purple Dragon Knight, an amethyst dragon must choose the squire as its rider. Not every squire is chosen, and squires passed over by a dragon often get discouraged and quit their pursuit of knighthood. Others stick it out, continuing to serve the Purple Dragon Knights as squires or administrators in hopes to be chosen as a dragon’s rider one day.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Amethyst Dragons</h3><p>Amethyst dragons are detailed in <span>Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons</span>, and you can find their stat blocks there along with more information on Eldenser. They are the most powerful kind of gem dragon. Whereas chromatic dragons are typically evil, and metallic dragons typically good, gem dragons are typically neutral. They have the same age categories as other dragons (wyrmling, young, adult, ancient) but their spellcasting powers are psionic in nature. The breath weapon of an amethyst dragon is a bead of exploding gravitational force. Amethyst dragons can breathe underwater and swim at great speed.</p></aside><h4>The Dragon and the Knight</h4><p>The relationship between a Purple Dragon Knight and an amethyst dragon partner is complicated and intense. Amethyst dragons are telepathic; they routinely read their partners’ minds and communicate by thought. Every Purple Dragon Knight knows that secrets can’t exist between a dragon and its rider if both are to succeed; eventually the pair comes to know everything about each other.</p><p>Amethyst dragons are exceptionally powerful. A Purple Dragon Knight is usually far less formidable than the dragon they ride. But a dragon’s rider has courage, ambition, and hope—qualities admired by amethyst dragons. The best pairings strategically leverage their strengths and weaknesses. Against an especially dangerous enemy, a knight is apt to let the dragon take point. When a situation calls for diplomacy and a dragon might be seen as a threat, the knight leads.</p><p>Purple Dragon Knights make use of their amethyst dragons’ unique powers outside of encounters as well. For example, because amethyst dragons can breathe underwater and swim at great speed, many knights make temporary camps in undersea grottoes or in hidden pools accessible only by flooded tunnels. The Grand Knight even built a secret sanctuary for the knights in the Dragonmere, a small sea on Cormyr’s southern coast.</p>"

In the wake of the empire’s fall, and subsequent magical devastation by wicked aberrant monsters known as phaerimm, the desolate desert slowly spreads, threatening to devour the surrounding lands.</p><p>Despite the harsh conditions in Anauroch, people still eke out an existence there. Remnants of Netheril returned from a long retreat to the Shadowfell and resettled with designs on spreading their power and influence once again. Nomadic peoples adapted to the trials of the region travel and live comfortably within the wastes. Travelers and fortune seekers from afar also carve out a niche in the desert, seeking fortunes and relics of the past beneath the sands and ice.</p><p>Adventures in Anauroch include themes of survival, for the struggle against the brutal conditions never relaxes. In addition to the harsh climate, vicious creatures call the wastelands home, jealously guarding the lost magic and knowledge of the realms that rose and fell in the region’s past.</p><h4>Bedine Tribes</h4><p>The nomadic Bedine people have lived in Anauroch for centuries, traveling from oasis to oasis, living in tents, and following small herds of desert-dwelling animals. Most tribes live in the region known as the Sword and number around a hundred people, encountering another tribe only once or twice a year. Their knowledge of the desert and hardy survival skills command respect.</p><h4>Empire of Shadows</h4><p>Anauroch is littered with the ruins of the ancient empire of Netheril, which fell in a magical cataclysm almost 3,000 years ago. Some of these ruins lie frozen in ice, their magical secrets preserved and waiting for Netherese survivors—or bold adventurers—to discover them. In the Year of Wild Magic (1372 DR), the Netherese flying city of Thultanthar, also called the City of Shade, emerged from the Shadowfell, where it had lain hidden for centuries. Its rulers, calling themselves Shadovar, began rebuilding their long-lost empire and even returning life and growth to the desert. Thultanthar fell in 1487 DR, crashing in Myth Drannor (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.lrG0hZ4y4gGV9hm9]{Heartlands}” in this chapter), and the Shadovar empire fell with it. But survivors of that catastrophe are working to re-create the fallen city near the Shoal of Thirst.</p><p><em><strong>Shade. </strong></em>The former city of Thultanthar, capital of the Empire of Shade, was a magical flying marvel. After it crashed, survivors of the empire built a new settlement on the slopes of the Scimitar Spires, overlooking the Shoal of Thirst. Though this city, called Shade, can’t yet fly, it is inspired by old Thultanthar, and it resembles a piece of the Shadowfell transplanted to Faerûn. Its lightless avenues and sunless courtyards are shrouded in impenetrable gloom despite the desert’s glaring sun, providing a comfortable home for the city’s Shadovar rulers. Most explorers and traders avoid the city, as the Shadovar attack intruders.</p><h4>Zhentarim Caravans</h4><p>The Zhentarim carved out a niche in Anauroch long ago by forging and securing caravan routes across the desert that bypass the High Ice to the north. Its guides and guards are experienced in navigating these paths and command steep prices to guide traders and travelers safely across with their wagon trains.</p><p><em><strong>Black Road. </strong></em>The Black Road is the main trade route that crosses Anauroch. Zhentarim garrisons and patrols monitor the road and protect the life-giving oases that dot its length. They exert immense influence over this road. They provide protection, travel stations, and access to oases but expect their tolls to be paid promptly.</p><h4>Anauroch Features</h4><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.VYn1r0q1vKO8GHg7 caption=false classes=\"float-right size-three\"]</p><p>Outsiders often imagine Anauroch to be a featureless expanse of desolate sand, but in fact it is defined by a glacier in the north and a central rocky plateau, both surrounded by the wind-blown sands.</p><p><em><strong>At’ar’s Looking Glass. </strong></em>A hazardous, sweltering stretch of desert in southeastern Anauroch is At’ar’s Looking Glass, named for the merciless Bedine sun god, whose face is reflected by the sand back up and into the heavens.</p><p><em><strong>High Ice. </strong></em>The desolate glacier called the High Ice crowns the northern reaches of Anauroch. Few people live here. Arctic monsters abound on the High Ice’s frosty plains, including different kinds of dragons. In spite of the danger, expeditions strike out into the glacier hoping to plunder ancient cities that have been buried in and preserved by ice.</p><p><em><strong>Plain of Standing Stones. </strong></em>The central region of Anauroch is the Plain of Standing Stones, a plateau that overlooks the sandy desert to the south. This area is mostly waterless, covered in gravel and jagged rock and ravaged by constant, howling winds. This is where the Shadovar first discovered chardalyn—a dark, icelike crystal that absorbs magic.</p><p><em><strong>Saiyaddar. </strong></em>One place in southern Anauroch teems with lush greenery and abundant animal life: the Saiyaddar. This verdant valley within the Sword is lined with natural springs that keep it watered, and the Bedine people guard the area as a hunting ground and safe waypoint for travelers. None of the individual Bedine tribes lay claim to Saiyaddar, and they work together fiercely to ensure that no one else tries.</p><p><em><strong>Scimitar Spires. </strong></em>The Scimitar Spires is a range of sharp mountain peaks that abut the Shoal of Thirst and the lush Saiyaddar valley. Nestled in the northern reach of the Spires is Elah’zad, an oasis sacred to the god Eldath. A temple at the oasis is made of translucent desert rock; it’s said Eldath can speak through anyone who enters the temple.</p><p><em><strong>Shoal of Thirst. </strong></em>Shadovar magic once created and preserved a body of water here called the Shadow Sea. With Thultanthar’s destruction and the fall of the empire, the magical cloud cover that protected the sea blew away, and the desert swiftly reclaimed the land. Legends speak of valuable gems once buried beneath the sea that now lie exposed to treasure hunters, but the Shoal’s proximity to Shade makes excavation of those gems a dangerous task.</p><p><em><strong>The Sword. </strong></em>When most people think of Anauroch, they think of the southern region known as the Sword, named for the bandits and raiders who maraud the region. Vicious creatures such as wyverns and purple worms are abundant.</p><h4>Noteworthy Sites</h4><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.t0ut3ng74ME7Wgdf caption=false]</p><p>Anauroch is littered with ancient ruins, particularly those of fallen Netherese cities. For those willing to sift through the expanses of weathered stones and sand, the desert holds many secrets buried in time, many of which are powerful, valuable, or both.</p><p><em><strong>Araugul.</strong></em> The southern region of Anauroch was once home to a large, expansionist goblinoid realm known as Hlundadim. The fortress-city of Araugul, also known as Goblinmount, was its capital and the home of the mysterious wizard Hlundadim, founder and leader of the realm. As weather in Anauroch grew arid and the land turned to dust, the goblins fled and the wizard vanished as mysteriously as he appeared. That was over a thousand years ago. Goblinoids and their allies have since returned to the ruins, and some live there still, defending the city from intruders.</p><p><em><strong>Ascore. </strong></em>The ruined northern city of Ascore was once a bustling port on the shore of a now-dried sea. Now its windswept streets are haunted by undead, and the ancient blue dragon Iymrith has claimed the ruins as part of her territory. Somewhere in its depths, Ascore holds a portal into the lost Netherese city of Hlaungadath. The portal is activated by reading the final line of a carving in a stone archway.</p><p><em><strong>Azirrhat. </strong></em>A small cluster of peaks on the southeast edge of the Plain of Standing Stones is known as Azirrhat, a word meaning “slashed rocks.” The crags are dotted with veins of gold, and prospectors sometimes brave encounters with the asabi, a territorial, nocturnal group of lizardfolk that dwell in the peaks.</p><p><em><strong>Heroes’ Helm. </strong></em>The rocky pinnacle of Heroes’ Helm in central Anauroch rises four hundred feet and is shaped like the helmet of a mighty warrior, complete with two caves where the warrior’s eyes would be. The caves lead to an expansive central cavern, home to an ancient blue dragon named Ghondalaath.</p><p><em><strong>Hlaungadath. </strong></em>One of the ruined flying cities of Netheril in Anauroch, Hlaungadath landed near the High Ice and was abandoned. In the ages since, it has been claimed by a powerful family of lamias. The city is still largely intact, maintained by the lamias and their thralls. The lamias kill most intruders, but they occasionally pick a few to ensnare with their curses and enchantments, keeping them as pets and servants. Most peoples of Anauroch know the place’s reputation and stay well away, but lost knowledge and potential wealth are powerful lures for adventurers.</p><p><em><strong>Lashloc. </strong></em>The so-called Lake of Ice is the result of subterranean hot springs that melt a sliver of the High Ice into a long, twisting lake. For creatures that live on the High Ice, Lashloc is an oasis—a place to stay warm and find liquid water without needing a fire. High winds freeze some of the lake’s surface water into ice floes. Predatory creatures lair within the lake, but three insidious aboleths dominate, using the lake’s unusual nature to draw in victims.</p><p><em><strong>Mines of Tethyamar. </strong></em>On the edge of Anauroch, southeast of Addas Babar, once lay the dwarven realm of Tethyamar. This vast city branched out underground as scattered and self-reliant neighborhoods that contributed to a large and thriving whole. Four centuries ago, Tethyamar was conquered by evil wizards commanding fiends and mercenaries. Repeated attempts to reclaim the city ended in failure. The survivors fled to Daggerdale in the Dalelands. The Zhentarim had a long trade rivalry with Tethyamar when the city was lost, and Zhents have plundered the upper levels of the lost city for magical secrets and treasure.</p><p><em><strong>The Shattered Tower. </strong></em>Long ago, phaerimm magic brought down the cloud castle of a storm giant, which crashed in eastern Anauroch. Adventurers have found the skeletal remains of storm giants and looted many of its halls. The castle is vast and inhabited by elementals and a blue dragon that either survived the crash or moved in after.</p><p><em><strong>The Smokeholes. </strong></em>Travelers in the High Ice see huge gouts of smoke and steam rising from the Smokeholes from many miles away. These vents were created by a massive network of underground lava tubes and lakes known as the Caverns of Burning Ice, inhabited by salamanders and dragons that would otherwise find the High Ice inhospitable, including blue, brass, and red dragons. The heat from the lava creates vents in the ice above and carves out steamy grottoes that capture warm, wet air.</p><p><em><strong>Untrivvin. </strong></em>Yetis dwell on the slopes of a mountain in the High Ice called Untrivvin, but the mountain’s interior is a catacomb of meticulously crafted tunnels and halls that echo and amplify any sound made within them. This is the source of the mountain’s name, which means “singing rock.” The honeycomb of passages within the mountain suggest that they were carved, perhaps by an ancient civilization predating even those of the giants and dragons.</p><h4>Life in Anauroch</h4><p>Simply surviving in Anauroch is a challenge. The people that dwell here rely on traditions based on generations of experience.</p><p><em><strong>Banditry. </strong></em>Brigands, raiders, and other bandits are an unfortunate constant in Anauroch. Victims of these bandits face a choice: fight to defend their property, or allow raiders to take what they please in the hope that enough is left behind for life to continue.</p><p><em><strong>Dry Death. </strong></em>Finding water is a struggle for anything that lives in this region. Most places are bone dry sand and dusty stone. The High Ice is a frozen glacier with no fuel for fire in sight.</p><p><em><strong>Gods and Names. </strong></em>Deities worshiped in Anauroch are often gods of the Faerûnian pantheon who go by other faces and names. At’ar, for example, is a pitiless sun god, but scholars of other lands consider her a form of Amaunator. Eldath, a god of peaceful waters, tenaciously maintains a presence in this harsh land, much like the springs and oases that offer life among the dust.</p><p><em><strong>Travels and Trade. </strong></em>For many in Anauroch, life is spent on the move, as staying still often means death. Bedine tribes bring their food and livelihood with them, escorting herds between oases. Others, like the Zhentarim, move back and forth over the Black Road, a dangerous but profitable route across the desert.</p><p>For centuries, the Red Wizards of Thay have threatened Faerûn, but no one has felt that threat more acutely than the realms of Aglarond and Rashemen, who have fought off Thayan raids and invasions and kept Thay bottled up within its old borders. To do this, Aglarondans and Rashemi have had to learn arcane magic powerful enough to match that of the Red Wizards.</p>"

Although all kinds of arcane magic are practiced in these lands, each realm has its own preferred magical tradition. In Aglarond, where the legendary Simbul once ruled, sorcery reigns supreme. In Rashemen, warlocks called hathrans forge pacts with mighty spirits known as telthors. And, in Thay, the word of a Red Wizard is law. All the Arcane Empires maintain large fighting forces augmented by spellcasting leaders. The common folk of these lands, though, aren’t spellcasters; magical training is a sign of status and power.</p><p>Adventures here spotlight the struggle against supernatural foes, with both heroes and villains wielding dazzling arcane magic. Sometimes this struggle takes place on the battlefield between armies. But often characters wage war in the shadows, infiltrating Thayan strongholds or sniffing out Red Wizard agents.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.4XUya6dcMORvGlM2 caption=false]</p><h4>Aglarond</h4><p>The realm of Aglarond was founded five centuries ago, bringing together human settlers and elves of the Yuirwood in a treaty of mutual defense and friendship. For centuries, the Red Wizards of Thay have posed a constant threat, leaving Aglarondans distrusting of arcane magic. This changed under the leadership of the Simbul, a sorcerer of legendary power whose goodness—while capricious—was beyond question. Under the Simbul’s leadership, individuals born with arcane magic were trained as sorcerers, and this tradition has continued after her death. Now the realm is ruled by the Simbarch Council, most of whom are arcane spellcasters.</p><p>Aglarond is famous as a place where elves and humans have come together to form a single realm. Marriage between elves and humans is common there.</p><p><em><strong>Altumbel.</strong></em> The small human kingdom called Altumbel is often considered part of Aglarond, but its inhabitants assert its independence and distinct identity. People here make their living from the sea, and the capital, Spandeliyon, is called the City of Pirates.</p><p><em><strong>Fang Light. </strong></em>The small peninsula that juts north of Velprintalar is known as South Fang. (Cape Dragonfang in Thesk, on the north side of the Sea of Dlurg, is called North Fang in Aglarond.) It’s an isolated and parochial backwater whose inhabitants are derisively known as “Fangers” by other residents of the Arcane Empires. At the tip of South Fang stands Fang Light, a magical lighthouse maintained by a mage that guides ships in and out of the Sea of Dlurg. Pirates frequently target the lighthouse.</p><p><em><strong>Sunglade. </strong></em>Just inside the southern edge of the Yuirwood stands the Sunglade, a double circle of standing stones decorated with elven runes. This ancient site was constructed by and sacred to inhabitants of the Yuirwood who left or died out long ago. The outer ring of larger stones bears dedications to deities of the elven pantheon, the Seldarine, while the inner stones represent the deities of long-gone human inhabitants of the Yuirwood. Though apparently abandoned, the stones remain in excellent repair, and a mystic presence lingers in the sunny glade, waiting for someone to speak to it.</p><p><em><strong>Umber Marshes.</strong></em> Named for the rusty water created by its iron deposits, the Umber Marshes is the border between Aglarond and Thay. Countless raids and invasions have criss-crossed this swamp, which is famous for intolerable bloodsucking insects and deadly monsters.</p><p><em><strong>Velprintalar.</strong></em> The crown jewel of the Aglarond peninsula is Velprintalar, one of the most beautiful cities in Faerûn. The Simbarch Council, made up of sorcerers and other spellcasters, rules Aglarond from a magnificent palace of pale-green Mulhorandi stone. Sorcerers from across Faerûn come here for training.</p><p><em><strong>Watchwall.</strong></em> Between the fortress city of Glarondar and the slopes of the mountain Umbergoth stretches the fifteen-mile-long stone Watchwall built long ago by galeb duhr for the Aglarondan crown. The Watchers—guards assigned to the wall—keep a constant lookout for Thayan aggression.</p><p><em><strong>Wizards’ Reach.</strong></em> The cities along Aglarond’s south coast are nominally ruled by Aglarond, but in practice the farther east one goes, the more the Red Wizards hold sway. Cross-country travel through the coastal marshes is difficult. Monsters leave the eaves of the Yuirwood and roam the coast of the Wizards’ Reach.</p><p><em><strong>Yuirwood.</strong></em> Elves who settled this forest millennia ago were called Yuir. Over centuries, humans joined them and adopted elven traditions, living among ancient Yuir ruins. These woods are protected by powerful magic that blocks scrying and detection spells. Fey crossings are plentiful, and many dangerous animals call the forest home.</p><h4>Rashemen</h4><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.AghCOlziJ3ARzTQi caption=false classes=\"float-right size-three\"]</p><p>An infamously insular realm of deep forests, high mountains, and wind-blasted heaths, Rashemen is home to magical practices considered strange by outsiders but also respected as frightfully potent. The warriors of Rashemen are berserkers known for their fierce frenzy in battle. The ruler of the realm, titled the Iron Lord, is chosen from among the berserkers by a council of mask-wearing spellcasters called hathrans. The hathrans are leaders in many aspects of Rashemen’s society, drawing their magic from pacts with powerful spirits that dwell in the realm’s magical woodlands. The current Iron Lord is Mangan Uruk, who has held the position for a generation.</p><p>The people of Rashemen revere a trio of gods they call the Three: Bhalla (the Den Mother), Khelliara (the Forest Maiden), and the Hidden One. In addition to these gods, countless potent and dangerous spirits called telthor live in the forests and wild spaces of Rashemen. These gods and spirits make pacts with spellcasters, who don individualized masks representing their pacts. These spellcasters are called wychlaran (“wise ones”), in recognition of the wisdom bestowed on them in their pacts.</p><p>Traditionally, wychlaran women are called hathrans (“wise sisters”) and form a governing council that selects the Iron Lord, while wychlaran men are called vremyonni (“old ones”) and support the hathrans by crafting magic items and inventing new spells. These roles have relaxed as Rashemen has opened more to the outside world, and wychlaran outside of Rashemen aren’t bound to these roles.</p><p><em><strong>Ashenwood.</strong></em> By order of the hathrans, no one is permitted to live in this ancient forest, which is home to mighty spirits, intelligent animals, and fierce monsters. Rashemi enter Ashenwood to commune with or hunt these creatures, placating the spirits with gifts and offerings of food.</p><p><em><strong>Citadel Rashemar.</strong></em> Once a mighty fortress, Citadel Rashemar was flattened over a century ago by invaders from the east who slaughtered the entire garrison of two thousand warriors. Now a coven of hags controls the ruins, served by a small army of goblins, giant animals, ogres, and other monsters.</p><p><em><strong>High Country. </strong></em>The north end of the Sunrise Mountains is called the High Country. This perilous region is marked by wild magic, strange occurrences, and crumbling monoliths built by the ancient empire of Raumathar. These monoliths imprison demons summoned and once controlled by Narfell; now hathrans check them every year to ensure the wards don’t fail. An ancient white dragon, Kissethkashan, commands these mountains, but the site of his lair is unknown.</p><p><em><strong>Immilmar.</strong></em> Traders, diplomats, and tourists coming to Rashemen often first arrive in Immilmar, Rashemen’s capital. The Iron Lord, the nominal leader of the nation, rules from a mighty castle raised centuries ago by hathran magic and warded with spells. Beyond the castle, citizens dwell in A-frame timber lodges. The city is insular, and visitors are encouraged to leave as quickly as possible.</p><p><em><strong>Mines of Tethkel. </strong></em>The Rashemi folk who live and work in this iron mine are infamously fractious, violent, and unruly. Goblin bandits and worgs prowl the outskirts of the town looking for prey, while kobolds lair in the mines. The kobolds have spent decades building a lair fit for a dragon, and an egg in their hoard has recently hatched into a deep dragon wyrmling.</p><p><em><strong>North Country</strong></em>. The North Country is the land between the Falls of Erech and the Towers of Smoke. While officially part of Rashemen, this land is sparsely populated and scattered with ruined settlements from the ancient realms of Narfell and Raumathar. Rashemi warriors venture into the North Country and plunder these ruins to prove their valor.</p><p><em><strong>Ring of Gray Flames. </strong></em>Five ancient towers built by the Raumathari civilization stand in a circle known as the Ring of Gray Flames. Most are ruined, but two are intact, and mechanical sounds and grinding noises come from within. From atop all five, gray flames spout. Divine magic doesn’t work within or near the towers, and the region is prowled by strange guardians—arcane spells brought to life.</p><p><em><strong>Shevel. </strong></em>Tradespeople established the town of Shevel near the Golden Road trade route to craft and peddle their wares. Over time, the town grew into a thriving, walled city of immigrants within the otherwise-isolated realm of Rashemen. Since the fall of Citadel Rashemar, raids from the lands to the east have been a regular occurrence, and there’s always mercenary work to be found in Shevel.</p><p><em><strong>Sunrise Mountains.</strong></em> Most people consider the nigh-impassible Sunrise Mountains the eastern edge of Faerûn. The range towers fifteen thousand feet high and is littered with ruined towers from the ancient realm of Raumathar and mysterious wells that date to some other forgotten culture. The few passes over the mountains are exceedingly dangerous, and many lethal creatures lair in deep caves and subterranean passages.</p><p><em><strong>Urlingwood.</strong></em> The mystical heart of Rashemen, Urlingwood is a dense, wild forest populated by telthors and supernatural beasts. Rashemen law dictates only hathrans are permitted here under penalty of death.</p><h4>Thay</h4><p>Thay has a reputation as a barren wasteland ruled by tyrannical wizards and populated by their undead minions. The truth is more complex.</p><p>While much of Thay remains barren, ancient weather-controlling spells bring enough rain for rivers and forests. The word of a Red Wizard is law, but most Red Wizards are more interested in self-advancement than conquest. And while undead walk openly in Thay, necromancy is just one of eight schools of magic, and Thay is home to many ordinary citizens just trying to live out their lives. All this combines to make Thay more than the caricature known throughout Faerûn, even if this exaggerated reputation is built on a foundation of truth.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.T36J3ebU1sFaTPDT]</p><p>Thay’s infamous undead ruler, Szass Tam, rules Thay, assisted by seven other zulkirs, each a master of a different school of magic. Few dare to oppose Szass Tam, but the zulkirs and the rulers of Thay’s various tharchs have considerable leeway to do as they please, so long as they don’t attract Szass Tam’s attention.</p><p>Aglarond and Rashemen pride themselves as realms that keep Thay in check, thwarting the Red Wizards’ territorial and magical ambitions. Thayan rulers, called tharchions, try to invade Aglarond or Rashemen every decade or so, and border raids are constant.</p><p><em><strong>The Citadel. </strong></em>A vast and ancient fortress that predates the Red Wizards of Thay, the Citadel was carved out of one of the highest mountains of Thaymount by a lizard-like people who left their images in statues and murals. The Citadel towers among lava, ash, and razor-sharp rocks and has extensive subterranean levels. For centuries, the Citadel has been Thay’s greatest stronghold, and Szass Tam has claimed it for his own. In the Citadel, Szass Tam is unassailable. In the time since he moved into the Citadel, many magical atrocities have occurred there.</p><p><em><strong>Delhumide.</strong></em> Thay began as a colony of the distant Mulhorandi empire, and Delhumide was Thay’s capital. Now the old city is a dangerous ruin inhabited by fiends, evil fey, and desperate folk. These threats keep the region around the ruins sparsely populated, but adventurers brave the ruins in search of lost Thayan treasures.</p><p><em><strong>Plateau of Thay and Thaymount.</strong></em> Central Thay stands on a vast, desolate plateau. Magic formalized by Red Wizards long ago brings rain here, which in turn allows towns, cities, and forests to survive. A second higher plateau rises from the first, culminating in the volcanic peaks of Thaymount. Only Red Wizards and their guests are allowed there.</p><p><em><strong>Tax Stations.</strong></em> Small fortresses called tax stations dot Thay’s border, roads, and internal boundaries. Soldiers at each station check identification papers and collect small but frequent tolls. A typical tax station has a garrison of thirty to fifty warriors, often including a pack of gnolls.</p><p><em><strong>Tharchs.</strong></em> Thay is divided into districts called tharchs, many named after a prominent city in that region; every tharch is governed by a tharchion who answers to one of the eight zulkirs. The eleven tharchs are the Alaor (two islands that house Thay’s fleet and shipyards), Delhumide, Eltabbar, Gauros (everything between the Gauros River and the Sunrise Mountains), High Thay (bounded by the Second Escarpment), Lapendrar (bordering Thesk and Aglarond), Priador, Pyarados, Surthay, Thazalhar, and Tyraturos.</p>"

Between the Sea of Fallen Stars to the south and the Great Glacier to the north, merchant-princes and archdruids struggle for dominion over a harsh, beautiful wilderness and its bounteous resources. Even the land itself vies for supremacy; for every ruler who claims to control a realm, there lies a magical glacier, a shifting labyrinthine forest, or a monster-plagued mountain that proves nothing in these parts can truly be controlled.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.GkDeKNbNS3u1sXPd caption=false]</p><p>The remote north—Damara, Narfell, and the Great Dale—has a well-earned reputation as a harsh land. The climate is dismal, the soil is rocky, and the food is bland. But beneath its crusty exterior, the land teems with river-size veins of gold, caverns lined with gemstones, and buried cities. Those who can endure toiling in the frozen northlands could strike it rich at any moment.</p><p>Conversely, creature comforts abound in the rich kingdoms of Impiltur and Thesk, to say nothing of the Vast’s lush pasturelands and rolling hills of golden grain. Yet, though Impiltur and Thesk are lands of plenty, competition is fierce. Adventurers arrive in droves to cities like Procampur and Telflamm. Gold and jewels are readily abundant in the north, but those who hope to prosper in these realms should be prepared to work fast and face terrible danger.</p><h4>Damara</h4><p>In Damara, hardy folk from many backgrounds work together to turn rocky soil into tillable farmland or extract bloodstone from the mountains to the west. Currently, the usurper King Yarin Frostmantle sits smugly on the throne of the Dragonbane dynasty while his people complain about his tyranny and the growing threat from demons across the country. Despite—or perhaps because of—these facts, Damara is a thriving adventuring hub.</p><p><em><strong>Bloodstone.</strong></em> Nowhere is the bloodstone trade stronger in the Forgotten Lands than in west Damara. Here, amid the East Galena Mountains that separate the lands of Damara from neighboring Vaasa, the ruins of a settlement called Bloodstone mark the infamous Bloodstone Pass. In its 150-year history, Bloodstone served as the battleground for monsters, assassins, warlocks, and countless others who wished to command the gem trade. Its most recent attackers razed Bloodstone to the ground. Little remains of the site except for an ancient, petrified tree that, if legends are to be believed, once bore golden leaves.</p><p><em><strong>Glacier of the White Worm. </strong></em>Nestled near the heart of the Earthspur Mountains is the Glacier of the White Worm: a mass of ice populated by herds of titanic white remorhazes and—if rumors are to be believed—a “king worm” that rules over the others. Devotees of Ilmater from the nearby Monastery of the Yellow Rose practice their sacred remorhaz-taming rites here; a monk who entreats and rides a white remorhaz is said to bear the “gift of the worm” and is afforded great prestige. Yellow Rose sages speculate that the glacier must be magical, for it is too far south for a nonmagical glacier to exist. The source of this magic, however, remains unknown.</p><h4>Great Dale</h4><p>Between Narfell to the north and Thesk to the south are two imposing forests called the Dunwood and the Forest of Lethyr. These forests, in turn, surround a narrow strip of grassland called the Great Dale. Xenophobic druids, reclusive rangers, and enigmatic fey call this realm home and welcome few others into their domain. Those who brave the Great Dale’s depths should keep their wits about them and their spellbooks close—traditional maps are all but useless in the mazelike woods, making divination magic essential for navigation.</p><p><em><strong>Dunwood. </strong></em>Dunwood is a soupy morass of firs and oaks that thins to muskeg in the north. The peaty soil has preserved the ruins of elven and Nar cities. The Dunwood’s countless secrets tempt treasure hunters bold enough to challenge the monsters rampant in the realm: zombies infused with demonic power, ancient living trees with inscrutable motives, and an extensive family of sadistic green dragons.</p><p><em><strong>Dun-Tharos. </strong></em>This great ruin near the center of the Dunwood is the former capital of ancient Narfell. Great plazas and wrecked temples devoted to demonic powers lie half-buried in the mist-shrouded bog. Various fell powers have claimed to rule over these wretched ruins, which are practically unexplored by adventurers. That might change soon—rumors circulating in roadside inns speak of powerful Nar treasures buried in crumbling shrines and flooded conjuring chambers hidden beneath the old ruins of Dun-Tharos.</p><p><em><strong>Forest of Lethyr. </strong></em>Mysteries abound in the gloomy Forest of Lethyr. The druids of Lethyr brook few trespassers in their sacred groves, and they resort to violence against anyone who means to exploit the land’s abundant resources. Outsiders who persist in exploring Lethyr might discover Yeshelmaar, the center of civilization in the Great Dale and a testament to elven engineering. In Yeshelmaar, visitors can see architectural marvels: vast, floating herb gardens; tiered stone courts; and ornately carved grottoes with pools of crystalline spring water, to name just a few.</p><h4>Great Glacier</h4><p>The Great Glacier originally formed from the ice necklace of the deity Ulutiu. The people who call this vast territory home are the Ulutiuns. Few southerners have ever interacted with them. Most outsiders who dare tread these arctic wastes instead encounter fierce monsters adapted to the glacier—white dragons, remorhazes, and even ice devils. The latter are said to be servants of an ancient and mighty priest of Auril who styles herself “the Ice Queen.”</p><h4>Impiltur</h4><p>In the past, Impiltur was among the wealthiest realms in Faerûn. Over the past century, though, the realm unsuccessfully grappled with magically altered geography and incursions from demons and demon worshipers. Now the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars have risen again, and Impiltur’s wealth and influence are returning. Hopeful commoners whisper that a lost monarch of the old ruling family will rise up to restore Impiltur to the great empire it once was.</p><p><em><strong>Lyrabar. </strong></em>The capital city of Impiltur, Lyrabar, boasts numerous sailing academies. The academies are fierce rivals and host regattas and other contests of skill year-round. One of the academies, Waywater’s Nautical University, specializes in teaching abjuration magic to seafaring mages. Lyrabar hosts the headquarters of the Warswords, chainmail-clad soldiers responsible for patrolling Impiltur’s trade roads and keeping merchants safe from brigands and monsters. Warswords sometimes deputize adventurers as “swordpoints”—temporary agents of t he law granted special privileges within Impiltur’s borders.</p><h4>Narfell</h4><p>The ruins of two ancient empires—Narfell, home to demon worshipers, and Raumathar, known for its battle mages—dot the plains where nomadic horse riders now roam, offering abundant opportunities for brave deeds and exploration. The Nars don’t care about dynasties or family lines. Rather, they believe actions speak for themselves. This sensible attitude also explains most riders’ preference to avoid the demon-cursed ruins of ancient Narfell. However, some now dwelling on the plains wish to reclaim ancient Narfell’s powerful, sinister magic for a new generation of Nar demonologists.</p><p><em><strong>Bildoobaris. </strong></em>In a vast, empty plain beneath the shadow of Mount Nar, tens of thousands of nomads gather for one tenday every summer for an annual trade meet, forming a vast tent city called Bildoobaris. Here, Nars barter in horses, furs, and jewelry; share news and oral histories; and celebrate the realm’s all-too-brief time of plenty. In recent years, Nar demonologists have come to Bildoobaris bearing demonic relics and weapons from the buried cities of ancient Narfell in the hope of recruiting more followers.</p><h4>Thesk</h4><p>Thesk is known to many as the Gateway to the East because it is the western terminus of the Golden Way, an ancient trade road that connected Faerûn to lands beyond the Sunrise Mountains. Although much of the Golden Way now lies in ruins, remnants of the old road still appear in the well-traveled hills between Thesk’s largest cities—Telflamm, Phsant, and Tammar. Thesk’s glory days as a trade metropolis are over, and Theskian wealth is now concentrated in the uppermost echelons of society, whose oligarchs exploit the working class via all manner of harebrained investment schemes.</p><p><em><strong>Golden Way. </strong></em>Despite its history as the most famous trade route between Faerûn and lands to the east, the Golden Way is now a shadow of its former self. In Faerûn, the Golden Way begins at the western edge of Thesk, where well-maintained roads connect the cities of Telflamm, Phent, Phsant, and Tammar. Beyond Thesk’s borders, the Golden Way becomes a path through the plains of Ashanath, connects to Rashemen via various ferries, and dissolves into little more than piles of stones—way markers—as it wraps around the Sunrise Mountains and continues eastward through the Hordelands and beyond. Interspersed here and there along the road are encampments and travel stations that provide shelter for those daring to make the months-long intercontinental journey.</p><p><em><strong>Telflamm. </strong></em>The largest city in Thesk isn’t controlled by that realm, but by the Shadowmasters, a religious thieves’ guild that owns the city’s inns and gambling halls and exercises considerable influence over Thesk’s government. The Shadowmasters operate out of the House of the Master’s Shadow, the largest temple to Mask in Faerûn.</p><h4>The Vast</h4><p>The Vast isn’t a unified realm, but a common term for the great swath of land bound by the Dragon Reach to the west, the Moonsea to the north, Impiltur to the east, and the Sea of Fallen Stars to the south. The region’s name comes from Vastar, the orc kingdom that once ruled this place and warred with the surrounding dwarven and elven communities. The Vast of today is primarily peaceful farmland ringed by prosperous coastal cities. Countless treasures lie buried just beneath the land’s surface, either in dwarven ruins, orc crypts, or forgotten battlegrounds.</p><p>As in other lands that touch the Earthspur Mountains, the gem trade is strong in the Vast, and many miners and adventurers alike come to the foothills seeking their fortune. The wisest are wary, for many of the tunnels that ribbon the Earthspurs connect to the Underdark, whose communities are far less welcoming of outsiders.</p><p><em><strong>Procampur. </strong></em>One of the oldest extant settlements along the Sea of Fallen Stars, Procampur was built atop an underground dwarven town called Proeskampalar. Procampur is known for its walled city districts, with slate-roofed buildings. More than its handsome architecture, though, Procampur is reputedly the single richest independent city along the northern Inner Sea. Hundreds of gem cutters and goldsmiths call the place home, and it would be a popular target for pirates if not for its incomparable fortifications and vigilant local government.</p><h4>Life in the Forgotten Lands</h4><p>Savage winters, perilous wilds, and fierce rivals mean that only the hardy survive long in the Forgotten Lands. Those who can meet the challenges of these realms are formidable indeed, contributing to this region’s reputation as a land of grim settlers and cutthroat traders.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.IZvGx7Aycf1oWrPZ caption=false]</p><p><em><strong>Adventurers’ Hub. </strong></em>The Forgotten Lands are a popular destination for adventurers from all over Faerûn. These realms are rich with history and magic that can turn a peasant into a monarch. Not all who journey to this region yearn for fame, however; many come to remote realms like Damara to forget their old lives and forge new destinies. And the Forgotten Lands are filled with material wealth; those who seek fortune here can dredge it up from the seafloor, carve it out of a mountain, or retrieve it from a dungeon.</p><p><em><strong>Bloodstone Economy. </strong></em>Realms in this corner of Faerûn benefit from abundant resources in nearby mountain ranges. The East Galenas, Earthspurs, and Earthfasts are rich in rare metals and gemstones, especially chalcedony, known locally as bloodstone. This gem is so plentiful—and so vital to the local economy—that these areas are sometimes referred to as the Bloodstone Lands.</p><p><em><strong>Brutal Climes.</strong></em> Life is hard in most of the Forgotten Lands. Long, icy winters and fleeting, muddy summers make for difficult farming. Many find other ways to subsist—such as trapping, mining, or fishing—but these trades are only slightly less trying in the region’s frigid climate. Fussy nobles and soft urbanites don’t last long in these parts; the average denizen of the Forgotten Lands is one of the toughest, most down-to-earth people one will ever meet.</p><p><em><strong>Living with the Elements. </strong></em>Regional natives must cope with the inhospitable climate. The nomads of Narfell, for example, migrate south during the dark months, avoiding the brunt of winter’s chill. Elsewhere, such as the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in Damara, people overcome the elements by mastering magic and enlisting the aid of local fauna. (See “Glacier of the White Worm” above.)</p><p><em><strong>Trade Prevails. </strong></em>For all their talk of autonomy and self-determination, the people of the Forgotten Lands also understand the importance of sharing goods and information. Trade in these realms begins in the mountains of Damara and plains of Narfell, from where it flows toward the Sea of Fallen Stars as a rushing river that empties into the rich ports of Impiltur and Thesk. Gold is everywhere in the Forgotten Lands, but unlike in other wealthy regions like Calimshan and the Sword Coast, folk here hold onto their wealth instead of flaunting it in the form of lavish palaces or gilded statues.</p>"

Its folk have hardy frontier spirits, for their lands are ripe with crops, resources, and danger. Monsters lurk in every forest and mountain range. No matter the threat, the people of the Heartlands must be ready to defend their homes.</p><p>The Heartlands is rife with classic medieval fantasy adventure. The Dalelands lend themselves to small-scale storytelling with personal stakes, such as defending a village from vicious monsters. Cormyr and Sembia are well suited for tales of knightly warfare or noble intrigue. Adventures around the Moonsea might involve ending the reign of a cruel tyrant. For a classic D&amp;D experience, adventurers can brave the megadungeon ruins of Myth Drannor. See chapter 2 of <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em> for more on the Dalelands and Myth Drannor.</p><p>The political landscape of the Heartlands is ever changing. Towns are absorbed into larger realms but might break out again when those realms are stretched too thin.</p><h4>Cormyr</h4><p>Cormyr has a legacy of chivalry and military might. Cormyr’s army, the Purple Dragon Knights, is the largest of any kingdom in Faerûn. Led by the just Queen Raedra Obarskyr, the Purple Dragon Knights and their allied war wizards train to fight both on land and in the sky. As monstrous threats from the Storm Horns and the Hullack Forest increase, and as Sembia grows ever larger, Queen Raedra has paused Cormyr’s expansion efforts to focus on defending and strengthening its borders. She also sends her Purple Dragon Knights across Faerûn on their amethyst dragon steeds to do good deeds, collect information, further her goals, and popularize Cormyr in the hearts and minds of common folk.</p><p><em><strong>Farsea Marshes and Marshes of Tun.</strong></em> The ruins of two prehistoric civilizations, preceding even the elves’ arrival in the Heartlands, lie in the pestilent marshes of Farsea and Tun in Cormyr’s north. Explorers who have braved the marshes’ monsters and magical sicknesses theorize that these societies released magical contagions on each other, resulting in their mutual destruction.</p><p><em><strong>Huthduth. </strong></em>A monastery devoted to Chauntea, Huthduth lies in a wooded valley just south of the Farsea Marshes and is well protected with walls and militant priests. It is named after its founder, whose benevolent spirit still haunts the monastery and periodically manifests. Priests raise sheep and make wine from local berries, but the well-defended nature of the place has led many to believe Huthduth houses a secret inhabitant, a valuable treasure, or magic unknown to the rest of the world.</p><p><em><strong>Shargrailar’s Lair. </strong></em>The ancient red dragon Shargrailar was the first dracolich Sammaster, the lich leader of the Cult of the Dragon, created using the <em>Tome of the Dragon</em>. The dracolich was destroyed more than a century ago with spellfire, but his lair, dug out of the Thunder Peaks near the headwaters of the Immerflow, remains a place of pilgrimage for the Cult of the Dragon and a nursery for red dragon wyrmlings.</p><p><em><strong>Sunset Mountains.</strong></em> The towering Sunset Mountains are home to the Darkhold, a powerful Zhentarim stronghold. Dragons dying of natural causes often come to the Sunset Mountains to spend their last hours at an extinct volcanic caldera called the Well of Dragons. The Cult of the Dragon’s base beneath the Well has been vanquished, but cult leaders have been spotted probing the ruins.</p><p><em><strong>Suzail.</strong></em> Suzail is the capital of Cormyr. Its monarch, the skilled sword fighter Queen Raedra Obarskyr, rules from the Dragon Throne. Her royal authority is kept in check by the Suzail Writ, a fifty-year-old piece of legislation that holds Cormyr’s monarch to the same laws as the rest of its citizens.</p><p><em><strong>Thunder Peaks.</strong></em> The storm-battered Thunder Peaks were once home to Shargrailar, Faerûn’s first dracolich. These days, a dracolich called Aurgloroasa, formerly a shadow dragon, lairs in an abandoned dwarven city within the mountain range. Also known as the Sibilant Shade, she commands the Cult of the Dragon’s Sembian sect.</p><p><em><strong>Tilverton.</strong></em> A rift to the Shadowfell wrought havoc on the Cormyrian town of Tilverton between the Desertsmouth Mountains and the Thunder Peaks. Now, all that remains is a vast crater of writhing darkness, from which monsters of shadow stuff periodically emerge.</p><h4>Dalelands</h4><p>The Dalelands is a loose collection of tiny vales called dales, each with its own territory, governance, and character. To the south, Archendale is well fortified, protecting tranquil Battledale, elven Deepingdale, and the rest of the dales from Sembian invasion, though Tasseldale still struggles from a history of Sembian influence. Distrustful Daggerdale, unassuming Shadowdale, and bountiful Mistledale sit to the west, where High Dale enjoys a defense treaty with Cormyr. Laissez-faire Featherdale, ambitious Scardale, and Harrowdale—the oldest dale—lie to the east. Every year at Midwinter, delegates from each dale convene for a Dales Council to discuss issues affecting the Dalelands at large. The location of the Dale Council changes from year to year.</p><p><em><strong>Dales Compact. </strong></em>When human settlers first arrived in the area now known as the Dalelands, the forest of Cormanthor was already occupied by a thriving elven civilization. These wary elves proposed the Dales Compact: an agreement that allowed humans to settle on the edges of Cormanthor or in places that the great trees didn’t grow, so long as they didn’t cut deeper into the forest. Human mages erected a stone obelisk called the Standing Stone in Cormanthor as a symbol of unity between the two species. This date became the beginning of the Dalereckoning, or 1 DR, marking the first year of the modern Faerûnian calendar. Though Cormanthor’s elven civilization fell long ago and few elves still live there, the people of the Dalelands still respect the Dales Compact.</p><p><em><strong>Archenbridge.</strong></em> A history of Sembian invasions has led the trading hub of Archenbridge (the chief settlement of Archendale) to become the most fortified town in the Dalelands. Most goods from Cormyr and Sembia flow through this walled, trap-filled town to the rest of the dales.</p><p><em><strong>Cormanthor.</strong></em> Cormanthor is a forest of towering trees. Most of the elves who once lived here left long ago, but some refugees of Myth Drannor’s second fall remain. A swath of fungi, oozes, and rot called Moander’s Road was carved through Cormanthor’s northern reaches by the rampaging god of corruption and rot, Moander.</p><p><em><strong>Myth Drannor.</strong></em> The elven metropolis of Myth Drannor fell hundreds of years ago to demonic forces. Elves briefly reclaimed it in the last century, but then the flying Shadovar city of Thultanthar crashed into it, doing extensive damage. Now demons and other monsters again infest Myth Drannor’s remains. Its many ruins invite adventurers to seek the lost city’s treasures or find a way to restore its mythal.</p><p><em><strong>Scardale Town.</strong></em> The infamously lawless harbor of Scardale Town is home to several criminal syndicates and an enclave of Red Wizards. Its people still reel from the memory of the Shaking Plague, a magical contagion that decimated its population. The town is governed by Lord Kharu Aumersair, a tiefling sorcerer who claims descent from Elminster, through the infamous Zhentarim agent Scyllua Darkhope and her father, Lashan Aumersair. Scardale has a history of being ruled by invaders, and Lord Aumersair has used this resentment of outsiders to unite the town’s criminal syndicates into an alliance that supports his rule.</p><p><em><strong>Shadowdale Town.</strong></em> Though small and unassuming at first glance, many consider sleepy Shadowdale Town the Dalelands’ cultural heart. It was once home to Elminster and Storm Silverhand, though neither has been seen in town for years. These days, a growing community of orcs from the River Ashaba have settled in Shadowdale. Lady Khara Sulwood rules from the twisted Tower of Ashaba, with the help of the elf warrior Tharinel, her reliable bodyguard and adviser.</p><h4>Moonsea</h4><p>Named after its central body of water, the Moonsea is a region of disparate cities ruled by cruel despots. It is a land of people hardened long ago by the assaults and schemes of chromatic dragons. The people of the Moonsea view the rest of Faerûn and even other Moonsea cities with distrust. In turn, people elsewhere in Faerûn view these folk as unfriendly and dangerous.</p><p><em><strong>Hillsfar.</strong></em> The independent walled city of Hillsfar, on the southern shore of the Moonsea, is busy, prosperous, and secured by a mercenary company called the Red Plumes. Until recently, Hillsfar’s Great Law of Humanity barred non-humans from entering the city. After a revolution deposed First Lord Torin Nomerthal, his successor, Vuhm Yestral, revoked the law. Hillsfar still suffers from strained relations between humans and other species, and progress is slower than Vuhm would like. In the wake of Zhentil Keep’s decline, Hillsfar’s only rival for dominance of the Moonsea is the city of Mulmaster.</p><p><em><strong>Melvaunt.</strong></em> A cloud of smog hangs over the austere and unwelcoming Moonsea city of Melvaunt courtesy of its hundreds of forges. This polluted merchant town is a smith’s haven and a den of crime.</p><p><em><strong>The Moonsea.</strong></em> Rumors persist of isles that rise from the cold, purplish depths of the eponymous Moonsea on certain nights of the year. An underwater tower called the Bell of the Depths is said to be guarded by the ghosts of the first humans who settled the Moonsea region. Its spire is visible from the water’s surface, and it tolls on foggy nights with the sound of a ghostly bell heard as far as Hillsfar.</p><p><em><strong>Mulmaster.</strong></em> Sixteen wealthy nobles called the Council of Blades rule the unabashedly imperialist Moonsea city of Mulmaster. At their disposal are the Hawks, a clandestine group of spies and assassins; the Cloaks, Mulmaster’s official mage guild; and the Soldiery, the city’s armed forces. The Church of Bane is Mulmaster’s dominant faith.</p><p><em><strong>Point Iron. </strong></em>The dwarven iron mine known as Point Iron was taken over by duergar more than a century ago. In their mining, the duergar found gold, which they craft into fabulous jewelry that fetches exorbitant prices throughout the Moonsea and Sembia. This trade has also given the psychic duergar access to powerful individuals they can bring under their mental control.</p><p><em><strong>Quivering Forest.</strong></em> For a time, travelers who entered the Quivering Forest emerged in Barovia, a Domain of Dread within the Shadowfell (described in <em>Curse of Strahd</em> and <em>Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</em>). The mists of Barovia have since cleared, but terrifying werewolves, vampires, and other creatures from that realm still haunt these woods. Barovia’s influence has even granted new powers to Jeny Greenteeth, a legendary hag of the forest.</p><p><em><strong>Thar.</strong></em> Valiant orcs fight to defend their territory from ogres, manticores, and perytons in the rocky moorland known as the Thar. Eons ago, this land was a unified orc kingdom. Legend has it that Vorbyx’s Hammer, a great weapon carried by the first king of Thar, lies hidden somewhere here. Thar’s orcs believe that the next orc to wield it will restore the kingdom to its former glory.</p><p><em><strong>Zhentil Keep.</strong></em> Once the seat of Zhentarim power across Faerûn, Zhentil Keep was razed over a hundred years ago by Shadovar forces. Eventually the Zhents returned and rebuilt it. Zhentil Keep is again a flourishing trade city, but Zhentarim leaders have been slow to return there. Zhentarim soldiers are sent to Zhentil Keep for training, and the governing council is conspiring to regain influence in the Moonsea from rivals Hillsfar and Mulmaster.</p><h4>Sembia</h4><p>The young realm of Sembia aggressively pursues both trade and territorial expansion. Merchant councils govern many of its cities, from gothic Saerloon to lavish Selgaunt. Sembians relish the art of negotiation, and coins create friendships fast here. But the lack of coins makes those friends disappear just as quickly. Outside Sembia’s cities, orchards, vineyards, and farms sprawl throughout the realm’s countryside.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.tsTCqwFsLXYjWmYV]</p><p><em><strong>Ordulin.</strong></em> Half a century ago, a dale called Moondale enjoyed a prosperous trade relationship with neighboring Sembian cities before being peacefully annexed into Sembia. It was renamed Ordulin and now serves as Sembia’s capital. Every seven years, the merchant councils of Sembia’s other cities convene and appoint an Overmaster from their ranks to govern Sembia from Ordulin. They have gone to great lengths to foster Sembian pride in the city and erase its cultural roots as a former dale.</p><h4>Life in the Heartlands</h4><p>Some of Faerûn’s greatest threats and most inspiring alliances have sprung up in the Heartlands. These histories influence the region to this day.</p><p><em><strong>Dragons. </strong></em>Dragons were the first occupants of the Heartlands, before even the elves of Cormanthor, and dozens of active dragon lairs litter the wilds, as do countless remnants of long-abandoned lairs. The Moonsea region sees much dragon activity; its sea was even once called the Sea of Dragons. Cormyr has seen a recent uptick in dragon attacks from the Storm Horns, and the Cult of the Dragon is steadily gaining influence in Sembia.</p><p><em><strong>Expansionism. </strong></em>While cities of the Sword Coast and the North enjoy relative harmony among each other, the same can’t be said for the realms of the Heartlands. Sembia and Cormyr have expanded relentlessly over the centuries and taken turns encroaching on each other’s territories. The Moonsea’s leaders ruthlessly control their individual cities and plot to overthrow each other to grab more power. The Dalelands sits in the middle of it all, trying to avoid the attention of realms and factions that would eagerly invade the dales if it wasn’t so difficult to march an army through the forest of Cormanthor.</p><p><em><strong>Pools of Radiance.</strong></em> Pools of radiance are open wounds in the Weave—powerful, naturally occurring fonts of raw magic. The water of these pools shimmers and shines with an unearthly glow. Nearly all of Faerûn’s pools of radiance are in the Heartlands region. Several evil entities throughout Faerûn’s history have found ways to channel the immense power of the pools—especially the pool of radiance beneath the Moonsea town of Phlan—to enact devastating rituals. A pool of radiance can be destroyed only with an artifact called the <em>Gauntlets of Moander</em>, but its whereabouts are unknown.</p>"

Though Amn, Calimshan, and Tethyr might not have raised swords against each other in the last few hundred years, they’ve spied on each other, made aggressive trade deals, and exchanged land with each other in delicate dances of thinly veiled mistrust.</p><p>Each realm grapples with its own internal web of intrigue. Merchant houses ally with and pit themselves against each other in dizzying configurations to assert their influence over Amn. Questions of bloodline and right to rule swirl around the queen of Tethyr. The four genie factions of Calimshan bristle at the increasing self-reliance of the realm’s folk—especially Sultana Songal, Calimshan’s ruler.</p><p>Adventures in these lands often play out against a backdrop of political machination. Characters might hobnob with influential nobles at galas, strike backdoor bargains in seedy undercities, or spy on one noble genie while working for another. Perhaps they’ll infiltrate the Shadow Thieves, a network whose meddling is felt throughout the Lands of Intrigue.</p><p>Each of the three realms in the Lands of Intrigue has at least one active port city and trade routes to go along with it. News travels as swiftly as goods, but deserts, forests, and mountain ranges make it difficult for armies to cross from one realm to another.</p><h4>Amn</h4><p>No realm in Faerûn is wealthier than Amn. Unlike their neighbors—which pursue wealth for the comfort it brings—Amnians seek and spend wealth as a symbol of status. Amn’s governing body is the anonymous Council of Five, said to consist of the heads of Amn’s most influential merchant families. Open worship of Cyric is legal here, thanks to deep ties between the Church of Cyric and the council, and Amn has long had imperial ambitions. Spellcasting, on the other hand, is forbidden. The law permits only priests of Cyric and the Cowled Wizards— specialized mages in service to Amn’s merchant houses—to use magic.</p><p><em><strong>Athkatla.</strong></em> Athkatla, the City of Coin, is the capital city of Amn and a place of vast riches. Things illegal, immoral, and despicable pass without comment in this busy port city so long as the price is right. The Council of Five rules from a fortress here called the Council House.</p><p><em><strong>Cloud Peaks.</strong></em> The Cloud Peaks teem with iron, precious metal, and gems—but also with remorhazes and white dragons. Frost giants sometimes scale the mountains’ crags for ceremonies or games.</p><p><em><strong>Esmeltaran.</strong></em> Amnian nobles and wealthy tourists flock to the beautiful city of Esmeltaran during the winter months to bask in the warmth of Lake Esmel’s hot springs. A young copper dragon has begun pulling pranks on the lake’s visitors, who mistake the dragon for a legendary monster of the lake named Esmelda.</p><p><em><strong>Myth Lharast. </strong></em>The city of Myth Lharast was sacred to Selûne for three centuries, home to benevolent lycanthropes as well as elves and other folk. Protected by a powerful mythal, it nevertheless fell to internal dissent many centuries ago. As evil wizards and their undead and elemental minions conquered the city, Selûne removed Myth Lharast from the world, placing it in a demiplane. Now the city can be accessed only when the moon is full.</p><p><em><strong>Orgoth’s Tower.</strong></em> Hubris claimed Orgoth the Tainted, a prodigious wizard who summoned three unruly fiends and died at their hands. Rumor has it that his spellbook, the <em>Alcaith</em>, still lies in Orgoth’s Tower. Elves of the Shilmista Forest warn against searching for it, since the three fiends are rumored to still haunt the tower’s halls.</p><p><em><strong>Small Teeth.</strong></em> To the south, temples of Cyric called the Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse sit high on each side of the Small Teeth mountains’ central pass. The ancient blue dragon<strong> </strong>Iryklathagra, also called “Sharpfangs,” sleeps deep within the Small Teeth, awakening once a century. Killing the dragon is a fool’s errand; instead, adventurers try to loot the many hoards scattered throughout her sprawling lair.</p><p><em><strong>Snakewood.</strong></em> Priests of Eldath inhabit Duskwood Dell in the serpent-infested Snakewood. Two years ago, a conniving beholder named Sersentrych slew the green dragon Ringreemeralxoth and moved into his lair. Sersentrych has since indoctrinated the dragon’s hatchlings into loyal servitude.</p><p><em><strong>Troll Mountains.</strong></em> Trolls aren’t the only dangers in the Troll Mountains. Balagos “the Flying Flame,” an ancient red dragon feared throughout the Lands of Intrigue, lairs in the extinct Smokespire volcano. The Gulf of Storms, a lightning-wracked canyon and pilgrimage site for worshipers of Talos, lies nearby. Wind whistles through the hollow eyes, ears, and mouth of the Wailing Dwarf, a mile-high mountainside carved to depict an enormous dwarf. An abandoned, ooze-infested dwarven city lies beneath this monument and is the setting for <em>Lancameth’s Last Expedition</em>, a famous ballad detailing the death of Bryam Lancameth and his four companions, armed with potent magic items that have never been recovered.</p><h4>Calimshan</h4><p>Tradition and innovation coexist in Calimshan under the reign of Sultana Songal. Calimshan’s people have a fraught and complex relationship with the realm’s four genie factions. The genies have both subjugated and fought alongside the people of Calimshan at various points in the realm’s ten-thousand-year history. While Calishites of the desert and other wilderness areas rely on genie magic for survival, inhabitants of Calimport have instead embraced and improved on innovations from Lantan, resulting in a new wave of <em>Mechanical Wonders</em> that have transformed city life.</p><p>Calimshan has the largest population of genasi (described in <em>Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</em>) of any realm in Faerûn; some of these genasi live among the realm’s people, while others reside with the four genie factions. See chapter 4 of <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em> for more on Calimshan.</p><p><em><strong>Alimir Mountains.</strong></em> Calimshan fought back against beholders from the Alimir Mountains thousands of years ago in a series of conflicts called the Eye Tyrant Wars. Nearly fifty beholders live together in a massive hive in those mountains today, biding their time while rebuilding their numbers.</p><p><em><strong>Calim Desert.</strong></em> Eons ago, when the immortal genies Calim and Memnon were imprisoned in the <em>Calimemnon Crystal</em>, the magical backlash transformed the surrounding environs into the inhospitable Calim Desert. Wild magic and sandstorms wreak havoc here.</p><p><em><strong>Calimport.</strong></em> Calimshan’s capital city Calimport is among the oldest cities in Faerûn. This famous trade hub teems with wonders magical and mechanical. Genies must swear a magically binding pact with Sultana Songal, called the Sultana’s Oath, to enter the city. Cults, criminals, and illicit markets lurk in the Muzad, Calimport’s undercity.</p><p><em><strong>Forest of Mir.</strong></em> The Forest of Mir hides Myth Dyraalis, a thriving city with deep ties to both the Feywild and the plane of Arborea. A powerful mythal allows only those with fey ancestry to see this so-called Phantom City. Nearby lies Dallnothax: a mostly subterranean settlement devoted to Vhaeraun, a drow god of thievery.</p><p><em><strong>Genie Strongholds.</strong></em> The four genie factions of Calimshan lair in fantastic strongholds scattered around the realm. The dao fortress of Olympus Dag stands in the Marching Mountains; the marid city of Maran Saya lies deep beneath the waves of the Shining Sea; the flying djinni city of Burin Bir and its trailing palaces drift above the Forest of Mir; and the efreeti fortress of Gozva Ka stands in the Calim Desert, hidden with shimmering illusions. These palaces are ruled by noble genies and are also home to a variety of aides and servitors who are adapted to the genies’ preferred environments.</p><p><em><strong>Marching Mountains.</strong></em> The Marching Mountains house the remains of the First Necropolis of Nykkar: an ancient site where early Calishites prepared their revered dead for burial.</p><p><em><strong>Nykkar, Isle of Memory. </strong></em>In more modern times, Calishites have established many mausoleums and cemeteries in a necropolis on the so-called Isle of Memory, named Nykkar after the ancient necropolis in the mountains. Nykkar is maintained by priests of Kelemvor and serviced by ships known as the Death Fleet. A crew of engineers maintain a lighthouse on the island’s northern tip.</p><p><em><strong>Spider Swamp.</strong></em> Zanassu the Spider Demon was vanquished from Calimshan’s Spider Swamp on the southern coast long ago, but quasits and other demons still infest this fetid area. The swamp is also home to reclusive spider-people known as araneas; so far, araneas have remained hidden, using magic to conceal their identity when they enter towns to trade. (Araneas are detailed in <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em>.)</p><h4>Tethyr</h4><p>Though not as much of a mercantile superpower as its neighbors, Tethyr enjoys a strong relationship with the elves of the Wealdath, who shun Amn and trade rare goods exclusively with Tethyr. Tethyr is a feudal realm of lords and vassals, and its royal line appeals to the divine patronage of Siamorphe, a demigod of nobility, to assert its right to rule. When Queen Anais Rhindaun died of old age, her half-niece and adopted daughter, Ysabel Linden, assumed the throne. Ysabel has guided Tethyr with a courageous heart and steady hand for three years, but she hasn’t received the blessing of Siamorphe. Some of Tethyr’s nobles whisper that Ysabel is too far removed from the Rhindaun bloodline—and Siamorphe’s favor—to rule.</p><p><em><strong>Castle Tethyr.</strong></em> Castle Tethyr was the historical home of Tethyr’s royalty before it burned down some 150 years ago. Now, an elder beholder named Xithallowthlan schemes within the dungeons below the castle. Hundreds of eyes cover Xithallowthlan’s body—a blessing from the Great Mother, a patron deity of beholders.</p><p><em><strong>Darromar.</strong></em> Queen Ysabel Linden rules the realm of Tethyr from Faerntarn Palace in the capital city of Darromar. An aasimar named Saerwyn the Bright has recently arrived in Darromar to challenge Ysabel’s right to the throne, claiming to be a child of the demigod Siamorphe. Whether Saerwyn is truthful or a pretender remains to be seen.</p><p><em><strong>Forest of Tethyr.</strong></em> Many call the Forest of Tethyr “Wealdath,” an Elvish phrase meaning “unspoiled woods.” This vast forest is home to monsters, fey, the peaceful gold dragon Garlokantha, and two wood elf tribes: the Suldusk and Elmanesse. The Suldusk have their own treetop city, Suldanessellar. The Elmanesse seek to restore the mythal around the will-o-wisp-infested elven tomb city of Myth Rhynn.</p><p><em><strong>Omlarandin Mountains.</strong></em> Omlar gems can be found only in the Omlarandin Mountains. These rare turquoise gems hold magic like a sponge, making them exceptional components for crafting magic items. The demand for omlars among Calimshan’s genie lords has run most of the mountain’s existing mines dry, prompting miners and adventurers to delve ever deeper into the mountain range.</p><p><em><strong>Purple Hills.</strong></em> No one in the Lands of Intrigue makes finer wine than the halflings of the Purple Hills, on Tethyr’s southwest coast. These halflings also recently reopened Canaith, a legendary bard academy. Bards travel from far and wide to study their craft there.</p><p><em><strong>Starspire Mountains.</strong></em> Balagos, a red dragon of the Troll Mountains, keeps some of his hoard at a secondary lair called Mount Thargill in the Starspire Mountains. Five years ago, Balagos captured a young bronze dragon named Ixolothingeir, tore off his wings, and commanded him to guard this lair or die.</p><p><em><strong>Velen.</strong></em> Velen is haunted, but its citizens don’t mind. Many of the city’s dead remain there as ghosts for unknown reasons, coexisting with the living. The autonomous Duchy of Velen gained its independence from Tethyr in 1424 DR. It maintains a friendly relationship with its western neighbor, using its impressive naval fleet to defend itself and Tethyr from Nelanther pirates.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.FXpSwNwAJD4w8C6y]</p><h4>Life in the Lands of Intrigue</h4><p>Folk in the Lands of Intrigue are more interested in politics than the mysteries of the lands themselves.</p><p><em><strong>Nelanther Pirates.</strong></em> Hordes of lizardfolk, ogre, and minotaur pirates surge forth from the Nelanther Isles (detailed further in the “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.h0kXnfziUK0UMaVb]{Trackless Sea}” section of this chapter) to raid shipping from the Lands of Intrigue. Merchants from all three realms commission adventurers to sail forth into those islands and recover stolen goods.</p><p><em><strong>Night Bandits of Erlkazar.</strong></em> The Lands of Intrigue’s eastern reaches suffer raids from the neighboring realm of Erlkazar. Armies of vampiric bandits slip into merchant camps and leap over city walls in the dead of night. Those who journey to Erlkazar find no trace of these bandits or the pilfered goods. The vampiric nature of the Night Bandits remains a secret outside Erlkazar, for the locals are too frightened of their vampire masters to betray them to outsiders.</p><p><em><strong>Rise and Fall of Muranndin.</strong></em> In the late fourteenth century, an oni couple conquered the city of Murann in southwest Amn and founded Muranndin, a short-lived empire of marauding orcs and ogres who sought living sacrifices for their gods Gruumsh and Vaprak. Amn and Tethyr’s forces slew the founders and reclaimed nearly all of the land by the late fifteenth century DR. However, the couple’s son—a brooding oni named Avasskyth—still rules over the villainous city of Murann. The city is surrounded by a formidable wall made of thick, sharpened tree trunks.</p><p><em><strong>Shadow Thieves of Amn.</strong></em> The ruthless Shadow Thieves began as an ordinary thieves’ guild in Waterdeep. When the Lords of Waterdeep assassinated many of the Shadow Thieves’ founding members and drove the rest out, the organization reestablished itself in Amn. It thrived in Athkatla, where they became a household name and forged covert connections with Amn’s ruling Council of Five. Now, the Shadow Thieves pulls strings everywhere in the Lands of Intrigue and plot vengeance on the Lords of Waterdeep. See chapter 6 for more information on the Shadow Thieves.</p><p><em><strong>Shanatar.</strong></em> Before the Lands of Intrigue existed, there was Shanatar. This ancient shield dwarf kingdom sprawled across the region’s Underdark and contained eight subkingdoms, each dedicated to one of Moradin’s divine children. Duergar and other Underdark invaders brought ruin to Shanatar long ago. The only kingdom still standing is Iltkazar, situated beneath the Omlarandin Mountains. The god Clangeddin Silverbeard watches over Iltkazar, and a wise ancient silver dragon called King Mith Barak rules over the kingdom. Mith Barak seeks the return of the <em>Wyrmskull Throne</em>, a powerful Shanatar artifact that went missing eons ago.</p>"

Frost giants, white dragons, and marauders threaten the land, and winter is always near, ready to destroy whatever remains. The region was ravaged by the War of the Silver Marches—a sweeping conflict between Many-Arrows, Menzoberranzan, and the cities of the Lords’ Alliance—and again more recently by violence between giants. And yet, the North abounds with fertile river valleys, mineral deposits, deep forests, and startling natural beauty. It is a wilderness of violent extremes, hidden wonders, and isolated strongholds struggling to survive against all odds.</p><p>The land is vast, cold, and lawless, and civilization survives only through fear, toil, and blood. Independent strongholds act as city-states in loose alliances. Outside fortress walls, farmers, prospectors, and settlers eke out hardscrabble lives, while roving nomads do what they must to survive while honoring their traditions. Ancient dwarfholds and forest ruins echo with memories of vanished realms. People in the North worship fierce gods and fear the freezing dark.</p><p>Adventures here focus on survival above all, both individual and communal. Here, adventurers must fight off invaders and face natural disasters as they carve out a foothold in an inhospitable land. They broker tenuous peace between hostile fortresses, uncover frozen secrets, battle dragons and giants, and defy fate to build something that can survive the cold.</p><p>The North is criss-crossed by fragile alliances between independent cities and strongholds in loose confederations for mutual aid, defense, and trade. These independent city-states look to their own interests first, defending and developing their own resources. They cooperate with allies not from fealty or honor, but from shared self-interest and to increase their own chances of survival.</p><h4>Icewind Dale</h4><p>At the far northern end of the Sword Coast, beyond the Spine of the World, lies Icewind Dale. Bounded by the Reghed Glacier to the east and the gnashing maw of the Sea of Moving Ice to the north and west, Icewind Dale is a wind-scoured waste marked by the solitary peak of Kelvin’s Cairn. The rough-hewn Ten-Towns band together to harvest hidden abundance: gems, timber, and the valuable bones of knucklehead trout. Would-be heroes and villains alike come to Icewind Dale seeking frost giant artifacts, Underdark wonders, and Netherese secrets, but most run afoul of fierce monsters, locals, and priests of Auril—to say nothing of chardalyn, a blighted material capable of twisting minds and spirits in pursuit of power. See <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em> for more on Icewind Dale.</p><p><em><strong>Bryn Shander.</strong></em> Foremost among the Ten-Towns—Icewind Dale’s cluster of small settlements—Bryn Shander is the local center of trade and government. It serves as a walled refuge for those fleeing nearby towns in times of crisis.</p><h4>Kingdom of Many-Arrows</h4><p>Self-crowned King Orrusk Homebringer is working to restore an orc domain in the far north, beginning with the shattered fortress of Dark Arrow Keep. The Kingdom of Many-Arrows united the disparate orc tribes of the Spine of the World for over a hundred years until it was razed in the War of the Silver Marches. Orrusk would see it come into being again, and more orcs arrive every day, drawn by his vision of a new, independent orc realm.</p><h4>Lords’ Alliance</h4><p>The Lords’ Alliance isn’t a realm, but rather a tenuous but powerful coalition between contentious settlements of the North and elsewhere, established to promote peace, prosperity, and security among its members. It includes Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Mithral Hall, and others, including powerful Waterdeep to the south (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.LNXJszscTv3MeV0z]{Sword Coast}” in this chapter). Each settlement in the alliance looks first to its own interests, then to the needs of its allies. The Alliance hires adventurers to investigate and eradicate threats to the region and isn’t above using violence and deception in pursuit of its goals. See chapter 6 for more information on the Lords’ Alliance.</p><p><em><strong>High Road.</strong></em> A vital lifeline linking settlements along the Sword Coast and one of the North’s foremost trade routes, the High Road begins in Luskan, runs south through Neverwinter, and then continues along the coast to Waterdeep (where it continues as the Trade Way). After decades of neglect and disrepair, the road is again safe to travel thanks to the efforts of Dagult Neverember and the High Road Charter Company.</p><p><em><strong>Mirabar.</strong></em> The richest city in the North sits on the Mirar River, enclosed by sloped outer walls. Above ground, a largely human population is ruled by their hereditary marchion, but Mirabar is deeply dwarven. Tunnels, forges, and foundries in the massive undercity lead to the great mines of the Sword Coast. Dwarven elders on the Council of Sparkling Stones rule underground, and the Axe of Mirabar, a well-armed company of dwarf soldiers, defends the city against threats, above or below.</p><p><em><strong>Neverwinter.</strong></em> The City of Skilled Hands was once known for its master crafters, fine goods, and lavish gardens heated year-round by the Neverwinter River, flowing from Mount Hotenow. When the volcano erupted and a great chasm to the Underdark opened, Neverwinter was nearly destroyed. Now, with the volcano’s wrath spent and the chasm sealed, the city is rebuilding itself under the rule of Lord Dagult Neverember.</p><p><em><strong>Silverymoon.</strong></em> Rightly called the Gem of the North, this quiet, cosmopolitan city is a powerful member of the Lords’ Alliance and a haven of learning, music, and culture. The Knights in Silver and magical defenses protect the city’s ivy-covered walls and towers, where gardens and trees cast dappled light on peaceful streets. For a time, Silverymoon was the capital of a tight-knit alliance across the Silver Marches—the region between the Glimmerwood and the High Forest. The War of the Silver Marches brought an end to that alliance and tarnished Silverymoon’s reputation, but it is still respected and beloved across the region.</p><h4>Luskan</h4><p>Luskan, the City of Sails, was once a grand port, but years of crime and ill fortune have reduced it to a dirty dive with filthy streets, ramshackle docks, and pirates thinly disguised as traders. Rising above its stinking fog like a clawed hand is the Hosttower of the Arcane, home of the Arcane Brotherhood (described in chapter 6). Five pirate lords called High Captains rule the city and are charged with the city’s defense and legitimate trade, as well as plundering the Northlander islands to the west.</p><h4>Menzoberranzan</h4><p>Menzoberranzan is a drow city carved from the pillars of a great cavern in the Underdark between Silverymoon and Mithral Hall. It is the center of Lolth’s worship in Faerûn. Also known as the City of Spiders, it’s known for its culture of deception, manipulation, and the capture and trade of enslaved surface dwellers. Although officially governed by a council of matrons from the eight greatest houses, the city is under the heel of House Baenre and the Matron Mother, who rules in Lolth’s name. On a high plateau stands the Academy, Tier Breche, where priestesses, mages, and noble warriors are trained. Over a hundred tunnels link the city to other parts of the Underdark, and drow traders sell poisons, strange mushrooms, beasts of burden, scrolls, wine, and secrets with merchants of the deep.</p><h4>Northern Dwarfholds</h4><p>Throughout the North, many dwarves dwell in independent fortresses called dwarfholds. Though many such dwarfholds are lost, abandoned, or infested by monsters, some still stand firm. Dwarves in Mithral Hall, Citadel Adbar, Citadel Felbarr, Gauntlgrym, Stoneshaft Hold, and Ironmaster trace their ancestry back to Delzoun, the ancient dwarf kingdom of the North. Mirabar and Sundabar are also dwarfholds, though Mirabar has welcomed human immigrants and Sundabar was razed by the Kingdom of Many-Arrows in the War of the Silver Marches. Before then, most dwarfholds had joined the Lords’ Alliance, but when Silverymoon failed to save Sundabar, the dwarfhold leaders declared their intention to rely only on one another.</p><p><em><strong>Citadel Adbar. </strong></em>Citadel Adbar is a fortress in the Ice Mountains built by the dwarves of ancient Delzoun that has defied invaders for eighteen centuries. The War of the Silver Marches reduced the city’s once-great Knights of the Mithral Shield to a handful of members, but its defending army—the Iron Guard—remains strong.</p><p><em><strong>Gauntlgrym.</strong></em> Once a bastion of Delzoun, Gauntlgrym lay abandoned under the mountains for centuries until King Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed it from Lolth’s followers with an army of shield dwarves. The heart of Gauntlgrym is its legendary forge, within which is trapped a fire elemental known as Maegera the Dawn Titan.</p><p><em><strong>Mithral Hall.</strong></em> The ancestral home of the Battlehammer clan is a nigh-impregnable vault beneath the Frost Hills. Despite its almost mythic reputation, Mithral Hall is more of a stronghold than a city, with tunnels to other dwarfholds deep below its mines. Queen Dagnabbet Waybeard rules Mithral Hall, firmly in support of the Lords’ Alliance.</p><p><em><strong>Sundabar.</strong></em> Like its sibling-city, Mirabar, Sundabar was both an underground dwarfhold and a thriving surface city until it was razed by Many-Arrows orcs in the War of the Silver Marches. Refugees from the surface city fled west to Silverymoon and other nearby settlements, while the dwarves of the lower holds withdrew from the Lords’ Alliance and banned outsiders from the city. While the walls and buildings of the city above crumble into ruins stalked by roving monsters, black smoke rises from tunnels and hidden chambers, where underground forges still operate.</p><h4>Savage Frontier</h4><p>The Savage Frontier is a vast swath of ungoverned land inhabited by dangerous monsters. Visitors can trudge for days through its peaks and snowfields without seeing so much as a trapper’s cabin.</p><p><em><strong>Evermoors. </strong></em>An unsettled region of fog-shrouded hills, cold bogs, rocky ridges, small peaks, and crumbling ruins, this vast waste is inhabited by hill giants, ettins, ogres, countless trolls, and warring bands of orcs. A mile above the Evermoors floats the cloud giant castle of Lyn Armaal, only fleetingly glimpsed through overcast skies.</p><p><em><strong>Glimmerwood.</strong></em> This wide forest combines the dense, lycanthrope-prowled Moonwood, the Druarwood (claimed by Uthgardt tribes), and the Cold Wood, which is covered by ice and snow even during the height of summer, except where blackened by traveling fire giants.</p><p><em><strong>High Forest.</strong></em> The greatest existing forest in Faerûn is vast and mysterious, a remnant from ages past, when elven realms like Illefarn and Eaerlann ruled a continent covered in green. The High Forest is as large as a realm, covering mountains and countless secrets. Here dwell treants of enormous size, stags with antlers wide as a wagon, gigantic bears, owlbears, wolves, centaurs, unicorns, and other creatures stranger still, some of which have no name remembered by mortals. The forest’s outermost fringes are inhabited by woodcutters and outlaws, but deeper in, wood elves and Uthgardt warriors of the Ghost Tree tribe guard the forest’s secrets.</p><p><em><strong>Icespire Peak.</strong></em> Icespire Peak is the tallest of the Sword Mountains, visible from far away as Phandalin. The mountain conceals mithral mines dug by dwarves long ago, and in winter its waterfalls freeze, forming amazing curtains of ice. But Icespire Peak is now home to goblins, frost giants, trolls, the white dragon Cryovain, and agents of the Cult of the Dragon, ensuring all but brave adventurers avoid its perilous slopes.</p><p><em><strong>Mere of Dead Men. </strong></em>Thousands of dwarf, elf, human, and orc corpses lie beneath this saltwater swamp, which was created many centuries ago through fell magic. The swamp is home to two ancient black dragons: Voaraghamanthar the Black Death and his twin brother Waervaerendor the Rapacious Raider. The two dragons share a psychic link and are indistinguishable, so they’re often mistaken for a single dragon. Efforts to drain the swamp or redirect the High Road away from its borders have been fruitless; the swamp merely expands to fill any abandoned space.</p><p><em><strong>Phandalin. </strong></em>The frontier settlement of Phandalin has a long history of association with mages and artificers working in the nearby complex of Wave Echo Cave, home to the legendary Forge of Spells. Fragments of Netherese civilization also dot this region, including pieces of psychic crystal. Mind flayers lairing in the Underdark beneath Phandalin collect these crystals and use them to mutate innocent victims in an elaborate scheme to create a new empire in Faerûn.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.TK2mo9I1Z3l1P48T]</p><h4>Life in the North</h4><p>To live in the North requires strength—strength of body to withstand the harsh elements, strength of will to withstand fear and isolation, and strength of heart to stand side by side with strangers.</p><p><em><strong>Giants and Dragons.</strong></em> In other parts of Faerûn, people tell stories about the conflicts between giants and dragons. In the North, these are lived realities. Many giants and dragons dwell here at the edge of the world, and their ancient enmity threatens those who dwell peacefully in the shadow of the mountains.</p><p><em><strong>Nomads.</strong></em> The Reghed nomads of Icewind Dale and the Uthgardt of the Savage Frontier survive through hardiness and mobility, proving that it’s possible to flourish even in the deadliest of lands. Some, however, depend on raiding and violence to survive.</p><p><em><strong>Spine of the World.</strong></em> This impossibly high mountain range spans the entire north, shaping and threatening the entire region. Towering black rock peaks are gripped by snow and ice, scoured by raging winds, and filled with yetis, white dragons, and frost giants, while tunnels, caves, and abandoned dwarfholds below are home to goblinoids, remorhazes, duergar, and drow. In the jaws of these mountains lie the crumbling ruins and secrets of too many half-forgotten realms and lost souls to count.</p><p><em><strong>Underdark Menace.</strong></em> Threats from deep below the earth’s surface are never far from the minds of folk in the North. Drow worshipers of Lolth dwell in great numbers in the Underdark, aberrations lurk in caverns deeper still, and buried secrets have a way of turning up in frightening ways. Worse still, in Icewind Dale, mysterious forces have begun to thaw the frozen deep, freeing horrors deep beneath subterranean ice that should never be released.</p><p><em><strong>Winter’s Reign.</strong></em> However dragons and giants might rage, there is no power greater than the winter in the far North. Life here is geared toward withstanding hardship. Traders throughout the region supply winter gear and spirits strong enough to warm bones and numb wounds. Builders create thick-walled shelters that stand against the strongest winds. Priests placate gods of cold, such as Auril, and pray to deities willing to grant one more breath, one more glimpse of the sun, to the faithful.</p>"

For over three thousand years the people of Mulhorand, Chessenta, and Unther have alternately flourished and floundered, rising to unparalleled heights and surviving unprecedented disasters. The result is three realms that share wide swaths of history and aspects of culture peculiar to outsiders: strict theocratic governments, enormous military-bureaucracy complexes, and unique advances in art, science, and magic.</p><p>Those who make the perilous voyage across the Sea of Fallen Stars and into Old Empires ports find desert coasts dusted with glittering purple sand; beachside bazaars overflowing with turquoise, lapis lazuli, and bronze metalcraft; and terraced temple gardens bursting with grapes, dates, and figs. Further inland, limestone monoliths loom over oceans of ripe grain next to unspeakably impoverished slum-cities; flooded riverside ruins and parched savanna fortresses teem with desert monsters; and battlegrounds lay haunted by restless dead—including previous incarnations of the gods themselves.</p><p>With their alien deities, inscrutable technology, and ancient grudges, the Old Empires are unlike any other region of the Forgotten Realms. To explorers and mercenaries from foreign soil, Mulhorand, Unther, and Chessenta are realms teeming with mysteries. For locals of these lands, opportunities abound to become heroes either by confronting the desert’s dangers or shedding light on corrupt powers. No matter who answers the call, the Old Empires promise priceless rewards for the brave, beneficial secrets for the cunning, and exciting adventures for all.</p><p>The story of the Old Empires begins with an empire called Imaskar, whose high artificers and overlords facilitated their kingdom’s ascension by subjugating tens of thousands of people from a distant world. The abused subjects beseeched their patron deities for freedom, and their prayers were answered. The Imaskar underclass liberated itself, and in place of overthrown Imaskar the people founded two new empires: Mulhorand and Unther.</p><p>Though they share similar origins, Mulhorand and Unther have harbored mutual animosity toward one another since their founding. Their constant territorial disputes eventually birthed the independent realm of Chessenta to the northwest.</p><h4>Chessenta</h4><p>Chessenta is an unusual empire, where a chaotic array of city-states are in perpetual conflict with one another. But where constant strife might weaken lesser realms, Chessenta’s endless saber rattling and infighting only tempers an already resilient people.</p><p>Chessentans revel in war the way other cultures delight in sports or feasting. In Chessenta, a youth’s first brush with death is a rite of passage, and a life without battle is no life at all. Chessentans who don’t take part in their city’s bloody military campaigns toil at home to supply the army, growing drought-resistant crops in the thin and stony soil, forging sturdy but lightweight weapons and shields suitable for the hot summer wars, and producing thousands of barrels of the region’s famous ruby wine to keep soldiers’ spirits high.</p><p>Religion is important in Chessenta, and Chessentans have an array of gods and demigods utterly alien to outsiders. But perhaps no deity in Chessenta is so noteworthy as Tchazzar, a legendary god-king who in antiquity united the city-states of Chessenta and spearheaded the realm’s only golden age. Tchazzar’s death four hundred years ago heralded a great schism between the Chessentan cities. Only recently has the violent deity returned to Faerûnian soil in his true form as the Great Red Dragon. After reclaiming and subjugating the city of Cimbar, Tchazzar now aims to reunite the fractious powers of Chessenta into his idealized warrior realm.</p><p><em><strong>Airspur.</strong></em> The city of Airspur drifts above the shores of Wizards’ Reach on an island of floating stone. Its populace includes a higher-than-average percentage of orcs and genasi (described in <em>Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</em>). Its theocratic rulers—the Church of Bhaelros—demand monthly sacrifices to appease their bloody god. The flying city uses its aerial advantage to harry its longstanding political rival, Cimbar, to the east. If not for Cimbar’s divine ruler, Tchazzar, Airspur likely would’ve already destroyed its age-old foe.</p><p><em><strong>Cimbar.</strong></em> The former capital of united Chessenta, Cimbar remains one of the fragmented empire’s largest metropolises. The city is Tchazzar’s seat of power. Naturally, given Tchazzar’s draconic nature, the Cult of the Dragon has a strong foothold here. Though it is a blood-soaked and perilous port of call, Cimbar boasts one of the largest navies in the whole Inner Sea region. It also hosts famous non-military institutions such as the University, the greatest center of higher learning in the Old Empires.</p><p><em><strong>Luthcheq.</strong></em> Military zeal combines with religious fervor in Luthcheq, whose ruling Karanok family persecutes practitioners of arcane magic in the name of Entropy, a strange god of alien intellect that resides somewhere in the vast underground chasms beneath Luthcheq’s undercity. Dozens, if not hundreds, of magically gifted refugees flee Luthcheq each year to escape this destructive cult.</p><p><em><strong>Threskel.</strong></em> South of the dormant volcano known as Mount Thulbane and north of the Riders to the Sky lies the sparsely populated land of Threskel. Chessenta and Unther both claim Threskel, but this remote land is famously lorded over by evil dragons. The few people who live in Threskel eke out pitiful existences on barren farms nestled between rocky shores and windswept cliffs. The desperation of this land has given rise to many heroic adventurers whom the dragons eagerly squash.</p><h4>Mulhorand</h4><p>Mulhorand is the oldest of the Old Empires and was literally shaped by gods. Deities from a distant world—gods with names like Anhur, Horus-Re, and Set—took on physical form, leading their people to settle in rich, densely populated metropolises and build massive stone pyramids. To this day, these incarnated deities continue to walk the land and directly influence the realm.</p><p>While pharaohs with divine lineage ultimately rule the realm, Mulhorand is governed by a class of powerful theocrats: high priests, sages, and holy warriors who serve the incarnated gods. All Mulhorandi, from blue-blooded nobles to common street peddlers, heed their god-kings’ wishes in every aspect of daily life. When a merchant’s latest shipment arrives safely at port, it is thanks to the will of Nephthys; a new mother’s safe delivery might personally be overseen by Hathor; and Mulhorandi commanders pray to Anhur, General of the Gods, for victory against Untherites who threaten their borders.</p><p><em><strong>The Great Vale.</strong></em> The breadbasket of Mulhorand produces enough barley, lentils, and onions to feed millions of the empire’s citizens; it is also the realm’s primary source of papyrus. Large bronze pumps—just one of Mulhorand’s advanced technologies—move water from the River of Spears to irrigate the valley’s vast farms. To the east, the Dragonsword Mountains cast their shadows over the Great Vale; the empire’s pharaohs and greatest high priests are buried among the foothills of these mountains. Marking these crypts are dozens of monuments and elaborate tombs—ancient step pyramids and towering obelisks—collectively known as the Land of the Dead.</p><p><em><strong>River of Swords.</strong></em> This long river is the current border between Mulhorand and Unther. A perennial battleground, the River of Swords sustains few settlements along its bloodstained banks. Most of the river’s water is too salty to drink or water crops. In the small city of Sekras there is a machine that pumps water from the river and filters out the salt; only a handful of priests of Thoth know how to operate the pump. Occupation of Sekras has traded hands so many times that even its few permanent residents scarcely know which empire—if any—they currently serve.</p><p><em><strong>Skuld. </strong></em>Anyone wishing to experience Mulhorandi culture in its most realized form visits the metropolis of Skuld. The so-called City of Shadows has the noteworthy distinction of being the oldest continually inhabited city in Faerûn. Its central district is called the City of the Gods; here, incarnations of Mulhorand’s god-kings live in grand temples that overlook lush gardens that produce delicious fruit and courtyards of gilded statues.</p><h4>Unther</h4><p>Though they share a common origin story, Mulhorand and Unther are vastly different realms. Whereas some might call Mulhorand paradise, most of Unther is nothing less than a hellscape. As one sage wrote, “the society of Unther is one of the most miserable tyrannies that the Realms have ever known.” It is a land defined by violence—an ever-shifting territory of fiery war camps, poisoned rivers, and salted battlefields where soldiers commit unspeakable atrocities in the name of their realm. Mercenaries might find their fortune serving in the armies of Unther, but the cost is no less than one’s own soul.</p><p>The patron god-king of Unther, Gilgeam, is largely to blame for the realm’s state. Whereas the god-kings of Mulhorand treat their realm with benign neglect, Gilgeam is neither benign nor neglectful. Cruel and vindictive, he forbids the worship of any other deity. He justifies his violence by attributing it to fate, a force he insists even he, a god, is beholden to. It was Gilgeam who led Unther to its present state of corruption and chaos. There was a short era of relative peace without the dread god, but that time has ended, and Gilgeam now leads a new generation of lambs to the slaughter. Already Unther is once more a realm of violent dysfunction, maintained by the brute force of Gilgeam and the raw willpower of his most devoted followers, a class of violent hoplites, holy warriors, and warlocks called the Children of Gilgeam.</p><p><em><strong>Black Ash Plain.</strong></em> This wasteland of infertile soil takes its name from the embers and ash that perpetually rain down from the volcanoes of the nearby Smoking Mountains. From the blighted earth jut brutalist ruins—vestiges of Ancient Mulhorand and even earlier empires. The ruins magically shift across the desert of their own accord. Those who brave the ruins’ subterranean depths find themselves in an ever-transforming maze of basalt corridors and granite columns engraved with eerie glyphs that resemble no known language.</p><p><em><strong>Djerad Thymar.</strong></em> The fortress-city called Djerad Thymar was the capital of Tymanchebar, an empire of dragonborn that was transported from its home world of Abeir to Toril during the Spellplague and fused with Unther to form the new realm of Tymanther. With Unther’s return in the Second Sundering, the armies of Unther have shattered the power of Tymanther, but Djerad Thymar still stands. With its awe-inspiring stone architecture (the city is carved into the face of a mountain) and its vast arts districts, Djerad Thymar is a bastion for draconic culture and a mark of great pride for dragonborn.</p><p><em><strong>Messemprar.</strong></em> The large city of Messemprar is by far the finest and most hospitable settlement in Unther. Not coincidentally, it is also the only city not presently under the thumb of Gilgeam. Instead, a coalition of anti-Gilgeam mages called the North Wizards controls the settlement. The North Wizards foster a brand of democracy otherwise unknown in the Old Empires. A prime port, Messemprar is beset on all sides by would-be conquerors: war ships from Chessenta, the armies of Mulhorand, and freebooting Inner Sea pirates from lands abroad. Sturdy adventurers are in constant demand to protect the city’s independence.</p><p><em><strong>Unthalass. </strong></em>Supposedly, Unthalass was once the greatest city in the Realms: a paradise of flowering gardens, alabaster statues, and palatial limestone manors. Anyone who visits the city as it is now would scarcely believe such legends. Everything here has been sacrificed in the name of the god-king Gilgeam’s hunger for conquest. The mud-brick streets overflow with filth and even blood, for Gilgeam brooks no dissent within his capital. The tyrant himself rules all of Unther from an imposing granite fortress in Unthalass called the Citadel of Black Ash.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.oJi6tvmrk2vvc8g9]</p><h4>Life in the Old Empires</h4><p>Those visiting the Old Empires are often surprised by the realms’ different cultural values, their unique architecture and customs, and the unforgiving southern climate. For natives of the Old Empires, these are simply facts of life.</p><p><em><strong>Ancient History.</strong></em> Mulhorand, Chessenta, and Unther are unfathomably old—and they are built atop the ruins of realms even older still. Most notably, Mulhorand and Unther are inheritors of the Imaskar Empire. To this day, countless ruins of Imaskar are strewn across the region, awaiting discovery by brave adventurers.</p><p><em><strong>Insular Realms.</strong></em> The people of the Old Empires care little for the concerns of greater Faerûn. Rulers and commoners alike consider themselves and their kingdoms far above the juvenile concerns of younger realms. The denizens of Mulhorand and Unther justify this point of view by citing the gods and godly descendants that have shaped their empires to an extent virtually unknown in other parts of the Realms. (Chessentans, for their part, simply view other cultures as weak and cowardly.) Further, rulers in the Old Empires are too concerned with their own internal power struggles to consider much beyond the horizon.</p><p><em><strong>Living Gods.</strong></em> Unlike most Faerûnian deities, the deities of the Old Empires regularly assume tangible, readily perceivable forms. This allows the god-kings of these realms to take an active role in their followers’ affairs. These deities deliver divine mandates personally and issue decrees that offer little room for doubt about the gods’ motives or intentions. Because of this, priests in the Old Empires tend to function more like bureaucrats or law enforcers than spiritual guides.</p><p><em><strong>Technology and Magic.</strong></em> The people of the Old Empires are masters of unusual technology and forms of magic seen nowhere else in Faerûn. Some of these secrets they inherited from Imaskari mages called artificers. Others are simply a result of unique Mulhorandi or Untherite genius. Examples include bronze water pumps and mass water purification spells that enable the transfer and filtration of precious water, and sail-powered sand sleds and easy-to-learn flotation spells allowing travelers to glide on desert winds over vast distances.</p>"

The Lords’ Alliance ensures that both the Sword Coast’s and the North’s major settlements keep their attention squarely directed at mutual threats.</p><p>The Sword Coast boasts some of the most cosmopolitan cities in Faerûn. In a city like Waterdeep or Baldur’s Gate, a visitor might pass a dragonborn ombudsman, an aasimar merchant, and a goliath lutist all in the span of a city block. Even in smaller villages, people hold few prejudices and tend to be more receptive to new ideas than in places like the stubborn Heartlands or the more isolationist isles of the Trackless Sea.</p><p>This is a region of adventure, where daring souls delve into the wreckage of ancient strongholds and explore long-lost ruins. The Sword Coast’s enormous cities also serve as useful sites for urban-based adventures, where characters unearth the machinations of scheming nobles or shady factions.</p><h4>Lords’ Alliance</h4><p>The Lords’ Alliance isn’t a true realm, but rather a loose coalition of cities, including Waterdeep, Baldur’s Gate, Daggerford, and Amphail in the Sword Coast. It also includes several cities in Faerûn’s North, such as Neverwinter (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofRegionsOfTheR.JournalEntryPage.yZ5xT59147vpYT3a]{The North}” in this chapter). Each member of the Lords’ Alliance keeps its own interests in mind first and foremost. But these cities also agree to maintain trade ties with each other, uphold a mutual peace, and band together against common threats. Without the Lords’ Alliance, many of western Faerûn’s great cities would have long ago fallen to outside threats.</p><h4>Baldur’s Gate</h4><p>The grim, crowded city of Baldur’s Gate sits alongside the River Chionthar. Its nobles, called patriars, reside in the Upper City while most of the rest of the populace lives in the Lower City. Refugees and the destitute make what homes they can in the Outer City. A short way to the east sits the walled district of Little Calimshan, a thriving neighborhood of immigrants from that southern realm. The Council of Four governs Baldur’s Gate, led by Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard. See chapter 6 of <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em> for more on Baldur’s Gate.</p><p><em><strong>Criminal Underworld. </strong></em>Baldur’s Gate has a shady underworld organization known as the Guild. It operates throughout the city under the discreet leadership of a crime boss named Nine-Fingers Keene. She has agents throughout Baldur’s Gate, including in the city’s banking network.</p><p><em><strong>The Dead Three.</strong></em> The gods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul share a common history linked to the city of Baldur’s Gate, where they are known as the Dead Three. All three gods began as mortals, claimed a share of the power of the death god Jergal, and died during the Time of Troubles. All three have returned, and their worshipers have made a resurgence in Baldur’s Gate and the surrounding area, hiding away in the shadows of society. Cultists of the Dead Three plot endlessly to secure the ascendancy of their deities at the expense of innocent folk. (The three gods are described in more detail in chapter 5.)</p><h4>Elturgard</h4><p>The realm of Elturgard encompasses Elturel, Triel, Scornubel, Soubar, and Berdusk. It also includes much of the surrounding land, including the Fields of the Dead. Once a shining kingdom, Elturgard fell into disarray when its capital Elturel was dragged into the Nine Hells and back again. Even after the capital’s return, Elturgard struggles to pick up the pieces. Some of Elturgard’s outer cities have attempted to secede from the increasingly theocratic realm. Elturel keeps them close by threatening to withdraw the protection of the Hellriders, a cavalry force that keeps Elturgard’s loyal cities safe from danger.</p><p><em><strong>The Fall of Elturel and Its Aftermath.</strong></em> A radiant sphere called the Companion appeared over Elturel in 1444 DR, blazing like a second sun. Elturel’s people praised the god Torm for this fortuitous blessing, and Elturel expanded to become the holy nation of Elturgard. In truth, the Companion was summoned up by the archdevil Zariel to enact a decades-long grudge against the city. In 1492, it became a crackling orb of darkness, dragging Elturel and its inhabitants into Avernus, first layer of the Nine Hells.</p><p>While all reasonable folk know and fear the Nine Hells, this fear is largely abstract. Very few have ever had to see such a place with their own eyes or feel its heat on their skin. But that’s precisely what the citizens of Elturel had to do, as their friends and family were slain by marauding devils. After brave heroes eliminated the Companion and returned Elturel to the Material Plane, Elturgard’s theocratic government doubled down on the mandatory worship of Torm, Tyr, and Ilmater—three benevolent gods collectively called the Triad.</p><p><em><strong>Elturel. </strong></em>Elturel’s people have become more pious after returning from the Nine Hells, desperate to ensure their afterlives send them to the Upper Planes. But this has created new problems, as the paranoid populace now distrusts and harasses tieflings, blaming them for the city’s fall. Fearing for their safety, Elturel’s tieflings have fled in droves for Baldur’s Gate.</p><h4>Najara</h4><p>The ancient realm of Najara stretches across the Serpent Hills, the Marsh of Chelimber, and the Forest of Wyrms. It is a land of yuan-ti, nagas, and lizardfolk. Najaran society is unfeeling and ever-calculating. The Sword Coast remained oblivious to Najara for over a millennia until Najara’s current ruler, the spirit naga Jarant, decided to make the realm’s presence known to its neighbors. For now, Najara’s nefarious motives remain unexplored. The Lords’ Alliance and Elturgard alike have been too busy with other threats to investigate the serpent realm. Najara grows in power right under their noses, like a coiled snake waiting for the perfect moment to strike.</p><p><em><strong>Ss’thar’tiss’ssun. </strong></em>Ancient and evil, the spirit naga Jarant rules the realm of Najara from its capital city Ss’thar’tiss’ssun with the aid of a silver circlet called the <em>Marlspire of Najara.</em> This artifact grants Jarant powerful abjuration magic and control over reptilian creatures—including the first ruler of the kingdom, Terpenzi, now a powerful bone naga called the Guardian of Najara.</p><h4>Waterdeep</h4><p>Also known as the City of Splendors, the bustling city of Waterdeep is ruled by a lordly council. The current Open Lord, Laeral Silverhand, keeps her identity known to the public. The Masked Lords rule alongside her anonymously, thus preventing any of them from being bribed or threatened. Waterdeep boasts a prodigious magical academy at Blackstaff Tower, which is run by a wizard holding the office of the Blackstaff—currently Vajra Safahr.</p><p><em><strong>City Wards. </strong></em>Waterdeep is divided into several wards. Wards aren’t separated by walls or gates, and crossing between wards is easy. City wards include the Sea Ward, marked by the palatial fortress-estates of the city’s rich and powerful; the peacefully elegant North Ward; and the busy marketplaces of the Trade Ward. The Southern Ward is home to many immigrants, while the city’s poorest live and work in the Dock Ward. Waterdeep’s dead are entombed in the City of the Dead, a massive park and open air mausoleum within the city. Outside Waterdeep, a large collection of shelters that were once temporary housing for refugees has become a neighborhood of its own: the Field Ward. The Field Ward isn’t patrolled by the city guards and has no sanitation or other city services; it is home to Waterdeep’s most desperate citizens.</p><p><em><strong>Defenses. </strong></em>While Waterdeep has a militia and city guard, its most famous defenders are magical walking statues and the griffon cavalry. The walking statues are eight enormous statues that sit dormant among the city’s buildings. The Blackstaff can activate them to defend the city in times of dire need, animating each statue into an unstoppable stone colossus. The griffon cavalry is made up of well-trained riders and their griffon mounts. Each rider wears a <em>Ring of Feather Falling</em>, allowing them to safely leap from their mounts in daring assaults on any enemy.</p><p><em><strong>Undermountain. </strong></em>The twenty-three-floor megadungeon of Undermountain stretches deep beneath the city of Waterdeep. Adventurers descend into it from a well in the Yawning Portal tavern to search for treasure. At the dungeon’s bottommost level lairs Halaster Blackcloak. Halaster’s motives are unknown and perhaps unknowable. He built this behemoth of a dungeon complex long before Waterdeep was founded, and he’s been stocking it with perils ever since. Many creatures have also found their way into Undermountain of their own accord, creating civilizations in its halls, including the bustling, crime-ridden city of Skullport.</p><p><em><strong>Xanathar Guild.</strong></em> The Xanathar Guild is a criminal organization operating out of Skullport, a subterranean city beneath Waterdeep. Its gang activity frequently spills up into Waterdeep proper. Very few people know who or what Xanathar actually is: a paranoid, megalomaniacal beholder who fawns over his pet goldfish, Sylgar. Xanathar has eyes all over the bustling city of Waterdeep and despises his rival, the Zhentarim. For more on the Xanathar Guild, see chapter 6.</p><h4>Other Sites</h4><p>Though Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate have great influence in this region, their official territories don’t extend far beyond their city walls. Most of the land in this region doesn’t fall under any realm’s jurisdiction.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.O8l1J3j2cEIcYqOt caption=false]</p><p><em><strong>Ardeep Forest. </strong></em>Once the heart of an elf kingdom, Ardeep Forest has shrunk over the years, its trees cut and sent to Waterdeep to build ships and homes. About a decade ago, elves from Evermeet returned to the forest to defend it against further intrusion and exploitation. They aggressively drive out all who enter the forest. But Ardeep Forest remains a draw for adventurers of all stripes, as it houses many interesting ruins and magical sites.</p><p><em><strong>Candlekeep. </strong></em>Candlekeep holds the largest repository of written lore in Faerûn. It is a towering, walled library standing proudly atop a seaside cliff. In order to enter Candlekeep, an individual must submit a work of writing not yet found within its halls. Its librarian-priests, the Avowed, retrieve tomes from the library for visitors. Candlekeep’s defenses include a mythal and a ghostly dragon called Miirym, the Sentinel Wyrm.</p><p><em><strong>Dragonspear Castle. </strong></em>An infernal portal hides in the catacombs beneath the dwarven ruins known as Dragonspear Castle, on the edge of High Moor. It connects to Avernus, first layer of the Nine Hells, but is currently sealed shut. These days, a thick cloud of mist shrouds Dragonspear Castle from harsh sunlight. A mysterious group of vampires known as the Szarlnaxi coven lurks within.</p><p><em><strong>Evereska.</strong></em> The elven city of Evereska is often called “a pocket of Evermeet,” and it shares that fabled land’s elusive mystique. Evereska is rumored to exist in a great valley in the mountains near Anauroch, protected by a mythal and defended by elf warriors who ride giant eagles.</p><p><em><strong>Fields of the Dead. </strong></em>Myriad wars and skirmishes have taken place on the Fields of the Dead over the centuries. It is a vast, rolling plain of windswept grasses. On rare occasions, it belches forth hostile undead, the buried remnants of wars long forgotten.</p><p><em><strong>Graypeak Mountains. </strong></em>Stone giants and stone goliaths call the Graypeak Mountains home. The range is riddled with abandoned mines of both dwarven and Netherese origin.</p><p><em><strong>High Moor. </strong></em>Trolls and cruel goblinoids prowl the rocky wilderness of the High Moor, as do nomadic orcs and human berserkers. An evil dracolich called the Old One lairs in Orogoth, a ruined villa on the moor, still guarding the ancient wealth of a long-lost Netherese noble family.</p><p><em><strong>Orlumbor.</strong></em> There’s no better place to purchase or repair a ship in the Sword Coast than Orlumbor. This rocky, cavernous island hides a great harbor full of skilled shipwrights and dockworkers who make some of sturdiest vessels around at a record pace. At the moment, Orlumbor has an exclusive business relationship with Waterdeep.</p><p><em><strong>Trielta Hills. </strong></em>Halflings live out idyllic, pastoral lives in the quaint Trielta Hills. Its humble people have little in the way of valuables to covet, which has allowed Trieltans to exist undisturbed by Najara to the north. Short-lived gold rushes bring outsiders to Trielta every now and then.</p><p><em><strong>The Trollclaws. </strong></em>The rough Trollclaw Hills teem with ravenous trolls. Caravans journeying south to Baldur’s Gate or north out of the Fields of Dead cross the river at the Trollclaw Ford and hire adventurers to battle off the regenerating monsters.</p><p><em><strong>Warlock’s Crypt. </strong></em>A Netherese enclave crashed to the ground in the Troll Hills over a thousand years ago, becoming a set of ruins now called Warlock’s Crypt. Hundreds of undead dwell among the site’s shattered rubble and twisted towers. Liches, including the great lich Larloch, perform bizarre experiments on the creatures of the surrounding region and release them back into the wild as terrifying horrors.</p><p><em><strong>Wood of Sharp Teeth. </strong></em>Hundreds of years ago, these woods were the site of a werewolf city called Vehlarr. Rumor has it that wicked lycanthropes are congregating in these woods once again to recreate that society.</p>"

Lantan’s denizens enjoy the conveniences conferred by their many inventions but are cautious and slow to share their discoveries with the outside world.</p><h4>Lantan</h4><p>Folk on the mainland know little of the reclusive realm of Lantan apart from its people’s devotion to Gond, the god of invention. Complex locks, oil lamps, tripwires, and light-beam intruder alarms have origins on the island. If a trap in a Faerûnian dungeon has a complex mechanism involved, odds are the technology originated in Lantan. The archipelago is governed by a theocratic twelve-person council called the Ayrorch, high-ranking members of the Church of Gond. Gnomes make up much of the island’s population and most of the council.</p><p><em><strong>Lantanese Inventions.</strong></em> The last hundred years have seen the secluded island realm of Lantan grow even more secretive. Its recent innovations include packets of explosive smokepowder, parachutes, firearms, and even submarines. Lantan’s people worry that the rest of Faerûn might learn how to replicate these inventions, potentially diminishing the island realm’s trading power. Lantan exports inventions in small shipments to mainland port cities like Baldur’s Gate and Waterdeep in exchange for precious metals and critical resources that are hard to find on Lantan’s islands.</p><p><em><strong>Northern Lantan. </strong></em>The large northern island of Lantan is home to the capital city of Sambar, which houses the realm’s ruling council. The city of Illul lies not far away, housing the High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration. Led by a high artificer, this wondrous temple is the center of Gond worship in Faerûn.</p><p><em><strong>Orlil.</strong></em> The seemingly barren isle of Orlil boasts a self-contained network of Underdark tunnels that house thriving communes of Lantanese deep gnomes, or svirfneblin. Unlike the svirfneblin of Faerûn’s mainland, Orlil’s deep gnomes have never known drow subjugation.</p><p><em><strong>Southern Lantan.</strong></em> Outsiders who wish to trade and parley with Lantan must do so on Lantan’s southern island, at a port city called Anchoril. Southern Lantan’s people are just as industrious and inventive as those to the north, but the citizens of Anchoril feign a lesser degree of technological advancement to keep Lantan’s secrets safe.</p><h4>Mintarn</h4><p>The island of Mintarn, between the Moonsea Isles and Waterdeep, is best known for its mercenaries. Mintarn is known as neutral ground, where enemies meet to negotiate and bargain with each other. Fledgling heroes often travel to Mintarn to make names for themselves. The island’s taverns bustle with quest-givers and quest-seekers from across the Trackless Sea and the mainland alike. Mintarn has always been governed by a single ruler self-styled as a tyrant—though these tyrants generally rule with a light hand. But even the current tyrant trembles before the ancient red dragon Hoondarrh, who lairs on a small volcanic island northwest of Mintarn and demands annual tribute from Mintarn’s people.</p><p><em><strong>Hoondarrh.</strong></em> Up until recently, Mintarn enjoyed unprecedented prosperity by offering its mercenary services to the wealthy cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep. As Mintarn’s wealth grew, the ancient red dragon Hoondarrh demanded increasingly exorbitant tributes from the island’s inhabitants. Today, Hoondarrh’s influence keeps Neverwinter and Waterdeep from doing any business with Mintarn. This has left the island’s ruler—Her Tyrancy Bloeth Embuirhan—with few ways to pay an increasingly greedy red dragon. Mintarn is poised to undergo a violent change of rulership as its people clamor for a new approach in dealing with Hoondarrh.</p><h4>Moonshae Isles</h4><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.zjXXPq8zHNrnN05m caption=false classes=\"float-right size-three\"]</p><p>Fey abound and giants lurk in the misty Moonshae Isles, an archipelago steeped in fey magic. These wondrous isles are home to two cultures: the rugged, seafaring Norlanders and the practical, hard-working Ffolk. These cultures once warred with each other but have come together under the ruling Kendrick dynasty. Ffolk worship the Earthmother, a divine embodiment of the Moonshae Isles. Springs of natural magic called moonwells are her windows into the world. Druids and rangers tend the moonwells and protect them from a new, insidious curse called the Rusting. This curse threatens to transform moonwells into pools of stinking oil and living things into rusted iron. See chapter 5 of <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em> for more on the Moonshae Isles.</p><p><em><strong>Rusting and the Rusted. </strong></em>A century ago, Amn invaded the Moonshae isle of Snowdown. Led by the vampire Erliza Darissa, Amn’s soldiers stripped the island’s mines bare, chopped down its forests, and polluted its ponds. Moonshavians banded together to slay Erliza and drive out the Amnians, but the vampire laid a curse on the Moonshaes with her dying words. This curse became the Rusting. Animals and plants affected by the Rusting warp into twisted iron before eventually crumbling to dust. Moonwells become pits of slick, black oil. People who dwell in an area gripped by the Rusting for too long become Rusted constructs who abhor the living. Some Rusted Norlanders even terrorize the Moonshae’s coasts in giant warships plated with rusted iron.</p><p><em><strong>Alaron.</strong></em> The Moonshavian island of Alaron is home to a large Ffolk population. Caer Calidyrr—a fortress that overlooks the city of Calidyrr—houses Derid Kendrick, high king of the Moonshaes. Norlanders live in the northern half of the island, herding sheep and working mines in the Farheight range.</p><p><em><strong>Gwynneth</strong></em>. Gwynneth is the most magical of the Moonshae Isles and the center of the Earthmother’s power. As of yet, it is the only Moonshae Isle totally untouched by the Rusting. Its landmarks include the rebuilt castle of Caer Corwell and Myrloch Vale, a forested valley teeming with fey. In the north of the island, the fey kingdom of Sarifal endures, ruled by High Lady Ordalf.</p><p><em><strong>Moray. </strong></em>The Moonshavian isle of Moray is home to monsters and the Red Shadow: packs of werewolves who worship a violent beast-god called Kazgaroth. The Red Shadow regularly abducts innocents for sacrifice in violent rituals.</p><p><em><strong>Norland.</strong></em> When Norlanders first sailed to the Moonshaes, they landed on the cold island now known as Norland. It remains the seat of Norlander culture in the Moonshaes. Jarl Olfsvenn is loyal to High King Kendrick, but he’s torn by the fact his sister has fallen victim to the Rusting curse and taken on a new identity as Queen Forfallen. Overfishing in the Sea of Moonshae has brought the Rusting to Rogarsheim, and dockworkers show the signs of exposure to the curse: rust-colored marks around the eyes and a hacking cough.</p><p><em><strong>Oman’s Isle.</strong></em> Giants and their goliath kin live in well-established steadings and ancient Ostorian ruins all over Oman’s Isle. Visitors can safely land at Trondheim, which is overseen by goliaths working for the giants.</p><p><em><strong>Snowdown.</strong></em> The island of Snowdown is a blight on the Moonshaes. The Rusting first manifested at its only moonwell, located near the center of the island. Attempts to rein in environmental destruction caused by Amn have proved futile, and the island’s population shrinks each year.</p><h4>Other Islands and Ocean Sites</h4><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.0n4w8yQyxNJ3gQwL caption=false classes=\"float-right size-three\"]</p><p>Beyond the major islands and archipelagos, unaffiliated islands dot the sea—and some mysterious sites lie hidden under the waves.</p><p><em><strong>Gundarlun. </strong></em>Gundarlun, west of Neverwinter, experiences wintry weather most of the year, and its Northlander population is regularly terrorized by Arveiaturace, a white dragon from the North. Off the island’s southwest coast lies the wreck of the <em>Golden Crown</em>, a Calishite merchant vessel that was carrying a vast cargo of gold, silver, electrum, and gemstones when it sank in a storm. A wizard named Hoch Miraz also went down with the ship. Its treasure has never been recovered.</p><p><em><strong>Maelstrom.</strong></em> The storm giant stronghold of Maelstrom sits on the seafloor somewhere between Ruathym, the Whalebones, and the Moonshaes. Serissa, the titular queen of all giantkind, resides here. A natural whirlpool occasionally manifests far above the palace, wrecking ships and dragging them down to the seafloor.</p><p><em><strong>Mother-of-Mists.</strong></em> Adventurers from Chult and Lantan alike have journeyed to Mother-of-Mists in search of treasure, finding nothing but danger. Poisonous vapors and smoke mix with cold sea winds to create the ever-present mists for which this volcanic island is known.</p><p><em><strong>The Nelanther.</strong></em> Riddled with communities of monstrous pirates, the Nelanther islands have few resources and are plagued with infighting. Ancient towers guarded by monsters and magic wards jut from several of the isles and even from the sea itself. The Nelanther’s pirates avoid these towers out of a mix of fear and superstition.</p><p><em><strong>Northlander Isles.</strong></em> Norlander culture originated long ago on the bleak, mountainous island of Ruathym in the Northlander Isles, north of the Moonsea Isles. Most Norlanders left these isles long ago in favor of more hospitable climates, but a few scattered steadings remain. Queen Forfallen, a Rusted pirate queen and Norlander, uses Ruathym as a safe port.</p><p><em><strong>Purple Rocks.</strong></em> Few have visited the distant Purple Rocks archipelago, far to the west of Neverwinter and so named because it appears dark purple under stormy skies. Those who return report its friendly inhabitants sport odd piscine features and also note an odd lack of children and elders.</p><p><em><strong>Sea of Swords.</strong></em> The Sea of Swords is a cold and storm-wracked gulf. Most of the Sword Coast’s trade routes hug close to the shore.</p><p><em><strong>Tuern.</strong></em> Red dragons and fire giants war constantly on the volcanic island of Tuern, far to the north and west. For decades, they demanded tribute from Tuern’s Humanoid population. When the people finally refused, the dragons and giants began conscripting them as disposable infantry in their brutal wars. People in Mintarn who have heard of Tuern see it as a cautionary tale.</p><p><em><strong>Whalebones.</strong></em> Whales come to die for reasons unknown at a set of islands called the Whalebones. The shores are littered with their bleached-white bones. Rocs perch on the mountaintops while petty self-proclaimed “kings” of the tiny islets squabble among each other for power.</p><h4>Life in the Trackless Sea</h4><p>No matter what island they dock on, outsiders quickly discover that life in the Trackless Sea can be quite different than life on the mainland.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.yQlI2tqqnoVSCpnm]</p><p><em><strong>Denizens of the Deep</strong></em>. Entire realms lie hidden beneath Faerûn’s waves. Storm giants live in great palaces on the seafloor. Merfolk live in sunlit shallows, while monstrous merrow and sahuagin lair in dark grottoes but surface to feast on innocents. Sea elves are much rarer in the Trackless Sea than they are in the inland Sea of Fallen Stars, as they’re hunted relentlessly in these waters by sahuagin and their malenti spies—a breed of sahuagin with the appearance of sea elves.</p><p><em><strong>Piracy.</strong></em> Pirates abound in the Trackless Sea. Norlander culture has a long history of piracy and raiding, sometimes harrying the mainland’s merchant vessels along the Sea of Swords. Mercenaries from Mintarn sell their services to privateering crews. But the most fearsome pirates hail from the monstrous Nelanther Isles. These ogre, lizardfolk, and minotaur buccaneers aren’t bound by codes of honor; they torture their victims and leave them to hideous deaths. They prey on the shipping routes of Amn, Calimshan, the Sword Coast, and the Moonshaes, and they war on each other as often as they war on outsiders.</p><p><em><strong>Ships.</strong></em> The lightly built galleys favored in more sheltered waters don’t fare well in the winds and storms of the Trackless Sea. Savvy seafarers opt for bigger, more durable sailing ships instead. The Norlanders of Ruathym and the Moonshaes build swift yet sturdy longships, equipped with smaller, specialized boats called whaleboats for whaling. They are among the most recognizable ships on the seas, but a trained eye can recognize any vessel’s land of origin by its size, shape, and build, even if the ship isn’t flying any flags.</p><p><em><strong>Umberlee Worship.</strong></em> Inhabitants of the Trackless Sea are ever-wary of Umberlee, the Wavemother. Cultists strike fear into the hearts of sailors, warning of Umberlee’s ire and demanding passage on ships. Each coastal city maintains shrines to the cruel sea god, and sailors leave flowers or small candies in hopes Umberlee will show mercy on a ship’s next voyage. Savvy pirate crews have been known to recruit priests of Umberlee to trap unsuspecting merchant ships in whirlpools or devastate towns with tsunamis before a pillage.</p>"

Nature is more respected here than in other areas of Faerûn, a result of both the Emerald Enclave’s enormous influence on the region and the region’s history of natural disasters.</p><p>People wary of magic often settle in the Vilhon, since some of its cities have laws that curtail or even ban spellcasting. Some Thayan commoners desperate to escape the rule of Red Wizards speak in whispers of Ilighôn, an island in the Vilhon Reach where no divination magic can find them.</p><p>Adventures in this region might explore philosophical themes about the role of magic in society or people’s struggle to coexist with nature. They might be wizards on the run, druids and rangers in search of training, or mercenaries hired to capture fugitive spellcasters. The realm of Chondath also provides the opportunity for heroes to help small towns and villages extricate themselves from the grasp of a greedy nation, whether by diplomacy or force.</p><h4>Chondath</h4><p>Chondath was once a large and powerful realm comprising all of the southern Vilhon Reach, with distant colonies in the land now known as Sembia. Military defeats and numerous plagues led Chondath to shrink in on itself over a millennium. Then the Spellplague decimated nearly all of Chondath’s coastal settlements, sealing the dying realm’s fate. Today, Chondath is but a shell of its former glory. Its capital city Arrabar still stands, desperately demanding increasingly exorbitant taxes from the tiny towns of Samra, Timindar, and Orbech—all three of which are considering secession. Adventurers flock to Chondath to see what abandoned treasures lie amid the ruined cities of Mussum, Iljak, Shamph, and Hlath.</p><p><em><strong>Arrabar.</strong></em> Arrabar, capital of Chondath, is a city determined to hold on to the last vestiges of its realm’s old splendor. Lady Udriana Wianar rules Arrabar and the realm from a grand palace called the Generon. Her family, along with Arrabar’s many nobles, lead decadent lifestyles funded by the rest of Chondath.</p><p><em><strong>Chondalwood.</strong></em> Rumor has it that a city-state of reclusive wood elves called Rucien-Xan lies hidden somewhere in the Chondalwood forest. Those who’ve searched the woods have found only monsters, raucous satyrs, territorial druids, and Ghostwise halflings—a distrustful and uncharacteristically ferocious clan of halflings with telepathic gifts.</p><h4>Sespech</h4><p>Once a barony of Chondath, Sespech gained its independence centuries ago after a civil war called the Rotting War. It has defended itself fiercely ever since. With its neighbor Chondath in decline, Sespech now has little use for its military. Many of Sespech’s former soldiers have turned to lives of adventure, roaming the Vilhon Reach and beyond. They’re often surprised and disturbed by the magic they find, for magic is more deeply suspect in Sespech than anywhere else in the Vilhon. In Sespech, the use of magic to charm or injure another person is a crime punishable by death.</p><p><em><strong>Mimph. </strong></em>A prosperous Sespech trade city, Mimph relies almost entirely on its port—famously, no roads lead to Mimph. A strong navy is based here. Rivalry with nearby Arrabar is so intense that merchants prefer to do business with only one city or the other, so as to avoid inciting violence. Helm is Mimph’s patron deity; Helm’s large temple is protected by a chapter of the Order of the Gauntlet (described in chapter 6).</p><p><em><strong>Nagawater.</strong></em> A bobbing line of buoys lit by <em>Continual Flame</em> spells divides the freshwater lake of Nagawater. The northern half belongs to the realm of Sespech, and fishers from Ormpetarr fish there often. The southern half is inhabited by a peaceful guardian naga. Those who assume the naga is guarding some treasure and attempt to retrieve it generally end up drowned in the lake’s still waters.</p><p><em><strong>Ormpetarr.</strong></em> Ormpetarr, capital city of Sespech, rests along the Nagawater. Baron Yoric Maplefoot rules Sespech from a modest manor here. He is a curt halfling man of few words, well-respected by his people for his daily public court sessions in which he rules on issues brought to him by citizens.</p><p><em><strong>Winterwood.</strong></em> Dim light filters through the dense canopy of the Winterwood’s tall oaks and pines. A cool mist coats the ground like snow, giving the forest its name. Several orc communities call the Winterwood home; they defend their villages against hordes of berserk plant monsters.</p><h4>Turmish</h4><p>The mercantile realm of Turmish, often called the heartland of the Vilhon Reach, is expertly managed and mostly peaceful. Most Turmishan folk are humans, but the realm is also home to many dwarves whose families emigrated from the nearby mountains, as well as other more recent immigrants. Turmishan merchants have a reputation as honest and fair traders.</p><p>This democratic republic’s tall mountain ranges shield it from outside aggression. Turmish also intentionally stays out of its neighbors’ conflicts, refusing to provide aid of any kind. It’s a stance that has often drawn the temporary ire of nearby realms, but it’s served Turmish well in the long term.</p><p><em><strong>Alaghôn.</strong></em> A great fire blazed through Turmish’s capital city Alaghôn a millennium ago, and Alaghôn’s buildings have been constructed of stone ever since. Turmish children play hide-and-seek in this stone city’s hundreds of cubbyholes and hiding places, sometimes discovering secret passages to long-forgotten dungeon complexes.</p><p>The citizens of Alaghôn hold free elections to appoint the Assembly of Stars, Turmish’s ruling council. These elected officials then select one of their rank to be Lord of Turmish.</p><p><em><strong>Aphrun Mountains.</strong></em> A handful of cloistered stone and fire goliath families live in the otherwise unsettled Aphrun Mountains, retreating to hidden caverns whenever Mount Kolimnis spouts ash or red dragons circle overhead.</p><p><em><strong>The Five Lions.</strong></em> An infamous and remote inn, the Five Lions was the site of a massacre—nobles fleeing revolution in far-off Tethyr took refuge here, but rebels caught up with them and all were killed. Now the inn is a haven for mages hiding from legal persecution. They have perpetuated a rumor that the inn is haunted by the restless spirits of Tethyrian dead, and this provides cover for their activities, including magical instruction and experimentation.</p><p><em><strong>Gildenglade.</strong></em> Gildenglade was once a thriving Turmish city populated by elves and dwarves. Then Mount Kolimnis erupted in 1423 DR, burying Gildenglade in volcanic mud and ash. Years later, after the lava had cooled, caves opened into the buried city. Dungeon delvers who explore these ruins find them eerily preserved—and teeming with monsters from the Underdark.</p><p><em><strong>Gulthmere.</strong></em> Nobanion, a benevolent god worshiped as a divine protector of the region, is said to live in the Gulthmere forest. Folk say they’ve seen the regal lion-god prowl through the foliage or even leap to their defense. Some faithful worshipers of Nobanion pilgrimage from the Shining Plains to Gulthmere in hope of catching a glimpse of Nobanion.</p><p><em><strong>Mount Andrus. </strong></em>A semi-active volcano, Mount Andrus famously destroyed the home of the Candlekairn orc clan a thousand years ago. The volcano is sacred to Talos, whose worshipers maintain a temple and shrines in the mountain’s heart, where they ally with evil elementals and other monsters capable of surviving the blistering heat. But Mount Andrus also hides a <em>Time Gate</em>, a portal that sends all who use it backward in time. The gate is protected by Mystra, who forbids anyone except her handpicked champions from using it.</p><p><em><strong>Orsraun Mountains.</strong></em> Kobolds and red dragons lurk in the uncharted Orsraun Mountains, and the dwarven city-kingdom of Ironfang Deep lies beneath the ranges’ northwest mountains. Some dwarves have migrated from Ironfang to Turmish, but many Ironfang dwarves loathe that upper realm. Centuries ago, a warlord led Turmish into battle against Ironfang, and Ironfang’s dwarves are slow to forget the lives lost.</p><p><em><strong>Starfall Stream Pool.</strong></em> A popular vacation destination, this picturesque town in the foothills of the Orsraun Mountains is particularly famous as a place to celebrate the Festival of the Moon. But the cult of Malar preys on tourists during this time, and the town desperately hires mercenaries and adventurers to keep visitors safe.</p><p><em><strong>Xorhun.</strong></em> Xorhun’s population consists mostly of elves and gnomes. This Turmish city is built in the fashion of the great elven cities of old, with elegant towers and abundant trees. Twin and triplet births are unusually common here; the elves and gnomes consider this a blessing from their gods.</p><h4>Shining Plains</h4><p>Shimmering heat waves rise from the vast, dry grassland of the Shining Plains most of the year, giving rise to its name. Centaurs and thri-kreen call these plains home. They maintain civil, if distant, relationships with the handful of towns within the plains. No unifying force controls the Shining Plains and the nearby hills, mountains, and swampy forest, but influences from across the Vilhon Reach extend here.</p><p><em><strong>Deepwing Mountains.</strong></em> The Deepwing Mountains are named for the many winged monsters that call its heights home: manticores, griffons, hippogriffs, dragons, wyverns, and more.</p><p><em><strong>Nathlekh.</strong></em> Cats abound in the independent city-state of Nathlekh, resting on rooftops and sipping milk from public troughs. Nearly everyone in this so-called City of Cats worships Nobanion, the lion-god rumored to roam in the nearby Gulthmere forest.</p><p><em><strong>Wetwoods.</strong></em> Lizardfolk, bullywugs, and other bog-dwelling creatures call the misty Wetwoods home. Apart from some tiny halfling hamlets, the most notable settlement here is Urml, a village of reclusive bullywugs.</p><h4>Independent City-States</h4><p>The Vilhon Reach is dotted with independent city-states. There was once a time when these city-states feared reannexation into the Chondathan empire, but that time has long since passed.</p><p><em><strong>Hlondeth.</strong></em> Turmish carefully maintains a friendly relationship with this City of Serpents, which controls the only trade road out of Turmish. House Extaminos, a line of guileful yuan-ti, has ruled Hlondeth for centuries. Snakelike architecture and green marble buildings decorate its streets.</p><p><em><strong>Ilighôn.</strong></em> The Emerald Enclave’s leaders, an Elder Circle of druids, reside in the faction’s headquarters on the verdant island of Ilighôn. Arcane magic doesn’t function on the island; magic from primal or divine sources is unaffected. As such, Ilighôn’s port city Sapra has become a haven for those seeking refuge from mages. The island is protected by the Seven Sentinels of Silvanus, colossal elementals that deter visitors and answer to the Emerald Enclave.</p><p>Locals of the Vilhon Reach call the islands of Wavecrest and Ilighôn the Eyes of Silvanus. Unlike its peaceful sister island, Wavecrest is an uninhabited and dangerous jungle teeming with ferocious beasts and monsters.</p><p><em><strong>Ixinos. </strong></em>Very little is known about Ixinos, a small forested island at the entrance to the Vilhon Reach, as the people there repel all visitors and refuse to engage in diplomacy even with their neighbors on the Emerald Enclave isle of Ilighôn. The only known settlement is the port town Tazixor, where the mysterious queen of Ixinos keeps court. The isle is defended by a mercenary company called the She-Wolves, and most of what is known about Ixinos comes from these mercenaries, who travel the Reach in small groups selling their services.</p><p><em><strong>Reth the Half-Ruin.</strong></em> Half of the independent city of Reth crumbled into the sea during the catastrophic events of the Spellplague. Some adventurers take the plunge, battling kuo-toa in those underwater ruins to find the lost treasures therein.</p><h4>Life in the Vilhon Reach</h4><p>In the wake of the Second Sundering, the Vilhon Reach has enjoyed a period of relative calm.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-heroes-faerun.book.JournalEntry.hofArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.35PB0wKqo8UzB75m]</p><p><em><strong>Emerald Enclave’s Influence.</strong></em> The Emerald Enclave (described in chapter 6) was founded on the island of Ilighôn in the 4th century DR by a coalition of priests from Turmish and Chondath who were devoted to nature deities. Its influence remains greater in the Vilhon Reach than anywhere else in Faerûn. Thanks to this faction, folk across the Reach share an immense respect for nature. The few callous folk throughout history who have polluted the waters of the Reach or tried logging in protected forests have been met with the Emerald Enclave’s unbridled wrath.</p><p><em><strong>The Rotting War and Distrust of Magic.</strong></em> The Vilhon Reach’s subtropical climate has, unfortunately, made it a perfect incubator for plagues throughout the region’s history. None haunt its people’s collective consciousness more than the magical contagion that ended the Rotting War. This Chondathan civil war began in 900 DR and gained its name when archmages from Arrabar and Hlath unleashed a necromantic plague. The rotting contagion decimated all sides of the conflict and spread beyond anyone’s expectations. This plague has long since subsided, but Chondath, Sespech, and the independent city-states near them remain distrustful of magic as a result.</p><p><em><strong>Spellmarks.</strong></em> A few villages and hamlets in the southern Vilhon Reach ask spellcasters to identify themselves by drawing a distinctive rune on their forehead with ink or chalk. This “spellmark” tradition derives from an old practice in the Vilhon wherein people would paint several circles on their forehead to indicate they could read or write—a tradition that became defunct as literacy rates rose.</p><p><em><strong>Volcanic Activity.</strong></em> The volcanoes around Turmish are both a blessing and a curse: their ash creates the fertile soil for which Turmish is well known, but it has also laid waste to more than one Turmishan settlement. Mount Ugruth is long dormant, while Mount Kolimnis and Mount Andrus are still active. Turmishan spellcasters do their best to predict eruptions and keep their cities safe. Troublesome red dragons flock to the volcanoes’ smoky heights to make their lairs.</p>"

Walls of mountains to the west, south, and east shield the interior from the sea and from the view of sailors. The rivers are so sluggish that it can be difficult determining which direction is upstream and which is down. The rivers pick up speed only where they thunder down through steep-sided gorges.</p><p>Chult has long been inhabited by bullywugs, dwarves, humans, goblins, and lizardfolk, as well as dinosaurs, hydras, wyverns, and other monsters. The people of Chult revere a deity named Ubtao, whose divine rival, Dendar the Night Serpent, is said to be imprisoned beneath volcanoes called the Peaks of Flame.</p><p>Chult’s coast from the Bay of Chult to Refuge Bay offers beaches from which explorers embark into the jungle, but the Bay of Chult is the only spot that welcome travelers from afar. The rest of the peninsula is a breeding ground for bloodsucking, disease-bearing insects; monstrous reptiles; carnivorous birds and beasts of every variety; and murderous undead.</p><p>Two locations in Chult are described below; see <em>Tomb of Annihilation</em> for much more detail.</p><p><em><strong>Mezro.</strong></em> The city of Mezro is widely thought to have been destroyed in the Spellplague. In fact, its inhabitants saved it through powerful magic, whisking it away into a demiplane and leaving only ruins behind. Some hints suggest the city will return when it is no longer in danger. The Flaming Fist, a mercenary company out of Baldur’s Gate, has searched the ruins of Mezro extensively and still sends patrols there.</p><p><em><strong>Port Nyanzaru. </strong></em>Port Nyanzaru hugs the coastline at the south end of the Bay of Chult. It’s a colorful, musical, aroma-filled, vibrant city—the only city in Chult that isn’t in ruins or overrun by monstrous creatures. The city is run by seven influential merchant princes. Other than trade, the biggest attractions are the weekly dinosaur races through the streets. Locals and visitors alike wager princely sums on the races’ outcomes. The city also boasts grand bazaars, glorious mansions and temples, circuses, and gladiatorial contests.</p>"

In the process, they devastated Toril in a cataclysmic disaster eventually known as the Sundering. But the island they created, Evermeet, remains. Elves from across Faerûn eventually travel to the island.</p><p>Evermeet is protected by many layers of defenses. First, it is magically warded to prevent navigators from finding the island. Winds and subtle currents turn ships aside, stars move in the sky, and powerful illusions hide the island itself.

Human travelers along the shores of Lake Lhespen often fall prey to bandits under yuan-ti domination and are carried back to a terrible fate in Lhesper—usually sacrifice to the yuan-ti’s evil god, but sometimes transformation into monstrous servitors to the serpent race. The Shaaryan give it a wide berth.</p><p><em><strong>Shaarmid.</strong></em> A free trading city populated mostly by human folk who claim no kinship with the Shaaryan nomads, Shaarmid is accepted by the tribes as a longtime ally because the city’s people have a history of brokering excellent deals for the nomads with the traders from the rest of Faerûn.

Similarly, active spells and areas imbued with magic are limned in a silvery network of threads, which might twist and reknit themselves depending on the magic involved. A magic item appears enmeshed in the silvery-blue threads of the Weave.</p><p><em><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong></em> The <em>Dispel Magic</em> spell unravels woven threads of the Weave.</p><p><em><strong>Antimagic.</strong></em> The <em>Antimagic Field</em> spell unravels magic woven from the Weave. While an otherwise-permanent effect is within an area of antimagic, the knots of the Weave untie, but the threads retie themselves once the magic is outside the antimagic effect.</p><p><em><strong>Dead Magic.</strong></em> In areas of dead magic, the Weave is absent. Not only do spells and magic items cease to function, but even the supernatural abilities of creatures that are innately tied to the Weave might fail as the knot of the Weave they carry with them unravels.</p><p><em><strong>Wild Magic.</strong></em> In an area of wild magic, the Weave becomes tangled, spontaneously forming its own magic.

Wild magic zones usually go unnoticed until they make some spell effect go awry. Some mages establish strongholds near wild magic zones. They chart the boundaries of the wild magic zone, lure enemies into it, and then take advantage of their foes’ confusion and weakness.</p><p>In other parts of Faerûn, however, the Weave has a tear or hole, resulting in a dead magic zone. Many were created where extreme concentrations of magical power were abruptly shattered or destroyed. The ruins of Myth Drannor, for example, boast large dead magic zones. Dead magic zones also might manifest at locations where Artifacts are destroyed or gods are slain, ripping a hole into the Weave.</p><p>The rules for dead magic and wild magic zones are in chapter 3 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>.</p>"

This system required many—sometimes hundreds—of spellcasters working in concert, and a single magical effect could take days or weeks to complete. But high magic was capable of incredible feats beyond the reach of ordinary spellcasters today. Elf high mages could heal hundreds of people at once, simultaneously create multiple magic items, restore large portions of forest, or destroy an entire city. The most famous examples of high magic are the raising of the island of Evermeet from the sea and the creation of mythals.</p><p>For ages, high magic was thought lost, its techniques supplanted by traditional spellcasting as the Weave settled into its current form. But some secrets of high magic have been preserved, though few living spellcasters retain this knowledge.</p><p>Examples of high magic can be found in chapter 1 of <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn</em>.</p>"

These creations are permanent fields of overlapping magical wards that bind and shape the Weave in a particular location. Mythals are sometimes so powerful that they bend or rewrite the rules of magic or even reality.</p><p>In its original usage, the term “mythal” referred to works of high magic that protected ancient elven cities, such as Myth Drannor. Its meaning has since expanded to cover all manner of similar protections, such as the magic keeping the immense floating cities of fallen Netheril afloat, the wards of Silverymoon, and the smaller workings of magic that keep safe important locations like Candlekeep. Some even consider the many-layered wards and effects of Undermountain beneath Waterdeep a mythal.</p><p>Most mythals restrict the kinds of magic that can be employed in the area they govern; for example, a mythal might restrict teleportation magic or spells of the Conjuration school. Evereska’s mythal influences the area’s weather and wards its inhabitants against disease, while the mythal of undersea Myth Nantar makes its waters breathable and more comfortable for creatures not suited to underwater life.</p><p>In many ways, a mythal is less like a spell or a magic item than a living creation of magic, capable of growing stronger or weaker, absorbing damage, or dying. Mythals can sometimes heal themselves, as did the mythal of Silverymoon, blossoming out of the Moonbridge following Mystra’s most recent return.</p><p>Each active mythal has one or more individuals especially attuned to it, and these individuals can ignore any restrictions on spellcasting, direct targetable effects of the mythal, and teach others of appropriate skill how to access its secrets.</p><p>Adventurers are most likely to encounter damaged or failing mythals in ruined locations where magic once had great influence. Although an <em>Identify</em> spell might reveal some of a mythal’s simplest effects, spellcasters can discover spellcasting restrictions only by trying (and failing) to cast a prohibited spell. A powerful spellcaster might learn how to access or repair a mythal without assistance, but such feats are rarely attempted by even the most renowned mages. Any elven city with “Myth” in its name (Myth Drannor, Myth Glaurach, Myth Nantar, and others) has or had a mythal. The ruins of such places often exhibit unpredictable effects related to their damaged or destroyed mythals.</p>"

When a caravan needs escorts, a noble needs bodyguards, or a city needs soldiers, the Zhentarim provides the best-trained fighting forces money can buy. If the cargo is shady or the cause is questionable, the Zhentarim doesn’t mind one bit—if there’s money to be made, Zhents will dabble in just about any venture.</p><p>Zhentarim agents consider themselves part of an extended family, and membership in the organization comes with the perks—and tension—that familial relations imply. Resources and security are shared among the organization, but the Zhentarim recognizes and rewards personal ambition, granting its members autonomy to pursue their own interests. In this way, the organization is a meritocracy; those who do well for themselves do well in the Zhentarim at large. But woe be to any whose personal aims conflict with the Zhentarim’s, for loyalists respond to treachery with fierce retribution.</p><p>The Zhentarim welcomes all whose primary motivator is money. This mindset has earned the organization a negative reputation among Faerûn’s other factions. Harpers in particular have historically clashed with Zhents, and members of the Lords’ Alliance and Order of the Gauntlet keep a close eye on the organization’s effects on Faerûnian politics.

According to Zhentarim doctrine, money left on the table benefits no one and only wastes precious resources. By this logic, the faction’s activities are altruistic. No laws are being broken, after all; the laws are simply being used to their fullest potential.</p><p>In actuality, the Zhentarim has its fingers in many illegal industries and unsavory ventures, ranging from racketeering, intimidation, and smuggling to grand larceny, assassinations, and warmongering. Zhentarim veterans may go deep undercover for months at a time, disrupting well-established local power structures, or leading task forces of lower-ranking agents into volatile situations.</p><p>In places where laws prove too restrictive for the Zhentarim to achieve its fiscal goals, it pulls strings to change those laws. In some parts of Faerûn, the Zhentarim effectively is<em> </em>the authority, having rewritten the legal code to suit its own ends. Such is the case in many districts of cities like Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate as well as the Zhentarim’s de facto headquarters in Darkhold.</p><p>The Zhentarim’s ultimate aims are unknown. The most common theory is the Zhentarim wants to monopolize trade protection and become the richest organization in Faerûn. If merchants were ever wholly reliant on Zhentarim transport, the Zhentarim would control commerce across the entire globe.

Presently the organization has no official affiliation with any god, but these deities still find many devotees among the Zhentarim. Bane’s ethos of domination over the weak is a natural complement to the ambitions of power-hungry Zhents, whereas Cyric’s cunning and ruthlessness are admirable traits in Zhentarim circles.</p><p>Nowadays, religious Zhents are more likely to consort with diabolic divinities than world-famous gods. The Lords of the Nine boast countless patrons who can advance a mortal’s social standing or wealth, and many Zhents beseech such powers. Some of the Zhentarim’s most popular infernal sponsors include Mammon (the Nine Hells’ principal miser), Fierna (coruler of Phlegethos with her father, Belial), and Glasya (Asmodeus’s daughter).</p>"
