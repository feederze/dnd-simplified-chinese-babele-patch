You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p><p>The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful [[/check ability=wis skill=prc dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against your spell save DC to notice.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose whether it’s an explosive rune or a spell glyph, as explained below.</p><p><strong>Set the Trigger.</strong> You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p><p>You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p><strong>Explosive Rune.</strong> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes a [[/save ability=dex dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 [[/damage (@item.level + 2)d8 type=acid]]{Acid}, [[/damage (@item.level + 2)d8 type=acid]]{Cold}, [[/damage (@item.level + 2)d8 type=acid]]{Fire}, [[/damage (@item.level + 2)d8 type=acid]]{Lightning}, or [[/damage (@item.level + 2)d8 type=acid]]{Thunder} damage (your choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong> You can store a prepared spell of level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.</p><p>When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The damage of an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the spell slot you use for the <em>Glyph of Warding</em>.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-S9SAlMniIN14fjKi\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>The <strong>Explosive Rune</strong> activity allows you to choose the damage type in the roll dialog.</p></section>",

    "Wish": {
      "name": "Wish",
      "description": "<p><em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p><p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</p><p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the <em>Greater Restoration</em> spell.</p><p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p><p><strong>Spell Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</p><p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.</p><p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</p><p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.</p><p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em> to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a [[/r 1d3cs1]]{33 percent chance} that you are unable to cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",
