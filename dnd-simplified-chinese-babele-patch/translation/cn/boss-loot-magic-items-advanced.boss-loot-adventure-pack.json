The central fountain gently trickles, providing a calming ambiance as the party goes about their business. There is no warning, no hint of danger until it's too late.</p><p>Without warning, a shadow looms over the square. Townsfolk glance up in confusion, their faces turning to horror as the sky above them darkens with the silhouette of massive wings. A roar reverberates through the streets, shaking windows and scattering birds. Panic grips the square as people scream and flee, dropping goods and overturning carts in their desperate scramble to escape.</p><p>Volcathar, consumed with rage, swoops down from the clouds. His wings create gusts of wind that scatter loose items across the square. The party, caught off guard, has only moments to react. Before they can even raise their weapons or cast their first spells, Volcathar releases a blast of fire from his maw, engulfing the nearest market stalls and setting the square ablaze.</p><p>The smell of burning wood and flesh fills the air. Volcathar lands with a crash in the middle of the square with his eyes fixed on the party.</p><blockquote><p>\"Did you think you could hide from me, mortals? Now, you will burn!\"</p></blockquote><h3>Dragon's Tactics</h3><p><strong>Surprise Attack from Above:</strong> Volcathar spots the party from the air and strikes without warning. His initial attack is a blast of flame to scatter and intimidate them, aiming to create chaos and separate the group.</p><p><strong>Targeting Vulnerable Party Members:</strong> Volcathar focuses on party members that are out in the open first. He will aim for spellcasters or healers, seeing them as a potential threat to his power.</p><p><strong>Flame Breath to Burn Buildings: </strong>If two or more adventurers enter a building to take cover, Volcathar will immediately shift his focus to that structure. He will unleash his breath upon the building, setting it ablaze with the intention of trapping or forcing the adventurers out. Everyone inside the building must make a Dexterity saving throw with advantage, taking only half damage on a success. In [[/roll 1d4]] rounds, the building collapses.</p><p><strong>Town Guards: </strong>If the town guard starts to gather, Volcathar may retreat to avoid an overwhelming counterattack.</p><p><strong>If the Party Flees:</strong> If most of the party flees, Volcathar laughs cruelly.</p><blockquote><p>“Flee, cowards! You can run all you want, but my flames will find you again!”</p></blockquote><p>He watches them scatter before setting a final building ablaze and soaring away into the sky, leaving the town square in ruins.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:center;font-weight:bold\"><strong>Lava Fall</strong></h2><img src=\"modules/boss-loot-magic-items-advanced/assets/006-adult-red-dragon/Lava_Fall_Clean_No_Grid.png\" /><p>This map can be used if the previous lair was destroyed by the party actions during their first encounter with Volcathar. Now, having tracked the dragon back to his domain, the adventurers find a dark, rocky plateau rising above a surrounding river of molten lava.</p><p>Furious at their daring intrusion, Volcathar prepares to make his final stand. This plateau is all that remains of his sanctuary, and seeing the adventurers invade it fills him with rage. Here, encircled by the river of lava, the dragon plans to fight to the death, determined to turn his enemies into ashes.</p>"

People are barring their doors and traveling only in groups, for those who venture out alone never return. Whispers of shadows in the night and an unnamed terror have seized the hearts of the villagers. Friends, family, and even passing travelers have mysteriously vanished without a trace, leaving the community gripped by dread as the disappearances continue.</p><p>A fanatical cult, hidden in the nearby mountains, is to blame for the disappearances. Led by Father Korvan, the cult worships a young red dragon named Volcathar the Flameborn. They believe that through worship and sacrificial offerings, can bind the dragon to their will. Unknown to them, Volkathar only pretends to be controlled, fully aware of the cultist’s intentions. Knowing that the ritual will transform him into an adult dragon, he tolerates the cult’s presence. A group of adventurers are hired to investigate the disappearances. Can they traverse the treacherous terrain, rescue the captives, and stop the cult before Volcathar's power becomes unstoppable?</p><p>The clock is ticking, and every step they take brings them closer to confronting a danger far greater than they could ever have imagined.</p>",

People are barring their doors and traveling only in groups, for those who venture out alone never return. Whispers of shadows in the night and an unnamed terror have seized the hearts of the villagers. Friends, family, and even passing travelers have mysteriously vanished without a trace, leaving the community gripped by dread as the disappearances continue.</p><p>A fanatical cult, hidden in the nearby mountains, is to blame for the disappearances. Led by <strong>Father Korvan</strong>, the cult worships a young red dragon named <strong>Volcathar the Flameborn</strong>. They believe that through worship and sacrificial offerings, they can bind the dragon to their will. Unknown to them, Volcathar only pretends to be controlled, fully aware of the cultists intentions. Knowing that the ritual will transform him into an adult dragon, he tolerates the cult’s presence.</p><p><strong>The Vow of the Burning Flesh</strong></p><p>The cult’s strictest commandment is the <strong>Vow of the Burning Flesh, </strong>an oath that forbids the use of weapons. Every initiate, with the help of their fellow cultists, must capture and offer a victim as part of their initiation. The cultists believe that true power comes from within and that weapons are for the weak, for only those who rely on their own strength are deemed worthy of channeling <strong>Volcathar’s</strong> flames. They aim to reflect the might of the dragon, who needs no mortal weapons to instill terror. At the heart of their combat style and ritual practice are the <strong>Bracers of Ignition</strong>, magical items crafted from Volcathar's scales. These bracers are gifted to each cultist after they take the Vow of the Burning Flesh. They see the flames that erupt from their bracers as a sign that the dragon’s magic flows through them.</p>"

The cultists, fanatical and aggressive, immediately attack, shouting:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Cultist</strong>: “You’ll be fuel for the ritual!”</p><p><strong>Cultist</strong>: “Burn in the name of the Flameborn!”</p></blockquote><h3><strong>If any cultist is still alive</strong></h3><p>The party can use <strong>Persuade DC 14</strong> to extract information.

Father Korvan and five cultists are preparing to throw prisoners into the vortex to fuel the ritual. Five other cultists stand guard. The young red dragon Volcathar circles in the center of the vortex, surrounded by flames, waiting for his transformation into an adult dragon to be completed.</p><h3><strong>Tactical Information</strong></h3><p>Every round, a cultist throws a prisoner into the vortex.The GM may choose to have Volcathar unleash his fire breath at this moment.</p><p>If 3 prisoners are sacrificed, the ritual will be complete, and Volcathar will transform into an adult dragon.</p><p>Once transformed, the adult dragon will fight for 1-2 rounds but weakened by the transformation, he retreats to his lair.</p><p>The party can attempt to stop the ritual by attacking, imobilizing or killing the cultists or the prisoners.</p><p>If the ritual fails, Volcathar will join the fight for 2 rounds before retreating to his lair weakened by the incomplete ritual.</p><p>Depending on the party's power level, the GM can adjust the timing of the sacrifices to 2 or 3 rounds between each prisoner being thrown into the vortex to maintain an appropriate level of challenge.</p><p>Volcathar canot engage the party until the ritual either succeeds or is disrupted.</p><p>The cultists are fanatically focused on their task of throwing prisoners into the vortex, and only if directly threatened will they stop their actions to defend themselves.</p><p>After the ritual is complete or intrerrupted, Korvan will fight but eventually will try to flee to the lair beleaving that the dragon is under his control.</p><h3><strong>Flavor Dialogue</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Father Korvan</strong> (in the middle of the ritual): \"Witness the flames that will birth a god!\"</p><p><strong>Father Korvan</strong> (in the middle of the ritual): \"Volcathar’s ascension is upon us!

His eyes gleam like molten gold within his skull-shaped head. He wears a crimson robe and a flowing cape, the color of dried blood, hangs from his shoulders.</p><h2>Actions</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Pyroblast.</strong> As an action, The Flame Tyrant can target a creature within 120ft that it can see. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 fire damage.

A creature that successfully saves is not affected by the vulnerability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flame Shield</strong>. As a bonus action, The Flame Tyrant creates a shield of fire around himself. Until the spell ends, any creature within 5 feet that hits him with a melee attack takes 1d8 fire damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Molten Resurgence (1/Long Rest). </strong>As a bonus action, the Flame Tyrant can submerge himself into a pool of lava or magma and regain hit points equal to half of his max current hit point total.</p></li></ol><h2>Legendary Actions</h2><p>The Flame Tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.</p></li><li><strong>Fire Tornado</strong>. The Flame Tyrant creates a tornado of fire in a 20ft radius, 30ft high cylinder centered on a point he can see within range. The inferno whips up the terrain, melting or burning the ground and filling the air with ash and embers. For the next minute, the area within the cylinder becomes difficult terrain.</li></ol><h2>Tactics</h2><ol><li><p>The Flame Tyrant will use his Fire Shield and Infernal Glide to deter close combat and maintain distance from the players.</p></li><li><p>He will use his helm ability Ember Gaze on wounded enemies.</p></li><li><p>When engaged in melee he will use Inferno Wave.</p></li><li><p>He targets players vulnerable to fire with Pyroblast.</p></li><li><p>He will cast Infernal Explosion, aiming to damage as many players as possible.</p></li><li><p>When his hit points are halved, he will utilize Molten Resurgence to heal.</p></li></ol><h2>The Flame Tyrant Quotes</h2><blockquote><ol><li><p>\"I am the Flame Tyrant, and my rule shall scorch the world's pages with tales of my glory!\"</p></li><li><p>\"Fire cleanses, purifies, and destroys. You think yourselves strong enough to command it? Let us test your resolve.\"</p></li><li><p>\"Extinguish my flames? Foolish mortals. My flames are eternal, as is my dominion over them. You will burn or bow.\"</p></li><li><p>\"Negotiate? There is but one negotiation: my will or your demise. What could you possibly offer that matches the power of fire?\"</p></li><li><p>\"My flames are eternal, my power unyielding. Bow or burn.\"</p></li><li><p>\"The inferno that courses through me cannot be tamed by mortals. I am a living testament to fire's supremacy.\"</p></li><li><p>\"Ah, the ants dare to challenge the Flame Tyrant himself. Your defiance shall be a testament to the power of the inferno!\"</p></li><li><p>\"Knowledge, you say? Power's true nature lies in wielding it, not in understanding it. But if you seek power, then face me and prove your worth.\"</p></li></ol></blockquote></div>"
