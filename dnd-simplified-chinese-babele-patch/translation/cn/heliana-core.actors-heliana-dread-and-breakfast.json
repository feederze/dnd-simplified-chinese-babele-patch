      "description": "<p>One of the rarest forms of mimic, tavern mimics are living structures that provide hospitality, benign or otherwise, in the remote wilds. These shapechanging buildings move using a variety of mechanisms: slug-like convulsions, millions of tiny cilia, or even hundreds of humanoid feet.</p><p><em><strong>Biomantic Origins.</strong></em> Tavern mimics occur when strong biomantic fields in the presence of a large structure, an unattached mind, and a mimic receive a sudden burst of magical energy. The most famous example is Jonjo Starr who, in attempting to create a lich phylactery in the biomantic laboratory of his half brother, Dr. Francis Norman Stein, accidentally fused himself to the building. Such creations are referred to as ‘mymilacteries’.</p><p><em><strong>Dark Contest.</strong></em> Tavern mimics often experience strong internal conflict. The basal, voracious appetite of the mimic desires only to consume and grow, while the mind with which it’s fused often has more complex desires. Not all tavern mimics are evil; some enjoy existence as a hub of activity, selling shelter and buying the produce on which they feed. Others aim to deceive travellers, giving into their core instincts and feeding on them as they sleep. Clever tavern mimics are selective and opportunistic predators, feeding only on strays and vagabonds who will not be missed.</p><p><em><strong>Lifecycle.</strong></em> Like all mimics, tavern mimics lay eggs. These baby mimics have a limited number of forms they can take, and often appear as a pile of gold coins. This coin form is, in fact, their dispersal strategy. Mixed into a traveller’s purse, a baby mimic can quickly find itself miles from home, and able to feed on the fingertips of consumers and pickpockets alike. Like the common cuckoo bird, a baby mimic will often push normal coins and other baby mimics out of a purse to ensure it is more likely to be spent.</p>",

These shapechanging buildings move using a variety of mechanisms: slug-like convulsions, millions of tiny cilia, or even hundreds of humanoid feet.</p><p><em><strong>Biomantic Origins.</strong></em> Tavern mimics occur when strong biomantic fields in the presence of a large structure, an unattached mind, and a mimic receive a sudden burst of magical energy. The most famous example is Jonjo Starr who, in attempting to create a lich phylactery in the biomantic laboratory of his half brother, Dr. Francis Norman Stein, accidentally fused himself to the building. Such creations are referred to as ‘mymilacteries’.</p><p><em><strong>Dark Contest.</strong></em> Tavern mimics often experience strong internal conflict. The basal, voracious appetite of the mimic desires only to consume and grow, while the mind with which it’s fused often has more complex desires. Not all tavern mimics are evil; some enjoy existence as a hub of activity, selling shelter and buying the produce on which they feed. Others aim to deceive travellers, giving into their core instincts and feeding on them as they sleep. Clever tavern mimics are selective and opportunistic predators, feeding only on strays and vagabonds who will not be missed.</p><p><em><strong>Lifecycle.</strong></em> Like all mimics, tavern mimics lay eggs. These baby mimics have a limited number of forms they can take, and often appear as a pile of gold coins. This coin form is, in fact, their dispersal strategy. Mixed into a traveller’s purse, a baby mimic can quickly find itself miles from home, and able to feed on the fingertips of consumers and pickpockets alike. Like the common cuckoo bird, a baby mimic will often push normal coins and other baby mimics out of a purse to ensure it is more likely to be spent.</p>",

These shapechanging buildings move using a variety of mechanisms: slug-like convulsions, millions of tiny cilia, or even hundreds of humanoid feet.</p><p><em><strong>Biomantic Origins.</strong></em> Tavern mimics occur when strong biomantic fields in the presence of a large structure, an unattached mind, and a mimic receive a sudden burst of magical energy. The most famous example is Jonjo Starr who, in attempting to create a lich phylactery in the biomantic laboratory of his half brother, Dr. Francis Norman Stein, accidentally fused himself to the building. Such creations are referred to as ‘mymilacteries’.</p><p><em><strong>Dark Contest.</strong></em> Tavern mimics often experience strong internal conflict. The basal, voracious appetite of the mimic desires only to consume and grow, while the mind with which it’s fused often has more complex desires. Not all tavern mimics are evil; some enjoy existence as a hub of activity, selling shelter and buying the produce on which they feed. Others aim to deceive travellers, giving into their core instincts and feeding on them as they sleep. Clever tavern mimics are selective and opportunistic predators, feeding only on strays and vagabonds who will not be missed.</p><p><em><strong>Lifecycle.</strong></em> Like all mimics, tavern mimics lay eggs. These baby mimics have a limited number of forms they can take, and often appear as a pile of gold coins. This coin form is, in fact, their dispersal strategy. Mixed into a traveller’s purse, a baby mimic can quickly find itself miles from home, and able to feed on the fingertips of consumers and pickpockets alike. Like the common cuckoo bird, a baby mimic will often push normal coins and other baby mimics out of a purse to ensure it is more likely to be spent.</p>",
