It is not considered to be a creature, does not occupy space, and does not require food, water, or air to exist. It is friendly toward you and other creatures you choose. It stays within 30 feet of you at all times and moves through objects as necessary in order to do so. If it’s unable to reach you, it disappears until summoned again. The companion wears a spectral copy of the band on its neck or limb when you summon it (your choice).</p>\n<p>The companion understands the emotion and intent of your commands, but cannot speak or understand language. Attempting to target the companion with a detect thoughts spell only reveals an overwhelming sense of love and affection for you.</p>\n<p>Once the same spectral companion has remained or has been summoned at least once a day for 7 consecutive days, the band and companion become permanently linked to you. When this happens, the band no longer requires you be attuned to it in order to use it, and no other creature can attune to it. Once the band is linked to you in this way, you can summon your linked companion using a bonus action instead of an action. In addition, once the band is linked to you, the companion becomes partially physical, allowing you and creatures you choose to be able to gently pet and hold its otherwise spectral form.</p>\n<p>If you die, the band can be attuned to by a different creature.

Believed by some to be a demigod of pocket dimensions and craftsmen everywhere, the griffon is a patron of artificers and creators across the multiverse. The griffon creates magical items in its great forge using materials collected from various planes of existence to add to its collection. While no one knows exactly how to contact the griffon, it has a knack for knowing what items are needed by whom.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Superior Holding.</strong></em> This 1-foot-wide bag always weighs 3 pounds, regardless of what’s inside it.

If doing so overloads the bag, random contents from either space are scattered in the Astral Plane.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Magic Courier.</strong></em> At the GM’s discretion, the saddlebag’s beak opens up to reveal a letter. The magical script can be read by all creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. The note is a delivery request or similar that includes the name of an item as well as either specific or vague descriptions of a person or place. At the bottom of the letter is a price listed in coins or other form of payment, as well as a date or time depending on its urgency.</p>\n<p>If the saddlebag is brought to the described person or place within the allotted time, it dispenses the magical item into the hand of the appropriate recipient. If the payment isn’t received by the bag within 1 hour of dispensing the magic item, the item vanishes and is lost. After receiving the payment for an item in this way, the bag’s beak reopens to dispense a reward for the courier.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sell Magic Items.</strong></em> The saddlebag has a connection to the griffon’s forge on the Astral Plane.

It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<p>The bag can speak, read, and understand Common. When in the presence of only creatures it trusts, the bag’s beak moves when it speaks. Otherwise, the bag communicates telepathically with its wearer. The bag can speak and communicate with griffons.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The bag’s purpose is to carry, collect, and deliver magic items. Different bags have different personalities, but they are for the most part largely pleasant to talk to. Their voices are bird-like and are filled with occasional coos and squawks, and their stitched eyes widen, squint, and move expressively.</p>\n<p>If the bag’s wearer or allies fail to fulfill Magic Courier quests, it may stop offering its magic to them. If it does, their items may be lost or inaccessible within the bag, or potentially spat out. While the bag provides the names of item recipients and delivery locations, it doesn’t know any more information than what was provided to it by the astral griffon. Regardless, it does its best to help its wearer and allies find the specified person or location on the letter.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Griffon’s Saddlebag. </strong></em>While there is no way to permanently destroy the saddlebag, piercing it with an artifact returns it to its place of origin for repair before it’s returned to the multiverse in a new location.

      "name": "Spire Seed",
      "description": "<p>This large tree seed is 1 foot long and surrounded by a protective cone. If you’re attuned to the seed and plant it and its cone in soil, it immediately takes root and begins to grow rapidly. It takes 1 month for the seed to fully grow. If you are dead for longer than 1 minute or are on a different plane of existence than the seed for more than 1 day while it grows, the tree dies and the seed is destroyed.</p>\n<p>The stem of the seed’s cone is vaguely key-shaped. When planted, the stem breaks off in your hand. While you’re attuned to the seed, the stem magically remains on your person at all times.</p>\n<p>Once fully grown, the <em>spire tree</em> is 300 feet tall with a 20-foot radius. It tapers gently inward towards the top of the tree. At the base of this magic tree is a door large enough for Medium creatures to enter. The door is guarded by a @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.Dryad]{dryad} who is loyal to you and any creature you choose. The dryad accepts the seed’s stem as proof of ownership and uses it as a key to open the door. Once opened, your attunement to the seed ends, the tree belongs to you, and both you and other allies you designate to the dryad can enter and leave the tree at will. Your attunement to the seed does not end if you are more than 100 feet away from it, and can only be ended early by a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Wish]{wish} spell. If it does, the key disintegrates and the door cannot be opened.</p>\n<p>Inside the tree are 10 floors. You choose how to distribute the floors throughout the tree. A wooden spiral staircase climbs upward through the center of the tree and floors. Each floor has 10 small windows that can’t be seen from outside the tree. In addition, the interior of the tree can’t be the target of divination magic or entered by teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.</p>\n<p>The canopy of the tree extends 30 feet beyond the base of the tree. Soil beneath the tree’s canopy is exceptionally rich and fertile.</p>\n<p>The tree has 500 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons that aren’t siege weapons, and resistance to siege weapons and all other damage. The door has 100 hit points. The tree regains [[/r 1d6 #Spire Seed - tree regains lost hit points]] lost hit points every day after taking damage. If a part of the tree, such as the door, is destroyed, a new one regrows after 7 days.</p>\n<p>If the tree is attacked, it immediately creates a @Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.Treant]{treant} at its base to defend it. Roll initiative for the treant, which has its own turns and does its best to defend the tree. Once a treant is created in this way, a new one can’t be created until the next dawn. A treant disappears after 24 hours, and there can only be one summoned treant at a time. Neither the treant nor the dryad can move farther than 1 mile from the tree. If the dryad is slain, it reappears the following dawn at the base of the tree. If you kill the dryad, the tree becomes a nonmagical tree that is still hollow inside with the floors you’d chosen, but its windows are lost.</p>\n<p>The tree creates another <em>spire seed</em> once every 100 years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flavour:</strong> <em>\"Back in the old days, every family had a tree like this. Only when man emerged, and with their merciless greed for land and resources stood at the edges of our homes, did we have to give them up.
