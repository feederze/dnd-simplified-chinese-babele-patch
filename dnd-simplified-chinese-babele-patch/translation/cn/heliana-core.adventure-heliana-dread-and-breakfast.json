      "description": "<p>Greetings, hunter! What you have here is a monster hunt from <em>Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting</em>. Heliana's hunts require your players to find the monster, picking up clues along the way, and then defeat it in an epic multi-wave boss battle. Be<strong> really obvious</strong> with the clues; make sure to give out the associated handouts. After the clues have been collected, but before the boss fight begins, the players should always have a chance to long rest and use what they've learned to prepare for the fight ahead.</p><p>This hunt makes full use of the Tracking, Harvesting, Crafting, and Cooking rules from Heliana's—be sure to read up on those! Using the Cooking rules to prepare magical meals is a great way the players can monopolise on the clues! Each of these Foundry Adventures comes with:</p><ul><li><p>PDF of the hunt.</p></li><li><p>Three clue handouts to be given to the players before they meet the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Handouts of the fantastical things the players might see along the way.</p></li><li><p>Walled and lit scenes, with each wave's monsters separated by level.</p></li><li><p>Actors with original tokens.</p></li><li><p>Lair actions given their own actor (be sure to put it at initiative count 20!).</p></li><li><p>Magic items that can be found during the hunt, as well as those that can be crafted from the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Spells that the monsters and magic items use.</p></li></ul><p>This adventure, Dread and Breakfast, is intended for 3 to 7 characters and is optimised for a party of 4 with an average party level (APL) of 3, 8, or 13. Characters who complete this adventure should earn enough experience to progress xxx of the way to 4th, 9th, or 14th level. The adventurers must find and end the menace causing a spate of disappearances within the Tanglepines, a shadowy, over-<br />grown forest.</p><p>After finding the gorey remains of several travellers and caravans, the party stumbles across a homely looking tavern. The tavern is, in fact, an enormous mimic: Dr. Stein’s unscrupulous half-brother, Jonjo Starr. After dealing with the resident mimics and being shrunk down to the size of a gold coin, the party must choose to either destroy the congealed, mimified remains of Jonjo Starr, or perform a ritual to summon Dr. Stein to clean up the mess.</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

A narrow area in this forested expanse, known as the Neck, is the shortest route between two nearby trading hubs. Though Dr. Stein’s experiments regularly escape his wizard’s tower, his magical wards around this trading route redirect his chimeric creations, keeping trade flowing and the local nobility happy. However, trade caravans have been going missing of late and rumours abound of a deadly creature: the Tanglepine Terror.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">Though everyone has heard of the infamous golemancer and progenitor of the school of biomancy, Dr. Francis Norman Stein, few are familiar with his half-brother, Jonjo Starr. Tired of relying on Stein’s magical artifice to extend his life, Jonjo decided to put his limited wizardly expertise to the test and pursue a path towards lichdom. While house-sitting in Stein’s wizard tower, Jonjo took the opportunity to create his phylactery using his favourite, perpetually-refilling amphora. Unfortunately, he confused a mimic with this vessel and the ritual went awry, dragging the biomancy-infused wizard tower into a maelstrom of magic.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">This bizarre combination of biomantically altered humanoid-mimic now roams the forest, feasting on unwitting travellers as a shapeshifting building: the Tanglepine Terror. Due to Jonjo’s shared genetic heritage with Stein, the Terror is immune to the doctor’s wards and has been preying on creatures in and around the Neck.</span></p><section class=\"sidebar right\"><h3><span class=\"None\">Future Hooks: Dr. Stein</span></h3><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Sidebar_Sidebar-Para-Last\"><span class=\"None\">Though not explored in this hunt, the inventions of Dr. Stein can be found plaguing many towns, regions, and biomes.

In addition, he asks for help in finding his half-brother and home, which he appears to have misplaced (his memory isn’t what it used to be). Unbeknownst to Stein, the two events are linked and the party will have a choice as to how the hunt concludes: can Jonjo be saved or must the menace be put down!?</span></p>"
