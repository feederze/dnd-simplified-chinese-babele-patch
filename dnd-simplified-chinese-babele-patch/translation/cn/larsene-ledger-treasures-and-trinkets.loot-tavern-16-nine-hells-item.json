However, after touching blood, its colour temporarily shifts to a red deeper than most rubies. For this reason, it's favoured among vampires as a reminder of when to feed.</p><p><em><strong>Blood Bond.</strong></em> When you damage a creature that has blood with this magic weapon, or it touches blood spilled from a creature less than 24 hours ago, the light pink crystals that make up its blade turn a deep, sanguine red as the weapon becomes bonded to the creature, which becomes its quarry. For the next 24 hours you can, as an action, toss the dagger in the air and speak its command word. For 6 seconds after, it hovers in the air, pointing in the direction of its quarry. If its quarry is on a different plane or is warded against divination magic, the dagger spins wistfully in the air. Once the dagger absorbs blood, it can't absorb another creature's blood until <strong>24 hours</strong> have passed and it returns to its normal pink colour.</p><p><em><strong>Finesse.</strong></em> When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Light.</strong></em> A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Thrown.</strong></em> If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p>",

The slightest trickle of crimson is enough for the pupils on this hellish weapon to dilate and for its eyes to appear wild and <i>bloodshot</i>.</p><p><i><b>Feed the Beast.</b></i> This weapon has <b>10 charges</b>. Over the course of a short or long rest, any creature can cause <i>bloodshot</i> to regain expended charges by dripping their own blood down its barrel and spending Hit Dice. Roll each Hit Die spent in this way, and the weapon regains a number of charges equal to the total. After absorbing 3 Hit Dice worth of blood, the weapon can't absorb more blood in this way until the next dawn.</p><p>Alternatively, over the course of a minute, you can extract blood from the corpse of a creature that has been dead for no longer than 10 minutes. When you do so, the weapon gains a number of charges equal to the roll of one of the dead creature's Hit Dice. After absorbing the blood from a corpse in this way, the weapon can't do so again until 1 hour has passed.</p><p><i><b>Shot Selection.</b></i> This weapon doesn't have the reload or ammunition properties.

If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.</p><p><i><b>Range.</b></i> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><i><b>Ammunition.</b></i> You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon.

This range is doubled in echoey locations, such as cave systems, and where sound travels faster, such as underwater.</p><p><i><b>Reload (X).</b></i> A limited number of shots, specified by the number in parentheses after the reload property, can be made with this weapon.

The slightest trickle of crimson is enough for the pupils on this hellish weapon to dilate and for its eyes to appear wild and <i>bloodshot</i>.</p><p>You gain a <b>+2 bonus</b> to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p><i><b>Feed the Beast.</b></i> This weapon has <b>10 charges</b>. Over the course of a short or long rest, any creature can cause <i>bloodshot</i> to regain expended charges by dripping their own blood down its barrel and spending Hit Dice. Roll each Hit Die spent in this way, and the weapon regains a number of charges equal to the total. After absorbing 3 Hit Dice worth of blood, the weapon can't absorb more blood in this way until the next dawn.</p><p>Alternatively, over the course of a minute, you can extract blood from the corpse of a creature that has been dead for no longer than 10 minutes. When you do so, the weapon gains a number of charges equal to the roll of one of the dead creature's Hit Dice. After absorbing the blood from a corpse in this way, the weapon can't do so again until 1 hour has passed.</p><p><i><b>Shot Selection.</b></i> This weapon doesn't have the reload or ammunition properties. Instead, in order to make a ranged weapon attack with it, you must spend charges in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li><p><span>Bloodshard (1 charge).</span> On a hit, the weapon deals its normal damage.</p></li><li><p><span>Septic Shock (3 charges).</span> On a hit, the weapon deals its normal damage and the target must succeed on a <b>DC 16 Constitution saving throw</b> or become <b><span id=\"was-tagged\">poisoned</span></b> until the end of its next turn as its blood becomes corrupted. A creature immune to disease automatically succeeds on this saving throw.</p></li></ul><p>A high-powered, short range firearm that deals [[/r 3d4]] piercing damage on a hit. It has the Ammunition (range 20/60), Loud (1000), Reload (1), and Two-handed properties.</p><p><i><b>Extra Reloads.</b></i> More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.</p><p><i><b>Range.</b></i> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><i><b>Ammunition.</b></i> You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p><p><i><b>Loud (X).</b></i> The sound of the weapon discharging alerts all hearing creatures within a number of feet as specified by the number in parentheses after the loud property. This range is doubled in echoey locations, such as cave systems, and where sound travels faster, such as underwater.</p><p><i><b>Reload (X).</b></i> A limited number of shots, specified by the number in parentheses after the reload property, can be made with this weapon. A character must then reload it using an action.</p><p><i><b>Two-Handed.</b></i> This weapon requires two hands to use.

A soul can be stored indefinitely, and time spent in captivity within the pendant doesn't count against the time limit of resurrection spells such as raise dead. A creature who is resurrected after its soul has been stored within the pendant must make a <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> or develop one long-term madness effect. The <strong>DC</strong> for the saving throw equals <strong>10</strong> + the number of days the soul was trapped in the pendant.</p><p><em><strong>Optional Attunement: Sellsoul.</strong></em> Upon attuning to this pendant, a devil, Eebezelbub, appears to you with an offer. She will trick souls you capture into following her to the Hells in exchange for granting you minor favours. If the pendant has a soul trapped in it, you can use an action to call Eebezelbub's name and permit her entry to the pendant. Roll a <strong>[[/r d6]]</strong>. On a <strong>1</strong>, the soul refuses Eeb's offer and drifts away, causing the miniature animal's eyes to slowly dim.
