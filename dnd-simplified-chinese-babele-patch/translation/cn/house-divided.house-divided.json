      "description": "<p><em>A House Divided</em> is an original adventure written and created by the Foundry Virtual Tabletop team. The adventure is designed specifically for Foundry Virtual Tabletop and leverages advanced features of the software to provide a unique storytelling experience. This comprehensive adventure for the 5th edition of the world's best-known role-playing game provides a party starting at 5th level with over 100 hours of gameplay, carrying them to level 10 by the story's conclusion. <span style=\"font-family:Signika,\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika,\">The adventure's non-linear narrative offers considerable replayability where no two parties will follow the exact same path.</span></span></p><p>This is a tale of gothic horror and familial drama. The adventure features immersive exploration and tactically challenging combat, but its primary gameplay emphasis is social interaction with a rich cast of nuanced characters. What choices will the party make within the halls of Raventree Estate? What allegiances will they forge and what betrayals will they commit? Will the heroes restore the manor to its former glory, release it from its torment, or seize its power for their own?</p><p>Our team is incredibly proud of <em>A House Divided</em>, we hope you and the players at your table will be amazed, thrilled, terrified, and delighted by the events which unfold within Raventree Estate.</p>",

Trapped between life and death. Lost amidst shadow and chaos.<br /><strong>A House Divided</strong>.</p>",

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered. Bandits have no boundaries of borders or locale, so caution should be taken whether you walk upon a forested road or sail the high seas as you island hop for fame. Danger lurks in every corner of our world adventurer, be prepared and discerning should you encounter a party of brigands lest your career end well before your legend is written.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to. and then contingency ends.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p>",

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered. Bandits have no boundaries of borders or locale, so caution should be taken whether you walk upon a forested road or sail the high seas as you island hop for fame. Danger lurks in every corner of our world adventurer, be prepared and discerning should you encounter a party of brigands lest your career end well before your legend is written.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>",

As a result, the family amassed a substantial shared library of arcane resources for all to use, and made a regular habit of teaching those with potential in the family.</p><p>The house would only achieve minor prominence for this trait, but this would be enough to secure it an alliance by marriage to the Annmatar mercantile family. With the marriage of the youngest members of the two families the Corvinarus house would finally gain a measure of true clout and renown, growing into a respected purveyor of magical knowledge and materials.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Young Love</h2><p>Betrothed in their thirteenth year, both Darius Corvinarus and Ylana Annmatar were quite at odds with each other in terms of personality, one a keen and studious academic in the making, the other a shrewd and daring negotiator at heart. Their families believed that their youth would allow them to grow together, and they were right. By the time the pair reached their twenties they had become a truly inseparable pair and were already taking steps to carve out positions of prominence in their family’s growing mercantile network.</p><p>In short order they built a new estate, filled it with books and servants, and quickly established a family with two children; Kryn and Elscieth. The eldest son, Kryn, was born with magical ability as a sorcerer, and over the years became a headstrong and ambitious man. Elscieth, their daughter, made up for her lack of magical ability with grace, charm, wit, and scholarly excellence. Both children would eventually integrate themselves into the Corvinarus-Annmatar mercantile network, achieving success and acclaim in their own ways.</p><p>Kryn would eventually marry a socialite and arcanist by the name of Vivesna Loumaal, who brought a child from a prior relationship by the name of Vaxillus Loumaal. Despite her charm and grace, a thread of pettiness and cruelty in her behavior ended up souring Darius and Ylana on their son’s new wife, a fact that ultimately drove a wedge between them and Kryn.</p><p>Elscieth too married, choosing a minor nobleman and politician as her beau. The pair bore a single child and lived quite happily away from the family, visiting Raventree estate as often as time would permit. They would maintain good standing with Darius and Ylana for many years. </p><h2 class=\"border\">Tragic Turns</h2><p>By their forties, with their children grown and gone, Ylana and Darius transformed their estate from a family home to an epicenter of culture and business. From the sprawling Raventree manor they routinely entertained dignitaries, supplies, and merchants, using it as a central place to woo potential clients and ink deals. However, Ylana fell ill one summer with a sickness that stayed with her well into the winter of that year, leaving her weak and bedridden. Local doctors could not find a cause or cure, and no specialists were available to attend her. By the next winter she had passed, robbing the Raventree manor of its spark. In her memory Darius constructed a memorial fountain, and promptly fell into a great bout of melancholy.</p><p>Darius eventually traded away much of his responsibilities to other associates and family members, becoming something of a recluse for several years. Eventually he would resurface, summoning his children back to his estate for a reunion, a Memorial Celebration of Ylana’s life. Darius proclaimed that at this event he would speak his final decision on who shall be heir to the family estate.</p><p>It was during this Memorial Celebration that the entirety of the Corvinarus family vanished leaving behind no bodies and no accounts of what transpired that fateful night. A factual but unrecorded account of what occurred is presented in the following chapter, @UUID[.nvlcD3Sxfw4wVAiG]{The Vanishing of Raventree}.</p>"

This was him, as his elder sister had never shown any aptitude for magic despite their pedigree.</p><p>After the death of his mother this certainty was becoming progressively weaker, as his father chose to hand off most of the greater contracts and assets to reduce his stake in the family business. This alone was a blow that set Kryn’s plans by a decade or more, but if nothing else he knew that one day he would inherit the Raventree manor, sooner than later it seemed, given how his father’s vigor had waned after his mother’s death.</p><p>This sense of security was broken by two events that occurred in late autumn family gathering: his wife Vivesna made a damning discovery, and his sister Elscieth revealed a vexing development. Both would become key catalysts for the events that would unfold in the Raventree manor that autumn.</p><h2 class=\"border\">A Duel of Spouses</h2><p>Some years into Kryn's marraige to Vivesna, and after a particularly quarrelsome family dinner, Ylana did some investigation into Vivesna's history and family. Kryn's wife had an odd way about her, was generally unsavory, came in-tow with a bastard son, and yet she acted with the imperious air of nobility.</p><p>Ylana used her connections to uncover that Vivesna was far older than she claimed and was, in fact, the deposed queen of an old and now-defunct kingdom. Ylana shared these revelations with Darius who was concerned, but chose not to act immediately. The family would monitor the situation and develop a better understanding of Vivesna's motives.</p><p>Vivesna, cunning and adroit in matters of political duplicity, caught wind of Ylana's investigation. She discovered letters while snooping around Raventree Estate which revealed that Ylana was aware of her identity. A cruel and powerful sorceress in her own right, Vivesna resolved to murder Ylana to protect her station and spousal claim to the estate.</p><p>Vivesna plotted for weeks, eventually enacting a vile curse which would cause Ylana to wither and die, culminating in her very soul being entrapped within a profaned @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ej6wyY4G1gOcb1U6]{Magic Jar}, subverted to form a prison. Ylana's death and subsequent imprisonment prevented her from being communicated with, resurrected, or otherwise returned as vengeful undead. A tidy solution, from Vivesna's point of view.</p><p>Overcome by grief and incapable of overseeing familial matters Darius retreated within himself and withdrew into bitter isolation.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Darius' Ambition</h2><p>For much of his life, Darius invested himself deeply into study of matters arcane and occult. By his later years as patriarch of the Corvinarus family and master of Raventree Manor, Darius had attained capabilities of a powerful magus.</p><p>Before its fall into ruin the estate featured many of the amenities that an archmage would require, however, as Darius delved ever deeper into esoteric rituals certain requirements were better served within the confines of an private sanctum of his own creation. Darius honed his arcane technique for many years to master the creation of a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pn4SnsFDvYDiE6rC]{Magnificent Mansion} - allowing him to conjure an extraplanar lair which satisfied any design or functional requirement that suited Darius' needs.</p><p>Darius grew more aloof as he aged - increasingly so after the later described passing of his wife Ylana - he began spending more of his time within his Sanctum. Away from the distractions of life, Darius toiled single-mindedly on strange projects, neglecting his station as lord of the manor and eschewing his responsibility as father to his children.</p><p>Darius arranged for a powerful Cleric to visit Raventree Estate in order to resurrect Ylana. The shocking failure of this costly ritual confirmed the terror that haunted Darius' dreams. Ylana's soul was not at rest. Recalling Ylana's revelations and suspicions about Vivesna, Darius levied his arcane talents to scry upon Vivesna and discern the truth of her actions.</p><p>His discovery of Vivesna's murder awakened within Darius a hunger for vengeance which was previously anathema to his studious and objective demeanor, and so he hatched a plan by which to accomplish his revenge, cast down his profligate children, and restore Ylana to his side.</p><p>In an unexpected display of magnanimity and extroversion, Darius extended invitation to his family, friends, acquaintances, and business partners. There was to be a grand celebration at Raventree Estate, a Remembrance Celebration for Ylana to commemorate her life and - at last - mourn her passing.</p><p>For the months leading up to night of the Remembrance Celebration, Darius toiled with unique focus on his own efforts to attain unnatural longevity by completing the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.h830iyqParFleNqR]{Clone} ritual to transfer his soul and consciousness into a rejuvenated body. To accomplish this task, Darius provisioned his Planar Sanctum to suit the specific needs of fashioning a viable clone. The many chambers and alcoves of the Planar Sanctum each served some purpose in this task.</p><p>Darius plotted to use the platform of the Remembrance Celebration to unmask Vivesna as Ylana's murderer and to provoke Kryn into taking action against him. Darius' death would trigger his secret return as his crafted Clone. He would use the anonymity of death to take action against his unsuspecting family. He would seek out Vivesna's allies, discover the location of the phylactery which imprisoned Ylana's soul, and wreak his final vengeance while restoring Ylana to life.</p><p>Should all other efforts fail, Darius could use his extended lifespan to further deepen his mastery of the arcane until attaining sufficient mastery of the arcane to @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} that Ylana's soul be freed of its cursed imprisonment.</p><h2 class=\"border\">A Damning Discovery</h2><p>For many years, the only souls to know of Darius' secret sanctum were Ylana and the family's loyal butler Usk.</p><p>During Vivesna's espionage into Ylana's affairs she came to discover the concealed gateway of the Planar Sanctum in the Lord's bedchamber. Vivesna deduced the gateway's purpose by its magical signature and warded entrance. Realizing what she had found she determined to gain access and discover what schemes Darius hatched within.</p><p>After months of careful study and secret observation of Darius' comings and goings, Vivesna learned the combination of glyphs used to unlock the magical ward and reveal the Planar Sanctum's gateway. She rushed to Kryn and convinced him of the urgent need to learn the truth of his father's secret affairs. Together, Vivesna and Kryn breached the Planar Sanctum when Darius was otherwise occupied with household concerns.</p><p>The discovery of a vast collection of materials, potent reagents, and esoteric texts enraged Kryn. Darius had accumulated such wealth and power and shared none of it with his eldest son. Beyond the treasure contained in the Sanctum - a darker discovery awaited. Upon its central platform stood a clockwork tank of inscrutable origin. An intricate machinery of metal and glass, the vessel contained a lifelike replica of Darius Corvinarus, youthful and hale. A means for his father to cheat death. Kryn realized that his father would never yield his inheritance.</p><p>Vivesna was all to eager to stoke the flames of jealousy and bitterness within Kryn - and she proposed a devious plan. Sabotage the clone vessel and its arcane glyphs, causing the body to be corrupted by the volatile energies of the Planar Sanctum. When Darius would perish and transact his soul into the Clone, it would offer him no suitable refuge and he would suffer a true death. Kryn and Vivesna would claim the estate and the treasures it contained.</p><p>Blinded by anger and the encouraged by Vivesna's manipulation, Kryn agreed and upon the eve of the Remembrance Celebration they set to work, aided by a distraction caused by Vivensa's son Vaxillus, subtly altering and sabotaging his father's ritual.</p><p>They planned at dinner to make a show of dismissing an unruly Vaxillus who would steal away into the Planar Sanctum and wait for the fateful moment of Darius' demise - a failsafe to ensure that the patriarch would attain no resurrection.</p><h2 class=\"border\">In Memorium</h2><p>The Remembrance Celebration was an event the grandeur of which had not graced the halls of Raventree Estate for a generation. Distant relations, friends, associates, and dignitaries traveled from surrounding regions to attend the soirée.</p><p>Upon her arrival at the family gathering Elscieth, who was in attendance without her husband Bartram who remained home with their daughter Byscilla, made a great show of demonstrating her precocious magical talents to the staff and other guests, making sure that by the end of the first day it was a central topic at dinner in front of Darius. Kryn realized that this was an attempt by Elscieth to position herself as the more suitable heir in their father's eyes.</p><p>The ceremony itself was painfully awkward - the pleasantries spoken about Ylana as a mother, wife, and friend seemed performative and incongruent with Darius' impassive expression. It was not for the memorial service that guests harkened from far and wide, however. After dinner there was a manificent feast, dancing, revelry, and merriment. The guest bedrooms of Raventree Manor were filled to the brim with aristocratic partygoers.</p><p>Seated at the head of the great banquet table, Darius surveyed his guests and family and vowed to enact his plan. He rose to toast the future of House Corvinarus and urged his children Kryn and Elscieth to give speeches about how they would best magnify its legacy. As Darius knew it would, what started as self-glorifying proclamations quickly turned to heated barbs hurled across the table. Darius stood to render his judgment and demurely proclaimed that clearly neither of his offspring were suitable to assume the responsibility. Darius smiled and announced that ownership of Raventree Estate and the legacy of House Corvinarus would pass to someone who was a true and loyal friend, the butler Usk.</p><p>Whether Darius intended this to be his will or whether he simply sought to provoke the deadly alteraction which followed, he knew what would ensue. Like dropping a torch into a pile of bone-dry kindling the great dining hall of Raventree Estate quickly turned to violence.</p><p>The ensuing conflagration of four powerful mages hurling evocations towards each other obliterated many of the unsuspecting guests at the table. As the flames of arcane immolation surrounded Darius he smiled, believing this to be a momentary pain from which he would emerge victorious.</p><h2 class=\"border\">A House Divided</h2><p>The violence which erupted the night of Ylana's Remembrance celebration triggered a cataclysmic sequence of events which cemented the fall of House Corvinarus.</p><p>When Darius met a fiery end at the hands of his children, instead of failing his spellcraft was preserved by the countervailing binding Darius had enacted within his Planar Sanctum. The harnessed shadow and fey energy offset and balanced each other - holding the sanctum and its contained ritual magic in stasis. Darius dying body was shunted into his Sanctum, recalled by the spiritual tether of his Clone.</p><p>In this moment of his planned death and triumphant return, Darius beheld and understood the full extent of his children's duplicity. The Clone which he had immaculately prepared as the vessel for his ascension was sabotaged. The arcane glyphs which protected it from the violent planar energy which coursed through the sanctum were corrupted and broken. What was left was an abomination - inchoate, twisted, and perverse.</p><p>Darius beheld the sadistic smile of Vivesna's son Vaxillus watching his struggle. Darius was cornered, outmaneuvered by his feckless offspring. He faced a terrible choice: allow his consciousness to pass into the mindless abomination, accept defeat and succumb to an irrevocable death, or bind himself to the planar tether of the sanctum refusing either path. In his anger, bitterness, and rage Darius chose an eternity of torment. His Sanctum shattering around him, his malformed clone an unworthy vessel, and his children reveling in their patricide. It could not pass.</p><p>With resigned determination, Darius seized the torrents of shadow and fey energy coursing through the sanctum. Wielding chains of shadow and vines of chaos he bound himself. He channeled dark energy which ripped through Vaxillus banishing him into ether. Allowing himself to be overwhelmed by the power in his grasp, he channeled the entirety of his vehemence into a sundering which scissioned the Raventree Manor into triplicate fragments. With obdurate shadow energy he pulled the manor into darkness. With tumultuous fey energy he hurled the manor into chaos.</p><p>Those who attended Ylana's Remembrance and survived the carnage of the dining hall were ripped free of material reality, regardless of whether they were complicit or not. Many souls were destroyed but those possessing a stronger force of will grasped to tethers of planar energy like drowning sailors clinging desperately to rope. These survivors rode the current of torrential energy and were swept away.</p><p>Having sundered the manor into splintered facsimiles, Replete with energy well beyond his own mortal limits, Darius concluded his judgment by sealing the breach. He wove torrents of planar energy into an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ZVnL9L8v1KC9TBF4]{Imprisonment} which doomed the Shadeward and Feyward manors to become inescapable demi-planes. None who partook in his betrayal would leave their prisons while Darius' binding yet held.</p><p>Committed to his path, Darius embraced the opposed torrents of energy which enveloped him. Darius became imprisoned, bound by constricting change and wreathed in vicious thorns, frozen in the epicenter of his Planar Sanctum, lost amidst shadow and chaos, trapped between life and death.</p><p>Thus was <em>A House Divided</em>.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Aftermath</h2><p>Raventree Manor and its surrounding estate now exists in three divergent realities, each with its own history, inhabitants, and unique environment.</p><p>In the Material plane, @UUID[JournalEntry.x9xlmkKYSp1PEYAf]{The Ruined Manor} is a forlorn and neglected place where lost spirits and cursed undead roam abandoned halls. No living souls remain here save foolhardy scavengers which dare to plunder the cursed manor.</p><p>In the Shadowfell, @UUID[JournalEntry.K9oTVoVEUPWHM45k]{The Shadeward Manor} is a domain of dread where Kryn and Vivesna have instituted a harsh order, maintained by exploited souls and perpetuated by servants equally cruel.</p><p>In the Fey realms, @UUID[JournalEntry.Kr7jDRSSoh9h54FH]{The Feyward Manor} is an enchanted domain where Elscieth presides ruling jointly with the archfey Lord Chirneros. Beneath the light and mirth, the manor has become a dangerous and bewitching revel.</p><p>The loyal butler Usk, to whom Raventree Manor was so unexpectedly promised, suffered perhaps the cruelest fate of all. The sundering of the manor bound him not to one division but rather to all. His spirit fractured, a facet of his personality bound to each variant domain. In ruin he roams as an aimless spirit without family to serve, in shadow he faithfully serves a cruel lord, and in fey he struggles to impose rationality upon a realm of chaos.</p><p>In his Shattered Sanctum, Darius writhes in eternal torment, unable to escape and unwilling to let go.</p>"

Local legends state that the curse of the estate can be broken, but the means varies wildly between sources, and may or may not include any of the following:</p><ul><li>Spend the night in the manor, and by dawn you’ll become the new owner of the manor!</li><li>Cleanse each room with a whole vial of holy water, and when the last room is done, the ghosts will depart.</li><li>Help each of the ghosts finish their business so that they can move on to the afterlife.</li><li>Surround the manor, all its thresholds and window sills with salt, then invoke a divine power. </li><li>Travel to the heart of the hedge maze on the grounds, and there you’ll find the source of power anchoring the ghosts.</li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Deadly Stalkers</h2><p>Rumor is that anyone trying to sleep overnight in the old estate, whether that be in or outside the house, will be murdered in their sleep! Worse still, if you die on the grounds, your soul ends up trapped there forever, unable to escape! Of course, nobody recently has been up there so nobody has any idea if it’s true, but some older folks in the town can confirm that folk went missing up around there in years prior.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Portal to Hell</h2><p>Rumors are that demons reside in the house, or that there is a portal to hell itself somewhere in the deepest pit of the manor undercroft. More than one greedy soul has traveled up there, braving ghosts and demons hoping to trade away their souls for riches, fame or success. Unsurprisingly, none have ever come back from these jaunts.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Giant Spiders</h2><p>Rumors from local scouts, foragers and hunters are that the huge old tree at the back of the estate is home to hundreds of giant spiders, some large enough to take down men with a single bite, and that they’ve seen man-shaped forms hanging from the tree, wrapped in webs.

In its heyday it was a regal structure of sandy white stone and pristine glass. Its grounds were carefully manicured and hemmed in by a forest which had provided the house all of the lumber it needed for its floors and furniture.</p><p>It stood for nearly forty years, serving as a home to a family and a vast staff of servants. After the children grew up and left it still would serve as a center for hosting dignitaries and events in the region for years to follow. This was until a fateful winter came to pass when Lady Corvinarus fell deathly ill. With the roads snowed over there was no easy way to get help, and the woman died. From this moment on the majority of the Raventree manor staff were let go, and the only visitors to arrive with regularity were Darius’ children.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Abandonment</h2><p>The Raventree manor would soon fade into obscurity, until eventually no one was seen going to or coming from the manor.

His greatest power is his ability to win over his foes, maneuvering around them without causing alarm until it’s too late to stop him.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cruel.</strong> Kryn is not above cutting words, punitive tasks, and openly admonishing those he considers to be under him to put them in their proper place. His retribution is not always swift, however, as he knows letting a victim become complacent makes the attack hurt more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intelligent.</strong> Kryn possesses a sharp mind which he uses to turn situations to his advantage. He fancies himself a scholar like his father, and has amassed a large collection of rare books and tomes to grant himself greater clout as an academic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selfish.</strong> There is little that Kryn cares for more than himself, despite the best efforts of his parents. He is an arrogant and selfish man whose every action is bent toward serving his schemes and desires. The only person he has ever shown any consideration for is his wife Vivesna.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wary.</strong> Borderline paranoid, Kryn trusts almost nobody in his life and is always on the lookout for schemes and plots against him, no matter how small or subtle. </p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>The second child of Darius and Ylana Corvinarus, Kryn grew up in the shadow of his older sister Elscieth who seemed to receive more respect from their parents. Though this was due to her age, Kryn developed a chip on his shoulder over this which persisted until he first produced magical energy, revealing that he was a natural born sorcerer. From this moment onward Kryn became the favored child, and relished every moment of importance and preference, often lording it over his older sibling. This would ultimately create a rift between them.</p><p>Growing up, Kryn was a cocky student who didn’t study half as hard as he should have, and simply breezed through his assignments. By the time he was old enough for academy he had his pick of academic and arcane schools, and opted to attend a mundane university where he would be able to use his magic to his advantage. By the time he returned home he had collected a small retinue of lackeys and sycophants to be used for his greater ambitions.</p><p>In adulthood Kryn threw himself into the family business of trading spellcasting materials and arcane insights into troubles. He was not as well-loved in this endeavor as he was in university, largely because his selfish cruelty was at odds with the generally honorable and outgoing nature of Corvinarus' work to date. Despite the bad taste he left clients with, Kryn proved a very effective member of the trade family, making a small fortune for himself.</p><p>It was during this time as a magical purveyor that he met and fell madly in love with the stunning socialite Vivesna Loumaal, becoming inseparable from her almost as soon as they met. The pair married within a year of meeting, much to the chagrin of the rest of Kryn’s family, who found Vivesma even more cruel and distasteful than their own son. This was not lost on Kryn, who took every chance he got to point out that his parents disliked his wife, and used this to guilt and manipulate his parents, albeit not as successfully as he would have hoped.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul class=\"opinions\"><li><p><strong>Darius Corvinarus. </strong>“Rest in peace, dear father.

Vivesna makes flawless first impressions, and it might take several meetings to begin to detect the hidden barbs hidden behind her courteous manner. She is keenly aware of more than she ever lets on, and twists everything toward her own desires for power and control.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Traits</h3><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#discerning-traits]{Discerning Traits} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p>Vivesna has the following personality traits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Vanity</strong>. For decades, Vivesna’s sole focus has been the preservation of her youth. With the shattering of the manor, this pursuit has turned to desperation, and she takes out her frustrations at her lack of progress on the manor’s staff, demanding nothing less than perfection in all things. In truth, she is terrified of aging, and despises the ugly and the infirm, seeing them as reminders of her own fragility. Conversely, she is eager to surround herself with beautiful things- although her unique definition of the concept might mean her efforts are lost on others. It’s to this end that she befriended the medusa Lyranth, whose ability to freeze a subject in time and protect it from the ravages of age or disease has fascinated her ever since their first meeting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cruel</strong>. Though she is too tactful to admit it, Vivesna derives great enjoyment from tormenting others. She sees physical torture as crude, preferring psychological trauma caused by exploit the weaknesses of others. During academy and later in her court she would engineer dramatic breakdowns to thoroughly ruin the reputations of rivals and annoyances. Now, consigned to the manor, she must rely on Lyranth to create grotesque sculptures of suffering and agony to amuse her, as she has no court to torment, and is wholly focused on reconstructing her ritual magic to restore her youth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conniving</strong>. Especially cunning, Vivesna prefers to thoroughly plan out her actions, striving to understand the people around her to better manipulate and use them to her own advantage. She prefers to avoid direct confrontation when possible, letting others fight her battles for her, unless she knows she can do it better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Graceful</strong>. Vivesna is a former dancer and veteran of noble courts, and her decaying health has not yet robbed her of her. Being stranded in the Shadeward manor has not eroded her social skills, but it has denied her the opportunity to use them, so any opportunity to revisit the niceties of her rich education in etiquette and manners is a welcome one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Socialite. </strong>There is little Vivesna enjoys more than social politicking. She craves social stimulation and association with others, no matter how sycophantic they may be. Twenty years of absence from high society have made her starved for conversation and socialization, the ability to manipulate and lead a crowd. She greatly misses having a clique.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>The Loumaal family itself was never one of great note, largely just a collection of career courtiers and hangers-on who subsisted on the patronage of others. Vivesna grew up constantly pitted against siblings and cousins,  in a family where one’s worth was determined solely by how much prestige one brought to the family name. </p><p>Hoping to give their daughter the best chance to succeed, Vivesna’s parents sent her to a prestigious magic academy where she became a highly competent wizard, favoring one teacher in particular, a dark elven wizard who loved to regale his classes with stories from homelands shrouded in mystery and darkness. Vivesna became smitten with this man, but failed to secure a mentorship with him despite her best efforts. </p><p>After the academy Vivesna found herself acting as court wizard to a small and inconsequential land. Enduring the jeers and mockery of her family, she quickly charmed the court and had them eating out of her hand. Within a decade she had deposed the old king, installed his son on the throne and sat at his side as the land’s new queen.</p><p>For many years after this life was good, and Vivesna integrated her family into her kingdom, solidifying her influence over both. Unfortunately, old age inevitably claimed her husband, and Vivesna soon found herself replaced by a younger male heir. Aged, dejected, and incensed, she began seeking solutions to restore her power, but younger generations of the Loumaal family had been working to declaw her further, leaving her without resources.</p><p>Fortuitously, a familiar face from her past reappeared: her old mentor, still as young and dashing as he was when she was young. Vivesna learned that the wizard had long retired from the academy and was studying exotic magic across the planes. Realizing Vivesna was in a desperate spot he made her a proposition: Provide him a child, and in return he would give her the secrets of endless youth. Seeing only potential to recover what she lost, and being unconcerned about what this elven wizard could want with a child, she agreed.</p><p>In the company of her mentor she was given access to rituals that turned back time and made her vibrantly young again, and though the deal was youth for offspring, Vivesna relished traveling and studying beside her old mentor for a time. Months later, much to Vivesna’s shock, she bore twin boys! Her mentor turned lover only required one child for what was to come, and as such allowed her to keep the other, whom she named Vaxillus. Their deal completed, the shadowy elf bid farewell to Vivesna, and vanished into the night. With the knowledge of endless youth and a newborn child, she spent the next many years watching her kingdom from afar, preparing for her return to power, while also doing her best to raise her son.</p><p>It was during this time she met Kryn, and learned of the Corvinarus family. Seeing potential in them she set out to marry herself into the family and find a way to use them as her means of reclaiming control over the kingdom and family that cast her aside.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul class=\"opinions\"><li><p><strong>Darius Corvinarus</strong>. “For that I heard of this good man, in the end he was as selfish and cruel as any other. His death was overdue.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Ylana Corvinarus</strong>. “She was ever my critic, ever a ball and chain around my beloved Kryn’s neck. It is good she is gone.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Elscieth Corvinarus</strong>. “A mewling and hapless little woman with no ambitions, she does not deserve half of what she has.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Byscilla Corvinarus</strong>. “I am frankly shocked that Elscieth could find a man that could stand her presence long enough to give her a child. I am sure she will turn out just as painfully irrelevant as her mother.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Usk the Butler.</strong> “He does not like me, and that is a pity as I find him quite fetching. I will enjoy his presence for as long as Kryn permits it, which I suspect won’t be long given how unsteady he has become.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Vostolas the Librarian</strong>. “I dislike the presence of this devil, it is not often I have to compete with another for someone’s attention, and he has quite an unfair advantage when it comes to Kryn. Worse, I dislike how he looks through me.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Lyranth the Sculptor</strong>. “My darling pet, her creations are each beautiful and unique. She owes everything to me, and I am glad she does not forget that fact.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Tymnas the Groundskeeper</strong>. “Looking upon the moping groundskeeper depressed me, but I cannot argue his effectiveness.” </p></li><li><p><strong>Vaxillus Loumaal</strong>. “My beautiful gem, he is my greatest accomplishment in this life and there is nothing I would not do for him. It troubles me greatly that he and Kryn cannot get along. I hope that in time they will be able to see eye to eye.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Kryn Corvinarus</strong>. “My beloved lord, he is my savior and greatest champion. I owe so much to him that I am sure I could not repay him even if we live a dozen lives. He supports me in every endeavor and worries only for my happiness. I could not ask for more.”</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Insights</h3><p>Vivesna has insight into the following aspects of the world and story:</p><ul><li><p><strong>What happened at the manor? (Approval 6 or higher)</strong> Truly tragic. A story I've seen before— it is a disgusting abuse of power to see a Lord disinherit his son out of a perceived slight. Kryn, with the bearing of a proper lord himself, could hardly be blamed for refusing to simply allow his father to take everything he had earned. What could I do but stand beside him and support him? We couldn't have known the fight would result in this imprisonment.</p></li><li><p><strong>What happened to Darius?</strong> Kryn believes he may still live— but it's not possible. During dinner, when everything happened, there is no way he survived. </p></li><li><p><strong>Why does she wear a mask? (Approval 8 or higher)</strong> Vivesna notes that once she had extensive rituals to maintain her appearance, but did not keep them with her since it was only necessary to use them every year or so. So this meant that she did not have them when they were thrown into the Shadeward Manor.</p><p>She has had scouts go searching her and Kryn’s home for the ritual materials but that has yielded nothing, and she’s attempting to recreate the rituals herself, but the progress is slow. So she is left to watch herself aging day by day. The mask is a small comfort from that shock.</p></li><li><p><strong>What happened to Ylana?</strong> A true tragedy, such a fine mother and caring woman, taken by a mysterious illness that nobody could identify or cure. It's a shame it took her so quickly, there was barely time for goodbyes, let alone proper medical and magical treatment. I think her death drove poor Darius mad.</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">About Ylana and her Soul</h3><p><strong>Warning: </strong>This is a very dangerous line of questioning. This directly addresses her murder of Ylana Corvinarus, which she had thought she sufficiently covered up. If it's asked before the party has Approval 10 it's playing with fire and likely to get them into very deep trouble with Vivesna.</p><p>It's also possible to Intimidate this knowledge out of her, or compel it from her via one of numerous spells, such as Zone of Truth, Detect Thoughts, Charm or Dominate Person/Monster, and similar. Items with lie detecting abilities might also be helpful here. However Vivesna will not respond well to being magically manipulated.</p><p>This knowledge ties into a secret conclusion option found in @UUID[JournalEntry.Am8HvuLkr7XcOFYx].</p><p><strong>If Vivesna's approval is under 5</strong> she turns cold and hostile, and will summon guards to throw the party out in response to any of these questions. Unless they party has a higher approval rating with Kryn, this will result in them being kicked out the front gates, or by a portal if such a means is open. If the party returns after this, the guards will be hostile.</p><p><strong>If Vivesna's approval is higher than 5 but less than 10</strong> she will deny any knowledge of the topic, and endeavor to change the subject. If pressed she will feign insult and ask the party to leave her alone and never bring up such things again. If the party continues asking about this, each instance results in tiny approval losses until he loses her temper.</p><p><strong>If Vivesna's approval is 10</strong>, she will share the information listed with each of the topics below, confiding in those she considers to be her friends, whether they truly or or not.</p><ul><li><p><strong>What did you do to Ylana?</strong> I infected her with a virulent poison to weaken her, and a specially made disease which, while not transmissible, was also incurable. They were necromantic creations I had sitting about at the time. Sadly I don't have them any longer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why did you kill Ylana?</strong> Well, Ylana was a nosy, meddling sort who learned dangerous secrets about me, secrets I was willing to kill for, and did.</p></li><li><p><strong>What secrets did she learn?</strong> Please, I like you, but not that much.</p></li><li><p><strong>What did you do with Ylana's soul? </strong>When she died I spirited her soul away into a necromancer's jar so she couldn't be resurrected. The best part was that the jar was already primed with a bit of her blood, so I didn't even have to be nearby when she finally met her end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Where did you hide Ylana' soul?</strong> Oh, I passed it on to some allies of mine for safekeeping, it's in a safehouse in a city several months away from here. Though that was some twenty years ago, I'm not sure if they are my allies anymore, or if they even have the soul jar, for that matter if they're even alive—but that hardly matters. Once I get out I can start rebuilding all of that.</p></li></ul>"

Given her self-critical attitude, even a compliment could offend or even anger her if it was not phrased with extraordinary tact.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=prc dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Perception)} </strong>Lyranth is often preoccupied with the paint on her skin, perpetually dabbing at it, checking coverage, and fussing with trying to adjust the way colors blend to suit her better. She fusses with her appearance regularly, but for all that seems undisturbed by how often she is covered in stone dust and grime.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=arc dc=16 passive=true]]{Intelligence (Arcana)} </strong>Medusa are most commonly the product of curses or diabolic pacts gone awry, and it's doubtful that Lyranth is any different. Only a fool would ask her about it, but perhaps the librarian might know more—if he'd be willing to talk about it.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=his dc=16 passive=true]]{Intelligence (History)} </strong>Lyranth’s jewelry appears to be especially old, around a century or more removed from present day, and is of a style not commonly seen in the region where the manor is located.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=med dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Medicine)} </strong>Whether due to her monstrous nature or some other force, Lyranth seems unaffected by the longterm changes brought on by exposure to this place. She lacks the paling of the skin or the darkening beneath the eyes, the grimness and shadow that seems into everyone here.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Personality</h2><p>Lyranth has gone quite mad in the years since she was transformed into a medusa and is doing her best to hold herself together, to varying degrees of success. She is always on the lookout for potential subjects for her “art” and filters everything through an artist’s lens, judging composition and aesthetic of anything from someone’s clothing to the pattern of scars and cuts on someone’s arm. Nothing is above being critiqued.</p><p>Above all else, she is utterly devoted to and quite possibly obsessed with her patron Vivesna.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Traits</h3><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#discerning-traits]{Discerning Traits} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unhinged</strong>. The period of revenge she inflicted on her home country as a medusa caused untold amounts of damage to her, and she is a dangerous, unstable being that should be handled carefully for one’s own safety. She is capable of being sweet and kind one moment then monstrously cruel the next. This tactic was often used to lull victims into a sense of false security before using that moment of sudden fear as their final stone pose.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fanatical</strong>. There is nothing that is more important to Lyranth than her patron Vivesna and doing anything to please her. Lyranth rather wrongly believes that she has a deep connection with Vivesna due to some similarities in their backgrounds, but this is largely due to Vivesna and Vostola’s expert manipulation abilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creative</strong>. Lyranth is indeed an unmatched artist, capable of crafting anything out of stone. Though she only infrequently creates carvings now, she is capable of creating stonework that flows like water, bears curves like flesh, catches light like hammered metal, and bears intricate detailing that few in the world can match. Sadly, most of what she creates with her own hands ends up destroyed shortly after being made.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bitter.</strong> Lyranth has an enormous chip on her shoulder about people who are especially attractive or charming that gain attention simply because of this. She respects people with actual skill, and despises those who have no substance to their character (whether true or imagined). </p></li><li><p><strong>Lonely.</strong> Spending most of her life alone before and after her infernal deal, Lyranth wishes for nothing more than someone to legitimately care about her. She believes that she has found this with Vivesna and to an extent even with Vostolas, but deep down she fears that she’s wrong and that nobody truly likes her.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Lyranth of Kavamatis was once an incredibly talented sculptor producing some of the finest pieces her region had ever seen. She was among one of the more celebrated members of her art community and her pieces commanded high prices, with sculptures in some of the most prestigious villas and palaces in her country. However, she found herself deeply dissatisfied with her life, not for a lack of fame, but a lack of love. Lyranth was by no means unattractive, but largely regarded as plain, and could never draw the eye like her art did.</p><p>Desperate to change this, Lyranth sought to make a deal with a powerful fiend that held some sway in the region. She struck a deal to be as beautiful and eye-catching as her own art, so that others would stop ignoring her for the rest of her life. With the deal struck Lyranth enjoyed the fawning attention of all who beheld her, and for a time all was well. However, as with all infernal deals, the devil waits within the details. As Lyranth reached the end of her natural life she awoke to find herself plain as she ever was, but with marble-like skin and a head of snakes where she once had hair.</p><p>Turned into a medusa, Lyranth quickly became known as the local monster that killed Lyranth the Beautiful, and was driven out of her home, narrowly escaping with her life. The stress of this event quite effectively snapped her mind and she quickly turned to a campaign of luring or outright attacking those who mistreated her in life, or those who received more attention than she felt they deserved.</p><p>One day she met a beautiful man who was an emissary of the archfiend that had turned her into the monster she was, and he promised to take her somewhere her art would be appreciated. More than this, the beautiful fiend revealed that if she served well and proved useful he might know of a way to undo all the nastiness his master inflicted on her.</p><p>When she asked why she should listen to him, he pointed out that a hero with a mirrored shield and magical blade was on her way, and that he expected Lyranth would soon become yet another monster whose death was told to children for their amusement. Bitterly, Lyranth agreed and was quickly whisked away through a portal of black flame and living shadow to a manor nestled in a plane of endless darkness.</p><p>For the next twenty years she lived with the Corvinarus family, serving as a personal artist to Vivesna and made to craft odd little stone figurines and seals for the incubus Vostolas. During this time she came to know Vivesna well and their shared tales of lost beauty endeared the medusa to the cruel wizard.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul class=\"opinions\"><li><p><strong>Darius Corvinarus. </strong>“I know nothing of the man, but he sounds most cruel and horrible.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Ylana Corvinarus</strong>. “The mother?

This weapon was granted to him along with his mantle when he accepted his title as keeper of the Wild Court. It allows him incredible control over plant life, and the ability to kill or revive nearly any plant he chooses to. For the many intelligent plant folk of the Feyward Manor this was cause enough to give the old satyr a great deal of respect.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Item.NxHaEKA3WSV1VJtA]{Mantle of the Keeper}.</strong> Tymnas’ fey mantle of fur appears iridescent when in the Feyward Manor, and confers on him great respect as well as protection from the dangers that the chaotic flora of the Feyward Manor present.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Routine</h2><p>Tymnas spends most of his time by himself tending his greenhouse (if he can), walking the grounds, or in his cottage. He is infrequently visited by others, few of them a welcome presence.</p><h4>Morning</h4><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.LacLs8vM3Phjhl4R.JournalEntryPage.SWkd518Q4hsneuwQ]. Waking up, Tymnas bathes, has a simple breakfast from stashed foodstuffs in his cottage, and has morning tea. This is done at an unhurried pace, taking up the whole of his morning.</p><h4>Mid-day</h4><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.LacLs8vM3Phjhl4R.JournalEntryPage.EKhmVYknVpL1Ycd0]. Tymnas' midday is spent pruning, repotting, and caring for the strange shadow plants growing in his greenhouse. Sometimes Vivesna shows up to bask in his displeasure at being trapped in the Shadowfell (40% chance). Shortly thereafter he begins tapping into the private stock from the small kegs he keeps about his home.</p><p>Note: If the Shiftless Dead quest has started, he cannot visit this location.</p><h4>Afternoon</h4><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.LacLs8vM3Phjhl4R].

Usk usually joins him if he's already visiting.</p><h4>Evening</h4><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.LacLs8vM3Phjhl4R].

Perhaps the source of his melancholy resides there. Whatever the cause, it only seems to lift when he tends to- or talks about- his garden.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=prc dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Perception)} </strong>Much of what Tymnas wears appears to have once possessed rather vibrant colors. His gloves and kilt appear to be a deeply faded blue leather with green straps. His shirt was once perhaps a rich chocolate brown, and the sash worn about his waist looks to have once been a vibrant teal.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=arc dc=16 passive=true]]{Intelligence (Arcana)} </strong>This is a proper satyr, a fey creature who shouldn't be here. It has clearly had profound effects on his nature. Usually, these creatures are abundant with life and vivacious to the extreme, Tymnas instead seems subdued— aged beyond his years. Being here is exacting a heavy toll on him that he may not even realize. Being cut off from the Feywild must be terrible.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=med dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Medicine)} </strong>Compared to some others within the Shadeward Manor, Tymnas seems to be suffering the effects of exposure to this place far more heavily. He seems even more drained of color than others. It wouldn't be obvious to most, but he exhibits all the symptoms one sees in someone elderly who has simply accepted that they are going to die soon.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Personality</h2><p>Tymnas is a downtrodden and exhausted old Satyr, but he was not always. Once he was a respected keeper of fey grounds, and carried that mantle with great pride. He still maintains the decorum and manners of a minor fey courtier with a title, but all of it is filtered through his disgruntlement at being trapped in the Shadeward Manor.</p><p>The only moments in which he seems to come out of this mire is when he deals with the plants in his greenhouse, though any enjoyment he gets appears fleeting.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Traits</h3><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#discerning-traits]{Discerning Traits} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Proud.</strong> Though not prideful, Tymnas is proud of the things he has accomplished in his long life, and does not take his duties lightly, even if they are done for a master he dislikes in a setting he does not care for.</p></li><li><p><strong>Patient.</strong> When dealing with plants, one must be patient, without magic they cannot be rushed, and even so, the result is not always desirable. This is a lesson that Tymnas has learned well and taken to heart.</p></li><li><p><strong>Polite.</strong> No stranger to the fey courts and their strange rules of etiquette, Tymnas is forever polite and well mannered, even when trapped in the Shadeward Manor working for the very master that kidnapped him. That does not mean he is not disgruntled, he certainly is, he simply keeps that to himself.</p></li><li><p><strong>Horticulturist.</strong> Tymnas has worn the fey mantle of Keeper of the Wild Court for nearly six decades of mortal time and has dedicated a significant portion of his life to it. He loves nothing more than plants and the tending of them, and revels in the natural chaos of their growth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disgruntled.</strong> Stolen away from his court and the work he loved, Tymnas finds the Shadeward Manor to be a dark, lifeless, depressing place with poor excuses for flora that are as miserable as the plane itself. He hates the Shadeward Manor and wishes for nothing more than a chance to return home.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Tymnas entered the fey courts as a young satyr, barely twenty years old at the time. He proved himself a likable sort, with good wit, better manners, and a way with words. What he lacked at this young age was any sort of useful skill. Another aged Satyr in the court, the venerable Keeper of the Wild Court himself, took Tymnas under his wing and began teaching him about the flora of the Feyward Manor.</p><p>The vital satyr initially didn’t understand the value of the old keeper’s teachings, and did not have the patience for such slow moving things as plants. Tymnas was still young after all, hot blooded, and much too interested in making a splash in the court and attracting the hungry eyes of fair courtiers around him. The old keeper was patient however, and knew that this was the way of all saplings in spring.</p><p>Over time Tymnas’ vim and vigor stopped being entertaining, he had been to every party, had every courtier on his arm, and tasted every thrilling taste there was, and the courts began to become tired of him. He had expended his value and novelty, and so began to fall to the wayside. Wilted and dejected, the old keeper simply extended him another chance to learn, a chance to become skillful in an arena few had the patience to master.</p><p>Over the years that followed Tymnas became a skilled horticulturist, as knowledgeable as the keeper, and when the old keeper grew tired of the courts and the chaos he began to pull strings on behalf of his young student. Within short order Tymnas was named the new Keeper of the Wild Court, and the old keeper quietly took to the deepest trods of the Feyward Manor to live alone among the flora and fauna there.</p><p>From that point onward Tymnas served with great distinction. He had not lost his charm or wit, but instead he tempered it with patience and wisdom. He held this title and wore the mantle up until one day he was out amongst the woods near the old Raventree manor to tend his faerie circles and collect rare plants when shadowy assailants beset him from all sides. Kicking and screaming he was dragged into the shadows and has languished there ever since.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Kryn Corvinarus</strong>. “My captor and master. I do not wish ill upon him for this, but I would not think twice if given the chance to slip his yoke. He is as cruel and self-important as his wife. They are a finely matched set of bastards, and likely knew no true friends in their mortal courts.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Vivesna Corvinarus</strong>. “Cruel, heartless, and wearing a veneer of pleasantry over a face uglier than any monster. I have seen her type many times before and enjoy them crossing my path less and less each time they do. I tolerate servitude to her because I must.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Vaxillus Loumaal</strong>. “This foul-hearted elf is as rotten a fruit as the tree that he fell from. I do not know who his father was, but I can hardly blame him for abandoning both mother and child.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Lyranth the Sculptor</strong>. “Ah yes, the mad sycophant, what utterly cruel and heartless bitch of a courtier is complete without an unhinged lackey to lap up every poisonous word to roll off their black tongue? It is a small consolation that these types tend to orchestrate their own demise with almost no outside help.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Usk the Butler</strong>. “A good sort, one who would be well respected, if overlooked, in any fey court. He looks harried by the simple act of existing. I hope one day he finds peace, though I fear such a thing is impossible in this place.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Vostolas the Librarian</strong>. “He wears his ambition and schemes openly, and anyone who doesn't see that is doomed to become the targets or pawns. Don't let his smiling face and warm nature fool you, the nicest of the fey are often the most dangerous. He is best avoided or very carefully managed if one must maintain proximity to him.”</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Master Chirneros</strong>. “He is a hot-headed romantic with a big heart and only half as much brain. I would not call him an oaf, but he lacks the canny nature necessary to truly excel in the fey courts. However, as a champion and defender he is absolutely unmatched.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Elscieth Corvinarus</strong>. “Far too good-hearted for the fey courts, but that was by choice, not by nature. She was no stranger to the cutthroat politics of mortal courts and seems to take to the fey trappings far easier than most. It was no great surprise that she had the will and means to take over the court, though I am certain no one expected her to ever do it.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Sylvaria.</strong> “A glorious reflection of Elscieth’s inner ambitions and desires. With the reigns of reason and kindness she is as horrible and mercurial as any fey lord or lady could hope to be. I am simply glad that Saedia and I found a way to contain her before things got out of hand…before I was dragged here.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Red Scullion</strong>. “Alas, Red. I knew her before she became what she is now. I don’t know what horrible evil befell her, or what creature drew that black, hateful thread out of her soul, but it pains me to see her. It is like watching a once beautiful tree being eaten from the inside out by a horrible rot. The merciful thing to do would be to cut her down and tear out the roots. I do not have the heart to do that to an old friend, however.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Greenhouse Sprites</strong>. “I appreciate their fervor and enthusiasm, if not their ceaseless moralizing and lack of patience. The eldest among them have good heads, and do a decent job of keeping them in order, at least.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Stuckina Boggs.</strong> “Truly repugnant. One good thing about being here is I don't have to tolerate her, see her face, or listen to her talk.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Herniva the Mermaid</strong>. “She wears no less of a mask than Vivesna, and both cover the ugly truth. I consider her no better than her haggish foil. They're well suited to each other, and neither can leave one another alone.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Thorne and Thystle.</strong> “Their most redeeming traits are the fact the recognize my scythe can put their antics to an end with a single swing. I know that they are loyal to their cores, but gods, they aggravate me to no end.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Mistress Saedia</strong>. “I have always fancied her, ever since I was a young man, and she knows it. We took very different paths in the courts, but there remains a strong feeling of respect between us. I am glad to have kept her as a friend when so many others drifted away. I miss her dearly.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Woodfellow the Librarian</strong>. “As obtuse and slow as any tree you will meet, with the wisdom of thousands of them and the profound respect of any fey worth their salt, I have known him most of my life and he has not changed one bit in that time.“</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Insights</h3><p>Tymnas has insight into the following aspects of the world and story:</p><ul><li><p><strong>How do we manage the flowering shambler in the Feyward Manor?</strong> Chicken. Or duck. Preferably chicken. Lure it away and it will be a while getting back. Ol' Shambly prefers them alive.</p></li><li><p><strong>What happened with Elscieth? </strong>We don't know the whole story— she appeared in the Fey one day and took to it like a weed. Chirneros sponsored her into the court, and they became very close. She was kind, and judicious, and she simply fit. Saedia liked her, and I must admit I did as well. When she took the court and became…what she is now, we knew we must do something to tame her latent ambition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Who was the old lord?</strong> \"Oh, dirty business about that. Ya see, when a Fey Lord gets got, as the last one did, their titles and mantles and claims shift to the new lord and most everything about the old lord gets forgot. If he had a name, the house, land, and folk in it have lost it.\"</p></li></ul>"

He seems to lack the desire or motivation to take care of his appearance.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=arc dc=16 passive=true]]{Intelligence (Arcana)} </strong>It would be easy to identify Vaxillus as a drow, but scholars of the planes would actually, correctly, identify him as a shadow elf, their kind being native to the Shadeward Manor itself.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=med dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Medicine)}</strong> Vaxillus does not appear to exhibit the same issues with fatigue and paleness that his mother and stepfather do. Perhaps indicating that this plane does not tax him in the same way as it does them.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Personality</h2><p>Vaxillus is arrogant, overconfident, condescending, and wildly disrespectful toward most everyone he meets. He is like a petulant teen in many ways, self-important and incapable of empathy for others.

Vaxillus enjoys very little more than provoking others to anger, especially if he can do so without any risk of repercussion. While he lacks the finesse and razor wit of his mother, he is highly adept at picking up on ways to pick at people, using this insight to harass, bully, and goad. Many of the things he says may not even reflect his actual beliefs, but Vaxillus will say literally anything if he thinks it will cause offense and get a rise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loyal.</strong> Though it may be surprising, Vaxillus is fiercely, dangerously loyal to those who demonstrate actual acceptance for him as a person. He has spent most of his life being mistreated or used due to his connection to Vivesna, so anyone accepting of Vaxillus for his own merits and traits gains a fierce, albeit toxic loyalty in return.</p></li><li><p><strong>Misanthropic.</strong> Since most people he meets are only respectful because of his mother, or an ulterior motive, Vaxillus expects the worst of everyone he meets, and protects himself from rejection by way of caustic antagonism. He has lived most of his life alone, and is aggressive to others to keep it that way. He is a difficult person to like, and he is fine with that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lazy.</strong> Vaxillus happily lets others do things for him, having spent much of his life being coddled and treated by his mother. He views any tasks assigned to him to be both great insults on his precious time and great burdens that he deserves special praise when he’s dealt with them (when he eventually does).</p></li><li><p><strong>Entitled</strong>. As the bastard son of a former Queen, Vaxillus has a great overinflated sense of his own importance and believes himself a prince deserving of great respect. Though he knows just well enough not to claim princehood, that doesn’t stop him from acting like everybody is beneath him.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Vaxillus has only known life at Vivesna’s side. He grew up an only child, never knowing about his twin sibling. He was afforded every comfort and desire he had, with Vivesna doing anything necessary to provide them. He knows nothing of his elven side, and has only learned enough to conduct himself in court and high society to avoid embarrassing his mother.</p><p>At a young age he displayed great aptitude with animals and crossbows, a ranger in the making to be sure, and Vivesna capitalized on this by giving him the best crossbow she could afford. Within short order he became a horribly proficient sniper and utterly dedicated protector. This is precisely what she had hoped her son would become.</p><p>As a gift on his twentieth birthday he was given a pair of wolfhound pumps and spent the next eight years caring for and raising them. They were the only things that he truly cared about and he put much of himself into their wellbeing, doing for them what his own mother had done for him. In return these hounds were utterly loyal.</p><p>When the blast at the manor occurred his hounds were obliterated, with only twisted bones being cast into the shadows. Vaxillus found these remains and was filled with a soul-crushing despair over this loss. Vivesna attempted to fix this by resurrecting them as immortal, infinitely loyal undead hounds, but in truth Vaxillus finds them repulsive and insulting to look at.</p><p>Over the years spent in the Shadeward Manor he has become progressively more disgruntled with his imprisonment. He desperately wants to leave the manor and never come back but could not bring himself to abandon his mother if he ever got the chance. Knowing this has only allowed him to sink deeper into a bitter melancholy.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul class=\"opinions\"><li><p><strong>Darius Corvinarus. </strong>“He was every bit the asshole that Kryn is, and deserved everything he got and more.

I’ve heard the warnings, and I’m not about to make any deals with him, but he’s got good stories about hell and his conquests though. We drink sometimes. I've asked if he'd join me for target practice but he just made some lewd remarks about teaching him to handle a crossbow. Absolute legend.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Lyranth the Sculptor. </strong>“A completely crazy bitch. She lives in my mother’s shadow, another sycophant. She keeps trying to get me pose for her so she can make a statue of me, as if I'd let her get within ten feet— I'd sooner shoot her in the face if mother didn't like her so much. I wouldn’t be surprised if she wanted to skin me and take my place. I'd love to see her try. ”</p></li><li><p><strong>Tymnas the Groundskeeper</strong>. “That decrepit old goat acts like he’s so great, above it all, like he's the real master of these grounds, but he can’t even get his precious scythe back.

There’s a perpetual glimmer in his eye, like he knows a secret nobody else does. Charm comes effortlessly to him, but no matter how likeable he may be, his goals are inarguably not benevolent.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=prc dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Perception)}</strong> A leather choker around his throat plus wristbands on either arm are imprinted with geometric symbols that appear to be arcane in nature. None of them have any visible seams or snaps indicating how they were attached. </p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=arc dc=16 passive=true]]{Intelligence (Arcana)}</strong> The runes and shapes present on his choker and bracelets are not actually magical. A character with proficiency in the Infernal language will recognize the language on the accessories, a message of servitude to an unnamed \"great master\" or \"great masters\", the plural is the same as the singular. Incubi tend to serve more dangerous fiends from the infernal planes, but this one seems to enjoy much more freedom than most.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=his dc=16 passive=true]]{Intelligence (History)}</strong> There are tell-tale hits in the fabric patterns and styles that this man wears that are centuries old and would be obscure in any modern context, indicating he is well versed in historical fashion, or extremely old.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=med dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Medicine)}</strong> Vostolas appears to be absolutely, physically flawless, and in perfect health, which is in its own way a bit unsettling. What a specimen.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Personality</h2><p>Dangerously compelling, the bookish fiend rarely says what he’s really thinking, instead choosing to let others bare their souls to him. He is a good listener, an avid scholar, and always on the lookout for a vulnerable soul to snatch up, preferably one that won’t cause him trouble down the road. He is adept at picking apart others to use their own interests and quirks against them to draw them closer.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Traits</h3><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#discerning-traits]{Discerning Traits} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Shrewd.</strong> Vastolas is a very good judge of character, can pick people apart easily, and figure out what they are after. He is very careful about picking victims he knows he can reach, and is dangerously patient, knowing he has immortality on his side.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unashamed. </strong>Vostolas does very little to hide his devilish nature unless he thinks his appearance makes others uncomfortable. He views people who make judgments about his being a devil as bland and boring, and accusations made that he's evil would simply be met patronizingly. He knows what he is, and is proud of it, as though he has carved the phrase \"Know thyself\" into the very core of his being.</p></li><li><p><strong>Untrustworthy.</strong> The fiendish librarian cannot be trusted, he is an unbelievably competent liar who has little trouble keeping his webs of deceit from unraveling. He will tell his victims whatever it is they want to hear, and finds a way to work it into his personality so that none of it seems like breaking character.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charming.</strong> As to be expected, Vostolas is dangerously charming, able to manipulate and win over almost anyone. He is an engaging host, a dazzling guest, he spins tales exquisitely and makes everyone happy to know him. This of course is all in service to his aims as a devil and incubus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intelligent.</strong> Vastolas is far smarter than he lets on, knows numerous languages, understands quite a lot about history, magic, politics, and people in general. He has a true, genuine love for academics and a lust for knowledge, which serves him well when interacting with others.</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Friend of the Devil</h3><p>Vostolas is patient in the extreme and won't, generally, view a party of adventurers as a threat. His initial reactions to attempts to engage him violently should be conducted in the tone of an adult being attacked by a group of pre-teen children. He will be patronizing and attempt to de-escalate away from combat, preferring non-violent handling of most situations.</p><p>As an immortal devil, he knows that any attempts to actually kill him will just be a minor inconvenience for him, and that his true death isn't likely to come at the hands of the party. If the party continues to harass and harry him, he will be forced to take action. If that occurs, see @UUID[JournalEntry.K9oTVoVEUPWHM45k.JournalEntryPage.0OHZngwGI8wLJPNi].</p><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Vastola hails from a long line of Incubi and Succubi bred, trained, and traded between Hell’s nobility. He has served a handful of lords, roamed the material world for centuries, and has proven himself to be a reliable earner in the realm of mortal souls. This proficiency has earned him freedom to come and go as he pleases, to keep the company he likes, and to collect souls on his terms.</p><p>Over the many centuries of his existence he has seen the rise and fall of kings, and facilitated the fulfillment of wishes and desires of all kinds for countless mortals. He is quite proud of the niche and name he’s made for himself, and serves his current lord with distinction, though he does not dare utter their name outside of their court.</p><p>Vastolas is as close to minor nobility in Hell as one can find, and this fact is one he is neither proud nor ashamed of. Not one to show off his authority. To him, his existence is simply what it is, and he has made the best of it, feeling that if one can enjoy what they must do then a lifetime of service feels much less like a sentence and more like a gift.</p><p>He is utterly content in his position, and quite happy to continue making the most of it. At present he is on something akin to holiday, spending some time with Kryn and his family, if only to witness the drama unfold and possibly make a deal or two with a desperate soul. When the manor stops being interesting he’ll collect his tomes and contracts and move on without a second thought.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong>Vostolas is never entirely truthful with the party. He lies as well has seduces, and has a fondness for playing word games. For simplicity’s sake, the first part of the opinion will represent a palatable sentiment, while the second part represents truer feelings.</em></p><ul class=\"opinions\"><li><p><strong>Darius &amp; Ylana Corvinarus. </strong>“I have never heard anything good about them leave Kryn’s lips, and I suspect I never shall. Truthfully, if I had the soul of every mortal I met that had issues with parents, I would be a Lord of Hell by now.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Elscieth Corvinarus</strong>. “I have not yet had the pleasure yet, but I'd surely love to have an hour with her given how the rest of her family acts. With all that Kryn says to her detriment, I wonder if she was the true victim.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Byscilla Corvinarus</strong>. “I am afraid I have no idea who that is.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Usk the Butler.</strong> “A dutiful soul that deserves better than he’s suffered. So very close to breaking, that one. I hope that I’m there when it happens to help pick up the pieces.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Vaxillus Loumaal. </strong>“A hotheaded lad with a keen eye and grand chip on his shoulder, he spends hours with me at times— no other friends, poor dear. Little more than a petty and vindictive pissant one bad day away from making a deal with me, he would serve admirably as a tormentor in some pit in hell.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Lyranth the Sculptor. </strong>“My dear friend, I am happy I managed to link her up with Vivesna and given her purpose. If she had been left alone to her own devices she would be long dead, and that is far less interesting, if we’re being honest. She thinks I can one day restore her from what she has become, but alas— a deal's a deal.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Tymnas the Groundskeeper</strong>. “He doesn't like me and I know it, so we keep to our own business. A stranger in a strange plane, I know how it feels to be somewhere foreign. A pity he is too canny to fall for my tricks, a weaker soul would have jumped at a contract to escape this place.” </p></li><li><p><strong>Vivesna Loumaal Corvinarus. </strong>“A charming woman who is every part Kryn’s equal. A match that couldn't have been better made in hell. A true joy to interact with, for all she avoids me. I understand she was once very fair, now she’s as ugly without as within. Any day now she’ll cave and come begging for her face back.”</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Insights</h3><p>Vostolas has insight into the following aspects of the world and story:</p><ul><li><p><strong>What happened at the manor? (Approval 4 or higher)</strong> \"Nothing hell hasn’t seen before: lies, secrets, betrayal, murder. A true melodrama fit for the stage.\"</p><ul><li><p>Vostolas can account for nearly all of the details of @UUID[JournalEntry.OIfGrskfmsmysKc5.JournalEntryPage.nvlcD3Sxfw4wVAiG#in-memorium]{In Memorium}, though he wasn't present and this knowledge is second-hand at best. He still likely won't share them without the party cutting @UUID[.5zgB2b6vG4z8aM1a#just-sign-here]{a deal} of at least medium weight.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What happened to Vivesna?</strong> \"Something about magic she can't access anymore, I believe. You should go ask her directly, she'd be better at explaining it than me.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>How did you end up here? (Approval 1 or higher)</strong> \"I have occasion to spend some time in the town nearest the Manor, and when the rumors began to circulate I decided to investigate— no one loves cutting a deal more than people in trouble. When I found this place, I was invited and have decided to hang about.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>Who do you actually work for?</strong> Vostolas simple smiles at that question. \"You couldn't afford that information.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>What are you actually after here? \"</strong>Oh, nothing really. I'm just borrowing some space for books and getting some papers in order with my team. That and visiting with an old friend.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>How do we get back to the material plane?</strong> \"Well, it just so happens I have a means, if you'd be willing to help me.\" See @UUID[JournalEntry.K9oTVoVEUPWHM45k.JournalEntryPage.NxPNP0H1U6M0yRqp]</p></li><li><p><strong>Do you actually buy souls?</strong> \"Heavens no, I have a totally different job. My work as a middleman for contractual deals is more of a side interest.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>What is your actual job then?</strong> \"Convincing people to make more interesting decisions in their lives.\"</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Just Sign Here</h2><p>Everybody wants something, and Vostolas is nothing if not accommodating. For the right price, nearly everything is on the table. Diabolic Pacts signed by Vostolas are empowered by a fiend on a different plane of existence, and are eternally binding once signed by the client and Vostolas both.</p><p>Vostolas is not a spellcaster, neither cleric nor warlock nor sorcerer— instead, to carry through the spellcasting parts of his Diabolic Pacts, Vostolas communes directly with his masters on some infernal plane of existence. This has benefits and drawbacks: some spells which should be instantaneous may take longer than expected—others which should take hours might be accelerated to minutes.</p><h4>Keeping Things Balanced</h4><p>The GM remains the final word on what the Diabolical Pacts Vostolas offers entail, and the GM should endeavor to tune the risk and reward of these to their table's play style and their players.</p><p>While the limitations of these contracts should be assumed to be \"anything the Gamemaster considers reasonably allowable\", a list found below should serve to provide some examples of services that Vostolas could offer. GMs are counseled to keep in mind that cutting deals with a devil are not just considered an evil act, but can be potentially disbalancing to the adventure. While we have tried to keep the suggestions relatively balanced, take a moment before deciding what to offer your players to be sure that their acceptance will neither completely derail the adventure, destroy their character, nor give them a level of power that overwhelmingly changes the scale of their power.</p><p>While trivial-cost deals represent a slippery slope into full blown devilish litigation, the price of any deal beyond trivial should be something that makes a player uncomfortable to consider, something which has a terrible cost that they might have felt necessary in the moment—but they'll always wonder if there was a better way. Likewise, the reward for signing the contract should be something that is <strong>initially</strong> extremely powerful, important, or which will make a character feel like they have come out of the deal with a very powerful benefit for the terrible cost they paid—but over time something that will make them wonder if they should have just not signed the deal.</p><p>When a deal is signed with Vostolas— <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">there is no backing out</span></strong></span>. What is traded is permanent, and cannot be undone. Even killing Vostolas and burning the contract will not unwind the deal—he's just the messenger, after all. Short of using a cast of Wish to free the character from the deal they signed by undoing it —these contracts cannot be terminated.</p><h4>No Free Rides</h4><p>Vostolas does not, generally, provide services without first receiving payment. He will sign agreements, but until the party member carries out their end of the deal, they will not receive their reward. This prevents cases where a character might, for example, agree to murder every sprite in the Feyward Manor in exchange for ungodly powers only to not hold up their end of the deal. Vostolas isn't particularly interested in long term promises, either— adventurers don't live particularly long lives and promises of \"give me unimaginable power and I'll convince some children to worship your infernal masters\" just isn't as appetizing an offer as some depraved person might think.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Trading Pieces</h3><p>Vostolas values his trades based on a simple four tier scale: <strong>trivial</strong>, <strong>low</strong>, <strong>medium</strong>, and <strong>high</strong>. Vostolas is willing to accept payment in the form of any of the following, in order of lowest value to highest:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Important Information(Trivial to Low)</strong>. Party members can offer up valuable intelligence, such as creature weaknesses, biographical details, secrets of a manor resident, storyline elements, or any other knowledge which Vostolas might be able to use to socially leverage others. The more detailed and secret the information, the higher the value. If this knowledge would allow him to leverage @UUID[.TxmjQWotcshN0E21]{Kryn} in particular, it would be considered a medium value trade instead.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pieces of Life (Low).</strong> Adventurers have often lived very rich and detailed lives, and Vostolas has a use for that knowledge: giving devils suitably real aliases when they come to the material plane. Player characters can cut a piece of information out of their backstory and sell it to Vostolas. It has to be a \"suitably interesting\" piece of a character's backstory, some defining moment of their life—and it isn't as simple as trading the <strong>story</strong> of that moment. That complete moment of background story ceases to belong to the character—it is taken from their history and given, instead, to Vostolas. The character loses all memory of it, forgetting it as if it never happened.</p></li><li><p><strong>Minor Vile Deeds (Trivial to Low).</strong> Performing evil acts can be rewarding—particularly if they sew some discord among otherwise orderly and good people. Performing a minor act of evil and presenting Vostolas with evidence of that fact, including the story of how it happened, can be enough. Some examples of minor vile deeds include: Stealing items of at least 500gp value, destroying a treasured possession or holy symbol, permanently injuring someone but leaving them alive, or convincing a different character (of a good alignment) to do any of these things. If the vile deed is performed against someone of a Good alignment, it's inherently worth more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Souls at Time of Death (Medium to High)</strong>. Vostolas values souls based on their alignment. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, and Chaotic good souls are considered High Value, Lawful Neutral and True Neutral and any Evil aligned souls are considered medium value. Characters who have died when their souls have been sold <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">may not be resurrected</span></span>. They are damning themselves to eternal servitude to be reincarnated in the service of Vostolas' masters on the infernal planes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Major vile deeds (Medium to High)</strong>. While minor vile deeds are enough for minor tasks, true diabolic power requires reprehensible sacrifice. If a party member is willing to commit murder of one or more innocent creatures of a good alignment, lure a small group of innocents into worshiping a devil, desecrate a holy place, corrupt an innocent good-aligned character into committing any of the above, or even worse acts of depravity, these are all acts of medium to high value (depending on just how bad the deed is). These acts should be the kind of thing that would make a player ask \"Do I need to change my alignment as a result of this?\"</p></li><li><p><strong>Ability Score Decrease (High)</strong>. Vostolas considers a trade of someone's natural talents and abilities to be a high value item…but only if it's one of their their best features. Mechanically, this represents a character taking a permanent -2 to an ability score or giving up a feat, but the character can only give points from one of their top three ability scores: Vostolas will not accept anything less.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oath of Perpetual Service (High)</strong>. If someone is willing to enter permanently into service to Vostolas' planar masters, it is considered a matter of high value. The character in question will receive regular instructions from an infernal being such as a greater devil, and should be prepared to undertake the kind of evil tasks classed as \"major vile deeds\" above regularly.</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Services Provided by Vostolas</h3><table class=\"services\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width:200px\">Service</th><th style=\"width:100px\">Cost</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Individual Healing</td><td>Trivial</td><td>Restore a single living target to their maximum hit points.</td></tr><tr><td>Hints and Useful Intelligence</td><td>Trivial</td><td>Provide details of an enemy's weaknesses, secrets of a key NPC, etc. Offer this if your players missed an important clue.</td></tr><tr><td>Recover a Lost Item</td><td>Trivial</td><td>Any specific item the party has previously had in their possession, lost at any of the three planar manors or its surrounding environs.</td></tr><tr><td>Trivial Spellcasting</td><td>Trivial</td><td>Vostolas considers the following spells to be trivial to arrange: Aid, Arcane Lock, Augury (with Vostolas' Master), Comprehend Languages, Continual Flame, Darkvision, Detect Poison and Disease, Gentle Repose, Identify, Knock, Lesser Restoration, Locate Object, Longstrider, Mending, See Invisibility.</td></tr><tr><td>Fiendish Familiar</td><td>Low</td><td>Vostolas will summon an Imp to serve a single target until its demise as an NPC companion.

The growing fey-like features, the aura of wildness in her. Doubtless her pact has empowered her to unimaginable levels of magical prowess.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=med dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Medicine)}</strong> Elscieth appears to be in good health, though she has taken on an otherworldly countenance with golden eyes, lavender skin, and elf-like ears. Whether this is a result of her exposure to the Feywild or some other aspect, who can say? It is like she is becoming a fey creature herself.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Personality</h2><p>Elscieth is as ambitious as her brother, but her desire for power and influence is tempered by empathy and an upbringing that highlighted the importance of temperance and wisdom. A childhood as the subject of a vicious and one-sided competition with her brother Kryn has left her with little patience for pointless rivalries. She aims to embrace a path of peace and diplomacy, learning how to realize ambition through gentler, more cooperative means. Despite her ambitions, Elscieth is a generally kind, forward planning and considerate soul who avoids harming others.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Traits</h3><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#discerning-traits]{Discerning Traits} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p>Elscieth has the following traits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Wise</strong>. Forward thinking, patient, and adept at watching her surroundings, Elscieth is not taken by foolhardy whims and improperly planned actions. She is keenly aware of when she should act and when she should wait, and when a course of action will not actually yield anything of value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resourceful</strong>. Though she often appears unassuming, Elscieth has been formidably armed with the ability to read people and situations so that she can capitalize on both. While it’s not impossible to catch her out and put her on the backfoot, she is very good at bouncing back and turning situations to her favor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambitious</strong>. Though she does as much as she can to temper her ambitions and realize them through less destructive methods, she wants power, station and control as the master of the manor. To her credit, she is generally unwilling to carry out acts of evil to bring her desires to fruition, and prefers to find alliances, deals and compromises to get what she wants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rational</strong>. One of Elscieth’s strengths has always been her ability to think realistically about situations. This has allowed her to sort her personal ambitions and desires from actions that would better serve greater purposes. This natural sense of reason was diminished while in the form of Sylvaria, leading her to consider her own interests heedless of anything else.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caring.</strong> Elscieth's upbringing and her torment at the hands of brother drove her toward goodness— a choice to be better than her family, to see the positive in others where some might only see the worst. She loves all of those who she believes to be under her rule, and wishes profoundly to see them become their best selves, as she feels she has.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>The eldest child of Darius and Ylana, Elscieth grew up in a loving household overjoyed to have her. She was just a hair shy of spoiled while growing up, given near anything she wanted. Naturally bright and charming, she was provided the best tutors available, and received education in leadership, history, finance, and diplomacy. Among her many talents there was only one which she could never grasp: magic. Despite her best efforts, and years tutoring, she could never grasp its intricacies.</p><p>Though not explicitly groomed to become the new master of the Corvinarus estate and assets, it was evident that she would be the chief inheritor. She quickly proved competent and sharp enough for the task, and possessed a far more even temperament than her younger brother. </p><p>Her relationship with Kryn was always strained. He wanted what she had, and always accused her of being their parents’ favorite. Regardless of how hard she worked to smooth things over and build a good relationship with her brother, he would have nothing of it. What little good relation she had was quickly ruined when he developed natural magical abilities. From that moment forward he never passed up a moment to lord that magic over her, knowing that Elscieth had spent years trying to learn how to cast even simple cantrips.</p><p>As a young woman Elscieth struck out on her own, attaching herself to an allied family’s court to collect additional experience in the family's many circles of influence. It was there she met fellow courtier and wizard Bartram Rousset. They struck up an easy friendship which quickly became a romance.</p><p>The birth of their first child out of wedlock forced the pair to reckon with the nature of their relationship, and- perhaps more dauntingly- to return home to reveal their child, @UUID[.xbxnzgARPDPigG4e]{Byscilla}. The couple carefully alerted both families, arranging for a family gathering wherein they would discuss how to proceed. The Corvinarus and Rousset families agreed that if their children were in love, had a child, and were committed to each other that marriage was the logical next step, and neither family would be worse for the alliance, with the Rousset recognizing this was a boon for them more than the Corvinarus family.</p><p>Within a year the couple were married, Byscilla was legitimized, and they lived as happily as they could for the years that followed.</p><h3 class=\"border\">A Cycle of Loss and Return</h3><p>Word of the sudden illness and death of Elscieth’s mother, and the sorrowful decline of her father soon reached the family. Though she knew there would be little that she could do to bring solace to her father, she set out to return home for only the second time since her youth. What awaited her at Raventree Manor was but the facade of a noble estate. The house staff did well at keeping up appearances, every inch of the estate was perfectly manicured and all duties upkept, but there was an unshakable feeling of hollowness within the once-proud home. On her way to announce herself to her father, she was embraced by a grateful but worried Usk, who expressed hope that her presence would relieve her father.</p><p>There was small chance of that.</p><p>Darius spared the barest amount of time for her visit. What time they spent together found him distracted and listless, and though Elscieth tried to draw him out, Darius' growled monosyllabic responses wore on her. Elscieth watched, helplessly, as her family fell apart, able to do nothing but shoulder the burden of work that her father would no longer do.</p><p>The return to Raventree was not entirely without reward, for Elscieth found in the manor grounds a power she had sought her whole life. Rather, it found her. It came in the form of a stranger, dressed as one of the groundskeepers, and over the course of days it listened to her when she spoke her thoughts. It offered advice, a shoulder to cry on, and understanding. Soon, their conversations turned to magic and the fact that Elscieth seemed to possess none of the magical talents for which her family was named. As she lamented her inadequacy, the stranger seized the opportunity and posed a simple theory: What if Elscieth had simply not been taught the way she needed to be? Perhaps the power had been there all along, resting in the trees, the vines, the hedges, and she only need to ask.</p><p>That was when she first met her patron.</p><p>Weeks after her arrival Elscieth finally left Raventree once more, convinced she could do no more to free her father from the impenetrable cloud of misery into which he had sank. She had already mastered the basics of her newfound powers as a burgeoning warlock. The Elscieth who returned to her family was different, suffused with life and glad to be away from the burden of her heritage. She pursued her newfound fey-fueled powers with unbridled enthusiasm, telling Bartram of each development with excitement. She tried to think no more on the plight of Raventree; she could do no more for her father, and if ever he broke free of his fugue she was certain that Usk would send for her.</p><p>When one day she received a formal invitation from her father to attend a celebration of her mother’s life a sense of great dread came over her. At first she considered not attending, but could not bring herself to turn her back on her family entirely. Hedging her bets, she asked Bartram and Byscilla to stay behind, promising to be gone only a few weeks.</p><p>As fate would have it, she never returned.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Trapped in a Reflection</h3><p>The events of the memorial dinner, outlined in @UUID[JournalEntry.OIfGrskfmsmysKc5.JournalEntryPage.nvlcD3Sxfw4wVAiG]{The Vanishing of Raventree}, sent the manor's guests spiralling through the planes. Arriving in the feywild, Elscieth was plunged into a world she knew only from stories and books. Now, she was face to face with a powerful fey being, into whose realm her home had apparently been thrust.</p><p>To the lord of the manor, Elscieth was a threat, if not true competition. Connected and powerful, she was a potential usurper. For her part, Elscieth was more focused on returning home to her family, but as the years passed and she struggled to settle into the life of a fey courtier, she was forced to come to grips with the fact she was unlikely to ever escape the Feywild.</p><p>Eventually, she began to have feelings for @UUID[.9Pf6tWcNRd4W760i]{Chirneros}, her patron’s right hand and champion. It was during this time that Chirneros divulged to her that their patron wanted her removed, since she was a threat in his eyes. With their options limited, they realised their only recourse was to depose the lord.</p><p>Their attack was swift, and two-pronged. Though powerful, the fey lord was not invincible, and ultimately fell. What the couple had not foreseen was what would happen when Elscieth took his place as lord of the Feyward Manor. In absorbing his title, position, and power, her mortal form and soul were changed. This change amplified her powers, but it also brought out the worst of her greed and ambition. She had become something new- Sylvaria, a fae dragon, Lord of Raventree Estate.</p><p>Chirneros watched the transformation of his love with horror, powerless to stop it. All he could do was enlist the aid of a powerful dryad, @UUID[.lUVjMazN4aeVfm9r]{Saedia}, to sedate and contain her while he searched for a way to return her to the way she was. Now Sylvaria sleeps, nestled within the boughs of @UUID[JournalEntry.OMTctEQKJfOaXmNG.JournalEntryPage.NsScYZr0nplIduU3]{F38. The Dreaming Tree}, dimly dreaming of power and expansion, never acting on them.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul class=\"border\"><li><p><strong>Darius Corvinarus.</strong> “I got my ability to dream of my future and work to realize it from my father. Despite years of effort I never developed competence with magic, but he still treated me like an apprentice. He always challenged me to see the world not as it was, but as it could be— reshaped by my will, and that changing the world required wisdom and forethought. When mother died, so too did a piece of him, I think. In truth, I never wanted anything for him but peace.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Ylana Corvinarus.</strong> “My mother taught me how to be patient, how to find common ground among those lesser and greater than me, she always saw the best in others. She taught me how to compromise without losing too much. She tempered my ambitions, much as I suspect she did for my father. I never was able to repay her…when father lost her, it was like he forgot that we lost her too. I miss her more than anything in the world.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Bartram Rousset</strong>. “What could I have done, trapped as I am? If I had discovered a way to break free and return to the material plane I would have, and do not think I didn't try. But how many years could I be asked to fail before giving up? How long could I have expected Bartram to wait for me? Surely he expected I was dead if he heard anything of the events that transpired at my father's manor. Eventually I moved on, as I am sure he did.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Byscilla Rousset.</strong> “I regret having left her as I did. Bartram, her father was a good and capable man, and no doubt did his best. I am sure she has grown into a fine woman, and all without me. I have missed her and her father greatly—but now we would be strangers, and I doubt we have a place for each other in our respective lives. It warms my heart knowing they have done well for themselves, I am saddened at having missed her life, and knowing that I would only be a stranger to her now if I were to return.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Kryn Corvinarus.</strong> ”My little brother was always a monster. He didn't become one over time, there was no inciting event. Even when we were young he made life as difficult— for me, for the staff, for our parents, for guests as soon as he could devise a way to. It was as though he was jealous of me from the moment he was born. I watched him become ever more competent, stubborn, ambitious, and closed off to the influence of our parents the older he grew. It is a credit to my parents’ patience that they tried so hard for so long to set him right. I gave up on him as soon as he developed magic, knowing that with that he would never have any cause to see reason beyond his own. Power in the hands of someone like him is a true injustice.“</p></li><li><p><strong>Vivesna Loumaal Corvinarus.</strong> “She is one of the few people I can find no good within. An absolutely vile woman, false in every way. I tried to be welcoming and gracious, to find common ground, to see good qualities in my new sister when her and Kryn were wed. The few pieces of good I found in her were paper-thin, and her thinly veiled disdain for all of us was plain to me and my mother. Moreover, she knew this, and didn’t care. If nothing else, we had an unspoken and very clear understanding with each other – she had married into the family, but she was not welcome. I hope very much that some chance of fate brings to her what she deserves.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Vaxillus Loumaal.</strong> “A miserable rat bastard cut from the same cloth as her mother. Entitled, selfish and arrogant. It is ironic that he and my brother seem to hate each other because except for his part-elven heritage it is like someone duplicated young Kryn. Part of me recognizes that he is a product of his upbringing, but Kryn proved to me that some people just come into the world rotten, and I suspect he might be another one. If he could be gotten away from those two, sent somewhere that would put him in his place, he might be better for it. I think there might still be <em>some</em> piece of good in him.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Usk Umberdael.</strong> “In many ways he was more of an older brother to me than an advisor and valet to my parents. I grew up with him, and will admit that for a while I harbored a <em>terrible</em> crush, but over the years he became a valued friend and ally that I could call upon for insight and advice. It pains me to see him in his current state, the trial of being trapped here has eroded much of his calm and confidence. My father never had a more faithful friend, and I love him the more for it…”</p><ul><li><p>after a long, thoughtful pause, depending on whether Elscieth was restored through @UUID[JournalEntry.Kr7jDRSSoh9h54FH.JournalEntryPage.RDt48DcdLD9cqDOo]{Quest: Chirneros' Love} and @UUID[JournalEntry.Kr7jDRSSoh9h54FH.JournalEntryPage.HK5dhhPNIaF96Lta]{Quest: Material Possessions} would add, sadly. \"Father gave him the estate in the end, you know. I am not certain there is paperwork to support this, nor do I think he would ever accept it, but he would make a fine lord.\"</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Chirneros.</strong> “My first ally in the fey manor, my protector, my heart. He is fierce and passionate, loyal and pragmatic. He stood for me when others would not. I love him as strongly as I have loved anyone in my entire life. He made me stronger, saw me through difficult times, and taught me much about the fey courts. If I am to be trapped in this manor forever, he is the one I want by my side.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Herniva.</strong> “She shrouds herself in false niceness, and wields hollow pleasantries as a rapier, aiming to disarm those around her. As long as you remember this, she makes for fine company, albeit the kind you keep at arm’s length. I wish she would find better hobbies than gossip and sewing chaos.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Stuckina Boggs</strong>. “She is a curious creature, ugly inside and out, but not by any choice of her own. To be created horrible and driven by forces beyond your control seems a special hell I would not wish on anyone. I see her grappling with it, I pity her for it, but respect that she has not given up, however futile the fight is. I hope that she wins out in the end.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Saedia.</strong> “My dearest friend and confidant. She reminds me of my grandmother, she has seen so much more than anyone else, to the point she can almost predict what people will do. That wisdom and insight has come at a cost, though. I suspect her youthful vibrancy is put on to hide a truer, more hardened core. I value her as council and my right hand in all things regarding the manor here. I do not blame her for what she did—something had to be done, and it was an elegant solution.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Sprites.</strong> “A spirited and good hearted bunch who are uncompromising and unflinching in their pursuit of their ideals. More industrious than creatures ten times their size, they are valuable allies, though I suspect they’d turn on me the moment I did anything that flew in the face of their personal code. Respectable, I think. ”</p></li><li><p><strong>Sylvaria.</strong> “It is unpleasant to look upon myself in that state, to remember how I thought and felt, the things I wanted. They were as true about me now as they were then, but I did not have the wisdom to push them aside and see reason. I am forever grateful that they no longer guide me unbidden.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Red Scullion.</strong> “Odious, mean spirited, dare I say evil. I do not know what her true name is, and I know she will never tell me. She feeds the Revel, and I cannot remove her because she has been promised her status by oaths made by those who ruled here before me, written into the land itself. It would take an outside force to remove her. I'm told she was a bugbear once—perhaps, if extricated, she might be able to recover some of her old self, as I have.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Revel.</strong> “A frightful force of pure hunger, something which would bring out the worst in anyone. I have wanted it gone for a while, but I have no means of removing it, and sending more soldiers to drive it off only bolsters the numbers within its ravenous host.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Thorne and Thystle.</strong> “The most stalwart of defenders. Their candor is improper, though funny. I have no question of their ability, and I know that their loyalties are to the master of the manor, whether that includes me or not, but I cannot help but love them for it all the same.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Woodfellow.</strong> “Wise, timeless, and coy. I like him, though I am sure he does not like me. Or perhaps after one has lived for centuries you simply stop caring for people in general. I could not blame him if that were the case. All the same, he keeps a fine library, and deserves his station without question.”</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Insights</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Who was the old lord?</strong> \"I will not speak his name, for that would grant him more power than he deserved. He was a cruel, imperious, and paranoid being who asked horrible things of his court and his servants. He was all too happy to see the Revel come to roost in his place, and tolerated a twisted hag for a scullion. That should tell you all you need to know.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>What happened to your mother?</strong> “It was terrible. The illness came upon one day, like a cloud passing over the sun, and she quickly became too weak to even sit. Father called for healers, alchemists, clerics, and druids alike, none could cure her. My father consulted with arcanists, trying to divine what was happening. When she died and the resurrection failed, it…changed him. It was like he could no longer see the good in the world— only the worst, and most horrible. I dearly regret leaving him to his misery, but I was lost to my own grief as well, what could I have done? I still miss her warmth and her kindness—she taught me so much.”</p></li><li><p><strong>What happened at the Raventree Estate?</strong> “Father was…he…\" She holds a moment to clear her tightening throat, \"Things had not gone well that day. The remembrance was supposed to reunite us, to remind us of the light and love she brought into the world. To celebrate the life she lived, rather than how it ended. That…isn't how things went. The day was sad, and I found it miserable. I regret to admit that I was not as restrained in my language as I should have been—I should have had better control of my reactions to Kryn. We couldn't stop needling one another, not for a moment. It infuriated Father, and if I look objectively at my behavior that day, I don't blame him—certainly I was not my best. I didn't expect him to interrupt dinner to disinherit us—but I didn't truly have time to react when Kryn and Vivesna attacked my father openly in front of us all. We fought—and I did my best to defend him and myself. I don't remember what happened after the explosion claimed him—only that I awoke here.”</p><ul><li><p>after a long, thoughtful pause, depending on whether Elscieth was restored through @UUID[JournalEntry.Kr7jDRSSoh9h54FH.JournalEntryPage.RDt48DcdLD9cqDOo]{Quest: Chirneros' Love} and @UUID[JournalEntry.Kr7jDRSSoh9h54FH.JournalEntryPage.HK5dhhPNIaF96Lta]{Quest: Material Possessions} would add, sadly. \"Father gave Usk the estate in the end, you know.

He feels some guilt for turning on the fey lord he had sworn himself to, but he knew the alternative was losing the love of his life. Seeing her turned into a dragon and consumed by avarice and ambition has left him doubting his convictions.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Traits</h3><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#discerning-traits]{Discerning Traits} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p>Chirneros has the following traits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Passionate</strong>. The mighty Chirneros is more than a deadly warrior. He has a big heart and burning passion. When he cares, he cares deeply and fully. This is a double-edged sword which can harm him, but does make him a good friend to have.</p></li><li><p><strong>Honorable</strong>. Though his actions may throw his loyalty into question, he acts with good intentions, and reason. Chirneros believes that how he sees himself is more important than how others might see him. If he gives his word, he will follow it not just to the letter of the oath, but in the spirit in which it was given.</p></li><li><p><strong>Druidic</strong>. Chirneros has a powerful connection to nature as a fey champion, and even has highly developed powers that allow him to summon beastly spirits and commune with animals as a peer, which he greatly enjoys doing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Romantic</strong>. Chirneros has a great desire to love and be loved. He has given his heart to Elscieth and relishes every moment he has with her. He has a soft place in his great heart for romance and fellow romantics, though he is not prone to showing it, as he must maintain his facade as a stoic warrior.</p></li><li><p><strong>Just. </strong>Chirneros believes that doing the right thing is paramount. Punishment for those who have done wrong should be commensurate with the crime, no matter who the perpetrator is. He is a fair and balanced judge in all things, be they situations or people, and has an extremely strong moral compass. All the world requires balance, and justice is the path to true balance.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Once Chirneros was half the size and stature that he is now. He began as an unassuming aspirant in the ranks of a distant fey lord’s guard force. With nothing to make him stand out, Chirneros spent the early part of his career simply trying to keep up with hobgoblins, satyrs, and bugbears far better suited to war than him.</p><p>It was because of his percieved inadequacy that he resolved to undertake the Champion’s Trials. This series of games are meant to test a warrior’s mind, spirit, and body, pushing them all to their breaking point. The prize, a magical swords, would- he hoped- allow him to fulfill the duties he was sworn to.</p><p>Many of his peers laughed and mocked him for his audacity, and even those administering the trials thought little of his chances. But Chirneros persevered nonetheless, and caught the eye of an unlikely sponsor. A wizened elf, ancient beyond years, offered Chirneros an array of potent potions that they would bolster his mind, body, and soul- enough to make him a worthy contender in the Trials. All the man asked for in exchange was a single favor, and Chirneros, young, headstrong, and desperate, agreed.</p><p>Thus empowered, Chirneros shocked all when he took victory in the Trials and was awarded the sword- and the adulation of those who had once mocked him. Yet his celebrations did not last long, as his debtor soon came to collect. The elf requested one single favour- for Chirneros to serve as his champion.</p><p>In the years that followed, Chirneros became an unkillable terror in the fey lands. He slew and conquered for his new lord. This life of service was gruelling and sapped his spirit, but he kept his word and served without complaint. Years passed, and the elf grew yet older and more withered, until he passed from the land of dreams.</p><p>Released from his oath of service by his former lord's dying breath, Chirneros wandered the fey lands, serving as guard captain, mercenary, and protector for fey courtiers and nobles. It was during this time that he came into the service of the lord of Raventree Manor.</p><p>This period of service is when he met Elscieth, and became smitten with her. The witch, still newly stranded in the land of fey, was glad for a friendly face, and the two grew close. However, as Elscieth's powers and influence over his court grew, the Fey Lord became more paranoid. Despite Elscieth's disinterest in politics, he was convinced that the erstwhile heir to the manor would attempt to usurp him. Though Chirneros took steps to shield her from his wrath, his efforts failed, and soon the fey lord commanded Chirneros to slay Elscieth. Chirneros agreed, and in so doing told his very first lie.</p><p>Chirneros immediately began plotting a means to overthrow his Lord, and end his control of Raventree Estate. He planned to use Elscieth's birthright as well as his own reputation and popularity within the court to replace the current lord- and his plan was successful. Soon thereafter, he watched as his love reluctantly took the throne, and breathed a sigh of relief that their struggles were at an end.</p><p>Any relief he felt was short-lived, however. As a mortal, it was not so simple for Elscieth to take the place of the previous Lord, and the position began to warp her, body and soul. Shedding the name Elscieth, she became Sylvaria, now defined by hunger, avarice and ambition, reformed as a fae dragon. In attempting to protect his love he had destroyed her, or so he believed. Now he holds only a fleeting hope that some small part of her remains that he can coax out, returning Elscieth to him.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Usk Umberdael</strong>. “An outsider, but one of good upbringing and honorable bearing. I respect him, and wish I could do more to help him with his plight.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Elscieth</strong>. “My love, my heart, I would do anything for her. I have done things which tarnish my honor, but there is nothing which love cannot conquer, no heart of iron that its heat cannot weaken. I may regret the things I have done, but I do not regret the reasons why I did them.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Herniva</strong>. “I know very little of her, to be honest with you. She is lady Saedia’s friend. Given how choosy the fair dryad is, I trust she is a fine person.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Saedia</strong>. “The fair and mighty dryad is a good ally to have, she offers good counsel and is a keen mind when it comes to matters of court and diplomacy. Her great distaste for violence however, is not one I can agree with. Sometimes the blade is necessary.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Sprites</strong>. “Stalwart allies, diminutive as they may be. I am glad to call them friends, and know I can rely on them in battle.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Stuckina</strong>. “I do not know the fiendish hag, but I am sure she is like the rest of her kind.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Sylvaria</strong>. “Somewhere within that great draconic mind is the woman I love, I know it. I can feel it. The question is how to bring her out.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Red Scullion</strong>. “Vile, in a word, I would kill her if I was not obligated to protect her.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Dark Revel</strong>. “Horrid, that thing terrifies me. I know it could take control of me if given the chance, so I steer clear.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Thorne and Thystle</strong>. “The most powerful warriors in the estate, and loyal to their death. They act like fools, but that is the soldier’s way. A life spent flirting with death forges a brazen soul.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Woodfellow</strong>. “The ancient librarian should be respected for all he has done to serve the courts. I’ve nothing unkind to say of him.”</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Insights</h3><ul><li><p><strong>What happened at the Raventree Estate?</strong> “I could not tell you with any honesty. All that I know is this: a powerful wave of magic struck the place, sending it tumbling through the planes, and of course bringing Elscieth with it. From what she has told me, she barely escaped an assassination attempt on her and her father. I hope the assassins met a terrible fate, and no longer draw breath.”</p></li><li><p><strong>What happened to Elscieth?</strong> \"When she struck down and usurped our old master, she became Sylvaria, and…she changed. Her ambitions got the better of her, and with each passing day we watched more and more of her slip away. Saedia keeps her weary, in a dreaming sleep, rarely waking—to eat and share some words with me…she is Sylvaria now—but Elscieth is still within her.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>What happened to your old master?</strong> \"He was threatened by Elscieth, and with good reason— she was potent and charming. When the master called for Elscieth's murder, I would have been the one to carry out the assassination… Instead, I betrayed him, told her of his plans, and helped her usurp leadership of the home, and for my folly I watched as Elscieth drank in his power…and now I watch as it consumes her even now.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>Who was the old lord?</strong> \"In defeat his name has been struck from all the minds save the one that slew him. This is the way of the courts. I remember his face, his voice, and his deeds, the history of my service is not revoked. Only the memory of his name and the mantles he once held.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>Why can't you kill the Red Scullion?</strong> \"Ugh. She has made deals with the very lands that this manor is built upon, to simply eradicate her would bring absolute ruin to this house. She can only be dealt with by an outside source not also sword to this manor.\"</p></li></ul>"

Saedia is very keen and very watchful, and if anything is downplaying her own awareness.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=prc dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Perception)}</strong>  It is hard to tell where Saedia stops and her dress ends, and it's entirely possible her dress is simply an extension of her form.

She has long adhered to the belief that communication can solve nearly any problem, and being as she's an ages old Dryad, that has proven true in countless situations she's had to deal with.</p></li><li><p><strong>Patient</strong>. As an ancient dryad she is in many ways more tree than anything, old, wizened, slow to grow and change, and sturdy. Patience comes to her as second nature, and she is more than willing to wait things out if there is a chance they’ll resolve themselves.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proud</strong>. Saedia has worked very hard for the accolades, respect, and position she holds in the fey community and is careful to take actions that only improve it. Tarnishing her reputation or causing her to do it herself is the surest way to make an enemy of her.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nonviolent</strong>. Saedia abhors violence and refuses to engage in it, condone its use, or be party to decisions that lead to it. She vocally objects to any course of action that would result in death, mayhem, or destruction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wise</strong>. Saedia has been around for a long time, has seen the best and worst of the fey courts, and wields that collective knowledge with great skill. You will find no better counsel in the circles of diplomacy, court intrigue, and estate management.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Saedia came into existence centuries ago, born from a dryad grove, and set out in the Feywild to find her people and her soul tree. She traveled through the chaotic hills and dales for many days until she found the regal tree of dreams which had been calling to her. Bonding with it she was imbued with its power and the immortality that comes with it.</p><p>From here she returned to the fey courts to make a name for herself. At first she was nothing more than a courtier, but soon proved herself wise, cunning, and a dangerously quick study. In short order she became a teacher to young courtiers, helping prepare them for their ascent to power. Eventually this led to her being picked as an advisor to one such noble she helped teach. From here she gained clout and influence, traveling from court to court as a dignitary and diplomat, and in time became a highly sought after commodity among the most powerful of the courts.</p><p>However, one day she felt a disturbance around her tree and quietly excused herself from the greater courts to discover what she was sensing. There she found a manor had sprung up, and an upstart fey was trying his hand at lordship. Sensing the trouble at hand, she offered her services as the court’s seneschal, and saw to shepherding it away from more dangerous paths.</p><p>This would all prove for naught, when a powerful outburst from the planar realm shocked the manor and deposited a young mortal woman in their midst. Within short order Saedia watched the old lord topple and the new lady Sylvia ascend to power.</p><p>Realizing the greater danger at hand, Saedia bedeviled Sylvaria and trapped her mighty draconic form in the boughs of the tree of dreams where she would be made to slumber. Since then the ancient dryad has served as de facto leader of the manor, representing her lady’s wishes while indisposed.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul class=\"opinions\"><li><p><strong>Usk Umberdael</strong>. “I am fond of Usk, he is from a family that sees things much the same was as me. I have great respect for his calling, and am glad to see the elves have not lost their fey ideals. However, the fact is that he does not belong here, and needs help I cannot provide.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Chirneros</strong>. “A competent champion and defender of the estate, but too narrow in focus and easily distracted.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Herniva</strong>. “An old friend from my younger, wandering days. For all her faults I would not trade her for anything.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Elscieth</strong>. “I sense the heart of a good person within her, she means well and should prove a good influence on this estate as its master. However she is not from this plane and has much to learn about it. If she’s willing, I can teach her. We all can.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Sprites</strong>. “Collectively they are the truest allies I have in this estate, though their willingness to engage in violence is regrettable. We are at least aligned in our goals, and they are willing to hear reason. This is more than I can say for most.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Stuckina</strong>. “I… have some sympathy for the fate of those captured and turned into hags, and though I like Stucky, I find her terribly difficult to be around. On her good days, she is somewhat less objectionable, and I feel as if we are friends after a fashion. I hope she can get the help she needs, though I’ve never heard of anyone being turned back once transformed.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Red Scullion</strong>. “She is magnitudes worse than any hag you’re likely to encounter. She was wily enough to write a contract with the lands of the estate to ensure her service, and hid her true name, making it impossible for her to be removed by the current or future lord without some repercussions for breaking the oath. Of course she could be killed, but violence is no good answer.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Revel</strong>. “Most spirits and forces like the Revel are harmless if you know how to spot them and avoid their influence. However, feeding them, or letting them run rampant can lead to bigger issues, like what has taken over the dining hall. I begin to suspect that The Revel may not be truly a spirit of the Fey but rather something even more dangerous. I have yet to figure out a solution, and the Scullion is not helping in the least.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Thorne and Thystle</strong>. “Annoying, flippant jokesters. It’s fortunate that they are good at their jobs and loyal to the estate or I’d send them back to the grove they were cut from.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Woodfellow</strong>. “My oldest friend, quite literally. He is truly ancient and wizened from centuries of existence in fey libraries. If there is any knowledge that one needs, he is surely a possible source. Though he does have limits. I first met him as a young dryad playing among the fey courts. We had a tendency to end up in the same place every few years, and eventually became good friends.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Tymnas</strong>. “The old groundskeeper, yes. It's a shame that he vanished, he was an old-hand at court politics and etiquette, and a broadly respected keeper. I would happily have him back were he still alive. I do hope he’s okay, whatever happened to him.”</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Insights</h3><ul><li><p><strong>What happened at the Raventree Estate?</strong> “The estate appeared much as anything in the Feywild does: mortals in the material plane built the building over the course of years, and anything that stands long enough in the material begins to gather a reflection here in the Feywild. However when Elscieth arrived there was a powerful blast of magical energy that damaged the grounds and changed the balance of power.”</p></li><li><p><strong>What happened to the balance of power?</strong> “For a long time there was only one lord in this manor, they moved into this estate ages ago and claimed it for themselves. But when Elscieth arrived she had the ability to manipulate the grounds as she wanted, this immediately threatened the control and authority of the old lord.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Who was the old lord?</strong> \"Doesn't matter anymore. All that they were was consumed by Sylvaria. There was an old lord only insofar as time and history are concerned, they might as well have never existed otherwise. It's the nature of the fey courts. You'll get used to it.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>What happened to Elscieth?</strong> “Power…changes people. She is overcome by the power of her own ambition—as She became Sylvaria, her darker aspects were amplified. Neither I nor Chirneros could bear to watch that lust for power consume her—so we have taken steps to prevent it worsening for as long as we can.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>What’d you do to Sylvaria?</strong> “She slumbers. The tree she rests in is made of dreams, and it holds her in a restful sleep where her mind can explore her desires and aspirations without danger. While she rests there she cannot cause disarray and chaos here. She is allowed to wake for a time—to be with Chirneros, to eat, to try to remember herself as she was.”</p></li></ul>"

The Red Scullion has as sharp a tongue as any being can, though she can blunt it when finessing potential victims. She largely lets her goblin staff have the worst of her beratement, lambasting them for any mistake or shortcoming she sees.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vicious</strong>. The Red Scullion no longer has a place for mercy in her heart. She sacrifices and kills without second thought or any sense of pity. Pleas for mercy and stays of execution fall on deaf ears, and no arguments of morality, honor, or peace will be considered.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conniving</strong>. There is no lie or deception that is off limits to the Red Scullion when it comes to manipulating her victims into the arms of the Revel. She will use any piece of information she can glean against her foes, and lies as easily as she breathes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compromised</strong>. It goes without saying that the Red Scullion is wholly compromised by the Revel. The only reason she hasn’t become a slavering cannibal like the rest of the ravenous hosts is because she had the forethought to protect herself against its dark influence early in their encounters. However, the Revel has long since worked past those defenses and tainted her irrevocably. It is possible that in time she will become just as mindlessly violent and hungry as all other victims.</p></li><li><p><strong>Profane</strong>. Red's once fine grasp on social etiquette was given up years ago, and now is- in a word- atrocious. She uses expletives as punctuation and, often, insults in place of names, sounding as though she learned Common by listening to some of the most foul-mouthed bandits and thugs in some dive bar. She is as rude as the most grizzled and haggard prison guard, and thinks spitting on the floor or cleaning her nails with her teeth mid-sentence is absolutely acceptable practice.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>The Red Scullion is a fey creature that has become horrifically corrupted by exposure to @UUID[.woGc37wUSVI8ot80]{The Revel}'s influence.

While she was known to lure wanderers into her hovel, it was rarely for truly nefarious reasons, mostly to trick them into doing tasks and running errands for her. </p><p>One day she lured in a traveler who was coated in blood and wounds and rambling about his hunger. Promising to feed him for a favor she took him, only to realize he possessed a wild, violent gleam in his eyes. Though he was no danger to her in the end, his sudden attack had caught her so off guard that she was nearly killed on the spot. After the fact, as she rifled through his innards she found the signs of a strange magic on him, something she hadn’t seen before. Curious, she set out to find its source.</p><p>This led her to a campsite filled with corpses brutalized and half eaten, all of them dressed like her attacker. Amidst them was the Revel, a demonic spirit of hunger and violence. She quickly enraptured it with magic to keep it from harming her, and began to study it. In short order she realized that she had a newly formed spiritual presence on her hands, and that if fostered properly, it could serve as an immense source of power for her.</p><p>In the years that followed she fed the Revel the travelers she lured in to help her, no longer releasing them after they did her favors and errands. Gradual exposure to the pernicious presence of the Revel has slowly changed her into what she is today, and now she uses Raventree Manor as a convenient place to protect and nurture her nascent godling.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p><em><strong>Note: </strong>Red has no qualms about sharing her true opinions with the party, although she will hold back information if she believes it could be traded for favors- or used to trick them into joining the Ravenous Host.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>The Goblin Chefs.</strong> \"Lazy, unimaginative idiots.

Once he has gathered all the history and knowledge he will move on. He has not left the Raventree manor yet because he can feel there are pieces of knowledge here that are hidden deep within the earth, yet to be touched by his roots.</p><p>Until that knowledge is found he collects records of the events in the faerie manor and the actions of its courtiers.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Usk Umberdael</strong>. “An odd little fellow, he should not be here and yet, he cannot go.

She has a strong personal code of honor and is keen to do things the right way, no matter how difficult an uphill battle that may be. To her credit, keen judgment paired with a collection of strong allies allows her to pick fights she knows she can win, even though that path to victory isn’t obvious to others. Despite her dogged determination, she is careful not to ask the impossible of those she works with.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Traits</h3><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#discerning-traits]{Discerning Traits} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p>Byscilla has the following traits:</p><ul><li><strong>Practical</strong>. Byscilla is the sort to leave fancy gowns and dresses for social settings, preferring simple and practical clothes that can brave muddy roads and dangerous forests when traveling. She packs light, lives frugally, and favors solutions that get the job done with little mess or cost. She doesn’t like cutting corners, and is willing to take longer to do things the right way once instead of having to redo work later.</li><li><strong>Cunning</strong>. With the help of her father’s family, she quickly learned to be tough, clever, and resourceful - taking advantage of opportunities as they arose, and making allies when possible. Though she doesn’t find any joy in being cutthroat, she does know the value of pressing advantages when holding the upper hand and playing conservatively when on the backfoot.</li><li><strong>Earnest</strong>. Byscilla believes that one should be honest and sincere in all they do, and refuse to take on duties and responsibilities they cannot truly bring themselves to care about. Though she doesn’t find herself bound to common traditions and conventions, she does make sure that she does not betray her own convictions.</li><li><strong>Reasonable</strong>. Despite being raised as a minor-noble (with the privilege that includes), Byscilla had a difficult childhood, having lost her mother at a young age. She also watched her father grapple with this grief, and the difficulties of raising a child alone. This left her with a keen sense of how a single decision or event can throw lives into turmoil. As a result she considers it important to keep one’s word, and remain mindful of how actions affect others.</li><li><strong>Determined</strong>. Once she sets her mind to a task, Byscilla is a force to be reckoned with. She is unyielding and does not consider any amount of failure to be enough to justify 'giving up'. Byscilla isn't willing to sacrifice lives for the cause, but as long as people are still standing she will always lean towards regrouping after a failure, pursuing a problem from another angle.</li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Byscilla was born a bastard to Elscieth Corvinarus and Bartram Rousset, only becoming legitimized some years later when they married in a quiet ceremony that included only a handful of family from both sides. Having slipped past potentially tumultuous waters once already, the future looked bright for the young girl who proved as cunning as she was precocious at her young age. By the time Byscilla was ten, however, her mother left for a family gathering that was meant to only keep her away for a few weeks. These weeks turned to months, then to years. When no sign of her nor the rest of the Corvinarus family could be found, Elscieth was declared lost and Bartram a widower.</p><p>In the years to follow Bartram moved himself and Byscilla closer to the Rousset family, allowing them to avail themselves of the aid of their own blood. This proved a boon, as Byscilla quickly fell in with a gaggle of cousins and aunts who taught her every skill and trick they could, each providing some piece of mentorship to the motherless girl.</p><p>In her early twenties it was revealed that Byscilla was slated to receive a large swath of assets that once belonged to her grandfather and mother, requiring only that she be of fit mind and body, and be at least twenty years old. Almost overnight Byscilla went from the daughter of a minor nobleman to one half of a once powerful merchant alliance.</p><p>This event and the ensuing mountain of legal paperwork led to her meeting a young barrister named Orvinder Danos who was training to specialize in just these sorts of cases. They married a few years after meeting, and found that their mixture of nobility, charm, and idealism made them not only a good pair, but a formidable one at that.</p><p>By her thirties she was a respected scholar of history and the arcane, with a small measure of practical wizardry under her belt and a long shadow cast by the Corvinarus legacy. With the help of Orvinder, she was beginning to wrangle that beast, and make sense of the rat's nest of deeds and purchases that accumulated after two decades of neglect.</p><p>It was during this period that she discovered papers to the old Corvinarus estate which last belonged to her grandfather. By law she was the final inheritor, and filing the paperwork, she set out with her husband to get a lay of the land, and perhaps revive the once storied estate.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul class=\"opinions\"><li><strong>Darius Corvinarus</strong>. “I remember my grandfather being very kind, and I have fond memories of visiting him when I was young. After my grandmother died though, all his warmth and humor drained away. I think that losing my grandmother took everything else from him.”</li><li><strong>Ylana Corvinarus</strong>. “I remember her most clearly when she was sick, even withering away she was, my grandmother was warm and funny, and good hearted until the sickness left her barely able to wake for visitors. I wish I had known her longer and in a better context. Everyone loved her, and my mother only ever had kind words for her.”</li><li><strong>Elscieth Corvinarus</strong>. “I missed her for a very long time, and resented her for abandoning me. It took many years and great efforts from my father to mend those wounds. He helped me realize that my mother wanted nothing more than to create a life for us to live on our terms, free of bitter family rivalries and drama. It's part of why I want to rebuild the Corvinarus family name. I want to do it in her honor. To make the family what it could have been if she had become its head.”</li><li><strong>Kryn Corvinarus</strong>. ”I was told not to speak ill of the dead, but he was an awful man through and through. I have no positive memories of him, and from what I've learned nobody else in the family did either. As far as I can tell he hated all the rest of us, too.“</li><li><strong>Vivesna Loumaal Corvinarus</strong>. “When I first saw her I thought she was the most beautiful person I’d ever met, but once I was left alone with her it became clear how little she liked me. There are things she said to me as a child I wouldn’t repeat to a grown adult in my most angry moments. I will say this: the world is better for her disappearance.”</li><li><strong>Vaxillus Loumaal</strong>. “At the time I knew him I thought he was mean and self-important, but having grown up, and looking back at my own memories I think that he always seemed unhappy and a little trapped. I would have been too, were I stuck with his mother.”</li><li><strong>Usk Umberdael</strong>. “He was always so very sweet and helpful, my mother grew up with him and considered him family. In fact everyone except for my uncle seemed to adore him. It is very sad that he was lost with all the rest, he deserved better than whatever befell the family.”</li><li><strong>Orvinder Danos</strong>.”My husband is a fearless and big hearted man that I love with all my heart. He has never failed to earnestly support me in my endeavors, nor has he faltered in pursuit of his own crusades, tackling both with a tireless zeal and dogged determination I can only aspire to match.”</li><li><strong>Danos Mercenaries</strong>. “Good fellows, all of them. They have served as protectors off and on over the years, guarding us as we travel, when Orvinder becomes embroiled in particularly dicey legal cases, or when I go on some foolish expedition to speak with a subject expert that chose the hermit’s life. I trust them with my life, but am also aware that career soldiers and guards cannot handle the dangers of true adventurers.”</li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Insights</h3><ul><li><strong>What happened at the Raventree Estate?</strong> Honestly I can only guess. Asking about it around town yielded nothing, frustratingly, and all I remember from when I was a girl was hearing that the manor was in ruins and that there were signs of battle. It’s easy to assume that perhaps bandits or assassins were responsible, but the region is a quiet one with little danger, and my family had no enemies.</li><li><strong>What happened after your mother disappeared?</strong> \"My father and I moved on, it was honestly the only choice we had. He did his best to raise me and instill in me a sense of what is good and proper. He didn't remarry for some years, but eventually he did with my blessing. My stepmother is a good woman, and I care for her quite a lot.</li><li><strong>What happened to the Corvinarus Family?</strong> \"It fell on hard times and was heavily propped up by the Anmatar wing of the family. However, they and a few far-flung relatives on our side managed to build it back up. However, my grandfather and mother drew up orders for large portions of control to revert to me on my twentieth birthday.\"</li><li><strong>Are you in charge of the merchant alliance now?</strong> \"Part of it. I control two thirds of the Corvinarus wing of the merchant alliance, and work more closely with the Anmatar family to make sure we're in lockstep. I've delegated much of the day-to-day to people who have spent the last twenty years overseeing the holdings though, as they are best qualified.\"</li><li><strong>What happened to your Grandmother Ylana?</strong> I was very young when she passed, only a few years old, so I’m afraid I know nothing, really. Though from what I was told she loved me very much, and was a gracious and kind woman for all the years she lived. I also know that no amount of magic nor healing could help her.</li><li><strong>What happened to your Grandfather Darius?</strong> After my grandmother’s death he became deeply saddened, and reclusive. It didn’t happen all at once, though. I remember visiting him over the years of his descent, watching my warm and jovial grandfather become cold and distant. I was about eight when we stopped visiting. A few years after that he had a party and everyone vanished.</li><li><strong>What do you remember about the party?</strong> Very little. I remember wanting to go, but being told that I was to stay back with my father, and that my mother would only be gone a few weeks. I recall them talking about it, being concerned about the sudden strangeness of a celebration being hosted after years of silence. I believe now that my mother was wary of the event, and clearly with good reason.</li></ul>"

He is quietly and confidently ready to support his partner, come what may.</li><li><strong>[[/check skill=prc dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Perception)}</strong> Orvinder carries himself with more grace than one might expect of him, he is sure-footed and walks with a smooth cat-like gait.</li><li><strong>[[/check skill=his dc=16 passive=true]]{Intelligence (History)}</strong> Orvinder' garb is not from this region, but is modern and sturdy, meant for travel rather than balls and tea with socialites.</li><li><strong>[[/check skill=med dc=16 passive=true]]{Wisdom (Medicine)}</strong> Orvinder appears to be in very good health, one could confidently assume he goes to lengths to keep himself fit, unlike most nobility. The cane is almost certainly an affectation and not something he needs.</li><li><strong>Proficiency (Martial Weapons)</strong> The cane that Orvinder uses has a catch and cut in it that leads one to believe it might be a hidden cane sword. Furthermore, he doesn't really use the cane to walk.</li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Personality</h2><p>Orvinder is a man of quiet, unshakeable conviction. He is not a loud, bombastic sort, he does not possess great, irresistible charm, nor is he the type who could raise armies or lead revolutions. Yet for all that he lacks in outward, forceful personality he is a man who has won countless allies, who is owed favors far and wide, and has the trust of all who work for him. He does not balk from challenge or hardship, but sees them as challenges and puzzles to navigate through, leaving nobody behind as he does.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Traits</h3><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#discerning-traits]{Discerning Traits} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p>Orvinder has the following traits:</p><ul><li><strong>Honest</strong>. Orvinder at a young age made the decision to make truth an integral part of his existence. He does not lie, and he does not ask others to lie on his behalf. He believes strongly that the truth may hurt, but anything that can be destroyed by the truth probably deserves to be.</li><li><strong>Just</strong>. To Orvinder nothing matters more than justice. To him there are two key truths: Laws must be upheld universally, and unjust laws must be changed into just ones. He has dedicated his life to learning the mechanisms by which he can achieve both of these things.</li><li><strong>Witty.</strong> Having a good understanding of the law isn't quite enough to make one a good lawyer. A little bit of charm and a good amount of dry humor go a long way for people who spend long hours rubbing elbows with nobles and court officials. Orvinder's humor may be dry and a touch sarcastic, but he has learned time and time again that people respect a just man who can wield a rapier wit.</li><li><strong>Brave</strong>. Though he has no outward appearance of it, Orvinder has made a name for himself as a barrister that openly tries cases and argues contracts in defense of common folk and lower classes wronged by those who would be his peers. He has more than once taken on work that men of weaker will would balk at, and does not waver when the powerful would lean on him to bend.</li><li><strong>Generous</strong>. Orvinder gives far more than he ever takes, his servants and guards are paid much better than their peers, and he routinely charges very little to those who cannot afford his services in the courts. He donates what he can spare, and lives frugally as he is able.</li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Orvinder was born to a low-noble house and was raised in the stark, often unpleasant light of reality, being shown how unjust, unfair, and often badly skewed society is for him and those below him. His parents raised him dutifully, seeing that he had the best in education, and shielded him from the worst influences in their circles until he was strong enough to take them on himself. </p><p>His mother, a barrister, felt it vital that her son learn the letters of the laws, and the realities of the courts so that he would never be a victim to either. His father, a landlord, felt it important that he learn to see those below him not as lesser, but folks often put upon by those of higher station wielding greater power.</p><p>Together they armed him with tools necessary to excel in an unjust world, and taught him to wield those tools not only for his own gain, but for the betterment of those around him. As a young man he decided that the law would be his sword, and the downtrodden would be his wards. But cruel worlds rarely have a place for good men, and he spent a decade traveling from practice to court seeking like-minded allies while making countless enemies in the cause of supporting the common person. </p><p>It was during this time of searching he met Byscilla, a wizard and scholar of similar temperament and good nature. They quickly became fast friends, later marrying with the blessing of both their families. Now, Orvinder seeks to begin his own office of barristers, to become a force for good and justice powerful enough to rival those which do the opposite.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Orvinder's decision whether or not to share his opinions are linked with @UUID[.xbxnzgARPDPigG4e]{Byscilla's} approval.</em></p><ul class=\"opinions\"><li><strong>Darius Corvinarus</strong>. “I have only heard stories of him from Byscilla’s family, and it seems that he was once a good and decent man but fell to darkness in a time of hardship. I hope that I could weather such an event better than him, but a part of me worries I might not.”</li><li><strong>Ylana Corvinarus</strong>. “I have never heard an unkind word about her, it seems her passing was a great loss to all who knew her.”</li><li><strong>Elscieth Corvinarus</strong>. “She in part set my beloved Byscilla on her path, and helped shape who she would become. It is a shame that I never had the chance to know her.”</li><li><strong>Kryn Corvinarus</strong>. “I have never heard anything good about this man, and he reminds me very much of the sorts who wield power solely for their own benefit. His vanishing was a boon to the world, cruel as it might be to say that.”</li><li><strong>Byscilla Corvinarus</strong>. “I will never claim that I could not live without her, for that would be a lie. But it would be no exaggeration to claim that had we never met, that my world would not possess half the joy and light that it does now. She is my favorite person in all the world, and I would do most anything she asked without question.”</li><li><strong>Danos Mercenaries</strong>. “Good lads, all of them. I’ve had them on retainer for years, calling on them to keep me and my family safe whenever we get up to something in which our safety is not guaranteed. They are good and honorable soldiers with good records. I know their families personally, and have helped them all in one way or another. They in turn have helped me just as much.”</li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Insights</h3><ul><li><strong>What happened at the Raventree Estate?</strong> “Could not possibly tell you, I’m afraid.

Sadly, Usk has not been at his best since things went wrong at Raventree Estate.</p><p>Usk's soul has been split into pieces, part of it existing in the Feyward Manor, part in the Shadeward Manor, and tattered remnants remaining in the Ruined Manor. This leaves the young elf experiencing his existence in two places at once, which is taking a toll on his composure.

He would rather die than damage his family’s legacy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proud.</strong> Usk is quite proud of his background, his family, and his dutiful service to the Corvinarus family. </p></li><li><p><strong>Reasonable.</strong> Usk, like many of his line, pride themselves on rational thinking, careful planning, properly measure reactions, and doing things to a certain standard or quality. He is loath to rush into things or make rash decisions if he has a choice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Desperate.</strong> Usk is in a rather delicate state with his spirit ripped in two. He is willing to do nearly anything to escape the planes and be made whole. He doesn’t know if the party can help him, but they are the only hope he has right now (Were he not ripped in two, this trait would not apply to him).</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Usk is the third son of a highly respected Umberdael family of elves that have spent centuries serving as advisors, valets, and tutors notable and powerful figures across the lands. His numerous siblings and cousins all hold positions of esteem in courts, and as one of the youngest in the family, Usk was only just beginning his training for a lifetime of respected service to more fleeting institutions. </p><p>For the Umberdael clan the strongest belief is that the long-lived elves must serve as guides and advisors to the other, less long-lived races, as they are uniquely positioned to collect and preserve knowledge that can benefit the world. Usk took this mission to heart and quite eagerly threw himself into his education and preparations.</p><p>At the young age of fifty Usk was sent to serve the Corvinarus family for a few decades to become better acquainted with humans and merchant alliances. He was among one of Darius Corvinarus’ first hires when the Raventree estate was established and he dutifully served the lord and lady quite happily until things went awry.</p><p>He watched Kryn and Elscieth grow up, was at Darius’ side when he lost Ylana, and desperately tried to pull the Lord away from his path of despair in the years leading up to the final days of the estate.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Usk’s opinions are split between his Shadow and Fey sides.

Really more a pet than anything. I suspect she is utterly mad, and service to her patron has not helped.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Tymnas the Groundskeeper</strong>. “A good fellow deserving of far better than what he’s suffered.

She seems to be more at home in the Feyward Manor than she ever did on the material plane.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Sylvaria</strong>. “Cruel, ambitious, and cunning, it is fortunate that the great fairy dragon spends most of her time half asleep in her roost. I strongly believe that something should be done to bring out the person she used to be, but I fear that no one in the fey manor has the means to do so.”</p></li><li><p><strong>The Red Scullion</strong>. “A despicable creature, she preys on the innocent, feeding them to her personal god, or whatever that monster is that occupies the dining hall.

She is a regular guest of the manor, for better or worse.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Thorne and Thystle.</strong> “Immature, petty, and utterly dangerous. They are peerless warriors, and I avoid them as best I am able to.

She is a regal, composed and well-intended person whose interests are in maintaining peace and keeping the manor in good order. It is a shame that so much if the task falls to her, as she is only one person.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Woodfellow the Librarian</strong>. “A pleasant if odd being, utterly accommodating to those seeking knowledge, but also just secretive enough that he is never rendered superfluous.“</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Insights</h3><p><em>For general insights see @UUID[.uJ8F15Har6MVMj6a]</em></p><p>Usk has insight into the following aspects of the world and story:</p><ul><li><p><strong>What happened at the Raventree Estate?</strong> \"I truthfully do not know.

Those with familiarity of the military and mercenary circles recognize the places where insignia and rank were affixed to his armor. Though they have been removed, the marks remain. </li><li><strong>Hargam (Thug) - Wisdom (Insight) or Crime-related Background</strong>. Those with insight into the worlds of crime and piracy would recognize that his numerous tattoos betray a storied history with gangs, bandits, and unsavory sailing vessels.</li><li><strong>Aemenor (Scout) - Intelligence (Religion) or Elf Background</strong>. A collection of wood and bone charms hang from their belt. Those well versed in religion likely recognize that each one is a hand-carved symbol of a god revered by the elven people.</li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Personality</h2><ul><li><strong>Rhak (Orc)</strong>. Gruff, and terse, Rhak is the oldest of the guards and appears largely interested in doing his job and nothing else. He is quiet and contemplative, spending his downtime reading from a book and making notes in a journal.</li><li><strong>Manderaz (Hobgoblin)</strong>. Inarguably the leader of the guard contingent, Manderaz is the most professional of the guards and takes his work very seriously. He does not appear to have free time, confirming that you can take the man out of the military, but you can’t take the military out of the man. Despite this he is generally polite and respectful in all instances where he does not need to be “on” as a bodyguard.</li><li><strong>Hargam (Thug)</strong>. Crass and irreverent, Hargam has all the hallmarks of a career sailor and lowborn thug, but when put to the task of doing his job all that drops away, replaced with single-minded and intimidating focus. In his free time he brews and drinks tea with Aemonor, and seems to hate every moment of it, but never passes up the chance when given.</li><li><strong>Aemenor (Scout)</strong>. Seemingly in competition with Rhak for most quiet of the guards, Aemenor barely speaks to anyone, only conferring with their fellows for clarification on tasks and orders, to report the result of a scouting run, or to ask Hargam if he’d like to have tea. Aemenor is very polite and deferential, if only to escape interacting with people. At times they can be caught fiddling with a half-carved symbol, using a small knife to shape it.</li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><ul><li><strong>Rhak (Orc)</strong>. A once dedicated warrior and champion of his god, Rhak was captured and imprisoned for crimes of raiding and murder. Orvinder was the only one willing to take his case, and in speaking to him at length learned that Rhak was not captured so much as he surrendered after refusing to lay siege to a village. He claims that he had grown tired of the violence done in the name of a god he’d never known, against those who seemed no different than his own people back home. This caused him to be forsaken and attacked on the spot. He single-handedly slew the raiding party that turned on him, then surrendered to the town militia. Orvinder used this to argue that he had defended the town, and won his freedom. He has served the Danos “clan” ever since.</li><li><strong>Manderaz (Hobgoblin)</strong>. Placed before a court on the grounds of misconduct and insubordination, Manderaz saw his entire military career crumbling around him simply because he refused to dishonor his oath to protect the people of his land by withdrawing and leaving fleeing townsfolk to encroaching raiders. Orvinder and his office at the time fought like hell to help Manderaze slip the traitor’s noose. Though he was stripped of his commission and discharged, he at least did so with a clean record. For this he owned the barrister.</li><li><strong>Hargam (Thug)</strong>. Drunk, disorderly and wanted, Hargam was arrested and placed on a fast track to prison or execution. Orvinder met with him and convinced him to turn witness, selling his guild of criminals up the river for a chance to start over. At first Orvinder was told to piss off, but with sobriety came fear and bitter truths: His own fellows had abandoned him to take the fall, he instead took Orvinder’s offer and was cut a deal. He still suffered a miserable year in prison for his crimes, but when he got out Orvinder was waiting with an offer for employment and redemption. Finding the life of crime unappealing, he agreed.</li><li><strong>Aemenor (Scout)</strong>. Charged with heresy by an out of control church, Aemenor’s clan was routed from their ancestral woods and forced to watch as lumbermen began preparing to carve into ancient groves. Some despaired, some begged the courts to uphold the old treaties, and some, like Aemenor, chose resistance, sabotaging the camps and laying traps to waylay efforts. When word reached them that a human barrister had dug up the old treaties and forced the powers that be to recognize them Aemenor sought him out and pledged their service until one of them reached their hundredth year.</li></ul>"

While it’s not impossible to catch her out and put her on the backfoot, she is very good at adapting situations to achieve her goals. She will unfailingly use every resource at her disposal to accomplish an end she has decided to pursue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambitious.</strong> Sylvaria wants more power, station and control as the master of the manor. She is more than willing to carry out acts of evil to bring her desires to fruition—the ends justify the means, and she will forge alliances to get what she wants, even if it means betraying allies too weak to oppose her.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cunning</strong>. Tempering the realities of her situation with her ambitions, Sylvaria makes every move count, and does nothing by half measures. She is careful not to overcommit, but never fails to press an advantage when an enemy shows its throat in one way or another. She does have a tendency to consider her own interests heedless of anything else, however.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decisive</strong>. Unflinching and direct, Sylvaria has an innate knack for seeing the possible courses of action to resolve any situation. She is quick to choose between them, and once her path has been chosen she does not regret whatever she must do to reach that end. If a path is shut off to her, it rarely slows her down, as she is quick to make informed decisions about which path is next best.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><ul class=\"opinions\"><li><p><strong>Darius Corvinarus.</strong> “We knew him, once.

As such, they are generally very friendly, outgoing, and charming, at least when there is a reason to be. When faced with people who are annoying or inconvenient, Herniva can become incredibly catty, petty, and mean, picking apart the person’s personality or appearance for maximum hurt. Worse still, Herniva is slow to admit wrongdoing and generally blames others for provoking cattiness.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Traits</h3><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#discerning-traits]{Discerning Traits} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p>Herniva has the following traits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Charming</strong>. Herniva is immensely charming and friendly, and easy to like, when they have a mind to be. The mermaid is naturally good with people and quite insightful when it comes to figuring out how to get along with others, or manipulate them to do something. </p></li><li><p><strong>Petty</strong>. When slighted, insulted, or wronged, Herniva can become perilously petty to the point where they undermine anything the target of her ire does, even openly mocking and deriding them to the point of outrage. This of course is done solely to make them look bad, as they are generally careful and socially skilled enough to come away looking like the victim, not the instigator.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gossiper</strong>.  Herniva changed their whole way of life simply to get access to more interesting stories and gossip. They could have lived a simple life of drowning sailors, but instead drift between faerie courts just to hear about who has done what to whom for whatever reason. Any bit of secret, juicy, or tantalizing info someone has is enough to bait them with, and they are can be a valuable source of insight in return.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decent</strong>. Herniva will do the right thing when all other options have been exhausted. They are perfectly capable of admitting wrongdoing, being the bigger person, apologizing, and all such things. The issue is that they don't want to, and resist it until they have no other choice.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Herniva was born in the depths of a fey sea, where the glittering light of the everdawn could barely reach. Alongside innumerable siblings they learned of arcane currents and secret grottoes, places from which to draw power and to enter into the material world. Herniva grew up playing among these currents, hunting prey in the material plane, and taking part in great games to lure sailors off course.</p><p>Growing into adulthood, they began to explore the endless waterways of the Feywild, traveling along rivers, canals, and through great mazes of flooded caves where no light or air-loving being had ever touched. This led Herniva to visit the courts and strongholds of many fey lords, and gave opportunity to frolic in hidden ponds and lakes surrounded by ancient groves and forests filled with dryads, spriggans, and treants. The excitement of exploration and the friends that Herniva has made along the way mean that they have very little interest in returning to a life of drowning sailors or sinking ships.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Opinions</h2><p class=\"important\">See @UUID[.owQzCUTqLpvjpaaI#gathering-opinions]{Gathering Opinions} for details on learning more about this NPC.</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong>: As a gossip, Herniva requires very little encouragement to talk about others, and never shares her actual opinion or insight, preferring to only swim in the murky waters of rumor, hearsay, and scuttlebutt.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Usk Umberdael</strong>. “Pretty elf boy from the material plane?

I’ve known her for years and I love her. She’s got all the best gossip and news, and she always wants to hear where I’ve been.

Far too stuffy for people so tiny.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Stuckina</strong>. “She can go to hell is what I think. She’s ugly, she stinks of fish, she’s mean, and she’s ugly. Her kind ruin the depths and make gross nests out of nice sea caves. The waters would be better without their type.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Sylvaria</strong>. “The new dragon lord?

In this case they are a band of militant groundskeepers fighting the good fight against the chaotic estate grounds that refuse to be tamed.</p><p>In general interactions with others they are almost universally peace loving and friendly, if a bit stiff and overly professional.

They are punctual, and organized with a clear rank structure, though the details seem to be obvious only to them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protective</strong>. Sprites have long been the forest’s protectors, and for this militant band of groundskeepers, they take their duty seriously. The grounds of the manor are theirs to protect, and their top priority, whatever problems they can't tackle head on they'll attempt to find a strategy for.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fierce</strong>. For their tiny size, these sprites know no fear and are more than willing to take on foes many times their size- which is pretty much everything. They are always ready to take up arms to fight the good fight on a moment's notice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Friendly</strong>. Sprites believe that heroes and protectors must be good people, otherwise they become sources of misery for the very people they strive to protect. To this end, the sprites all endeavor to be good, decent folk to get on well with those around them. They are generally successful in this, though sometimes bad neighbors make this difficult.</p></li><li><p><strong>Earnest</strong>. The sprites are absolutely honest in their design to protect the forest, fey lands, and denizens of both. They believe in battling evil as a cause that drives them in life, more than a simple calling, it is their way of life.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Sprites are ancient protectors of forests both in the Feywild and the material plane.

They, like other elite bands, tend to guard locations that have large numbers of local fey transit points, recognizing they are places where interlopers and monsters tend to congregate.</p><p>They were all hand selected by their peers to join these ranks, and in their villages they raise whole generations of new sprites with the aim of picking the best, brightest, and most good hearted to join their elite numbers.

Stuckina was once a decent person who was kind and well meaning, but she was tricked and warped into a hag. Now she struggles with the magical darkness within her that drives her toward self-centered evils. Though she is desperately attempting to hold onto her original ideals, they are slowly slipping from her little by little.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reclusive</strong>. Though she was always a bit of a shut-in before being cursed, Stuckina never avoided people entirely, she had a town to look after as an apothecary, and hermits don’t do well in the school of business. However, since being cursed she feels an unnatural drive to sink herself into the black depths of the sea, hiding in caves and grottos where no light reaches.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tortured</strong>. Stuckina wants nothing more than to be returned to her human state, but she’s barely holding on against the dark curse taking hold of her. She doesn’t know where to begin trying to break her curse, and her dark impulses and tendency to lash out make it hard for her to reach out for help.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intelligent</strong>. Stuckina was once an expert herbalist and alchemist, highly educated and well versed in survival. She was a business owner and head of her family, but much of this has been stripped away by a curse that's left her a hunched over, cave dwelling hag desperately looking for a solution to a curse that's eating away at her very personality.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Background</h2><p>Once a highly trained and competent herbalist and alchemist, Stuckina Boggs was the former owner and operator of Aul Nan's Apothecary in the town of Ferncombe, a small town in the vicinity of the Raventree estate. She took the location over when her mother passed away, and proudly operated it for years until one day she went hunting for materials along a nearby river. Something reached out of the water, seized her wrist, and dragged her into the water. The normally lazy river transformed into a deep, roiling torrent of water the instant she hit the surface.</p><p>As she was dragged down below the racing rapids into its depths she saw the golden light above vanish. She was drowned in the swirling blackness of this strange, bottomless river, only to awaken in a grotto dimly lit by bioluminescent fungus. Hacking up sea water she stumbled about, seeking an exit, but could find nothing of the sort.</p><p>Huddled in a corner, sore, tired, soaked and afraid she felt a terrible pain worm through her body. Laying on the wet stone of that grotto she screamed in agony as her body was warped from the inside out. Stumbling to the edge of the grotto she peered through the gloom into the water’s edge, trying to get a glimpse of what was happening to her. What peered back was a horrible monster.</p><p>Feeling her lungs burn with panic she leapt into the water and swam desperately, trying to find some escape. What she found instead was a vast sea stretching to all corners of the horizon under a vast pastel sky. An endless ocean in the Feywild had become her home.</p><p>Eventually she found a sunken passage that led to the old waters of the Raventree estate, and there she met Saedia, who saw the person suffering beneath the fey curse, and took pity on her.

His designs were rudimentary, and oriented to travel, but I think Olforth was onto something fundamentally important to my own intent, and proper adaptation of the ritae contained within his work may prove essential to furthering my own.</p><p>Olforth's near-rhyming pedantry is difficult to decipher but there are pieces of invaluable information nestled within.

The former is active, the latter passive.</p><p>First and foremost the essence which runs in all things, and through all things, comes and goes away bright, it is in all things bright, and at the same time shadowed and unknown. These pieces of what make us whole is assembled by the parts of a greater essence, shone through a lens into our world which, as it condenses, composes that which is the stuff that makes us. This essential energy, when it is by it self (no other matter coming to it, in which it should manifest its proper action) is boundless, and invisible, of itself sufficient for every action that is proper to it, moveable, and yielding itself after a manner to all things that come next to it.</p><p>The essences known have a renewing, guarding nature, and can be understood as inherent, never dissipating nor collapsing, eternal. Others have noted them in detail, with their heavens and their hells and their dynamics and their statics and their lights and their shadows and their order and their chaos. What they do not comprehend is that any energy which perpetually flows is itself perpetual, and thus limitless. Portals between realms then are sustained not by our own ethereal energy but by that which is perpetually flowing from out of the realm such a binding connects to. Such a binding does not stand in need of another, secretly increasing of itself, and manifests its greatness to things that receive it.</p><p>The ritual to compose such a portal is carefully balanced against stars and their geometries, shaped by line and circle, held in check by crystal, chalk, fire, ash, stone, and whatever essential materials most closely aligned with the realm from which the portal and its energies shall flow. All the stars and their peculiar natures, properties, and conditions must be accounted for when composing the seals and characters or the rays of essence of the planes will not adequately form to bind the sigil set. About and within the circles, in opposition to one another, place the signs and markings of those planes which in opposition stand, omitting the signs of our realm and the sign of the plane to which the tether shall adhere. </p></blockquote><p>I believe for this to be successful I should need to harness the energies described here by way of some sort of edifice. By assembling suitable methods of focusing the energy, it should be possible to direct it into separate locus, where (if it can be suitably contained) I should be able to empower other…</p><p class=\"annotation\">The page is torn below this point.</p>"

Aside from being hopefully interesting to curious players, they also have several hints about key aspects and secret endings available in the adventure.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Is the Research useful?</h3><p>The data contained in the pages is meant to represent a deep cut into Darius' work, but is not at all comprehensive enough for a player to use. It's not intended that players could recreate his work. However, as the GM, you are free to decide otherwise, and use this as the basis for a player to explore the concepts of manipulating planar energies.</p><h2>What are the Planar Pearls?</h2><p>These are items that have been placed into the game world by Darius and have been sitting and collecting planar energy for decades. They were hidden in the three ancient trees at the three groves on the three different planes. And yes, the players can go find them if they want to!</p><h3 class=\"border\">Discovering the Pearls Exist</h3><p>Planar Pearls are well hidden, both physically in the trees that hold them, and by the natural magic the surrounds and flows through them. On the shadow and fey planes the masters of the manor are aware of them (Kryn and Elscieth/Sylvaria respectively) but they likely have left them in place until they are needed.</p><p>The Party can discover not only the existence but the location of them through the journal entries listed above, specifically the @UUID[JournalEntry.RhllE2L6PEe9jLh6.JournalEntryPage.vPWer0O82Cj0D5do]{Accretion Sites} entry. However, knowing about isn't so easy, as in most cases the pearls are protected by hostile entities, and the planar masters are likely to notice they have been taken.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Sensing the Pearls</h3><p>Detect Magic may reveal the presence of powerful magical artifacts in the trees. Additionally, party members that have connections to fey, shadow, or undead magic may have a chance to sense the flows of magic nearby. For example, a warlock with a shadow or undead patron might naturally sense the magic of the shadow orb with a Perception check. Or an elf with fey lineage might sense the flow of energy above Sylvaria's sleeping form.</p><p>This is up to you as the GM to decide on, but is a possible way of discovering the pearls without needing to have read or understood Darius' research first.</p><h2>Recovering the Pearls</h2><p>The pearls can be claimed from their resting places rather easily once the party knows about their existence, however this often requires defeating the hostile entities located around the trees first.</p><p>In the case of Sylvaria and Kryn, it's also possible for them to give the party the pearls if they agree to help the siblings with their task of defeating the other. While possible to deceive both of them, it's a risky game to play and one that could turn them hostile if not handled well.</p><p>Elscieth, seeing as she does not want command of the material manor, has no designs on the acorn pearl, and is willing to give it to a party that has shown they are good, decent people who have made efforts to aid the fey manor with minimal bloodshed and destruction.</p><p>She could also be convinced to turn over the pearl if they party has a plan to use the acorn to save Usk and free the trapped denizens of the manors.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Ruined Manor</h3><p><strong>Planar Pearl</strong>: @UUID[Item.fBQzwjHj7keVFf7f]{Effigy of Remembrance}</p><p>This pearl is hidden in a web-covered knot of the @UUID[JournalEntry.fnNToxGl9e4bBlrv.JournalEntryPage.JezR262gGav5xh6t]{R38.

This item is integral to Sylvaria's plans, but can also help the party achieve their own ends.</p><h2>What are the Secret Endings?</h2><p>There are technically three secret or obscured endings which the party can uncover. Only one of them is contained in the arcane pages, while the other is hinted at in the rest of @UUID[JournalEntry.RhllE2L6PEe9jLh6]{The Journal of Lord Darius Corvinarus}.</p><h3 class=\"border\">A House United</h3><p>By collecting all three of the planar pearls, the essences of the three planes, the party can create a perfected piece of @UUID[JournalEntry.RhllE2L6PEe9jLh6.JournalEntryPage.lp7h10U7i5URsiF9]{Quintessence} which is a powerful composite of three planar energy types. With it they can restore the manor to its original state. This is detailed in @UUID[JournalEntry.JQTx5TJdy2fWcADT.JournalEntryPage.MdLIL1sn839wFuZJ#a-house-united]{A House United}.</p><p><strong>Warning</strong>: As noted in the above link, this eradicates the other manors to repair the house. This should not be an ending a party takes if they want to spare one or both of the manors and its denizens.</p><h3 class=\"border\">A Division Preserved</h3><p>In the journal entries, specifically @UUID[.K99rj77f9GGUnMmI]{On Tethered Planes}, and @UUID[.phY0AlsI8DFeEPuo]{On Planar Threading} Darius talks about using arcane tethers to anchor a dimension in place. This could lead the party to deduct that by destroying the tethering crystals in his planar sanctum, they could break the planes away from each other. This would be a correct assumption, and by destroying the tethering crystals in the planar sanctum they can achieve the @UUID[JournalEntry.JQTx5TJdy2fWcADT.JournalEntryPage.MdLIL1sn839wFuZJ#division-preserved]{Division Preserved} ending, which allows for the houses to be deposited into their planes. While this doesn't repair the ruined manor, it does leave the shadow manor and fey manors in their planes.</p><p>This is good for a party that wants to spare one or both of the houses and its denizens, or for a party that wants to claim one of the planar houses after clearing out its previous inhabitants, while also handing over the ruined manor to someone else.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Save Ylana and Darius</h3><p>Contained in the greater body of notes are a series of hints and clues that some greater plot was at hand when it came to Ylana's untimely demise and Darius' plans. While you might be aware of the @UUID[JournalEntry.OIfGrskfmsmysKc5]{History of House Corvinarus}, there are certainly gaps in what the party knows.</p><p>However, they may have begun to suspect that Kryn and Vivesna had a hand in things. With these notes in hand they can begin to press the masked wizard about what she knows, either forcing or finessing information out of her (see @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.CHPlHOdAOkk9F3l4#about-ylana-and-her-soul]{About Ylana and her Soul}).</p><p>This can lead the party to a whole sub-story of the adventure that we've left breadcrumbs for. While there's no official content available for this story, it does open the way for you to explore the world with this party beyond the completion of this adventure, and let the party really stick it to Vivesna.</p><p>Not only that, but if she survived the events in the main story, she might even have escaped and can become a new villain to contend with as the party tries to get Ylana's soul back to truly rebuild the Corvinarus family.</p><p>This is, of course, highly optional, but the seeds and knowledge are here for you to plant amongst your players if you want to.</p>"

That's the question that has been plaguing me most. Are the pieces of my memories of that dinner real, or am I the memory, being thought back on by some future me?</p><p>I think that it happened like this:</p><p>My painting of Ylana was covered on the easel, to be unveiled during tea once desert had settled and people were feeling more relaxed. It had taken me months— I am sure it was one of my finest. I think Darius would have loved it.</p><p>We had just finished a creamy soup with a delightful sherry, and fresh fish from nearby Ferncombe was being served topped with some sort of sliced citrus. I remember, because the smell was sweet and pleasing. I wasn't in a place of particular honor, which suited me fine, I didn't like the way that Vaxillus leered at me. An argument had broken out at the other end of the table— Kryn and his sister, and not for the first time that day. Something got shouted and I think someone broke a glass.</p><p>Something slammed on the table and I almost knocked my wine over. The room got very quiet then, no one knew where to look. I watched Darius—he had been such a kind man once, but he looked—it would have been easier to draw him than put words to it.</p><p>I remember the sound of him clearing his throat in the silent room, and waving the servants away with his fish. I suppose the argument must have gotten to him. The room was very tense and I was thankful to be able to hide my discomfort behind my glass. He gave a little speech, I wish I could remember all of the words.</p><p>What I do remember is the reaction.</p><p>He said something like: \"This was to be a day to remember your mother, My Ylana, and you have made a mockery of it. I find your manners wanting and your behaviour disappointing. If this is to be the legacy of House Corvinarus, neither of you deserve to be my heir.\" There were gasps then, and I remember noticing that Kryn had stood, in that way he has that makes you feel very small and insignificant.</p><p>Only it didn't work on Darius. The Lord was very calm. He was angry, certainly, that much was obvious, but not uncontrolled.</p><p>The thing I remember most vividly is his smile. It was a very mean smile. Even though he was looking at his own son, it was like he was looking at a beggar on the street. A sickly smile. Derisive.</p><p>Kryn said something then, challenging. I don't recall what exactly, but I do remember he was asking if Darius would betray his own children, who should inherit, the servants?</p><p>And then Darius said he could think of no one he would hold up as a more true and loyal friend than his butler, Usk, and that yes, Usk would be the new Lord of Raventree Estate.</p><p>Kryn threw a glass at him then. Or perhaps it was Vivesna. It could even have been Elscieth- I just remember the glass shattering against the mantle. Everything happened so fast after that— Explosions and fire. Screaming and shouting. I don't know what possessed me— I just couldn't let them destroy the painting, it had taken me months—and I ran.</p><p>Through the shouting and the lighting and the fire and the screaming and the bodies of people trying to get away I ran. Ylana's painting was in my hands- Darius just behind me, magics flying about everywhere. I thought for sure they'd kill one another, or me— but I had worked so hard on it.</p><p>I remember gripping the velvet cloth tightly— I don't think I'd ever been so afraid in my whole life. I remember turning around to run for the kitchen—but I lost my balance, or I thought I did. I think something blew up. The table wasn't really there anymore, it had moved and it was on its side.</p><p>I remember thinking to myself \"I didn't get to taste the fish.\"</p><p>I remember it was very dark when I woke up.</p><p>And that is what I remember of the dinner.</p>"

Within the grounds of the old estate, however, their exploration begins to take a turn. The party will quickly realize that something horrible happened in this place and the missing members of the Corvinarus family are not gone, nor have they forgotten their sins against each other.</p><section class=\"box-text hazard\"><header><h4>Content Warning</h4></header><article><p>A House Divided contains some events or subject matter which may be uncomfortable for some gamemasters or players. Like most 5th edition adventures, A House Divided contains combat encounters which depict sequences of violence. Additionally, the adventure includes certain events which portray body horror, cannibalism, death, familial and emotional abuse, supernatural horror, human experimentation, murder, kidnapping, mind control, ghostly possession, torture, and large spiders.</p><p>We have done our best to ensure that none of these topics are overly gratuitous in their presentation or needlessly gruesome in detail, but we advise gamemasters to be cautious and aware of triggers which may cause discomfort at the table.</p><p>The purpose of tabletop roleplaying games is to have fun experiencing a unique adventure and story together as a collaborative storytelling experience. It is important to talk to your players before beginning the adventure, and modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate to avoid content that the party might be uncomfortable with. Use of Tabletop RPG safety tools such as <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg\" title=\"X-Card: Safety Tools for Simulations and Role-Playing Games\">X-card by John Stavropoulos </a>is a common way to address this. We encourage Gamemasters to work with your players and adjust content as needed to ensure the game is fun for everyone.</p></article></section><p>This adventure begins with strong horror elements but quickly turns into a plane-jumping adventure of family drama, ambition, mystery, violence, betrayal, redemption, and more.</p><p>The player characters will find themselves jumping between planes occupied by grim shadows and planes filled with the chaotic fey, navigating a cast of characters with their own problems and ambitions, with the adventurers becoming increasingly involved as time goes on.</p><p>Ultimately it is up to the party to decide if they will help settle matters in the Corvinarus family, make things worse, or turn against all parties and claim the manor and its lands for themselves.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Party Creation Guidance</h2><p>This adventure is designed for a group of 4-6 player characters starting at level 5 which will advance to level 9 over the course of the adventure. If the players are focused on completing every possible task, encounter, or milestone, the contents may carry them into the 10th level. As encounters and checks have been balanced around that starting point, characters beginning lower than level 3 or higher than level 8 are unlikely to be appropriately challenged by the content, and may have a negative experience as a result.</p><p>Gamemasters are encouraged to organize their groups and run their sessions as they see fit, but the we offer the following recommendations that may help provide an ideal experience:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Indiscriminate Murder is Counter-Productive.</strong> A House Divided contains a wide variety of social encounters which will be made much more difficult by characters whose first solution to every meeting is violence. The adventure has been written to anticipate the case that the party treats every NPC as hostile— but this is not an easy path.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manners Maketh Man. </strong>Many NPCs written for A House Divided have been carefully crafted to have their own personalities, motivations, likes and dislikes. As the adventure includes an @UUID[.WqZYuB8H66TiCGYH]{Approval System} for tracking the way NPCs view the party, having every meeting with an NPC begin on the wrong foot due to disrespect and lack of etiquette can make navigating the adventure more difficult. In some cases, open disrespect can even result in immediate violent altercation against powerful foes which could potentially end the adventure (and the party) early.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magical Mystery Tour.</strong> This adventure centers around an eclectic family of spellcasters and their efforts to attain power through arcane and occult rituals. The adventure is designed to offer multiple ways to solve problems, it is ideal for there to be at least one character in the party with interest and proficiency in Arcana.</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Non-linear Adventure</h2><p>A House Divided is a large adventure that spans 24 different Scenes across four different planes of existence. The party has a considerable amount of freedom to tackle exploration and quests in the order and manner of their own choosing. Completing the adventure will require the party to backtrack and revisit locations to get everything done, with multiple quests that can only be resolved by traveling to a different plane first. There are also quests which only become available once specific criteria are unlocked elsewhere.</p><p>Regardless of how the party approaches these quests, their actions all lead toward final events in each plane, where they make allies or enemies of that region's rulers. While it’s possible to play both sides, ultimately a choice will need to be made: help or turn on the family members. Which alliances the party forges is up to them!</p><h3 class=\"border\">Violent or Peaceful Resolution</h3><p>A House Divided has various quests that directly involve combat, but there are also many quests where combat can be avoided and is in fact the preferred outcome. A party interested in keeping body counts low will be able to avoid combat under most circumstances and will find several NPCs favor them for doing so. That being said, not all instances of violence and death can be avoided in the landscape of treachery and ambition that is the Raventree Estate.</p><p>Quests where non-violent solutions are preferred will be clearly marked in the quest breakdowns found in the quest journal for each plane. </p><h2 class=\"border\">Prevalent Themes</h2><p>This adventure explores the following themes:</p><ul><li><strong>Family Drama.</strong> The years have not been kind to the Corvinarus family, and the party will directly experience the ruin they’ve brought on themselves. This adventure revolves around the fate of the family members who were caught in the middle of a family drama that even to this day they haven’t managed to escape. If using @UUID[.OMwWzsxyMmnx6wQo#the-last-heir-to-raventree]{The Last Heir to Raventree} plot hook, this extends even to the last living member of the family seeking to reclaim their heritage learn the fate of her mother.</li><li><strong>Betrayal &amp; Ambition</strong>. A House Divided has recurring themes of ambition and betrayal woven into the actions and motives of the major NPCs. The Corvinarus family has executed more than its fair share of betrayals, often in pursuit of some goal or desire, and the characters will begin to see what these decisions have wrought.</li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Gameplay Pillars</h3><p>The core of A House Divided revolves around the following pillars:</p><ul><li><strong>Exploration</strong>. The Raventree Estate is a sprawling location with immense floors, extensive grounds with a hedge maze, and a vast woodland clearing, all of which exist in three planes. Players will have a vast amount of area to explore, numerous points of interest to investigate, with items and valuable information hidden throughout the adventure.</li><li><strong>Decisions</strong>. Nearly every quest and storyline in the adventure is designed with multiple possible solutions, many of which do not require combat, and in some cases violence is not the preferred method of resolution. In addition to this, who the players help and how they resolve questlines will also change the opinions of the NPC cast, affecting how much they are willing to work with the player characters.</li><li><strong>Social Maneuvering</strong>. In order to obtain the information and resources needed to resolve the main storyline the party will have to navigate a web of complex relationships between non-player characters and choose carefully who they help and whom they betray.</li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Inspirational Media</h3><p>In the creation of A House Divided, our team drew inspiration from a number of sources in popular media.

If you simply press play on one playlist and let it run for the entirety of a game session, both you and your players will become disinterested in the sound experience and stop listening.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Idle Time to Change the Soundscape.</strong> While players discuss their next steps or argue about the best way to handle a situation, this provides you a perfect opportunity to make sure the soundscape best fits their current environment. All playlists have been configured with a fade duration, allowing you to press stop on one playlist and play on another to blend them together more smoothly while the players are distracted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audio Cues Are Important.</strong> Whether the party is exploring the Ruined Manor or wandering the halls of its planar representations, there are many opportunities to change how the players are experiencing their current situation and offer clues to what may be occurring. Look for opportunities to use subtle audio cues that the players are being watched by an enemy, or that the NPC is plotting something, or that something dangerous is approaching.</p></li></ul>"

While unclaimed land is nothing special in and of itself, the land apparently has a huge abandoned estate on it.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>It was barely something one might consider important if they hadn't been paying attention— an off-handed comment between two drunkards lamenting the abandonment of a nearby parcel of land.</p><blockquote><p>What a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">waste</span></span>.</p></blockquote><p>One said, muttered into his stout.</p><blockquote><p>All that land, sittin' there, great big house— and for what? so some noble jackass can say 'I own an estate out east.<span style=\"font-family:\"><em>'</em></span></p></blockquote><p>The other, shaking his head vehemently.</p><blockquote><p>I heard it's up for auction, if anyone can 'maintain' it.</p></blockquote><p>The first man spoke, emphatically.</p><blockquote><p>And who's got the money?

But they're waiving tax.

The reality is that nobody goes up to old Raventree Estate because there's nothing to see but an old rotting building. On top of that, getting there is a royal pain due to the lack of a road. So really all the locals have are some chilling tales of made-up horrors, and some old memories from folks that made the trek a decade ago out of curiosity.</p><p>Despite that, most have a creepy story they heard from a father, uncle, grandfather or brother about the place, and are perfectly happy staying the hell away from it.</p><section class=\"box-text investigation\"><header><h4>Rumors of Ruin</h4></header><article><p>A bout of ravenous curiosity has driven the party to come sniffing about, possibly for adventure, possibly for treasure, possibly to learn the truth of what transpired at the haunted manor.</p><ul><li>Local explorers and would-be adventurers have gone up there only to come back raving about ghosts and monsters.

She was only ten years old at the time of her mother’s disappearance, visiting with family while her mother attended a family function far away. Twenty years later she’s come to reclaim her inheritance, and has contracted the party as a band of stout adventurers she feels will be better suited to the task than her personal retinue of guards.</p><p>Reading through the letter presents the selected adventurer with the following text, addressed to them by name, offering them a job:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Your name has been recommended to me as a potential candidate for handling a private matter of utmost personal importance. I am the inheritor of a manor in a distant region, and require stout adventurers to assist in the survey and securing of its grounds. As a show of good faith in your capabilities and suitability for this task, I will pay the modest travel expenses for you and your compatriots so that we might meet to negotiate engaging your services.</p><p>As the presence, number and potential threat of any denizens within my future estate are unknown, this job comes with generous and negotiable payment. My initial proposal is that a simple scouting the manor will yield [[/award 200g]], with additional pay provided on proof of hazards, and more in return for removal of those hazards.</p><p>If you would like to accept this work, please respond via the courier that brought this message, and you will be provided the necessary details for where myself and my husband may be found in order to further detail this expedition.</p><p>Additionally, if you have any adventurers you enjoy working with and can vouch for as stalwart companions in this task, please recommend them in your reply and they will be considered as part of the company being assembled for this task.</p><p>Kindest Regards,</p><p>Byscilla Corvinarus-Danos</p></section><p>Byscilla is willing to pay several thousand gold to each adventurer who joins in the task to have the manor cleared of danger. Depending on how much the party reveals to her of their findings, she may request help driving out Darius to become the new master, and she might become invested in being reunited with her long-lost mother (even if briefly).</p><p>Aiding her will result in the Corvinarus family being reinstated locally, and will earn the party wealthy allies connected to the mercantile world in the process.</p><h3 class=\"border\">A New Challenger Appears</h3><p>If the Last Heir to Raventree plot hook <strong>is not</strong> used as the lead-in for the adventure, we recommend you introduce Byscilla, Orvinder and company about midway through the adventure. Her presence could provide much needed context and support, or it could create a new, dramatic turn which heightens the family drama at play.</p><p>The reasons for Byscilla and Orvinder's arrival could easily be explained, as well. Either they are arriving to claim the manor as discussed in the above plot hook, and are still looking to hire adventurers, but hadn't gotten around to it yet.</p><p>Alternatively, they might have arrived on the back of rumors about activity around the old Raventree Estate. In this case, they've come to investigate, since that's technically a property owned by Byscilla, but one which she hadn't gotten around to working on yet.</p><h4>Friend or Foe?</h4><p>On the one hand, she does have legal claim to the manor, and is more than willing to pay the party for their efforts clearing it out for her. On the other, she may represent an outside party attempting to take what the party feels is theirs. Her presence might also create a wrinkle if the party was already planning to side with one of the other major NPCs in the planar manors.</p><p>In either case, it is up to the party to decide how they want to deal with her. She could make for a good ally, and would happily step in to help fund and support the party's endeavors if they wanted to work for her. Or she could prove a dauntless foe with money, influence, and connections enough to make their lives exceedingly difficult when trying to rebuild and establish the manor in the region.</p><p>Ultimately, Byscilla and Orvinder are not bad people, and should not be presented as villains, but they could easily end up as unwanted opposition to the player's agenda if the goal is to keep the manor. The couple would, after all, be attempting to stop a party of strangers trying to steal Byscilla's birthright.</p><h2 class=\"border\">The Lost Child of Corvinarus</h2><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>A messenger arrives, seeking you out by name. The young fellow is wiry and polite, confirming your name before handing over a sealed envelope.</p><p>Fixed with a seal that you do not recognize, you pry away the wax and withdraw a collection of documents detailing your connection to the Corvinarus family, and more importantly, the deed to a parcel of land in a distant wooded region.</p><p>In detail, the papers state that the Raventree Estate, which includes several acres of land, a three-story manor, and outbuildings is yours to claim. The estate was built decades ago, and per the letters, abandoned after some sort of incident that isn't specified in the pages you have.</p><p>The last known deed holder was one Darius Corvinarus, former head of the Corvinarus wing of the Corvinarus-Annmatar trade family. He and all descendants vanished some 20 years ago, and the manor was left to fall into ruin. It names you the sole surviving member of the Corvinarus line, and no matter how tenuous that familial tie is, you have claim to the manor.</p><p>To accept this land as your own you need only sign the documents attached and send them back by way of the courier that delivered the package. After that it is yours to do with as you please, though the state of the manor is unknown.</p><p>A map is provided detailing the location, and the three week journey needed to reach it.</p></section><p>The Corvinarus family is made up of Humans, and as such any human or half-human character could be revealed as a long-lost or illegitimate child of the Corvinarus family. They could be the child of Elscieth, Kryn or even Darius himself. There are some logical age restrictions for this, and characters need to have been alive before the events that occurred in the manor, as such the character needs to be at least 21 years old.</p><p>The eligible descendant should be given a set of documents and papers indicating their birth parent, and that the Raventree Manor is to pass to the oldest descendant of Darius Corvinarus, former lord of Raventree Manor. This will make them related to all of the Corvinarus NPCs in the adventure— though doesn't necessarily require knowledge of those characters. There are many reasons the members of the Corvinarus family might not want their relatives to know about the existence of a child.</p>"

Do not read further if you wish to remain unsullied.</p><p><em>A House Divided</em> can be roughly characterized as having three major acts. Over the course of the adventure, characters should advance from level 5 to level 9.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Act I - Early Game</h2><p>In the early game the party will conduct an investigation into the mysterious Raventree Estate, encountering various cursed denizens and environmental perils while trying to piece together what happened here. During this exploration they receive strange visitations by a shadowy figure who later calls for their assistance. Exploration of the Ruined Manor culminates with a dangerous encounter in the Dining Hall and a narrow escape through a magic portal into another realm.</p><p>The heroes are introduced to Usk, the butler of Raventree Manor, and learn that disappearance at Raventree Estate is no simple haunting and that the manor is, in fact, fractured between multiple planes of existence. The party has opportunities to explore the Shadeward Manor and Feyward Manor and become introduced to the cast of characters who dwell within. After performing some services to begin winning acceptance, the party will have the opportunity to meet the rulers of the manor and learn more about its cursed condition.</p><p class=\"important\">These early stages of the adventure will generally advance characters from level 5 to level 7.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Act II - Mid-Game</h2><p>In the Feyward Manor, the party will assist Saedia with a variety of local concerns until they gain access to visit with Lord Chirneros and Lady Elscieth. The rulers of the Feyward Manor have troubles of their own due to Elscieth's strange condition and a demonic spirit of debauchery which has cast the Feyward Manor further into chaos. By aiding Lady Elscieth and Lord Chirneros and earning their trust, the party learns of the true menace which afflicts the manor and how to confront it.</p><p>In the Shadeward Manor, the party will meet its dysfunctional family and either assist or thwart their conniving agendas. The party will eventually earn the interest of Lord Kryn and Lady Vivesna who will enlist the heroes to help them escape their eternal prison. Having proven themselves capable and trustworthy, the party will be entrusted with the secrets of Raventree Estate and the means to end its torment.</p><p class=\"important\">These middle stages of the adventure will generally advance characters from level 7 to level 8.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Act III - Late Game</h2><p>Once the party has gained the approval and trust of the rulers of either the Shadeward Manor or Feyward Manor— or have decided to spite both groups and carve their own path— they are tasked to resolve the terrible curse which sundered Raventree Estate into triplicate fragments by confronting the patriarch of the family, Darius Corvinarus, who remains imprisoned within his Planar Sanctum.</p><p>The party is entrusted with the secret means of restoring access to this sanctum which involves gathering lost knowledge from the planar realms and defeating vestiges of dread energy which haunt the Ruined Manor.</p><p>With access to the Planar Sanctum restored, the party must prepare by gathering powerful artifacts and resolving any remaining quests. The passage into the Planar Sanctum marks a point of no return, wherein the heroes must deal with Darius Corvinarus and his corrupted legacy.</p><p>If victorious, the party is presented with an opportunity to choose the fate of Raventree Manor and all who dwell within it. The choices made in this final sequence and the consequences of those choices lead the players to experience one of the many possible endings available within the adventure.</p><p class=\"important\">These late stages of the adventure will generally advance characters from level 8 to level 9.</p>"

              "text": "<p><em>A House Divided</em> can be appropriately set in almost any game setting or location. The adventure itself is one of fantastical magic, gothic horror, and planar travel. These themes impose some requirements on a potential setting, but otherwise there is considerable flexibility to incorporate this content into a wide variety of game worlds.</p><p>Raventree Manor itself should be set in the countryside in an area which is far enough removed from a major city that the Corvinarus family would be the preeminent nobility of the surrounding area. The manor should be located next to a forest large enough to surround the manor and its estate grounds.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Proximity to Civilization</h3><p>The Raventree Estate is about three days of travel from any large settlements, but the roads in and out of the area are in decent enough condition to make traveling relatively painless. The nearest hamlet to the old estate has maybe two hundred people in it, and is about a 6 mile walk through rough terrain. While there once was a paved road leading to the estate from the village, the last 20 years have allowed nature to almost completely reclaim it, forcing anyone interested in heading that way to blaze a new trail through the forest. </p><p>If they are lucky or keen-eyed enough they can use the old paving stones of the old road to guide them, but it will be a slow hike regardless. Travel by horses, or other land vehicles does not significantly improve travel time due to the forest growth and lack of good paths to follow. The region around the manor is, after all, largely avoided by locals and wildlife.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Suggested Town: Ferncombe</h3><p><em>The following is an optional suggestion for Gamemasters who want to jump quickly into the action.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ferncombe\" title=\"The Town of Ferncombe Module\">Ferncombe</a> is a small farming town about six miles away from the old Raventree Estate. It has about 200 people in it, and is protected by a small militia of about 20 able-bodied folk with leather armor, wood shields, spears and bows. A small river runs through the area providing fresh water and fishing. A few farms and pastures dot the area, providing the town with its necessities and a little spare to trade to any that come along the main road.</p><p>It has a small inn for travelers, a toolsmith, and local healer. The townsfolk sell their items directly through a notice board in the inn, selling fish, meat, woodcraft, hides, wool, and other handmade goods to any that are interested. The residents of Ferncombe are friendly enough to strangers, decent folk, and happy to chat, but are largely unremarkable. They can be used to gather rumors about the old Raventree estate, though they don’t have much in the way of truly useful or accurate information. See @UUID[JournalEntry.OIfGrskfmsmysKc5.JournalEntryPage.I7Y8QfN3da5cywDT]{Local Legends and Folklore} for some ideas of rumors that townsfolk would tell about Raventree Estate.</p><p>There was once a road to Raventree Estate from Ferncombe, but it is now so badly overgrown that it might as well be hard travel through wilderness, extending a three hour jaunt to a six hour trudge through invasive brush.</p><p></p><p><br /></p>"

Its most common inhabitants are any creatures of the fey subtype, and they are rarely friendly, civilized sorts when encountered beyond the walls of an ordered court like that of the Feyward Manor.</p><p>This plane serves as a primal reflection of the material plane, and keen-eyed travelers in it will recognize landmarks, though many of them may be buried under layers of strange plants and decades of natural decay.</p><p>The sky in this realm is a fractal swirl of late evening and early dawn colors, with great waves of purple, orange, pink, and yellow washing overhead, casting the area in a perpetual dance between dawn and dusk, with neither being seen to fruition. As a result there is no night, and it is difficult to get a sense of time.</p><p>Beyond the manor there is only chaos, unpredictable wilderness, and often animalistic fey beasties. Traveling beyond the Feyward manor is a risky proposition for even the most well prepared party, and is not recommended under any circumstances.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Realm Properties</h2><p>The Feyward Manor has some particular traits which are universal and change the way certain aspects of reality function. These traits apply to the party from the moment they arrive, and remain with them until after they have left.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Primal Nature</strong>: Spells which directly affect or involve plants are more effective than normal. These spells are treated as being cast one level higher than the spell slot used. Spells that do not have extra casting levels are not affected.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication</strong>: Common is a very rare language on this fey plane and most creatures encountered here will not speak or understand it. Instead, the most common language is Sylvan, followed by Goblin. As elves have roots in this plane, Elvish also present, but less common. Older, more powerful beings, and those well traveled in the material realm tend to speak additional languages including common.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deepest Dreams</strong>: Taking long rests is accompanied by strange dreams, and even creatures that do not normally sleep find their minds clouded with strange visions of chaotic lands and fanciful beasts.</p><p>When completing a long rest make a [[/save wisdom dc=10]] saving throw, on success the creature awakens normally. On a failure they remain asleep or in an unbroken trance, and can save again after another hour passes. Other characters may attempt to wake the sleeping character, giving them another immediate save with advantage. This is considered a magical sleep effect for the purposes of saving against it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Old Faerie Magick</strong>: In many places around the manor the party is liable to encounter old magics, strange fey magics, and unusual enchantments. There are magical practices intrinsic to the Feywild which do not translate well to those not well versed in them. They can still be interacted with, but any attempts to dispel them requires a successful spellcasting ability check with a DC of 24.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lingering Wildness</strong>: Spending time in the Feyward manor has lingering effects on the appearance of those within. After completing a long rest in the Feywild every character gains a level of Wildness up to 10.</p><p>The higher a character's Wildness value, the more their physical appearance changes. At first this affects only the character's equipment, armor and clothing, manifesting as an increase of color vivideness and reflectiveness.</p><p>As Wildness increases this spreads to the character themselves, causing them to take on a flushed skintone or growing more tan, as though suffused with life. At the highest levels their eyes begin to look more wild, their hair more windswept and untamed, their voices more rich and resonant.</p><p>Completing a long rest outside of the Feywild removes 5 levels of accrued Lingering Wildness.</p></li></ul>"

As a result, most everything around the manor is badly, wildly overgrown and unchecked.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Lighting</h3><p>Caught in a perpetual dance of dawn and dusk, it is not unlike being caught under a rainbow aurora at all hours. The sky is mesmerizing and beautiful, though the sun is very hard to tack down, as it does not move in a consistent cycle, and sometimes simply isn't visible at all.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Smells</h3><p>Many of the plants that grow in the gardens and greenhouse are strange but familiar reflections of the real world's own regional flora around the manor, but they are twisted, overly large, the wrong color, or strange in other ways. They permeate the air with sweet scents, and when the breeze shifts it can become downright cloying as waves of Fae pollen come drifting in.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Sounds</h3><p>The Feywild is a lively place, filled with bird calls and creature howls that sound familiar but not quite right.

Everything is clean and in good order, but well worn and showing its age. Its many decorations are displayed proudly, and a bustling staff does its best to keep the house running despite the considerable damage done by invasive faerie flora.</p><p>The layout of the manor has been heavily influenced by its current events in and around it. As damage has occurred, new doorways have appeared out of nowhere, and supplementary growth has appeared to hold up walls, or topple them entirely. Given long enough, this manor would appear entirely different to even the current residents.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Lighting</h3><p>The manor is modestly well lit throughout by warm glass lanterns, which flicker with lively flames. Beyond that the ever present light outside spills through windows and gaps to supplement the lanterns when they aren't up to the job. As a result there are few places that are dimly lit or dark.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Smells</h3><p>A flowery fragrance drifts throughout the manor thanks to the abundant plant life growing in and around the structure. The air is crisp as well due to this, allowing everyone to breathe easily.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Sounds</h3><p>The manor's staff bustle to and fro, socializing, working, engaging with guests and carrying out their work with gusto.

There are a few different cadres within the manor, responsible for differing matters. While Elscieth (Sylvaria) rules the manor in name, her dreamful sleep keeps her from active engagement in daily activities, and with Chirneros occupied protecting her, most of the manor duties fall to their trusted staff.</p><h4>The Administration</h4><p>Saedia and Usk are the primary figures responsible for oversight of the manor's day to day operations—Saedia first, with Usk as a sort of right-hand-man for her. Saedia's knack for non-violent conflict resolution made her fast friends with the lady of the manor and her champion, respectively.</p><h4>The Guard</h4><p>The Guards are beholden to the leadership of the Feyward Manor—which, with Sylvaria dreaming, means Saedia. The majority of them are preoccupied trying to keep people out of @UUID[.N0JCXydhJblKtqr4#the-revel-and-the-ravenous-host]{The Revel and the Ravenous Host}.</p><h4>The Goblin Staff</h4><p>The goblins spread throughout the house fall into two categories:</p><ol><li><p>The Goblin Staff serve the house and carry out menial tasks—keeping the manor relatively clean, bringing food and beverages to the administration if requested, escorting guests to key locations, and otherwise keeping things organized.</p></li><li><p>The Goblin Chefs serve @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.p3bIby0SnVHtf3mL], and do not care about anything but preparing meals for her to bring to the revel, inspired by the pure terror of what Red might do if she catches them slacking. The kitchen still supplied food to the rest of the house as well, and though hastily prepared and disinteresting it is at least of better condition than what gets sent to the Revel.</p></li></ol><h4>The Sprites</h4><p>The grounds, maze, glade, and library are tended and maintained by the incredibly efficient work of the Sprites, who work with near military precision. They are loyal foremost to the estate, and are not keenly invested in whichever lord or lady might want to declare themselves in power this century. They are a commune of equals, and though their goals might align with the administration they follow their own moral code and do not consider orders from anyone to be mandatory.</p><p></p><p></p>"

For information about the steps needed to accomplish this very difficult task and achieve the secret ending that allows for it, please see: @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.uJ8F15Har6MVMj6a#reuniting-usk]{Reuniting Usk}.</p></div></section><h2 class=\"border\">Running the Quest</h2><p>This quest serves as an introduction to the manor and a method of steering your players toward other available opportunities, but it should not be used to provide your players with deep knowledge of the intricate plot of the manor. While Usk is hopeful that the party will aid him, he is smart enough to hold some knowledge in reserve, and may be reluctant to share deep details of the Feyward Manor's situation with strangers who have just arrived.</p><p>The party's first meeting with Usk in the Feyward Manor can occur in one of two ways which determine which piece of introductory text to use.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Arriving In The Parlor</h3><p>Usk dusts himself off and straightens his clothing, smoothing out the wrinkles and rubbing at a small scuff on his forehead- the result of his own tumble. Looking slightly embarrassed, he offers:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I didn’t expect the tear to send you directly to me, but it’s probably best that it did. I am Usk, head butler of the Raventree Estate, valet to the lord of the manor, and the person who was trying to get you here to begin with. I cannot possibly thank you enough for listening to me. I am in rather desperate need of your help.</p></blockquote></section><h3 class=\"border\">Arriving Elsewhere</h3><p>Usk arrives slightly out of breath but otherwise composed. He takes a spare moment to sweep his eyes over the party, as though taking count that a certain number have arrived. His smile has a mildly nervous quality. When he begins speaking, he seems to act as though he has not met the party before:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Ah, I'm glad you all seem to have arrived in one piece. Sorry that I've arrived late. I am Usk, head butler of the Raventree Estate, valet to the lord of the manor, and the person who was trying to get you here to begin with.</p></blockquote></section><h2 class=\"border\">Questions and Answers</h2><p>Usk is eager to trade some of his knowledge in exchange for guiding the party in a cause that will ultimately aid his goal of reuniting his shattered selves. As the party speaks with him, use the questions and answers below to help form the dialogue.</p><p>If the party is not interested in listening to Usk, they can attempt to carve their own path through the Feyward manor, but will find that without the insight that Usk provides they are lacking key information to smooth their way. They can return to Usk at any time for more information, he is willing to wait, especially since his options are limited.</p><h4>What help do you need?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I need to escape this place. I can feel it tearing my mind and soul in two. It has been for… years, I think? I admit I have no idea how long I’ve been here. The sun rests ever on the horizon, just moments from sunrise or sunset, with no way to tell one day from the next. Regardless, I need out before I am entirely undone and I believe that Lady Elscieth might have a way to do so. In short, you need to help her with her current predicaments so that she might help me with mine. She is a good person, I know this at my core, and she would gladly assist me, but she can scarcely help herself right now.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What happened to the manor?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I can’t say for certain what happened, as I wasn’t present at the heart of the incident- but, there was some sort of explosion in the dining hall. I heard… screaming and the whole house shook like it was going to collapse then I felt a pain unlike anything I’ve experienced before, collapsed and awoke here.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What is this place?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>This is Raventree Estate, the home of the Corvinarus family, but situated in the Feywild. I can't pretend to understand every part of it, though I know this place is a reflection of the true manor we came from. It is a place that bustles with life and activity, but with that comes chaos and difficulties. The seneschal of the house is doing her best, but she is one person without aid of the lady or her champion.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Who is Lady Elscieth?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Lady Elscieth Corvinarus is the first child of Darius and Ylana Corvinarus, and the master of this estate. She was…is…was a most accomplished merchant and socialite, keen of mind, and good-hearted. She rules this estate with the aid of her powerful Lord-champion Chirneros, and the Seneschal Saedia whom I work with quite closely, both are equally talented in their own rights. Sadly and lady and her champion are presently… preoccupied with troubles of their own...</p></blockquote></section><h4>Have others come through before?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Yes, quite a large number, actually. This household serves as a small but promising fae court and visitors come from far and wide across the faerie planes to visit with those who call this place home. They rarely stay for long, and none of them come from the mortal plane where we call home.</p></blockquote></section><h4>How does the party leave the Feywild?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Leaving should be simple, just stepping through any of the numerous gateways out in the woods beyond the estate would lead you somewhere in the nearby region. But that requires being able to leave. I cannot go, nor can Lady Elscieth, something holds us here, and we did not determine what before the lady fell prey to her current troubles.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What do you know about (a person)?</h4><p>Consult @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.3yPIFSCFMwqqONX6#opinions]{Usk's Opinions}.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Available Solutions</h2><p><strong>Hear Usk out</strong>.

Unfortunately, this requires the cooperation of the manor's lord, but Lady Elscieth is presently indisposed and her house is out of order. If Usk's plan has any hope of succeeding, the party will have to make a name for themselves and gain the support of some of the Manor's more influential residents.</p><p>Usk will offer to introduce the party to either Saedia or the Sprites and will escort them if that offer is accepted. He will also, reluctantly, suggest the party speak to the Red Scullion- but is also happy to let them find their way to the kitchen on their own, as he dislikes the red hag.</p><h4>What needs to be done?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>You’ll need to earn favor with people in the manor, and your very best way of doing this is to help put the manor in order. It is presently in disarray and while I could arrange a meeting straight away with the master of the manor, you would likely be turned away as an unwelcome group of strangers. Helping set things in order would make you far more palatable.</p><p>That said, providing aid to madame Saedia herself, the manor seneschal would make a significant social footprint for you. You could also do much worse than having the support of the collective Sprites which maintain the grounds, and…though I am reluctant to recommend it… you could earn favor with the Red Scullion, though I am reluctant to even consider what she might have in mind for any who would work for her.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Why help Elscieth?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I practically grew up alongside her, being attached to her family at a young age myself. She is a good person, with a kind heart, and keen mind. If her house is put in order and her troubles are settled she will certainly have a way to resolve my current predicament.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What’s in it for us?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Beyond helping a soul suffering great distress? My family would surely reward you for returning their son to them in good health… or as good health as I can be after this ordeal. We are not rich, but our family is long-lived and well connected as a result. They have countless favors they could call upon to your benefit.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What do you know about X person?</h4><p>Consult @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.3yPIFSCFMwqqONX6#opinions]{Usk's Opinions}.</p><h4>What do the Sprites need help with?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I’m not actually sure, it probably has to do with tending the grounds or working on their greenhouse. You’d need to go speak with them to find out the particulars. I could make introductions if you wish.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What does Saedia need help with?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Madame Saedia is presently trying to keep the manor running by herself, with what assistance I can provide, and while she can manage the staff just fine, there are some problems that have seemingly grown beyond her ability to affect. As I understand it, she has some guests who won’t leave, and a few guests who <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">can’t</span></span> leave. There might be more though. If you wish to inquire, I will escort you to her for the proper introductions.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What does the Scullion need help with?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I shudder to think. She and her vile staff of cooks spend all their time in the kitchen preparing meals for the Revel, the festival in the dining hall and the…creature…which oversees it. I would not recommend you attend…people tend to lose themselves to the celebration. I would expect whatever she has that needs doing is related to that. I…will introduce you to her, if you really think that is the best course of action.</p></blockquote></section><h2 class=\"border\">Available Solutions</h2><p>This quest is completed when at least two of the following quests are completed, but the party may resolve as many as they like.</p><ul><li><p>The Sprites want to permanently deal with the Red Scullion as part of @UUID[.sRSKKq4KJ5IiQtxQ].</p></li><li><p>Madame Saedia has a handful of tasks that can be resolved as part of @UUID[.1jm6sAlqOHj1pdIF].</p></li><li><p>The Red Scullion wants to permanently deal with the Greenhouse Sprites as part of @UUID[.sRSKKq4KJ5IiQtxQ].</p></li></ul><h2 class=\"border\">Notes and References</h2><p>It is possible to complete the listed quests without agreeing to talk to Usk, though the party wouldn’t necessarily know who to talk to, and would need to figure out the notable figures in the manor and engage with them without the benefit of Usk's guidance.</p>"

If they agree, he will escort the party to the @UUID[JournalEntry.9cQ3NRZsM5PIx7X7.JournalEntryPage.BKjyeoFWgdVCI8Ht]{F07. Seneschal's Office}. He will pause before entering to collect the names and any official titles the party may have, so that he can properly and formally introduce them:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Usk precedes you through the door, leaving it open, he announces your titles in a tone of warm deference to a stunningly beautiful woman clad in a gown that seems to be made of still-living plantlife, her hair— if it could be called hair, for surely vines would be a more accurate description—has blooming flowers woven within it, swept over her shoulder.</p><p>She smiles graciously as Usk speaks, as though to let him know she is listening—but her eyes take in the party with open curiousity. When Usk has finished, she rises, delicate hands folding in a gesture of welcome. Usk turns to you and offers:</p><blockquote><p>May I present, Her Ladyship Saedia, Seneschal of the Feyward Manor.</p></blockquote><p>For her part Saedia purses her lips, and her eyes sparkle in some amusement, or perhaps pride, at her title being used.</p><blockquote><p>It is not often that mortals come to visit us.</p></blockquote><p>She says, an unspoken question hanging in the air—but she is clearly too polite to outright ask: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">what are you doing here?</span></span></p></section><p>During the discussion that follows, Saedia will take the time to assess the party—in the Feywild it isn't often that that a group of adventurers simply appear and ask if you have any work. Saedia has three tasks she could use some clever individuals to handle on her behalf, but she would prefer people with discretion and ability to handle tasks without resorting directly to violent conflict. Saedia is strictly against violence, so to gain her support the party will need to do their best to find non-violent solutions to these problems. Failure to do this will cause loss of approval with Saedia, and possibly close off the chance of getting help from her.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Allow me to formally welcome you to the Raventree Estate. I am Saedia, Seneschal and Confidant of the Lady Elscieth. As I understand it, you are hoping to provide some aid to the household in exchange for our hospitality. To begin, I would like to say that is very kind of you—most who come here are more interested in availing of our hospitality without offering much in return.</p><p>I do happen to have a few tasks which would benefit from a deft, uninvolved hand.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What can we assist you with?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Oh, I have quite a matters I could use assistance with, though a few come to mind which might be of the best benefit, especially if I do not personally need to be involved. I’ve done my best to manage them…but frankly, I’d be happy to have an outside force nudge things a bit, and see what comes loose.</p></blockquote><p>Saedia looks ready to continue, but hesitates a fraction of a moment, seeming to remember something.</p><blockquote><p>And, so that we’re very much thinking the same way: I hope that it needs not be said that I do not consider violence an acceptable way to nudge things. Any acts that result in chaos, destruction or death in this estate will be taken as a personal slights against me, and I do not take insults lightly.</p></blockquote><p>Her tone indicates a dire warning and deadly seriousness. </p><blockquote><p></p><p>Find diplomatic answers if you can.</p></blockquote></section><h4>A choice of topics.</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Now, the tasks I have at hand are…</p><p>Two of our guests, some friends of mine, in fact, are both overdue—They're overdue, because they're busy shouting at eachother from opposite sides of the pond in the maze.

A Flowering Shambler is a slow creature—but it's an ambush hunter, and not everyone understands the difference between its affection and its will to consume.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What about the sprites?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>They expanded to groundskeeping after the last keeper was eaten, and I haven’t asked them to deal with Shambly— They don't see it as a problem, and the last time it came up in conversation they were laughing about it.

In either case the party is likely to end up at the same point: Herniva is the source of Stucky’s curse, and instead of owning up to it she has been lying out of shame and embarrassment.</p><h4>Why did you steal the orb?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Herniva's countenance pales, her eyes widening at the accusation. She cracks under the pressure of being found out almost immediately. She begins to weep, blubbering:</p><blockquote><p>FINE! I took it! I took it, Okay!?

We lure ships to the rocks, because sailors are stupid and ugly and we're pretty and clever, who cares if they drown?—we play tricks on people at sea, or in lakes—I liked playing tricks the most; finding secret little underwater passages to rivers and caves and all…</p></blockquote><p>A sniffle, she looks over at Stucky and shuffles on the platform to try and place a party member between her and the hag.</p><blockquote><p>So I was swimming up a river, peering out through the waters…and there's this woman plucking plants from the water—I don't know why I did it— I was gonna play a trick at first, just a little scare for her…so I waited until she plunged her hand into the water, and grabbed her to pull her in—she'd get a little wet, get a little cold, I'd have a little laugh and that would be that…</p></blockquote><p>She swallows, her tears drying, she calms down some, perhaps relieved at finally being able to share the truth.</p><blockquote><p>But she when she fell, she hit me with her stupid elbow, and I got mad—And so I cursed her, not even thinking about it—the words were out of my mouth before I could help myself…And then I didn't know what to do with her—So I and left her in a cave in the depths.\" She looks absolutely guilty and downtrodden—\"if I could take it all back I would.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Why didn't You Just Admit It?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>She'd <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">kill</span></span> me!

I really do regret it, you know.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Stuckina’s Curse</h4><p>If Herniva has been revealed as the source of the curse, then the party can extend her offer to help lift the curse to Stucky. Naturally she accepts immediately, even if it means she must swear an oath to take no revenge.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">knew</span></span> it!</p></blockquote><p>She says, pointing a clawed finger across the water at Herniva.

It was her all along!</p></blockquote><p>She pauses, perhaps coming to the realization that she looks utterly mad. A brief effort is made to compose herself and straighten her perpetually soaked rags.</p><blockquote><p>Yes…Well, please extend my acceptance of her…help. It would be most welcome if that hightide whore can get me out of this.</p></blockquote><p>Her huge eyes flick toward Herniva.</p><blockquote><p>Uh…maybe leave the whore part out.</p></blockquote><p>She adds sheepishly.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Available Solutions</h2><p class=\"important\">Completion of this quest earns the party a @UUID[JournalEntry.D1QzSUnec7ZApnDF.JournalEntryPage.mhIzp2kUkLiWEKB8#milestone-advancement]{Milestone Point}.</p><p><strong>Convince Stucky to give up and let Herniva leave.</strong> Convincing Stucky to give up on the pearl and just let Herniva go requires a successful [[/check skill=per dc=25]] or [[/check skill=itm dc=25]] check.

If Sylvaria was redeemed back into Elscieth via @UUID[.RDt48DcdLD9cqDOo] then this quest is not available.</p><p>This quest has three steps: @UUID[.HK5dhhPNIaF96Lta#revelation-of-intent]{Revelation of Intent}, @UUID[.HK5dhhPNIaF96Lta#clearing-the-land]{Clearing the Land}, and @UUID[.HK5dhhPNIaF96Lta#planting-the-seed]{Planting the Seed}. The first step requires a secondary quest (@UUID[.yEahhspi0pne1ZGS]{My Brother's Killer} to be completed before the final two steps can begin.</p><p>Details are provided below.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Revelation of intent</h2><p>This is the first part of this quest's three parts. The party is summoned to the @UUID[JournalEntry.OMTctEQKJfOaXmNG]{The Dreaming Grove} to hold court with Sylvaria, and hear of a task she wishes to have dealt with. The dragon has her servants and agents in attendance, who all stand by in silence and watch the party keenly.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>The dragon’s voice resonates through the air.</p><blockquote><p>I have had more than enough time to think and dream of what I want, and now I feel it is time to make these dreams come to fruition.</p><p>As you were the ones that freed me from my imprisonment, I am offering you the chance to be my allies in this endeavor, and the agents of my will.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What is your will?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>The great dragon smiles, an unnerving sight to behold. Her voice holds excitement and amusement.</p><blockquote><p>I want the Raventree Manor, in the material realm. It is a close reflection of my stronghold here and once properly reinforced it will become a garrison for my servants.</p><p>A foothold from which we can come and go as we please.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What will you do There?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Whatever I like and demand of my servants. It is not for you to know the actions which I have not yet taken. In time however, that can change.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Why do you want access to the material plane?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>There are many reasons we want that access: scouting, diplomacy, recruitment, exile. The plane has much to offer us and many uses.</p><p>Again, as I said, I am not inclined to explain myself any further.</p></blockquote><p>Says Sylvaria, a moment later adding:</p><blockquote><p>My friendly advice to you: do not press the topic further.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What do you need us to do?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Much, but let us begin with the thorn in my paw. I will need you to kill the man who was once my brother.</p></blockquote></section><h4>You want us to kill your brother?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Simply put: yes.</p></blockquote><p>The dragon folds her great claws together.</p><blockquote><p>There is much ado about this task though, and first we must formalize our arrangements of service… though that is a separate topic.</p></blockquote></section><p class=\"important\">Before proceeding onto the next part of this quest, the party must agree to serve Sylvaria.<br />See the @UUID[.yEahhspi0pne1ZGS] for details on this, and the mission to kill Kryn.</p><p>If the party refuses, then Sylvaria is done with them until they change their mind, and this quest will not progress any further.</p><p>Once the party has completed @UUID[.yEahhspi0pne1ZGS] then the quest advances to the next stage: <strong>Clearing the Land.</strong></p><h2 class=\"border\">Clearing the Land</h2><p>This is part two of Material Possessions. Now that the way has been paved for Sylvaria's victory, she has more material and less personal issues that need to be dealt with. This phase of Material Possessions involves clearing the manor of threats, then assaulting Darius' Planar Sanctum. After that, the party enters Endgame.</p><p>Make sure to adjust the dialog here to account for anything the party may have already accomplished previously. Assume that Syvlaria has sent out scouts while the party was occupied with other things, and has a general idea of the state of the ruined manor.</p><h4>What is next?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Now that the weeding is done, we must make the earth ready to grow. I require you to return to the ruined manor grounds and clear it of threats.</p><p>My scouts say that the great tree is or was overrun with spiders, and the manor grounds are patrolled by the dead at night. See them removed, and then scour the interior for any other interlopers.</p><p>Whatever monstrosities have set themselves up in my estate must be removed. Places of such power and tragedy often attract oddities and aberrations that I don't want lurking about.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Can we have some help?</h4><p>If the party has managed to maintain an approval level of 5 or better with Sylvaria, they can request some assistance with their next mission.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Really? You've proven capable enough thus far, now you require assistance? Very well, I can send along some of my minions to aid you.</p><p>What do you want? A pair of house guards, a squad of three sprites, a team of four goblin servants, or someone else?</p></blockquote></section><p>The party can request 2 House Guards, 1 of each War Sprite, or 4 Goblin Staff to aid them. They all only speak Sylvan, and Goblin (sprites might know Elvish). But they will serve to the best of their ability and understanding while assigned.</p><h4>Clearing The House</h4><p>To complete this phase of the quest the party must defeat the following encounters in the Ruined Manor:</p><ol><li><p>Arcane Wraiths in the @UUID[JournalEntry.GfWgVX7GYShBa9bG.JournalEntryPage.1dClw8TQYJAPuvGi].</p></li><li><p>The Colossal Spider at @UUID[JournalEntry.fnNToxGl9e4bBlrv.JournalEntryPage.JezR262gGav5xh6t].</p></li><li><p>The Shard Stalker in the @UUID[JournalEntry.x9xlmkKYSp1PEYAf.JournalEntryPage.gZcmW4fALCF3iwkH]{Ruined Estate}.</p></li><li><p>Secondary encounters such as greenhouse and kitchen rust monsters, dance hall ghosts, library haunted books, and patrolling wights. These are less vital that the prior steps, but should still be completed at least partially or else Sylvaria will be annoyed.</p></li></ol><p>This also automatically completes @UUID[JournalEntry.x9xlmkKYSp1PEYAf.JournalEntryPage.ohNULn0egCTMgjYz#repowering-the-circles]{Repowering the Circles} which is part of the @UUID[JournalEntry.x9xlmkKYSp1PEYAf.JournalEntryPage.ohNULn0egCTMgjYz]{Quest: Planar Intrusion}, which the party will need to deal with in the near future.</p><p>With the monsters cleared out the manor becomes quieter, almost empty now. The party is ready to begin the next phase: <strong>Planting the Seed.</strong></p><h3 class=\"border\">Planting the Seed</h3><p>This is part three of Material Possessions, and the final phase of this quest. The party by now has proven itself capable enough that Sylvaria is ready to entrust the final steps of her plan. She summons the party to her presence at the dreaming tree once more, and begins to lay out what is to occur next.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>You've done quite well so far, I am satisfied. You should be pleased with yourselves.</p><p>However… there is yet more to do, one more thing, really. Perhaps you have noticed by now, or maybe not: There is energy being pulled from this plane to somewhere else.</p><p>The man who was once my father had a fondness for sub-planar hideaways, and has made himself one such location. There is a magic circle in the master bedroom of the old ruined manor which once served as a doorway to these locations.</p><p>It is presently damaged however, so you will need the other two pieces of the circle.</p></blockquote></section><h4>How do you know this?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>What, you think that I only gained draconic powers by consuming my old patron? Please, there is so much more to me now than that. Besides, I was well versed in my father's work, he attempted to teach me magic once, and of course, there are clues here in my estate.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What do you think we’ll find?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>You will find whatever is causing my imprisonment in this manor, you may even find the man who was once my father. If you do find him, kill him for me. I can have no obstacles in my path, and he might enjoy the rest.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Where do we find the pieces of the magic circle?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>One of the partial circles is in my master bedroom, I suspect the other is in the same room in the Shadow Manor.</p><p>I am sure you should have no trouble finding what you need there, not now at least. Though if you left survivors they might not be pleased to see you. Do what you must to gain access to the other circle. With them both the circle can be repaired and you can see where the threads of energy lead.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What Do we do After that?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Repair the circle, and travel through it to whatever realm awaits. Once you have secured the realm beyond the door, you must carry out one final task: You must plant a seed that will become our future.</p></blockquote><p>Sylvaria rises up on her hind legs and stretches her long draconic body like a cat. She pushes a massive claw up into the boughs of the dreaming tree and extracts a glowing golden acorn the size of a man's fist.</p><blockquote><p>This is an artifact of my father's making, you must place it in the nexus between places. It will bring this sordid story of betrayal and drama to a close, and end your service to me.</p><p>Once this is done, return to me, and I will see you properly rewarded.</p></blockquote><p>Sylvaria lowers the acorn down to the party, so that they may claim it.</p></section><p>The party acquires the @UUID[Item.jYehUiLvEHwsIZGd]{Acorn of Rampant Growth}, which is integral for at least one of this adventure's @UUID[JournalEntry.Am8HvuLkr7XcOFYx.JournalEntryPage.WWmG2oDTDLx7TAsi]{Possible Conclusions}. The party will need to place it in the nexus of planar energies that form after Darius is finally defeated. This begins the ending for @UUID[JournalEntry.Am8HvuLkr7XcOFYx.JournalEntryPage.WWmG2oDTDLx7TAsi#sylvarias-stronghold]{Sylvaria's Stronghold}. If the party wishes to enact a different ending, they are free to do so if they want.</p><p>This final step requires that the party complete @UUID[JournalEntry.x9xlmkKYSp1PEYAf.JournalEntryPage.ohNULn0egCTMgjYz]{Quest: Planar Intrusion}, which at this point they have likely completed at least one part of through other steps in this quest.</p><p>Once the portal is repaired and opened, the party can step through to face the adventure's final challenges in @UUID[JournalEntry.JQTx5TJdy2fWcADT]{The Shattered Sanctum}. Doing this however, is potentially a point of no return. If they have other tasks they wish to complete first, they should see to them before going through.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Approval Changes</h2><p class=\"important\">Completion of this quest earns the party a @UUID[JournalEntry.D1QzSUnec7ZApnDF.JournalEntryPage.mhIzp2kUkLiWEKB8#milestone-advancement]{Milestone Point}.</p><p><strong>Repair and power the portal to the Planar Sanctum</strong> as described in @UUID[JournalEntry.x9xlmkKYSp1PEYAf.JournalEntryPage.ohNULn0egCTMgjYz]{Quest: Planar Intrusion}.

He’s going to maintain his claim on the manor, and I can’t be certain that the magic holding us in place won’t somehow affect that. So, to keep things simple: kill him.</p></blockquote><p>She flicks her wrist in a dismissive motion, pausing to raise a huge, taloned finger.</p><blockquote><p>Him… his horrible wife, and her wretched son.

As the eldest child I could have had the first claim of everything.

So, I want it.</p></blockquote></section><h3 class=\"border\">Assistance Upon Acceptance</h3><p>Sylvaria provides the part with an @UUID[Item.wHSBMJJV9IzCGTYD] which automatically attunes to them when first worn. This marks them as agents of the Feyward manor and its estate, and empowers them against the Shadeward manor, so that no others will mistake where their allegiances lie.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Sylvaria gives a broad smile of razor sharp teeth, pleasure emanating from her draconic eyes.</p><blockquote><p>Very good. I will dispense with materiel that will make your task easier. It would be unwise of me to send you ill-prepared for what lies ahead.</p></blockquote><p>She gestures toward the party and an attendant moves forward with a box. Lifting the lid a velvet lined case is revealed, the contents including golden bronze rings with glowing orange gems.</p><blockquote><p>These are my autumnal bands. They will empower you against the forces of the shadow estate, and mark you as my agents. You will have this manor's assistance and hospitality so long as you wear them.</p></blockquote><p>Wearing the rings shrouds the wearer in a gentle orange glow at first, which fades to a dim orange ring light at their back. A sensation of warmth fills the the body as the rings rapidly attune themselves.</p><blockquote><p>You should be aware that you cannot remove the rings until you have finished your service to me. Which I am sure will not be an issue, as you have agreed to assist me, and we fey do not take our agreements lightly.</p></blockquote></section><p>Sylvaria provides the party with two important items intended to help them complete their mission, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.DQzlB5Y3k791W5bH]{Scroll of See Invisibility} and one @UUID[Item.t1cUANf3vvqTBkT1]{Bead of Antimagic}.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Be warned … my brother Kryn was always fond of illusions and tricks.

Be sure to leave nothing to change, force him into an isolated and inescapable position before taking your best shot … and do not miss.</p><p>He will, doubtless, try and escape your onslaught. Be ready to use this bead to deny him that recourse.</p></blockquote></section><p>As for Vivesna, Sylvaria is more scornful:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>The Lady Vivesna is unlikely to prove a challenge, unless you are more stupid than you look.

I started after Kryn as lightning and fire rained through the room—gods, the look on his face when my first spell hit him—not an hour before he was telling me how I would amount to nothing because I was a 'magicless mongrel, barely worth a political marriage'.</p></blockquote><p>Her eyes are distant with the memory, her expression one of profound regret.</p><blockquote><p>I'd like to tell you I went into the fight to defend my father from Kryn…but the truth is in that moment I wanted him as dead as he wanted our dad.</p></blockquote><p>She shakes her head, slowly at the memory.</p><blockquote><p>I withstood his hatred and abuse for years, and he gave me what I thought was the best gift he had ever given: an excuse. I really and truly want him dead.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Do you still want Kryn Dead?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>A slow response, as she inhales slowly, it is truly a struggle for her to decide. And her body tenses, a terrible anger passes over her countenance, and for the barest of moments you fear that perhaps Sylvaria might be within, ready to take hold. Finally, she exhales an explosive breath through her nose before shaking her head.</p><blockquote><p>Deep down— yes…the malice is still there, but the fire has died out. If he crossed my path, I would rend him in two and I would feel nothing about it…but I have no desire to go and hunt him like some rabbit.</p></blockquote></section><p>If the party offers to kill Kryn for her, she will be lukewarm to the idea at best, more along the lines of \"I'm not ordering it, but if you do it I'd like to know\" than any actual order given to the party to carry out an assassination.</p><h4>Why would darius name usk successor?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Looking back, I don't know if it was more to spite Kryn and I, or if he truly wished it. I'd like to think my lashing out at Kryn wouldn't be enough for father to disinherit me. Still, he named Usk as his successor— I'd swear to it, if you wished the estate to go to him.</p></blockquote></section><h3 class=\"border\">Will you cede the manor to your daughter?</h3><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>She seems surprised at the suggestion, as though she had expected a different request, or perhaps she simply hadn't considered it.</p><blockquote><p>I could—I suppose it would only be right to see that it remains within the family. It's the least I could do.</p></blockquote><p>She frowns.</p><blockquote><p>Seeing I left her abandoned with her father…gods she must hate me.</p><p>If she wants it, she can have it, and with my compliments. I would deliver it myself, but I was hardly a part of her life and I would probably only terrify her a sudden return.</p></blockquote></section><p>Elscieth will not disclose that Usk was the one her father named successor if Byscilla is to be named successor, keeping the secret to herself. She will ask if the party will deliver a personal note to her daughter along with the formal proclamation that she is ceding the manor.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Will you cede the manor to Kryn?</h3><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Elscieth's eyes narrow and her expression hardens, a deep hatred visible on her features. A dangerous flare of anger burns within her visibly, barely contained. She swallows convulsively.</p><blockquote><p>No. Absolutely not. I would sooner burn my childhood home to the ground or cede it to total strangers than I'd see it in his hands. If he tries to take it, I will take his life.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Why not cede to Kryn?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>You don't know what it was like. Years. Decades. He tormented me, tortured me, and filled my life with misery and suffering. For a kid so much smaller and younger than I was, he was an absolute monster.\"</p></blockquote><p>Her eyes are distant, unfocused in memory, her expression tightened in a deep fury.</p><blockquote><p>You can't even imagine. You can't. He can't be rewarded, not after all of that.</p></blockquote></section><h2 class=\"border\">Available Solutions</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Elscieth agrees to give up all right and claim.</strong> She will cede the manor either to the party, someone in the party, or Byscilla (if using the Descendants aspect of the adventure). This is given with her compliments and hopes that the manor will thrive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elscieth is convinced (not easily) to cede the manor to Kryn.</strong> This is hard to do, and requires some convincing as she still harbors some bitterness toward her brother for killing their father and tormenting her as a child and young woman.</p></li></ul><p>The party can attempt to change her mind with a Charisma (Persuasion) check. The DC of this check is [[/check skill=per dc=35]]{35} minus her approval rating for the party. On success she grudgingly cedes the manor to him, but feels this is a terrible idea. On failure she refuses to budge. All additional attempts are made at disadvantage.</p><h4>Group Check or Single Check?</h4><p>It’s assumed that a single character would be attempting to convince Elscieth, likely with help from another member of the party. If you would prefer, you can make the persuasion check into a group check, requiring the whole party to participate and for at least half the party to succeed for the attempt to be successful.</p>"

Now that it has been fed— the tradition, the law keeps us from intervening directly while it claims the land within the manor—but if it were to be weakened and withdraw, it could be construed as abandonment. It is too powerful, and I cannot simply banish the spirit back whence it came—not as it stands now.</p></blockquote><p>She looks to the party, nodding her head slightly as if having come to a conclusion.</p><blockquote><p>If you will undertake this task—we could be free of it, its victims might yet be saved.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What, Exactly, Is The Revel?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Elscieth and Saedia share a look, and with the barest of nods from Elscieth, Saedia raises her gentle voice.</p><blockquote><p>The Revel is the work of The Red Scullion—you've no doubt met, by now. When first it began, it was only her and her small coterie which gave it its power. I am told that it is a powerful and ancient spirit, feeding on the gluttony of the ravenous host it controls. Its temptation is powerful, and holds an allure for the Fey that makes us even more susceptible to its influence than most. Some time ago, we took steps to prevent it growing further—the guards try to stop anyone from slipping into its domain.</p></blockquote><p>Elscieth adds, with an undertone of disgust.</p><blockquote><p>The last ruler of this place granted Red an agreement, ceding part of the manor to her and her Revel in exchange for some boon we cannot even begin to guess at.

A somewhat adaptable caster, the druid uses the barkskin, shillelagh, and produce flame spells to protect themselves while fighting in melee or at range, tossing out the thunder wave spell to throw enemies back, or off of balconies (if nearby). If it instead needs to control the battlefield, it can use entangle to trip up enemies.</p><p><strong>1x @UUID[Actor.v02ojTfZZIHitZoM]{Satyr Scout}</strong>.

The revelers should attempt to mob, flank, and surround members of the party. After moving, make attacks as described using the Ravenous Host's @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA.Item.10eiXWWhRtpBywb5]{Multiattack} feature.</p></div></div><p>While the Revel is content to throw the Ravenous Host at the party to keep them busy—make no mistake, it is the real threat in this encounter. The Revel will float in and out of view during combat, like an unmoored balloon, making use of its features to assail targets it believes it cannot control while subjugating the targets it can. The Revel cannot be targeted directly due to its ephemeral nature.</p><h3 class=\"border\">The Revel Weakened - Active Effects</h3><p>If the party has taken steps to weaken the Revel by poisoning the Ravenous Host through @UUID[.06korcrbV4pOyn4g]{Quest: A Meal To Die For} or otherwise, the GM should activate the \"Poisoned Feast\" active effect on @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA]{the Ravenous Host}, which will significantly reduce the health of the Host on which the Revel depends.</p><p>Enable the following Active Effects on either the @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA]{The Ravenous Host} depending on whether they were poisoned lethally or non-lethally.</p><p><strong>Poisoned Feast</strong>.

The Revel actor has been pre-configured with Active Effects which the GM should trigger to weaken the Revel, making it increasingly susceptible to banishment.</p><p>Enable the following active effects on @UUID[Actor.X4vtehnvPo43XEXD]{The Revel} as the encounter progresses.</p><p><strong>Ravenous Host Below 50%</strong>.

Each turn it will seek out a character which is not yet enthralled and try to captivate them using @UUID[Actor.X4vtehnvPo43XEXD.Item.gFL67nPdImRqULzN]{Gluttonous Enthrallment}. The revel will hover in the air and position itself to afflict as many foes as possible with its @UUID[Actor.X4vtehnvPo43XEXD.Item.fK2qS4ZxH0J1xRds]{Disquieting Aura}.</p><h4>Obligatory Host</h4><p>The Revel's @UUID[Actor.X4vtehnvPo43XEXD.Item.pH0i0gM0z7EJSYyF]{Noblesse Oblige} makes its Disquieting Aura and Gluttonous Enthrallment particularly dangerous for Fey creatures, and it will prefer to target them whenever possible. It is for this reason that Elscieth, Sylvaria, Chirneros and Saedia keep their distance from the Revel during the encounter.</p><h4>Absolute Legend</h4><p>The Revel will use legendary actions to empower the Ravenous Host and to force enthralled characters to turn on their friends. If The Revel has enthralled a character within 5 feet of an enemy it will use @UUID[Actor.X4vtehnvPo43XEXD.Item.ZCab4Il8MtiKCrfx]{Debauched Puppeteer} to force the character to attack its ally. In addition The Revel will use either @UUID[Actor.X4vtehnvPo43XEXD.Item.sEwOyQtykdzaMSpj]{Blood Frenzy} or @UUID[Actor.X4vtehnvPo43XEXD.Item.5W0z45VyCzz3A87s]{Ravenous Speed} to empower the Ravenous Host to even greater gluttony.</p><h2 class=\"border\">The Ravenous Host</h2><h4>Mob Rules</h4><p>The Revel uses the @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA.Item.B1FhT6UJBspWma9Y]{Debased Swarm} that is The Ravenous Host as cannon fodder, a distraction for the party which forces them to spend resources. As a <strong>swarm</strong>, the Host is relatively easy for the party to hit and that makes it particularly good at serving as a sponge to soak up anything the party might throw at it. Remember, the tokens for individual revelers in this fight are not <em><strong>actually</strong></em> individual actors, they instead share a pool of health and are used only to visually represent the whole of the swarm. As the Gamemaster you should try and threaten as many characters as possible with revelers in order to use the Host's specific @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA.Item.10eiXWWhRtpBywb5]{Multiattack}, dealing damage with @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA.Item.5rkovtQjDONTMOxS]{Mob Beatdown} for targets in melee range of a reveler or @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA.Item.41u2tXg2oXTsMW49]{Hurled Objects} for those not in close proximity to a reveler token.</p><h4>Getting Blasted</h4><p>The Ravenous host are particularly susceptible to AOE attacks given the nature of the swarm, though GMs should remember that @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA.Item.wpbJX0k7jx2nGLVi]{Blast Susceptibility} means the damage from AOE attacks is only applied <strong>once </strong> to the host, rather than affecting each reveler struck. The reveler tokens represent the whole of the swarm and are not actually individual targets.</p><h4>I GET KNOCKED DOWN BUT I GET UP AGAIN</h4><p>If The Ravenous Host is targeted by spells or attacks that would render them unconscious, such as non-lethal attacks or a spell which causes the sleep effect, another member of The Host within 5 feet of the represented token may use @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA.Item.T9DgIOVze7Uxc9v4]{Boot and Rally} as a reaction to restore them to consciousness. <strong>Note:</strong> the entire Ravenous Host only has one reaction per round regardless of the number of Tokens present on the battlefield. In addition, when the Revel uses the @UUID[Actor.X4vtehnvPo43XEXD.Item.lNNNGBrEwgcX0ge4]{Dark Rejuvenation} lair action to restore HP to the swarm, add one token back to the scene for each 10HP it restores in this manner.</p><h4>Sorry for Party Rocking</h4><p>At the start of their turn if the GM is feeling particularly punishing, The Ravenous Host can spend their bonus action to make use of @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA.Item.o0PAx8EOd9kbRvEN]{Double Fisting}, improving the effectiveness of @UUID[Actor.cuIbliWBwzc9UegA.Item.5rkovtQjDONTMOxS]{Mob Beatdown} and increasing their resilience against pugilism.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Supporting Cast</h3><p>While the actions of the party determine which NPCs will be present during this encounter it is important that the Gamemaster understand the role those NPCs play during this fight. While they can provide the party with some support, that is not their focus or goal. Due to the very real danger that they might become swayed by the Revel and join the Ravenous host, the fey are wary of committing too heavily to the fight until the Revel is weakened.</p><p>Primarily, the NPCs present are here for narrative purposes, and offering the party support is a secondary goal to that end. Overuse of the NPC abilities will greatly weaken this encounter and can lead to an overall disappointing experience for players. Remember: the players are the stars of the show, they don't want to be upstaged by the secondary actors.</p><h4>All Flash, No Substance</h4><p>It is likely advisable that while the NPCs should be seen by the players as actively assisting them from a distance — complete with attacks made against the Host—the GM should not, necessarily, change the HP totals of the Ravenous Host as a result of attacks from the NPC support. Some of the NPC cast have extremely powerful abilities that would greatly shorten the duration of this encounter, and while it may feel a bit underhanded not to apply the actual results of NPC rolls to the fight mechanically—theatrically, it would very likely disappoint the players to have their victory cheapened by NPCs killing off the enemy for them.</p><h4>Sylvaria Enters the Fray</h4><p>Sylvaria will not even join the fight until it starts to look like the party is winning, watching from the grounds to the north or east. Once the Ravenous Host has reached 50% of its HP, she will land at the north or east end of the room (whichever will place her closest to the party) and rake the Ravenous Host with a single use of @UUID[Actor.h0g8nVSDHjwhvoKB.Item.HOTavLfsvvI26Ele]{Arcane Breath}, attempting to hit as many single targets of the Host as she can. She will target this ability specifically to avoid hitting the party—this is a surgical strike. On her next turn, she will begin to transform into her human form, and thereafter will focus her efforts on casting @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pxpb2eOB6bv4phAf]{Banishment} on the Revel, expecting the party to defend her.</p><p>If the Ravenous Host comes within 10 feet of her, she will retreat behind the party or, if cornered, will make use of her full complement of features and spells to escape to a more suitable place to cast from. Sylvaria is not interested in pulling punches against the Host, and will remorselessly kill any non-friendly targets.</p><h4>Protect Our Lady</h4><p>If the party is assisted by Saedia, Chirneros, and Elscieth, the trio will hold position near the double doors, entering from the hallway to the west. They will strategically attempt to keep out of the Revel's field of view during the first half of the encounter, with Chirneros loyally acting as an impenetrable bulwark against anyone coming within fifteen feet of Elscieth. Saedia will act as a skirmisher when it is suitable to do so, aiding the party by dropping a strategic @UUID[Actor.9ZpxboHICNZBYhQu.Item.nZ8w7AlnmfziI1yb]{Entangle} on a portion of the Host, or other otherwise providing assistance—but she will only do this provided Elscieth isn't under direct threat. Elscieth, for her part, will make use of her full complement of spells and features to prevent the Host from descending upon them, and will provide the party aid in any way suitable to her arsenal of spells.</p><p>Once the Ravenous Host has been reduced to 50% health, Elscieth will begin attempting to cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pxpb2eOB6bv4phAf]{Banishment}, using however many spell slots are necessary to complete the task.</p><h4>We're In This Together</h4><p>If a party member is rendered unconscious during the event, Elscieth, Saedia, and Chirneros will move to assist that character - to a point - Elscieth will not compromise her mission as she needs to focus her efforts on Banishing the Revel.</p><p>Sylvaria, conversely, is not distracted and maintains full focus on subduing the Ravenous Host until she can begin the Banishment process, even if it means sacrificing members of the party to accomplish that goal.</p>"

Bets must be placed on the table to count, and you're automatically out of that round if you bet but refuse to put the item on the table.</p><p>Once all players have folded or bet the players then show their cards and take turns making their best case for why the face on it is better than anyone else's. Whoever makes the best argument wins the hand, and whatever was bet.</p><p>When it's your turn to argue for your card, declare a skill or tool proficiency you are using to build your argument with, and make the associated ability check. Arguments can be anything from historical claims and fabricated deeds, to entirely absurd shows of charismatic creativity.</p><p>If the party has obtained the @UUID[Item.m1dnZFX6vYG10Bhi]{Arcane Accretion Set} from the Shadeward @UUID[JournalEntry.2hdVeUnyNT1PHuFD.JournalEntryPage.1Bo1vfxHbLg8AAzw]{Gallery} and opts to use them in the game, they gain advantage on these rolls because their cards are <em>clearly</em> better.</p><p>Describe what your argument is based on the result of this skill check. Anything under 10 is flimsy, anything over 20 is incredible. The highest check at the table wins. Ties result in the bets being left in the pot and a new round begins on top of the pile.</p><p>Viable skills for this game are nearly anything a character is proficient in, as the game is based around making up cockamamie reasons why the person on your card deserves to win you all the stuff on the table.</p><h4>Foul Play</h4><p>There aren't a ton of rules about what you can and can't say when playing, but the following things will get you expelled from a hand, and possibly the table as a whole:</p><ul><li><p>Intimidating, threatening, or manipulating the players instead of making an argument regarding your face card. This will get whatever you bet thrown bat at you followed by being told to piss off.</p></li><li><p>Using magic, sleight of hand, or thievery to cheat. This is grounds for being kicked from the game and never invited to play again unless you bring gifts to apologize with.</p></li><li><p>Being boring with your explanations or not putting any effort into the game.

Though he did not have a soul meant for vengeance through violence, he was a man of law and letters, and spent the rest of his days wielding both to the detriment of his wife's murderers.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Usk Umberdael</h2><p>The endings for Usk Umberdael depend largely on what action the party took at the Planar Conduit:</p><h4>Divison Preserved</h4><p><em>If no essence was used at the Planar Conduit and the fragmentation of the manor was preserved:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Escaping the planar manor, Usk returned to the material plane. He was whole again, though he could feel something about him had changed, or been lost. Empty memories of faces, events and landscapes lingered in his mind as gaping canyons. He did not know what he had forgotten, but he knew that he remembered only half of hwat he once did.</p><p>With the memories of the feyward court in his mind, he wandered home to seek solace and counsel with the Umberdaels, hoping that his family might be able to aid him. To his shock he instead met himself, a dark reflection who held the other half of his mind, an escapee of the shadeward manor when the barriers fell. He was not one man, but two, forever, and not a day would pass where this felt fine.</p></section><h4>A realm of Chaos</h4><p><em>If the Acorn of Rampant Growth was implanted into the Planar Conduit:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Trapped within the feyward estate, Usk eventually become a fully fledged member of the house's court, with title and prestige and duty with it. Though it was not the life he wanted, he could learn to accept this place, and the chance to serve as a voice of reason in a place of madness and chaos.</p></section><h4>Everlasting Shadow</h4><p><em>If the Orb of Shadow Dominion was embedded within the Planar Conduit:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Though he survived the fall of the shadeward manor, Usk could do nothing but watch in hopeless terror as the shadows moved in to consume the grounds. Soon even the gray stone of the manor could not keep the hungering darkness at bay, and eventually he was made to join it.</p><p>Trapped within the shadeward estate, and forever at the mercy of Kryn, Usk endured unparalleled cruelty and disdain from a man who would never love or trust him. His life would be one of punishment for loyalty to Darius, for the sin of trying to aid a good man against the likes of his own son.</p></section><h4>A House United</h4><p><em>If the Quintessence of Harmony or Effigy of Remembrance was used to heal Usk's fragmentation:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Returning to the material plane, Usk sought out his family. Though they had mourned his vanishing, two decades was nothing to the elves, at most the blink of an eye, and he was quickly welcomed back into the fold. Once his mind, body and spirit were healed of the great trials he had endured he happily returned to his family's calling as a keeper of peace and order. In time Usk Umberdael was once again a respected counselor to great houses and seats of power, and this suited him just fine.</p></section><p><em>Additionally, if Usk was granted inheritance of Raventree Estate:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Usk was ultimately convinced to accept the Raventree Estate, and see to its operation as its new lord. Though he was reluctant to do so, and would forever feel out of place as a lord, those that came to serve him would never have an unkind word to say about his stewardship of the old estate.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Vivesna Corvinarus</h2><p><em>If Kryn was deposed and Vivesna ousted from the Shadeward Manor:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Narrowly escaping the fall of the Shadeward manor, Vivesna slipped into the material plane and fled, seeking to reconnect with her old contacts, and reclaim not only her beauty, but some of her power and influence. It was not how she would have wanted things to go, but it was certainly better than the alternative.</p></section><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor became permanently imprisoned:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Trapped in the shadeward manor with no escape in sight, the dark entities beyond the walls began to encroach. She she laid wards to keep them at bay to the best of her ability, but eventually there too many, their arrivals too frequent. The Wraiths and specters wore familiar faces of those once banished beyond the dark gates, and seemed keen to seek out the vile necromancer. Eventually Vivesna had no choice but to hold court with the shadows, and join their number, willing or not.</p></section><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor was transported into the Material Plane:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>With the restoration of the Shadeward manor and access to her restorative magics again, Vivesna became a flawlessly beautiful and effortlessly cruel mistress, ruling those beneath her with an iron fist clad in velvet glove. Those that pleased her knew only luxury and joy, and those that did not, would find use elsewhere, far from her court, or worse, as a permanent fixture of it.</p></section><p><em>If Kryn was killed:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Though she would mourn her beloved husband's death, truly what pained her was the last chance of reclaiming her glory and power as a royal. She had hoped that Kryn's family would have given her the necessary resources to forge a new kingdom… but alas, it would not be so.</p><p>At least, now, she would be able to pursue this ambition anew, with her beauty restored, and perhaps a new name to go along with it.</p></section><p><em>If Vaxillus was killed:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>It should never be said that Vivesna was a good mother, for in most all ways she was indulgent and negligent in damaging measures. Yet with her child's death, and knowing that she would never he other child, a great and powerful pain blossomed in her chest.</p><p>With her beauty and vitality restored through old magic recovered, she now had time enough to plan her vengeance, for there is no greater horror than a mother protecting or avenging her children.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Kryn Corvinarus</h2><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor became permanently imprisoned:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Kryn grew mad and vengeful as the shadeward manor landed wholly into the shadows. As the denizens of the dark approached his walls and gates he mustered his forces and fought them back as valiantly as he could. Sadly the dark lord learned that the shadows are endless where there is no light, and in time he would suffer the fate of all those who walked this plane unprepared.</p></section><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor was transported into the Material Plane:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>In the time to follow, the Raventree manor would come to be known as a place of dubious renown, where macabre parties and shady business deals were carried out, where profane magics could be acquired for sometimes unpalatable prices. Ultimately the old legacy of the Corvinarus family was lost, replaced with a newer, shadowed one, with Kryn at its heart.</p></section><p><em>If Vivesna was killed:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Kryn had never trusted anyone in his life before he met Vivesna, and even if she had been toying with his feeling and manipulating his mind, he had given himself to her completely and without regard for any risk of betrayal.</p><p>When she perished he felt a pain unlike any other before it. In the wake of this loss his mind was consumed by an ache that could not be soothed. The dark irony, however lost it may have been on him, was that this is just how his father had felt once before, and like his father, Kryn began to plot and scheme.</p><p>However, his plans would not be so elaborate, nor so virtuous as to affect rescue of his love like his father had dreamt of doing. No, he preferred something simpler, something crueler: bloody vengeance. Nothing more, nothing less.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Vaxillus Loumaal</h2><p><em>If Vaxillus was &amp;Reference[petrified]{petrified} as a statue:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>It should never be said that Vivesna was a good mother, for in most all ways she was indulgent and negligent in damaging measures. Yet staring at her son's petrified form caused a powerful pain to blossom in her chest.</p><p>In the years that unfurled before her, Vivesna dedicated countless hours to studying magic and lore in pursuit of a cure for her poor son. With time she would be able to save him, and once that was complete, she and her beloved boy would seek vengeance on those who had helped Lyranth so long ago...</p></section><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor became permanently imprisoned:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>When the shadeward manor fell Vaxillus did not fall with it. When the black iron walls crumbled and the darkness entered the grounds he hunted and ambushed shapes prowling the grounds. Eventually though, the shadows began to seethe with a knowing malice, peered through windows, and sat in wait. When they moved, it was not to flee, but to pursue. It was too late when Vaxillus realized he was the one being hunted.</p></section><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor was transported into the Material Plane:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>When the Shadeward manor was restored, the man was expected to hold a title and serve a purpose. Only ever good at one thing, it seemed a natural fit for him to bear the title of the hunt master, and to the shock of many, including Kryn, he proved quite capable. Any who thought otherwise rarely lived long enough to say so.</p></section><p><em>If Kryn was usurped but the party earned Vaxillus' loyalty:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>In Vaxillus' life he known only one true friend who had cared for him, and that was his mother. But within the party he had found others that seemed to genuinely accept him, warts and all. When his stepfather fell he refused to raise his weapon in defiance, and instead stood aside.</p><p>For this he was spared, and in the years to come he would continue to offer aid to the party whenever he could, after all, what were friends for if not lending a hand now and then?</p></section><p><em>If Kryn was usurped and the party did not earn Vaxillus' loyalty:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Vaxillus had hoped he'd feel joy, or elation upon his stepfather's failure, but instead he knew that with Kryn's defeat all that would come it was his mother's misery, and for him, a hollow feeling where there should have been satisfaction.</p><p>Without the means to express this to anyone, and no conduit for his hatred, he focused his cruelty outward at whomever he could catch and corner. In the years to come his brutish nature precede him in all places he went, and never would that bastard son know a true friend or ally so long as he lived.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Lyranth the Sculptor</h2><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor became permanently imprisoned:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Having survived the ordeal of the Shadeward manor's fall, Lyranth found herself trapped in the ruins of the dark manor with no escape. Mad with isolation and fear, she cast open the gates and strode into the darkness hoping that something would end her. She would not be so lucky. To this day there are rumors of a sculpture garden of gray figures deep in the Shadowfell, and that any who enter its bounds become a part of it.</p></section><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor was transported into the Material Plane:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Under the guidance of Vivesna, with the Shadeward manor restored to glory, Lyranth did not want for work or attention. She even had a growing list of models, and better still, a plentiful supply of unwanted courtiers with which to do as she pleased. In the time her pieces would be found far and wide, the unmistakable expression of fear and horror a hallmark of her work.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Tymnas</h2><p><em>If \"Home Sweet Home\" was completed:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Having escaped the shadeward manor after being freed from his bonds, Tymnas returned to the Feyward manor for a while, but ultimately decided that he had gotten his fill of the familiar walls and paths. Setting out into the primal Feywild, he sought to reconnect with a land he had long been removed from. He was never seen again, as was surely his desire.</p></section><p><em>Otherwise if the Shadeward Manor became permanently imprisoned:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Having never been released from his bondage before the Shadeward manor fell, the unfortunate groundskeeper found himself trapped in a manor of darkness and shadows, without any way to escape. Eventually he would be claimed by horrible things that no mortal nor fey could comprehend, and would never be seen again.</p></section><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor was transported into the Material Plane:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Having never been released from his bondage, Tymnas was made to suffer many more years of service under the cruel hand of the Shadeward Manor's master. With each vicious cycle of the calendar his melancholy grew, and his hope of escape dwindled. The withered figure that remains to this day is but a shadow of the man who once was.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Vostolas the Archivist</h2><p><em>If Vostolas was \"killed\":</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Slain while in the Shadeward manor, Vostolas bided his time until he was ready and able to return to the manor, if he even could. It had been some time since he knew the sting of death, and in time he might see to repaying those that reminded him of its great unpleasantness.</p></section><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor became permanently imprisoned:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Vostolas survived the ordeal at the Shadeward manor, avoiding a more unfortunate fate. It is impossible to know where he has gotten to, or what became of his grand collection, but there is no doubt that he and his imps are up to their old tricks.</p></section><p><em>If the Shadeward Manor was transported into the Material Plane:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>To this day Vostolas remains the librarian and archivist of the Raventree Manor, and enjoys an even greater flow of guests to charm and corrupt. Unchecked by the limits of the Shadowfell, his little game of collecting souls for his master would prove quite a lucrative one.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Chirneros</h2><p><em>If Elscieth's humanity was restored and the Feyward Manor was not destroyed:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>At the side of Elscieth, Chirneros became a boisterous and beloved champion, a dauntless protector of the estate and storied hero like few others the court had seen. He would sit at her left hand for as long as they both drew breath, and would never know a happiness greater than this.</p></section><p><em>If Sylvaria established her fey queendom:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Ever faithful, the great fey champion remained dutifully at the side of Sylvaria, and suffered in silence as he watched the last shreds of Elscieth be consumed by the boundless draconic ambitions of his new lord. Though he wished to leave, and could have begged release from his oaths, he could not bring himself to do so, for that would admit that Elscieth was finally, truly gone.</p></section><p><em>If Elscieth was killed:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Without his beloved at his side the great and powerful Chirneros would leave the feyward manor and battle across the Feywild, slaying foes great and small, growing in power. His every victory would be dedicated to the memory of his beloved, and the chance to visit vengeance upon those that murdered her.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Elscieth Corvinarus</h2><p><em>If Elscieth's humanity was restored and the Feyward Manor was not destroyed:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>With her mind restored and command the Feyward manor returned to her, Elscieth would become a beloved master of her court, with guests and dignitaries coming from far and wide to meet here. What's more, she would soon begin to hear the whispers of those seeking power like she had so many years ago, and in return she would grant them their desires. Yet unlike her old master, she would treat her Warlocks well, and they would serve happily.</p></section><p><em>If Chirneros was slain:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Though she would rule the feyward for an age, she would do so alone, without her champion. Each passing day made her a more bitter and unpleasant master, her lonely melancholy souring her once sunny disposition. Twice she had lost the love of her life, and twice she was forced to start anew. Those who called to her with bitter tears and cries for retribution would receive a patron's spiteful gifts, if only to seek revenge upon the mortal lands.</p></section><p><em>If reunited with Byscilla:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>It was a predictable awkward reunion when mother and daughter met again. Elscieth did all in her great power to appear human, and Byscilla made great efforts to recall the woman who had not been a part of her life for more than two decades.</p><p>Though there was much to catch up on, and they both knew they belonged to different worlds now, there was a measure of closure gained between them. The two women came away confident that the other would be okay without them, and that for all the time and distance between them, neither had fared so badly.</p><p>They would maintain infrequent contact in the years to come, but as Byscilla grew older, and Elscieth did not, and as the Danos family grew great and large, it forgot the last Corvinarus within its tree.</p><p>This suited Elscieth just fine, for her had much to do as the Feyward Estate's beautiful mistress, and she was happy to know her family did not need her.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Sylvaria the Dragon</h2><p><em>If the Manor became a fey crossing with Sylvaria as its archfey queen:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>With the planar sanctum claimed as her new chaotic nest, Sylvaria set to ruling the Feyward estate with an iron talon, while also turning the old, ruined estate into a vast stronghold brimming dangers from another plane. Soon the old legends and stories of things in the woods became frightfully true. Though children were cautioned to avoid the tree lines at sundown and daybreak, lest they be taken by fairies and goblins, many still went missing regardless.</p></section><p><em>If Sylvaria's reign was denied by the party:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Denied her foothold in the material realm, Sylvaria took to seething in the feyward manor, and turned that anger upon any in her court who displeased her. All the while she plotted and planned, vowing to one day return to the material realm to seize what was rightfully hers, and destroy those who had kept it from her.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">The Red Scullion</h2><p><em>If the Red Scullion survived but The Revel was destroyed:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>With the loss of the Revel, the Red Scullion ran off into the chaotic wilds where she wandered forever, crying out for the vile spirit to return to her, begging it to come back, to restore her power. In the end she would be lost to the wilds, never to be seen again, and those to remembered her would not do so fondly.</p></section><p><em>If both the Red Scullion and The Revel survived:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>With nothing to stand in her way, the Red Scullion fed soul after soul to the great Revel until it grew so great that its hunger was beyond what the feyward could tolerate. Old pacts were damned and broken, weapons were drawn, and the Ravenous Host was set upon. Though the Feyward manor drove off the Hag and Revel, they would lurk forever in the Feywild, ensnaring travelers, and falling upon lesser courts unprepared for their presence. Each feast, each victim bringing it closer to apotheosis.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Greenhouse Sprites</h2><p><em>If the Feyward Manor survived under Elscieth's leadership:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>For the years to come the band of brave and goodly war sprites would help to maintain and defend the great feyward manor, assisting its master in efforts of scouting and security. In return they were celebrated as heroes, and their villages grew in number and strength, until a veritable army stood in defense of the Feyward estate.</p></section><p><em>If the Feyward Manor survived under Sylvaria's rule:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>With the Feyward manor falling under the control of Sylvaria the band of war sprites quickly chose to withdraw from the estate grounds rather than serve her darker interests. Observing from afar, they built scouting camps, and began sending information to their allies. Something would need to be done about the dragon queen.</p></section><p><em>If the Sprites were killed or enthralled by The Revel:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Having suffered innumerable losses, the war sprites of the Feyward manor abandoned their post and retreated back into the wild fey lands to regroup and report back to their leaders. This would be a battle lost, but a war begun. Given time they would regroup, rearm, and prepare to avenge their fallen.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Stuckina Bogg</h2><p><em>If Stuckina was freed from her curse with Herniva's help:<br />(If the party helped her end the curst, adjust this accordingly.)</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>With the help of Herniva, the hag's curse was eventually lifted from Stuckina and she found her form returning to that of a human woman, with fair countenance and unclouded mind. She might have been forever in Herniva's debt, but the fact the siren had been the source of curse meant she offered only forgiveness, and that was more than enough for Herniva. As for Stuckina, she returned home, reclaimed her life and alchemical shop, and shared her wild story with her sister, who was thrilled to see her back.</p></section><p><em>If Stuckina was freed from her curse without Herniva's help:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>It was no easy task for Stuckina, escaping her curse, and when she eventually returned home to reclaim her life she had found that many, many years had passed. All that she knew and loved and cared for had grown old without her.</p><p>She cared for an aging sister, took on an identity of a long-lost cousin, and did her best to shepherd what remained of the Boggs legacy, but it was in truth a bitter homecoming. Though in her heart, Stuckina knew the alternative would have been far, far worse.</p></section><p><em>If Stuckina was never freed of her curse:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Having never been cured of her curse, Stuckina eventually lost her mind in the lightless depths of the faerie seas, and to the icy currents went everything that made her more than a monster. She would join the numberless horde of hags that haunted grottos across the material plane, preying on mortals, until one day a band of heroes would put her out of her misery.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Herniva the Siren</h2><p><em>If Herniva helped to free Stuckina of her curse:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Having helped restore Stuckina's humanity, Herniva took to the faerie seas and the chaotic depths with a lighter heart. They had ultimately done the right thing, and in so doing, felt a great and terrible weight lifted from their soul.</p></section><p><em>If Herniva did not help cure Stuckina:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Refusing to do the right thing, Herniva returned to a life of wandering from court to court, listening to gossip and spreading it around. Yet they never felt fulfilled, and could not bring themselves to enjoy these moments of social exchange, for a missed opportunity to do the right thing clung to their heart like a leaden weight. Herniva's mind often wondered after the fate of Stuckina, though the siren would never admit it.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Thorne and Thystle</h2><p><em>If one of the two spriggans perished, but the other survived:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>One without the other would never be the same, though they could hold watch with other spriggans, and find friends among their own ranks, one can never replace a soul cut from the same grove. For all the rest of their days the one surviving spriggan would feel alone, wishing their friend had lived, or that they both could have died.</p></section><p><em>If both spriggans survived:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Thorne and Thystle would go on to guard many a path and checkpoint in the ages to come, adding more rings and becoming fat with age. Eventually, when their limbs were too stiff to move easily, and everyone had grown sick of their antics they set off to their old war grove from where they were split. There they settled down to teach the next chop of spriggans coming from the grove.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Mistress Saedia</h2><p><em>If the Feyward Manor survived under Elscieth's leadership:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>At the side of the feyward manor's master Saedia served as a dutiful Seneschal, guiding the house, tending the staff, and providing useful guidance. In the years to follow the house would thrive, and she would be lauded as a vital right hand, earning her accolades far and wide. She could not have been more pleased.</p></section><p><em>If the Feyward Manor survived under Sylvaria's rule:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Stuck at Sylvaria's side for many years to follow, Saedia did her absolute best to guide and corral the ambitious dragon, but Sylvaria was too wary and untrusting of her after the ordeal with the dreaming tree. Realizing she would never truly be listened to, Saedia resigned from the court, and sought halls far away from the Feyward, where she could escape the violent chaos it created.</p></section><p><em>If Elscieth and Sylvaria were killed:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Without a master of any sort, the leadership of the Feyward estate would eventually fall to the ancient dryad. Reluctantly, but with grace, Saedia accepted the mantle, and came to rule the manor with an even, and peaceful hand. Though many would consider it to be a rather placid court by comparison to others, it was a safe and respected one regardless.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Woodfellow the Librarian</h2><p><em>If the Feyward Manor survived:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Woodfellow would remain in the feyward manor for an age or more, drinking up the history in the land and filling countless tomes. When eventually he felt there was nothing more of note to record he pulled up his great roots and began the long journey across the Feywild, seeking a new spring of knowledge to dig into.</p></section><p><em>If the Feyward Manor fell:</em></p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>In the grand history of mortals there were countless soul-breaking tales of vast libraries burning, and with them stores of knowledge older than nations and empires being lost.

This outcome avoids a deadly follow-up encounter with the @UUID[Actor.Xxf80BJeTCVKhIao]{Corvinarus Abomination} but sacrifices the opportunity to use the Planar Conduit. If this outcome occurs proceed to the \"Division Preserved\" outcome of @UUID[.MdLIL1sn839wFuZJ#division-preserved]{Event: The Planar Conduit}.</p><h4><strong>Darius Becomes The Abomination</strong></h4><p>If the party defeats Darius without destroying both Crystal Tethers, his soul and consciousness will flow into the failed clone and Darius becomes the @UUID[Actor.Xxf80BJeTCVKhIao]{Corvinarus Abomination}. This outcome results in the plot advancing to @UUID[.g52H8P0iv7YF19Nj]{Event: The Corvinarus Abomination}.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Combatants and Tactics</h3><p>Darius is a talented mage whose powers are amplified by his Planar Sanctum and the raging torrent of the Planar Conduit, which simultaneously tortures and empowers him.</p><h4>Unique Features</h4><p>Darius is permanently &amp;Reference[Restrained] and cannot move from his current position, but through his unique mastery over the Planar Sanctum, Darius has several features that set him apart from other spellcasters.</p><p><strong>Masterful Spellcasting.</strong> While inside the Planar Sanctum, Darius weaves magic solely with his mind ignoring all requirements for verbal, somatic, or material spell components.</p><p><strong>Master of the Sanctum.</strong> Within his own Planar Sanctum, Darius is nearly omniscient. He has &amp;Reference[truesight], cannot be &amp;Reference[Deafened], &amp;Reference[Silenced], or &amp;Reference[Blinded], cannot be &amp;Reference[surprise]{Surprised}, and has advantage to saving throws against Illusion magic.</p><p><strong>Immutable Prison</strong>. The nature of Darius' imprisonment renders him immune to any spell or effect that would alter his form. He cannot be &amp;Reference[Grappled], &amp;Reference[Restrained], &amp;Reference[Stunned], or &amp;Reference[Paralyzed] beyond the extent to which he is already imprisoned.</p><p><strong>Torrential Spellcraft</strong>. Darius cannot rest, but the raging torrent of magic which courses through Darius' body fully recharges his spell slots every 10 minutes.</p><p><strong>Tethered Suffering</strong>. Damage dealt to the Fey Crystal Tether is shared, dealing half damage to the crystal and half damage to Darius as lightning damage. Damage dealt to the Shadow Crystal Tether is shared, dealing half damage to the crystal and half damage to Darius as lightning damage.</p><p><strong>Violent Regeneration</strong>. Each turn, opposing energies from the Crystal Tethers tear at Darius, wounding and healing him.</p><p><strong>Legendary Actions and Resistances</strong>. Darius is a powerful foe with both legendary actions and legendary resistances to assist him in battle. As a pure spellcaster, Darius will use all 3 legendary actions each round to <strong>Cast a Spell</strong>.</p><h4>Spellcraft</h4><p>Darius is intelligent, cunning, and prepared for combat because of his awareness of events within his sanctum. He balances his spellcasting tactics between defending himself, protecting the Crystal Tethers, and crippling or destroying the party.</p><p>Darius should always maintain one spell which uses Concentration, while using his other (legendary) spell for the round to deal damage or defend himself. Some specific tactics that he is likely to employ include:</p><p><strong>Set a trap. </strong>As the party makes their way through the Sanctum, gradually approaching the @UUID[JournalEntry.qokqJHkJY1uv6PoD.JournalEntryPage.9u7nPiXTTuAtujwH]{Ritual Chamber}, cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.B2kbmgbA2WQR00kx]{Symbol} to lay a deadly trap.</p><p><strong>Defensive preparation. </strong>As the party approaches the Ritual Chamber, cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.4smlOvpF5AQHcyg1]{Contingency} to trigger @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X4c8xCkmF8U9HUMz]{Mirror Image} when he takes damage from an attack.</p><p><strong>Remove the biggest physical threat. </strong>Attempt to quickly nullify a physical damage dealer like a Fighter, Rogue, Paladin, or Barbarian by imprisoning them within a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.clwv2PWOcT822hlr]{Maze}.</p><p><strong>Even the odds. </strong>Remove the most dangerous opponents by casting @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pxpb2eOB6bv4phAf]{Banishment} which temporarily (or eventually permanently) expels them into the @UUID[JournalEntry.rJvb9Dp9sAvBIIzP.JournalEntryPage.HZepipuQu62GA5JQ]{R20. The Lord's Chambers} of the Ruined Manor.</p><p><strong>Protect the Crystal Tethers. </strong>If the party attacks the Crystal Tethers, use @UUID[Actor.cEaCmjp4Fxfa3ftH.Item.1NhqeogMFg5Eqian]{Wall of Force} to protect one or both crystals from physical harm.</p><p><strong>Maintain his defenses. </strong>Darius is vulnerable to attack rolls because he is &amp;Reference[Restrained] and has low Armor Class. He will always keep @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X4c8xCkmF8U9HUMz]{Mirror Image} active to provide himself with defenses. Use @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.z1mx84ONwkXKUZd7]{Shield} to maintain a higher Armor Class if focused upon by attack rolls.</p><p><strong>Prevent dangerous spellcasting. </strong>Use @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{Counterspell} to nullify dangerous magic once he has run out of Legendary Resistances.</p><p><strong>Attack using the Conduit. </strong>Darius does not have offensive Cantrips, but he can channel the Planar Conduit directly with his Volatile Coil and Repulsive Sweep attacks. He will resort to using these attacks directly if his spellcraft fails to subdue the party.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Attacking the Crystal Tethers</h3><p>The party may choose to destroy the Crystal Tethers, either because they believe this the best path towards victory or because they find themselves outmatched by Darius' spellcraft.</p><p>Each crystal has 50 Hit Points, an Armor Class of 20, and several damage resistances or immunities as reflected on their character sheets @UUID[Actor.HSfcDhqYWOyVdZqb]{Shadow Crystal Tether} and @UUID[Actor.5aBfVyHdXKw8oJXb]{Fey Crystal Tether}.

The only way to avoid inevitable death is to destroy the other Crystal Tether to nullify and collapse the Planar Sanctum itself.</p><h4>The Sanctum Collapses</h4><p>When both Crystal Tethers are destroyed, the Planar Sanctum swiftly collapses:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>With both Crystal Tethers destroyed the maelstrom of energy intensifies, wrapping and twisting the very environment. Light and sound begin to warp as nearby objects begin to look very far away and the crashing sound of thunder stretches into an otherworldly drone.

The @UUID[Actor.Xxf80BJeTCVKhIao]{Corvinarus Abomination} may be attacked while inside the tank but it benefits from three-quarters &amp;Reference[cover] and has resistance to all damage caused by area-of-effect spells or abilities.</p><p>If the abomination is reduced to zero hit points, Darius is unable to transfer his soul into the clone and the second phase of this encounter, @UUID[.g52H8P0iv7YF19Nj]{Event: The Corvinarus Abomination} is avoided.</p><p>This approach constitutes a highly risky strategy because the abomination is difficult to destroy while inside the tank and ignoring Darius exposes the party to considerable risk from his spellcraft.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Darius Destroyed</h3><p>If Darius is reduced to zero hit points without both Crystal Tethers being destroyed first, read the following:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Darius' terrible wounds surpass the restoration provided by the sustaining magic of the Planar Conduit.

Before the Planar Conduit can complete the task of tearing Darius' asunder, his body collapses and with a deafening crash of thunder a shockwave emanates from the epicenter of the ritual chamber tearing through the broken remnants of the Planar Sanctum with explosive power.</p><p><span data-text=\"true\">The Planar Sanctum explodes with a shockwave of concussive force and deafening sound.

The Corvinarus Abomination is a monstrous beast fueled by pain, fear, rage, and hunger. It seeks only to escape its prison of torment and destroy anyone or anything which stands in its way.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Destroy the heroes</strong>. If the abomination determines that it can defeat the party, it will attempt to destroy them using its brutal array of attacks to swiftly end the encounter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Destroy the crystals</strong>. If the abomination determines that it cannot defeat the party, or if the Crystal Tethers are already partially destroyed the abomination will instead focus on destroying them in order to manufacture an escape from its prison. Attacking the Crystal Tethers will damage the Abomination itself, but like a wolf chewing at its own leg to escape a trap, the monster is willing to suffer in exchange for tasting freedom.</p></li></ol><h3 class=\"border\">Paths to Victory</h3><p>There are two possible outcomes for this event which have significantly different consequences for the adventure conclusion:</p><h4>Destroy the Crystal Tethers</h4><p>If the party destroys both Crystal Tethers, the Planar Sanctum will collapse. This now comes with added risk because if the Corvinarus Abomination still survives it is also expelled into the Material Plane when the sanctum collapses.</p><p>If one of the crystal tethers has already been destroyed the only available path forward is to destroy the other tether to complete the unraveling of the Planar Sanctum.</p><h4><strong>Destroy the Abomination</strong></h4><p>If the party destroys the Corvinarus Abomination, they have a moment of peace where the Shattered Sanctum is still. If both Crystal Tethers still survive the party can use the remaining power of the Planar Conduit to make crucial decisions which change the adventure conclusion as described in @UUID[.MdLIL1sn839wFuZJ]{Event: The Planar Conduit}.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Combatants and Tactics</h3><p>Unlike the prior encounter against Darius which featured a cunning and skillful adversary with a wide array of magical capabilities, the Corvinarus Abomination is a direct confrontation against a deadly melee adversary. The abomination lacks guile, finesse, or arcane capability, instead relying on monstrous force to overwhelm enemies.</p><h4>Unique Features</h4><p><strong>Tentacled Climb.</strong> The Abomination can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p><p><strong>Standing Leap</strong>. The Corvinarus Abomination can long jump is up to 30 ft. and high jump is up to 15 ft., with or without a running start.</p><p><strong>Tethered Suffering</strong>. Damage dealt to the Fey Crystal Tether is shared, dealing half damage to the crystal and half damage to the Abomination as lightning damage. Damage dealt to the Shadow Crystal Tether is shared, dealing half damage to the crystal and half damage to the Abomination as lightning damage.</p><h4>Brutal Tactics</h4><p>The Corvinarus Abomination will use its @UUID[Actor.Xxf80BJeTCVKhIao.Item.ZSGdaJpSN69gBl6m]{Standing Leap} to quickly traverse the arena and get into melee combat with its chosen adversary. It will unleash its full @UUID[Actor.Xxf80BJeTCVKhIao.Item.ka2c1JcobIxvqJkx]{Multiattack} chain upon a single target in an attempt to render that target unconscious, ideally positioning itself to utilize @UUID[Actor.Xxf80BJeTCVKhIao.Item.AdnmIzVYUYTGCoYN]{Rampage} against an adjacent enemy.</p><p>The Corvinarus Abomination will use its @UUID[Actor.Xxf80BJeTCVKhIao.Item.Uzy4dHz5Sgrt8ioe]{Anguished Roar} to project a cone which can stun enemies within its area and will prefer attacking stunned targets to gain advantage on its strikes.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Destroying the Abomination</h2><p>The most direct path to victory is to destroy the Corvinarus Abomination.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>With a final monstrous roar the Corvinarus Abomination slumps to the ground, the Planar Conduit coursing through its dead body which is no longer able to retain its malformed cohesion. The abomination's flesh chars and blackens as it is scorched. The torrent of energy streaming off the Crystal Tethers dissolves the flesh of Darius' abhorrent clone and the conduit suddenly snaps back into alignment, once again achieving equilibrium in the center of what remains of the Shattered Sanctum.</p></section><p class=\"important\">Advance to @UUID[.MdLIL1sn839wFuZJ]{Event: The Planar Conduit} to resolve the final choices that the party makes to conclude the adventure.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Destroying the Crystal Tethers</h2><p>This remains an option available to players as described in @UUID[.92Et3bs4VeUrkAoU#attacking-the-crystal-tethers]{Attacking the Crystal Tethers}, however once the Corvinarus Abomination has awoken this becomes a foolhardy path to follow as collapsing the Planar Sanctum would expel its inhabitants - including the abomination - back into the Ruined Manor.</p><p>If the Abomination survives when the tethers are destroyed, move the combat to the @UUID[JournalEntry.rJvb9Dp9sAvBIIzP.JournalEntryPage.bN8UThZWXJ04ndwk]{R21.

The valuable scrolls, richly illuminated with gold foil and bright inks, contain the secrets to several powerful arcane techniques. Their magical nature and the enchantment on the case means that they have survived where no other document in the library did- and their fine decoration means that their value might be as much artistic as arcane.</p></li><li><p><strong>[[/check skill=arc dc=16]] check.</strong> Faint signs of an aura of of abjuration magic linger about on the display case, and a closer inspection reveals that there are tiny abjuration runes carved into the metal frame, clearly designed to reinforcing the case and protect its contents.</p></li></ul></article></section><p>The key which opens this lock is in the drawer of the desk in the @UUID[JournalEntry.rJvb9Dp9sAvBIIzP.JournalEntryPage.bN8UThZWXJ04ndwk#the-desk]{The Master Bedroom} - but the lock has long since been claimed by rust, and can no longer be opened.

The once august home is filled with considerable dangers, not the least of which are the many treacherous hallways and unstable floors.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Structural Damage</h2><p>Extensive damage to the manor has left most of the upper floors treacherous to traverse. The party will need to tread carefully and avoid damaging the walls of the manor as too much damage could cause floors to collapse. Given that much of the manor is lit only by whatever daylight might leak through its battered structure, there are significant tripping hazards and risks of perilous falls.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Mirrors and Broken Glass</h3><p class=\"important\">As the locations of mirrors are important to the Shard Stalker, we have marked the locations of all mirrors within the ruined manor in red, these markings are only visible to you as GM.</p><p>Numerous room descriptions in the ruined manor mention mirrors or broken glass. The gamemaster should be prepared when a player character first passes a mirror or steps on broken glass, as this will be the first trigger which notifies @UUID[.Qc8bHOHpX2Lvy9W2#the-shard-stalker]{The Shard Stalker} of their presence.</p><p>From the moment that occurs, the Shard Stalker will begin hunting the party.</p><p>For your convenience, the mirrors in the ruined manor are marked with red squares which only the GM can see.

See @UUID[.C9oG9vTReMN48i1t]{Event: Housebound Ambush} for more information.</p><h3 class=\"border\">The Shard Stalker</h3><p>Though it keeps to itself on the highest floor of the manor, the @UUID[Actor.A60ns8tMmTdrXI6U]{Shard Stalker} will quickly realize that there are intruders in the manor and begin watching them from mirrors and holes in the wall. It is an extremely deadly opponent which will, true to its name, stalk the party slowly over time.</p><p>The Shard Stalker <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">will not</span></strong></span> attack outright, but instead spends time, possibly several days watching the intruders, learning about their habits and behavior. During this time it may make its presence known by creating innocuous noises and lingering just long enough in the periphery of the party's line of sight to draw attention before vanishing. This is all done to test how the intruders respond, so that it can prepare to fight them. Once it feels confident, it will begin looking for opportunities to draw individuals away from the group, or attack vulnerable stragglers.</p><p>For more information see @UUID[.gZcmW4fALCF3iwkH]{Event: In a Mirror, Darkly}</p><h3 class=\"border\">House Wight Patrols</h3><p>Once the sun sets, teams of @UUID[Actor.aaEXnW2WjmAh4yDt]{Wights} materialize out of the gloom and begin patrolling the manor.

At first they are silent, save for the crackling of electrical discharge.</p><p>Then, as if spurred by something, their faces contort in torment and they begin to shriek and wail in agony, the magical energies of which they are formed increase in intensity, small arcs of electricity discharging against the loose debris and the surfaces of the room, which begin to char and smoke at their passing.</p><p>And they are moving toward you.</p></section><section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><h2>Encounter: Arcane Wraiths</h2><img src=\"modules/house-divided/assets/creatures/portraits/arcane-wraith.webp\" /></header><article><p class=\"encounter-left\">@UUID[Actor.x28laoC4NPE7abQC]{Arcane Wraiths x2}</p><p class=\"encounter-right\">Deadly</p></article></section><p class=\"important\">Destroying the Arcane Wraiths earns the party a @UUID[JournalEntry.D1QzSUnec7ZApnDF.JournalEntryPage.mhIzp2kUkLiWEKB8#milestone-advancement]{Milestone Point} and completes one of the objectives for @UUID[JournalEntry.x9xlmkKYSp1PEYAf.JournalEntryPage.ohNULn0egCTMgjYz#repowering-the-circles]{Repowering the Circles}.

If they have not already investigated the portal enough to reveal details about it, now is a good time to offer spellcasters proficient in Arcana the opportunity to make some hasty guesses. A successful [[/check skill=arc dc=14]] checkwill tell them any or all of the following:</p><ul><li><p>It seems to be some kind of portal or rift—though it's too small to consider trying to step into it.</p></li><li><p>Whatever caused this portal or rift, it doesn't seem to be <strong>inherently </strong>dangerous.</p></li><li><p>The colors it shifts between seem somehow connected to the strange wraiths.</p></li></ul></div><figure class=\"portrait flex1\"><img src=\"modules/house-divided/assets/creatures/portraits/arcane-wraith.webp\" /></figure></div><p>The players have only a few moments to act in this time, give them one round to allow them to panic before expanding the portal in the center of the room as an escape. @UUID[.tfp0I9VUbtICy5xY#the-way-out-is-through]{The Way Out Is Through} contains details about how to guide the players in, as well as macros you can use to visually expand the portal to its full size.

Over the noise of the portal and the sound of the wraiths, they might even hear his distant voice calling things like \"Here! Through here!\"</p><p>If the party attempts to fight the wraiths, make it clear that this encounter is hopeless by leveraging the Arcane Wraiths' extensive kit to deny every possibility of attack. Anyone who moves into melee range should be hit with @UUID[Actor.x28laoC4NPE7abQC.Item.xZPFtf2vCYraWXVe]{Arcane strike}. Anyone who attempts to cast a spell should have it sapped by @UUID[Actor.x28laoC4NPE7abQC.Item.uYDXkZCgYiZBNT8C]{Spell Shattering}.</p><h2 class=\"border\" style=\"margin-top:0\">Tactics</h2><p>This encounter is intended to be deadly when first encountered, as the party is expected to flee through the portal instead of fighting. For very large parties (5-6 pcs) add an additional Arcane Wraith to the Dining Hall. GMs should take advantage of the @UUID[Actor.x28laoC4NPE7abQC.Item.idILnIUj76QH9v8w]{Incorporeal Movement} feature to have the wraiths shift to positions which force the party to retreat toward the portal.</p><p>Arcane Wraiths are highly resistant to a large number of damage types, are immune to most conditions, and gain health when successfully saving against magic. This makes them especially difficult to kill without proper equipment and preparation. </p><p><strong>Intelligent Horrors.</strong> Arcane Wraiths are highly intelligent, and will smartly select targets in battle. Given their resistance to magic in general they tend to prioritize non-magical combatants first, as they can rely on incoming magic to make them more resilient and able to survive melee with tougher creatures. If a caster proves especially troubling however, they will shift their priorities appropriately.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Special Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Portal Bound.</strong> Arcane Wraiths cannot move more than 100ft from the portal in the center of the dining hall, or move to a point where they would not still see the portal. Wraiths that are forced to move further away or out of view of the portal spend all of their movement (and action if necessary) to return to a square at least 100ft from and in view of the portal.</p><p><strong>Beckoning Figure.</strong> When the battle begins the party can see a figure in the fluctuating portal desperately beckoning for them to approach. The party will notice this with a passive perception of 10 or better.</p><p><strong>Fluctuating Portal.</strong> The portal begins pointing at either the fey or Shadowfell, and at the end of the last arcane wraith’s turn the portal flips to point at the other plane. This continues until at least one member of the party goes through the portal, at which point it stops fluctuating and stays fixed on the plane the party member went to. Left-clicking on the macros below will switch the portal to display as linked to the Feyward Manor or Shadeward Manor, as you choose.</p><section class=\"box-text macro\"><div class=\"macro-icon\"><p></p></div><aside class=\"macro-details\"><h4>Macro: Fluctuating Portal</h4><p>These three Macros allow you to control the state of the <strong>Fluctuating Portal</strong>.</p><p>@UUID[Macro.HSvizhDJAugq7wjP]{Dining Hall Portal: Dormant}: both Feyward and Shadeward energies are in balance and the two Arcane Wraiths are equal in size.</p><p>@UUID[Macro.B2VvwY3dMrNC9Ni7]{Dining Hall Portal: Feyward}: the Feyward energy is dominant and the Feyward Wraith increases in size.</p><p>@UUID[Macro.lHq3lgAVwZoujsej]{Dining Hall Portal: Shadeward}: the Shadeward energy is dominant and the Shadeward Wraith increases in size.</p></aside></section><h2 class=\"border\">The Way Out Is Through</h2><p>On Round 2, the proximity of the wraiths to the center of the room will cause an unstable portal to appear.

Once a member of the party has fled through the portal the portal no longer switches.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>As the portals shift and ripple, swirling with alternating violet and orange light, the sillouhette of a backlit figure leans part way out of it, face and body contorted and twisted by the shimmering and shifting effect of the rift. A hand extends outward toward you, palm up— and the figure seems to be shouting. The voice emerges, distorted and strange, echoing and overlapping as it calls:</p><blockquote><p>HURRY! IT WON'T HOLD FOR LONG!</p></blockquote></section><p>Other possible phrases include:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>PLEASE! I CAN HELP YOU!</p><p>DON'T LET THEM GET TO YOU, HERE! COME THROUGH HERE!</p><p>IT'S SAFE! QUICKLY!

Lines of questioning or insistence on these topics are quite disturbing to him and, if the party presses the issue or try to engage him in combat, he will stop talking to the party. He instead politely declines to speak to them, asserting that he would like to wait in peace and quiet. Continuing to press the issue will result in him determinedly refusing to even look in their direction, turning his chin up and away, or even civilly rising from his seat and moving to a different one in the room which faces away from the party. If such a seat doesn't exist, he will excuse himself into the lavatory for an extended period of time, periodically peeking back out from within to see if the party has moved on.</p><p>This can be smoothed over with an apology (sincere or otherwise) and a successful [[/check skill=dec dc=16]] or [[/check skill=per dc=16]] check, depending on truthfulness. The DC of this check increases by 2 each time the party insults him further and tries to smooth things over again.</p><p>However, pointing out details about Perrius, such as his name (which can be discovered from the guest book in the@UUID[JournalEntry.GfWgVX7GYShBa9bG.JournalEntryPage.L8EjhZ0KKa46WBs3]{R02. Foyer} ) he will recognize those facts as correct— he remembers who he is— though he does not gain any additional knowledge as a result.</p><section class=\"box-text investigation\"><header><h4>Ghostly Speculation</h4></header><article><p>Conversing with Perrius provides some opportunities to glean a few key details:</p><p><strong>[[/check skill=his dc=16]] check.</strong> Perrius' clothing, manners, and style are about two decades out of date, which would mean he's been sitting in this house for quite a while. By the looks of his finery he was a man of means and likely modest wealth.</p><p><strong>[[/check skill=ins dc=16]] check.</strong> He appears to be stuck in a moment of waiting for some house servant to come get him, and has no awareness that it has been years since anyone living occupied this location. He does not appear to be upset by the wait, however.</p><p><strong>[[/check skill=inv dc=12]] check.</strong> What at first appears to be a porcelain mask is actually simply his face, becoming a ghost has transformed his visage into a ghostly death mask.</p><p><strong>[[/check skill=rel dc=16]] check.</strong> Since most ghosts are trapped on the material plane due to unfinished business, it is very likely that Perrius is suffering the same plight, though what tethers him to to this world might only be guessed at without more information.</p></article></section><h2 class=\"border\">Questions and Apparitions</h2><p>Perrius has faulty, half-remembered information about the estate and the events that took place within it, but he is happy to gossip and chat about the family and the manor.</p><p>While the below questions cover a variety of information the players might ask, Perrius can provide them with details of any of the Corvinarus' family or Usk— just keep in mind that his information is twenty years out of date, and his understanding flawed. If the party asks any question you would rather they not learn the answer to, it is perfectly acceptable to have him trail off without answering, lose focus, and act as if they didn't ask anything at all.</p><p>The ghost has the following insights:</p><h4>Who are you?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Why, I am… um…</p></blockquote><p>The man hesitates for a moment</p><blockquote><p>..Hm. Lord… Baron? No… Sir. Count? Marquis! Count!……count?</p></blockquote><p>A faint sound of alarm creeps into his echoing, haunted voice, and he looks for a moment as though he might be about to panic. Suddenly, his eyes drift away to a center point on the distant wall before him, and he seems to lose focus abruptly, and the tension seeps out of him.</p><blockquote><p>Terribly sorry— I must confess my mind wandered there a moment, you were saying…?</p></blockquote></section><p>Repeating the question causes this exact event to repeat, word for word and action for action. Perrius will have no memory of repeating himself.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The ghost is Count Perrius Annmatar, a noble on Ylana Corvinarus' side of the family, and a well-respected diplomat. He vanished after setting out to visit family far away from his home city, and was presumed lost on the roads while traveling. This information can be found via magic, or by researching nobles who disappeared about 20 years ago in the region (a successful [[/check skill=his dc=18]] or [[/check skill=inv dc=18]] check with relevant research resources on hand can accomplish this). His name can also be found by searching the @UUID[JournalEntry.GfWgVX7GYShBa9bG.JournalEntryPage.L8EjhZ0KKa46WBs3]{R02. Foyer}.</p><h4>What brought you here?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Well, these remembrance parties are quite common, but this one is special!</p></blockquote><p>The ghost insists,</p><blockquote><p>Lady Ylana was truly a treasure, and I would not pass up on a chance to celebrate her life, short as it was.</p></blockquote><p>He emits a sigh, briefly distracting himself by toying with the handle of his cane.</p><blockquote><p>What good is family if it's never there for you?</p></blockquote></section><h4>Who was Lady Ylana?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>He shifts position somewhat uncomfortably, hesitating</p><blockquote><p>I'm not sure how to tell you this— terribly sad that you weren't informed. She was the lady of the manor— poor Darius was quite distraught after her illness.</p></blockquote><p>The ghost shakes his head sadly, before adding:</p><blockquote><p>She was truly a remarkable woman, and her passing left the world a worse place.</p></blockquote></section><h4>How do you know Ylana?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>She was my cousin and one of my closest friends.</p></blockquote><p>The ghost offers wistfully, and the faint glow he emits seems to brighten and remembrance seems to make his form sharpen and strengthen.</p><blockquote><p>She was most dear to me— truly. We grew up together and when apart we wrote constantly.</p></blockquote></section><h4>…Darius?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>The ghost tilts his head, leaning slightly forward as though to inspect the party more closely.</p><blockquote><p>…the…lord of Raventree Estate? …Lord Darius Corvinarus?…I'm sorry, who did you say you were, again? How did you come to be invited?</p></blockquote><p>He looks deeply perplexed. Yet, his eyes drift away, and they lose his attention, he settles back into his seat, comfortably. Almost absently, he speaks over any response to his questions, as if he has forgotten that he asked them in the first place.</p><blockquote><p>Poor Darius. Good man. I never heard even one foul thing about him from Ylana. Kind to his children and the staff, generous with pay— made Ylana unbelievably happy.</p></blockquote><p>He frowns slightly, a comically distorted expression on the death mask of his visage,</p><blockquote><p>I wish they'd had more time together— that I'd gotten to know him better.</p></blockquote></section><h4>How did Ylana die?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>The ghost's countenance falls, his good cheer dampened, and for these few moments the glow that he emits darkens, and he seems somehow less solid. The edges of his form less sharp.</p><blockquote><p>She fell ill. Horribly ill.</p></blockquote><p>A deep and tragic shake of his head.</p><blockquote><p>No alchemy, or magic, or herb seemed to help— they tried everything. Darius tried everything, poor soul…he spent a veritable fortune trying to save her—but for all that magic and money, death comes for us all in the end, doesn't it?</p></blockquote><p>He seems lost in the melancholy of the moment, falling silent before finally exhaling a profoundly sad sigh.</p><blockquote><p>…poor man, he hasn't been the same since. Like when she left, she took a part of him.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What are you waiting for?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>The ghostly figure brightens with exuberance, any evidence that something might have been perplexing him vanishing.</p><blockquote><p>Well, I've only just arrived! I've been waiting to be admitted to the party proper.</p></blockquote><p>He hesitates briefly, and a contemplative expression crosses his strange features, as though he is uncertain just how long he's been waiting in the parlor. He waves a dismissive hand in the air, as though to banish the thought, before adding:</p><blockquote><p>I'm sure that dear Usk or another servant will be along shortly to announce me properly.</p></blockquote></section><h4>…Usk?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>The Butler. Didn't he show you in?</p></blockquote></section><h4>Where are you from?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Oh, from… quite far away. Over the hills… and... past the sea. Ten leagues through the mountains.</p></blockquote><p>He waves a hand toward the nearby window.</p><blockquote><p>You know, far out that way. I spent quite a while on the road to be here!</p></blockquote></section><p><strong>Note</strong>: Perrius Annmatar is from a court at least 20 days of travel from the estate, in a neighboring region. If the party writes or chooses to detour to speak to his family, they are all nobles who fondly remember him, though they have regrettably moved on without him. Polite and as helpful as they are, they are too far removed from the manor and the events surrounding it to lend any insight or aid. The pursuit of Perrius' family is not within the scope of this adventure, so GMs are encouraged to do what they will with his history, close family, and backstory.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Releasing Perrius</h3><p>Perrius' unfinished business is quite simple: He is waiting to be let in to his beloved cousin's mourning celebration. If the party wishes to let him know peace and move on, the owner of the manor would need to throw a party and make a grand show of inviting Perrius in for introductions.</p><p>As soon as he is introduced to the party the ghost would feel great relief, realize that he'd been waiting ages for that and that he could finally rest. Before fading away he would offer a deeply sincere thanks.</p><p><strong>Cruel Dismissal. </strong>Killing Perrius in battle before he can escape, using destroy undead or similar powers obliterates the ghost. While effective, it is cruel and denies the spirit his final rest.</p>"

              "text": "<p>The Raventree Estate is in a frightful state, having suffered severe damage, then mass looting and vandalism followed by years of abandonment and neglect. The worst harm it's received has been at the hands of the elements, with rain, wind, and sun eroding most of the old building's integrity.</p><p>The following entries in this journal cover the typical sights, sounds, smells, and other characteristics of the ruined estate, and how to get the most out of it from a roleplay and narrative standpoint. This journal can also serve as a reference point for specific mechanics at play for parties in this area.</p><p class=\"important\">Refer to this section regularly when the party is in the Ruined Estate.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Interior</h2><p>Hints of the manor's former glory are obvious throughout, but none of them have escaped the years without being ruined. The wallpaper is peeling and stained, and the floorboards are thick with splinters.</p><p>There is little to motivate an explorer, here. Anything of value was taken from the house by fleeing servants on the night of the splintering, and the few foolish looters that visited in subsequent years found little of interest- if they made it back at all.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Lighting</h3><p>The manor has not been inhabited for many years, and there is no artificial lighting within its halls. During the day, rooms with windows are dimly lit by what sunlight filters in, but the rest of the manor is completely dark unless otherwise specified.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Smells</h3><p>As nature slowly reclaims the manor, the smell of damp and decay permeates the aging wooden furnishings. When disturbed, thick layers of dust will fill the air and the senses, and spots of mold or fungus might elicit a more visceral reaction.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Sounds</h3><p>The manor is severely damaged, and in many places the floors have entirely collapsed. Even at rest, the faint creaking of failing supports can be heard throughout the house. Wind whistles in through open windows and down long, narrow hallways.</p><p>However, one sound that is almost entirely missing is that of natural wildlife. Not even scavenging insects have moved into the manor, and birds and bats fear to roost in its eaves.</p><section class=\"box-text audio\"><div class=\"audio-icon\"><p></p></div><aside class=\"audio-details\"><h4>Ambience of the Manor</h4><p>There are a number of playlists filled with ambience, music, and sound effects. As the players explore the Ruined Manor depending on time and weather conditions you can use: @UUID[Playlist.KFwSyB8o3EK0bbya]{A House Abandoned (Day)}, @UUID[Playlist.XkpcwytF9M62jS06]{A House Abandoned (Night)}, @UUID[Playlist.KoT1QMXlJQ8oA246]{A House Abandoned (Storm)} as well as playlists for specific areas which will be linked in their location's journal page.</p></aside></section><h2 class=\"border\">Building Fear</h2><p>While the events that caused Raventree Manor to fall to this state are mostly unknown to the party, there are hints which can be found throughout the ruin which can lead to speculation. While the party explores, the GM should make use of a few tricks to help amplify feelings of uncertainty and discomfort.</p><p>It is important that players get a sense that <strong>something very wrong happened here</strong>. Here are some tricks you can use to help deliver that feeling:</p><h3 class=\"border\">Don't “Over-Explain”</h3><p>Letting your players imaginations run will lead them to worry about things this adventure may not even contain. Saying very little about what the party finds can be far more effective at inciting them to feel a little healthy fear than describing every detail. Don't suggest reasons for why something is the way the party found it— instead, leave room for the party to speculate. Portion your information out, giving ambiguous explanations and descriptions which become more precise as the party begins to pay more attention to clues and danger. This is a delicate balance to walk— to inspire a little fear in your players, less detail brings greater impact, but you don't want to leave your players with nothing at all to work with.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Emphasize Absence</h3><p>What makes the ruined manor scary isn't necessarily what it contains, so much as what it doesn't. There are simple cues that might cause the players to get a sense of warning and danger. You can (and should) draw attention to a few key things which may not be declared in the room descriptions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lack of Wildlife</strong>. While the party might find old nests or examples of wildlife passing through, there are no animals living in the manor. Animals long ago learned to give the estate a wide berth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abandoned Equipment.</strong> In the years that followed the manor's destruction, numerous adventurers and looters passing through swept it clean of anything of much value. Those who were quick managed to make it out, but anyone who tried to spend the night didn't survive.</p></li><li><p><strong>No blood, no violence.</strong> While the manor is in a state of destruction, almost no evidence of violent altercation or gruesome dismemberment is left behind. No blood, viscera, or body parts have been left behind— even where there is abandoned equipment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Broken and Dusty Mirrors.</strong> The @UUID[.gZcmW4fALCF3iwkH]{Shard Stalker} travels through mirrors, leaving nearly no evidence of its passage. Some adventurers in the past have clued into this and broken mirrors to prevent its passage, others have unwittingly wiped the dust and grime away from a mirror for one reason or another. Periodically mentioning a broken mirror or working a dusty mirror into your descriptions as players explore will help allude to this encounter. A number of room descriptions explicitly include this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uncomfortable Quiet.</strong> Though the manor is rich with the sounds of wind blowing through the ruin or the quiet creak of the house settling, it contains very little in the way of its own ambient noises during the day.</p></li></ul><h3 class=\"border\">Repetition and Realization</h3><p>Take the time to drop hints across multiple rooms— perhaps not several rooms in succession, but reusing a cue every third or fourth room can help players draw conclusions in a way that will be discomforting. For example, in the second room players explore you might use words like \"quiet\" or \"solemn\" to convey the lack of ambient sounds, only to mention it again in the eighth room with a little more emphasis. By the third time you mention it—each time increasing in emphasis—players will likely start to pick up the clue.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Ransacking the Ruins</h2><p>Two decades of the manor sitting open to anyone brave or foolish enough to pick over the ruins has left the manor devoid of any true valuables to be claimed. However, not everything has been taken, and especially dogged looters can still find items that might be of interest, if not necessarily worth any money.</p><p>The party can attempt to search any cabinet, container, desk, wardrobe, or chest they find. This eats up 10 minutes of their time and requires a [[/check skill=inv dc=14]] check. On success, select or randomly roll for an item found on the @UUID[RollTable.11Wt48JsGl9x2ZkY]{Items in Ruin} table:</p><p>@Embed[RollTable.11Wt48JsGl9x2ZkY classes=\"caption-top\"]{Items in Ruin}</p><p>If the party wishes to search the same room repeatedly, increase the Investigation check DC by +2 each attempt.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Finite Finds</h3><p>It is up to you to decide if you want the list of items to be inexhaustible, or for them to eventually run out. If you'd prefer that the item list eventually run dry, toggle \"Draw with replacement?\" in the Roll Table off. This will make each item appear only once until the roll table is reset.</p>"

When the party (or a single character) enters a room that fits the criteria for a Housebound encounter, roll [[/gmr 1d20 # Housebound Ambush Chance]], on a roll of <strong>5 or less</strong> a Housebound is present and watching, waiting for their chance to attack. </p><p>In general one or two housebound are no real danger to the average starting party, but the number of housebound skulking the halls can increase rapidly if not properly managed. The fact they can appear in any room that is dimly lit or dark makes them a constant ambush threat at all hours of the day.</p><p><strong>Clearing the house:</strong> Once the party has destroyed or defeated at least triple their number in Housebound they will notice no more of the skulking monsters appear in the dark halls.</p><h4>Scuttling Dangers</h4><p>Housebound are capable of moving through any of the walls, floors, and objects found in the ruined manor. They can scuttle up walls and slip through cracks, which the manor has countless numbers of. This allows them to be anywhere in the manor, and enter any space, even those with locked doors and barred passages.</p></div><figure class=\"portrait\"><img src=\"modules/house-divided/assets/creatures/portraits/housebound.webp\" /></figure></div><h4>Hidden in Plain Sight</h4><p>Housebound lurk on surfaces of walls, ceilings and floors, invisible to the naked eye. The only requirement for this is that the surface be in dim light or darkness at the time of entering. Even if that surface is exposed to light afterward they remain hidden. This makes them highly effective ambushers who can quite literally come out of the walls to attack the party.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Mechanics &amp; Tactics</h2><p>Housebound will not enter areas where other creatures are roaming, such as the @UUID[JournalEntry.GfWgVX7GYShBa9bG.JournalEntryPage.2qZpP9nUAg1sCZqv], @UUID[JournalEntry.GfWgVX7GYShBa9bG.JournalEntryPage.1dClw8TQYJAPuvGi], @UUID[JournalEntry.GfWgVX7GYShBa9bG.JournalEntryPage.JmPjF9bwmjqgjvIP], or @UUID[JournalEntry.GfWgVX7GYShBa9bG.JournalEntryPage.WdWkhlKZVKrE7qs5], unless these locations have been cleared of any encounters first. The housebound actively avoid trespassing in the @UUID[JournalEntry.yTBQvct1IyEyLKvg], as the @UUID[Actor.A60ns8tMmTdrXI6U] poses enough of a threat that they do not wish to invade its territory.</p><h4>Skulking Skirmishers</h4><p>Housebound prefer to use hit-and-run tactics rather than engaging in pitched battles. Their favorite tactic is to follow potential victims from room to room until someone is close enough to strike, or is isolated from everyone else. When a potential target presents itself they then lunge out of whatever surface they are hiding on, rush out, surprise attack the easiest targets, then retreat back into darkness.</p><p>Housebound aren't especially intelligent beyond this ambusher style of attack and a basic sense of self preservation. They don't tend to be coordinated or tactical, but they will retreat when reduced to below half their maximum hit points. When they do this they will try to find somewhere they can hide for a day to recuperate.</p><div class=\"columns flexrow\"><div><h4>Biding Their Time</h4><p>If they never get their chance to strike, Housebound wait until sundown when they can freely move throughout the house. If the Housebound are aware of living intruders, they begin quietly prowling the manor, looking for them. Otherwise, if the @UUID[.UABNLlUeQ63FhlnD]{Event: Wight Patrol} is active, they will just linger around the wights in the hopes of finding something interesting.</p><p>All Housebound will find refuge in dark places at sunrise and become dormant for [[/gmr 1d12 # Housebound Dormant]] hours.</p></div></div><section class=\"box-text macro\"><div class=\"macro-icon\"><p></p></div><aside class=\"macro-details\"><h4>Swap Appearance</h4><p>This creature has an alternate appearance that can be swapped between by selecting it's token and using the @UUID[Macro.6ay8EaH7NRkH3yTu]{Toggle Appearance} macro.</p></aside></section>"

With their ability to see in the dark better than most, they are able to strike from the shadows, killing enemies before they even get spotted.</p><h4>Dangerous Intelligence</h4><p>More important than their physical might though, is their cunning. Wights will not mindlessly attack their enemies, but instead coordinate using gruff, choked commands passed between each other and enraged howls across larger distances. With their background as former guards, these wights are highly adept at using terrain and cover, luring enemies into traps, and will attempt to separate out weak enemies for quick kills.</p><p>Wights can and will coordinate with @UUID[.C9oG9vTReMN48i1t]{Housebound}, gathering them to join their malevolent patrols through the manor.</p><h4>Undead Conscription</h4><p>While normal wights command zombies, the Manor Wights have the unique power to raise the victims of their @UUID[Actor.aaEXnW2WjmAh4yDt.Item.NX8cqG6aZMns8wvY]{Life Drain} attack as new housebound. This is especially troublesome as it also means that the Manor Wights have the ability to command the housebound, and absolutely have the intelligence necessary to use them effectively.</p><h4>They Are Learning</h4><p>Wights will generally retreat if their destruction is imminent, hiding anywhere they can until they can escape back to their greenhouse to recuperate.</p><p>The more times the party fights the Wights, the more clever they will become, as they begin to learn about the intruders and how to counter them.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Undead Patrols</h3><p>At sundown on the <strong>first night</strong> that the party occupies the ruined manor two Wights emerge from the ruined cottage and patrol as detailed below.

Once they encounter the party they unleash a horrible wail and attack. This wail alerts and attracts all the other roaming wights who begin walking toward the room where the wail happened.</p><p>These patrolling wights will fight to the death, and flee back to the greenhouse just before sunrise.

With its 10' move speed, avoiding it isn't particularly difficult. Containing it within the manor is much more difficult, as every room in the house has at least one place with a one-inch gap that the jelly can squeeze through.</p><h4>What's Yellow, Sticky, And Heavy Enough To Crush You?</h4><p>The Voluminous Ochre Jelly likes to get the drop on unsuspecting targets, literally.

It is recommended to also check out the @UUID[Playlist.PhWWmZdSyJFA1nRv]{Shard Stalker Sound Board} for additional effects you can use to haunt your players.</p></aside></section><p>Though the GM is counselled not to use the Shard Stalker to engage the players in direct combat early, there are a number of ways the Shard Stalker can be used to instill sufficient fear in your party.</p><h4>Scare Tactics</h4><p>The Shard Stalker uses its powers to create paranoia in its victims. It does this by peering through mirrors using its @UUID[Actor.A60ns8tMmTdrXI6U.Item.oxqm05Yp2apaZJmg]{Unreal Eyes} feature, which causes it to appear in the mirror’s reflection. It can decide how it appears while doing this, and usually wears the face of a stranger, or one of the party itself. It will also use stealth and its mirror stepping ability to move around the house so it can watch them directly through holes in the floors, gaps in the walls, and from open doors leading into shadowy rooms. It tries not to be seen initially, but after a while it begins to let its future victims see glimpses, causing them to become alerted and unnerved. If the party doesn’t seem affected by its scare tactics it instead reverts to being invisible instead of wasting time trying to play mind games.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li>A pair of eyes peering through a hole in the ceiling overhead. As soon as you make eye contact they pull away from the hole.</li><li>An eye gazing through a gap in the walls. As soon as you make eye contact it’s gone.</li><li>A glance at a mirror shows a humanoid dressed in strange finery standing behind you. When you look back there is nobody.</li><li>Glancing at a mirror your reflection briefly appears to be standing stock still and grinning at you, upon second glance it’s fine.</li><li>A voice whispers a secret that only you would know through a hole in the wall. Attempting to find the source proves fruitless.</li><li>You hear someone in your party call your name. When asked, they did not call you.</li><li>You see one of your party reflected in a mirror standing behind you. When you turn to confront them they are gone.</li><li>You hear a sound nearby and look up. You see yourself staring back at you. You blink and they are gone.</li></ul><h4>Impersonation</h4><p>To better understand its prey, the Shard Stalker will make use of its @UUID[Actor.A60ns8tMmTdrXI6U.Item.395qQQDNH8YJg1c8]{Arcane Facsimile} and @UUID[Actor.A60ns8tMmTdrXI6U.Item.YIoB9xCKEcrrPRt9]{Psychic Mirror} abilities to impersonate player characters. If a party member wanders away from the rest of the group or for some reason becomes separated while the Shard Stalker is hunting them, it provides an opportunity to give your players a proper scare.</p><p>Whichever player character is separated from the group, give them a few moments, and then inform them via private communication (such as the /whisper command, or another direct message option) that they return to the party sooner than expected, but that they are a little quieter than normal-- reserved, and reluctant to communicate. Ask the player to pick a different party member who their character suddenly finds <strong>extremely interesting</strong>, worthy of study. Tell the player they have difficulty taking their eyes off of this other party member, that they want to examine everything that character does. Further, if applicable, make it clear that the player doesn't remember why they returned so soon.</p><p>Once you have done so, narrate the return of the character, describing them as seeming distracted or lost in thought.</p><p>What has happened here is that the Shard Stalker has formed an Arcane Facsimile of the character, and is using the duplicate to more closely study the party. If the party doesn't realise, ask anyone communicating with the party member consumed by them for [[/check skill=ins dc=14]] check to identify that the image of the character is not actually the character (increase this DC by 2 for every day the Shard Stalker has had a chance to observe the party). Alternatively, if enough time has passed--inform the player that they return to find a second version of themselves standing with the party.</p><p>The Shard Stalker's duplicate of the party member will rush to accuse the party member of being a fake, and will attack without hesitation, initiating combat. The actual Shard Stalker will observe from somewhere nearby, but will not directly engage the party itself, if they spot it or try to attack it, it will slip away at the nearest mirror.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Special Mechanics</h2><section class=\"box-text macro\"><div class=\"macro-icon\"><p></p></div><aside class=\"macro-details\"><h4>Shardstalker Automation</h4><p>Three macros are included for making it easier to run the Shard Stalker. The @UUID[Macro.s7d0wCYO9Af4HESa]{Shatter Form} macro will handle cloning the Shard Stalker and setting its necessary attributes while the @UUID[Macro.aDxy7bzpgQgqzY9E]{Arcane Facsimile} will clone the targeted token and @UUID[Macro.LA1NMxqwES2Reb94]{Arcane Facsimile - Revert Form} will revert its form.</p></aside></section><section class=\"box-text macro\"><div class=\"macro-icon\"><p></p></div><aside class=\"macro-details\"><h4>Swap Appearance</h4><p>This creature has an alternate appearance that can be swapped between by selecting it's token and using the @UUID[Macro.6ay8EaH7NRkH3yTu]{Toggle Appearance} macro.</p></aside></section><h4>Diversionary Tactics</h4><p>When faced with multiple opponents the Shard Stalker prefers to split up its prey, forcing them to give chase and get turned around and separated in the environment (which it knows like the back of its hand). The more confusion it can incite in its prey the better. If it has had a chance to watch the party (or a single PC) for at least a day (or 24 hours over time) it can use @UUID[Actor.A60ns8tMmTdrXI6U.Item.395qQQDNH8YJg1c8]{Arcane Facsimile} to make itself look and sound exactly like a member of the party to manipulate them.</p><h4>Overwhelming Presence.</h4><p>The Shard Stalker avoids direct confrontation with groups by itself, and instead uses its @UUID[Actor.A60ns8tMmTdrXI6U.Item.Xjsk5HcZLSY2oJYu]{Shatter Form} power to create clones of itself to fight with the party. Since it has the ability to control its clones, they are perfectly coordinated and not susceptible to being confused, routed, or distracted unless the Shard Stalker is directly targeted.</p><h4>Your Own Worst Enemy</h4><p>Using @UUID[Actor.A60ns8tMmTdrXI6U.Item.395qQQDNH8YJg1c8]{Arcane Facsimile}, the Shard Stalker can force the party to face itself in battle by using @UUID[Actor.A60ns8tMmTdrXI6U.Item.Xjsk5HcZLSY2oJYu]{Shatter Form} to create copies with the same ability scores, skills, and equipment. Coupled with the tactic of splitting the party up, this can be used to sow greater confusion and paranoia into the group.</p><h4>Tactical Retreat</h4><p>When the Shard Stalker is at or below half of its maximum hit points, or losing control of the battlefield it attempts to flee, sacrificing clones as necessary to accomplish this. If it’s being pursued it uses its mirror jumping powers to avoid the party until they give up the search. It won’t engage the party again until it has had a chance to recuperate, and instead uses this time to watch them.</p><h4>You Are Being Watched</h4><p>Starting fairly early into the adventure the party will become aware of the sensation of being watched. Keen eyed adventurers will notice eyes gazing through peep holes and gaps in walls. Calling out to this observer is pointless, and attempts to find them entirely fail.</p><p>In a manner of thinking, this encounter begins immediately when the party first enters the ruined manor, but does not result in combat until the Shard Stalker is ready to begin hunting. The Shard Stalker uses this time to learn how to defeat them quickly and easily. This in turn gives the party numerous chances to realize they are being watched or to suspect they aren’t wholly alone in the house.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Additional Details</h2><h4>What are you?</h4><p>Right above the dining hall are bedrooms and above that are rooms for the staff. When the incident occurred waves of unstable arcane energy ripped upward through staff preparing bedrooms, resting, or otherwise unaware of the events unfolding. These staff members were all instantly eradicated, but their collective psychic and spiritual energy was twisted into a magical kaleidoscope of thoughts and abilities capable of changing form at will. </p><p>It is a tortured creature, filled with the shattered minds of multiple people. Each time it kills an interloper the memories and feelings it psychically skimmed from them get added to the pile of disparate thoughts, and with each new pile of tattered psyche it collects it feels a little more whole. But it’s a brief high which never lasts long enough and quickly fades back into a hunger for more.</p><h4>No Simple Doppelganger</h4><p>The Shard Stalker appears to be a doppelganger in many ways, but it is substantially different, and in many ways much worse. It does not want power, or to assimilate itself into the world, it wants to destroy the living. The creature has lived in the ruined manor for the last 20 years, as much as it can at least, traveling in and out of the mirrors of the manor. It is curious of the interlopers, if only because it believes killing them will help make them more complete, instead of an amalgamation of a dozen shattered minds and souls.</p><h3 class=\"border\">A Mirror's Edge</h3><p>Enterprising parties may realize the stalker moves through mirrors, and decide to begin smashing them. This is a very wise move, as it will deprive the Stalker of places for it to exit the mirrors. However it can still peer out of any shard of glass large enough, allowing it to eavesdrop on the party even when they think they are safe.</p><h4>No Escape</h4><p>If all the mirrors are broken the Shard Stalker will become highly aggressive, realizing it has no opportunity to evade and toy with its prey. It instead will lean more heavily on its illusions to disrupt and mislead the party while setting up for hit-and-run encounters to weaken them.</p><h4>Mirror Dimension</h4><p>Though it would take some coordination and a small amount of luck, if the party is able to catch the Shard Stalker while it's in a mirror and without any other mirrors to escape from, they can smash the final mirror, leaving the stalker no way to escape.</p><p>Trapping them in this way effectively defeats the shard stalker in regards to any quests and milestones related to it. However, that does not by any measure mean that the shard stalker is dead. A cunning gamemaster will instead bide their time, knowing that the next time a mirror enters the manor the shard stalker can reappear to begin claiming victims.</p><h4>Clearing the Ruined Manor</h4><p>If the party is undertaking @UUID[JournalEntry.x9xlmkKYSp1PEYAf.JournalEntryPage.OGC18Svpu60HT8zQ]{Quest: The Descendant} on behalf of Byscilla, defeating the Shard Stalker and reporting back to her about your progress earns moderate approval:</p><p>%APPROVAL%byscilla,2%</p>"

This is a relatively short and simple quest that will quickly lead into the main plot line.</p><p>The goal of this quest is to walk the exterior grounds of the estate, then investigate the interior of the manor for damage, valuables, and signs of danger. How the party tackles this is entirely up to them, and nothing especially noteworthy will happen until they set foot inside of the structure itself.</p><p>Once inside of the manor two things will become very clear:</p><h4>The manor is in incredibly bad shape.</h4><p>The Raventree manor will need extensive work to repair to a livable state. If the party is working for Byscilla (or another interested party), this is something they can report back to her. If the party is working toward their own interests, they will get a sense of how much work and money it will require, which will easily be in the thousands of gold range.</p><h4>Something horrible happened to the manor.</h4><p>Among the decay and collapse are signs of internal damage that get worse as one travels toward the back of the mansion, strange remnants of life like lingering shadows, odd noises beyond the settling of the manor, and an inescapable sensation of being watched.</p><p>During this exploration the party may also encounter a shadow apparition trying to communicate with them, which begins @UUID[.G2dcOT2iiMxELIpy] or they may encounter the ghost of Perrius Annmatar during @UUID[.kKYMyI2x6JqH5qHG]{Event: Insights From Beyond}, both of which shed <em>some</em> light on the condition of the manor.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Reporting Back</h2><p>Once the party reports back to Byscilla about what they found, she consults with them on how to proceed.

Uncle Kryn, Vivesna, and her son Vaxillus were all unbearably mean and cruel. Not just to me, but everyone around them.

Or that you would like to see her.</p></blockquote><p>Byscilla pushes the topic aside:</p><blockquote><p>I… will need to think about that, if I settle on something I’ll tell the party so.</p></blockquote></section><p>Ultimately Byscilla is resistant to the idea of going to the Feywild, and will never agree to go personally. This is doubly true if Elscieth is still Sylvaria.</p><h4>What about Elscieth?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I’m not sure I know what I feel in this moment. Does she even remember me or want to see me? She must have started a new life by now. If you want to ask her, please do. I would like to have her back, though we might be strangers at this point.</p></blockquote></section><p>If Elscieth's humanity has been restored, Byscilla may be convinced to write a letter to her mother, filling the gaps and wishing her well. This will begin a string of letter back and forth between Byscilla and Elscieht, either delivered by Fey messengers or the party itself.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Available Solutions</h2><p>Once the Gamemaster feels that the party has explored enough of the manor to understand the two facts above, or once the party triggers @UUID[JournalEntry.x9xlmkKYSp1PEYAf.JournalEntryPage.tfp0I9VUbtICy5xY]{Event: Desperate Escape} and is transported away from the Ruined Manor, they can report back.</p><p>This is concluded when the party finally returns to Byscilla and reports their findings.</p>"

There are a lot of rumors, most of them outlandish.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Where is the estate?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>The Raventree Estate, or what remains of it, would only be about half a day's ride away if the roads weren't so overgrown. Orvinder and I considered visiting it, but our guards became uncomfortable about the difficulty of getting the horses through the brush and the potential for ambush.</p></blockquote><p>She frowns slightly, the inability to see the place for herself is clearly distasteful, and there's something of the impression that she probably would have just gone on her own if no one had stopped her.</p><blockquote><p>You’ll have to go on foot, as we learned—which means it's more like half a day's walk…but at least it’s a pretty quiet forest and the old cobbles are hard to lose, even if they are grown in.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Why aren’t you exploring it yourself?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Orvinder pipes up, dryly:</p><blockquote><p>I threatened to put her in stocks.</p></blockquote><p>Byscilla chuckles, gently shaking her head:</p><blockquote><p>I might be terrifically headstrong …</p></blockquote><p>Her husband interrupts with a show of covering a laugh with a cough, but she continues as if she hadn't heard.</p><blockquote><p>… but I recognize that I’m not an adventurer, and our guards can only offer us so much protection. It would do little good for us to traipse through the ruins, fumbling and uncertain what we might be getting into, when there are actual professionals. Ones who know what they are doing and who are capable of standing up to any dangers that we might not anticipate.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What do we do with items we find?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>We’ll pay you for any valuables you bring out, especially if they are items related to the Corvinarus or Annmatar families. I have connections with historians, I’m sure relics from two decades ago would be interesting.</p></blockquote></section><h4>How are you related to the estate owners?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Well, the place belonged to my grandparents, and it was the last place my mother was seen before she vanished— along with my uncle and grandfather. Technically, the estate is mine unless an older descendant of the family asserts claim over it.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Why are you interested in the estate?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I recently received land papers from another family member. The papers establish the parcel of land and states the last owner was my grandfather. Importantly, he declared absolute primogeniture as the inheritance plan for the property. That means I own it unless my uncle or mother is still alive somewhere in the world.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What do you plan to do with it?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Orvinder and I are going to rebuild it and start investing in the local land to bolster trade routes and industry. The Corvinarus-Annmatar family alliance was one primarily of trade, and it's time someone reclaimed holdings here to breathe some new life into local trade.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Has the family business been doing badly?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Not terribly, no, but things did take a pretty sharp decline over the last two decades, especially since most of the Corvinarus line died out. Since then, the Annmatar side of the family has been doing most of the heavy lifting.</p></blockquote></section><p>Byscilla and Orvinder are polite, honest, and forthcoming with details. They acknowledge that they don’t know a lot about the situation, and that they don’t believe a lot of the rumors.

Master Bedroom} and the other in the Shadeward @UUID[JournalEntry.Rp3ajAv2u5p3YZkq.JournalEntryPage.R6379dUbiGeOxA1X]{S21. Master Bedroom}. There are investigation boxes for both circles in those rooms which detail the skill checks necessary to uncover them.</p><p>Alternatively, player characters will be told about these circles if they have agreed to assist Sylvaria or Kryn in their respective endgame quests mentioned above.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong>: The party is able to begin studying the circles.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Studying the Circles</h2><p>In order to restore the primary circle in the Ruined Manor, the party will need to study the fragments that remain in the Manor's planar variations. The locations of these circles are documented immediately above.</p><p>Studying the circle and copying down all of its features takes <strong>4 hours of work by a creature proficient in Arcana.</strong> This work can be divided up among multiple people, but there is only enough room for four people to crowd around the magic circle's markings. All characters working on transcribing the circle's design must have a writing implement and a book or spell book to work in.</p><p>Depending on the situation, the people working on the circle might not be welcome or allowed in space containing the circle (be it the Feyward or Shadeward estate), and as such run the risk of being discovered based on guard and staff patrols or manor schedules of other house occupants.</p><p>If discovered, the NPCs will react accordingly to intruders being where they shouldn't be. This usually involves a medium-to-large approval loss and physical ejection from the bedroom and lord's chambers, followed by heightened scrutiny of their actions for a time afterward.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong>: Once the party has sufficiently studied both the Feyward circle and the Shadeward circle fragments, they are ready to begin repairing the primary circle in the Ruined manor.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Repairing the Circles</h2><p>Restoring the circle of magic in the ruined manor to working order requires a character proficient in Arcana to first have the following:</p><ol><li><p>A studied copy of all the missing pieces of the circle (see @UUID[.ohNULn0egCTMgjYz#studying-the-circles]{Studying the Circles}).</p></li><li><p>Sufficient materials necessary to repair the circles, which will require gathering and then creating the repair materials.</p></li><li><p>Restoring the power that became unfettered at the breaking of the circle.</p></li></ol><h3 class=\"border\">Identifying the Ritual Materials</h3><p>The party must determine the nature of the materials used in the creation of the magic circles by studying any of the existing circle fragments.</p><p>This requires an alchemist's kit and <strong>4 hours of work by someone proficient in the toolkit and also proficient with Arcana</strong> or being helped by someone proficient in Arcana. Once the analysis is complete they will have concluded that the medium used to inscribe the circles is a ritually-prepared compound of bone, ash, chalk and iron, first powdered and then made into a paste to serve as a paint for the circle.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Preparing the Ritual Materials</h3><p>The ritual paint requires the following key ingredients:</p><ul><li><p>Several pounds of bone (it doesn’t matter from what),</p></li><li><p>Twice as much freshly cut live wood as the amount of bone used</p></li><li><p>A block of incense</p></li><li><p>Iron dust (at least one pound)</p></li><li><p>Chalk powder (at least one pound)</p></li></ul><p>The ritual requires combining the bone, freshly cut wood, and incense and burning them together until they have been reduced to ash. The ash is then gathered and combined with the chalk and iron dust.</p><p>All of the ingredients can be gathered in or around the estate @UUID[JournalEntry.7dfwxAL8ID3a4OoY]. Tress can be cut down, bones can be exhumed (or extracted from fallen enemies, if the party feels particularly gruesome), and iron dust can be found in the wake of the rust monsters in the greenhouse and the kitchen, or by feeding them fresh metal.</p><p>The whole process takes 8 hours from start to finish but does not require any special skills. However, the party can reduce this work time by 4 hours if they have the following proficiencies in the party: Alchemist's Supplies, Nature, Survival, and Athletics.</p><p>If the party has some of these but not all four, they can reduce the time by 2 hours instead.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Repairing the Circle</h3><p>With the design of the circle extracted from its fragments, and the ritual materials in hand, it takes <strong>8 hours of work by someone proficient in Arcana</strong> to restore the circle in the Ruined Manor. This work can be divided up among multiple proficient people, but there is only enough room for four people around the magic circle before things get too crowded to work.</p><p>While work is happening the party will have the ability to set the circle's <strong>command word</strong>, granting them exclusive use of the circle unless they share that word with others.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong>: The circle is repaired but remains inert unless <strong>Repowering the Circles</strong> has been completed.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Repowering the Circles</h2><p class=\"important\">Completion of this quest earns the party a @UUID[JournalEntry.D1QzSUnec7ZApnDF.JournalEntryPage.mhIzp2kUkLiWEKB8#milestone-advancement]{Milestone Point}.</p><p class=\"important\">This portion of the quest can be completed unknowingly if the party has already defeated the Arcane Wraiths, Colossal Spider, and Shard Stalker.</p><p>To regain its function, the circle must be repowered.

While they have no idea how to recreate this effect, they do know that the power should be flowing from this plane into the circle to repower it.</p><p>However, that is not happening.</p><p>A successful [[/check skill=arc dc=16]] check leads one to believe that the energy is going elsewhere. The Arcane Wraiths are a likely first place that energy would be going. It is a logical conclusion that if the energy is being diverted to the Arcane Wraiths, there may be other magically-charged creatures in the estate which are being pumped full of magical energy instead of having it go to the circle.</p><p>The level of power in the circle can be determined easily by anyone proficient in Arcane. If none of the required encounters have been defeated, the circle contains only the barest trace of its power source.

Anyone found rifling through his private collection will quickly earn his distaste and be encouraged to leave his presence immediately— If this occurs and the party isn't apologetic, the group receives a Medium Approval loss.</p><p>Vostolas keeps most of the contracts signed by his clients within these tomes and shelves, dispersed in ways that make it nearly impossible for others to identify which is which.</p><p>These special books contain pages which may look like a normal page to the average observer, but dragging a finger vertically across the page causes the text to 'scroll', allowing a contract to be browsed without it occupying the space a normal scroll might. Vostolas stores the contract books based on a categorization of what the client received in exchange for their soul or a piece thereof. For example, a book of contracts wherein the client received wealth might be stored among a collection of books about historical finance.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Let's Make A Deal</h2><p>Vostolas' uses his office to conduct business.

They can be opened with the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1nhIxh0DsJsntCfj]{Knock} spell, though it will alert Vostolas immediately.</p><p>The Reliquary has been subtly enchanted by Vostolas, allowing him to overhear anything said within the room, and each display case is warded to trigger a sort of 'silent alarm' alerting Vostolas of any attempt to steal from the collection. If Vostolas becomes aware of an attempted burglary, he will immediately and invisibly make his way into the room, only becoming visible once he is already standing over the shoulder of the thief or thieves responsible.</p><p>It is important for GMs to understand that attempted theft <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">does not</span></strong></span> anger nor offend Vostolas.</p><p>Though he will interrupt the attempt, the encounter should be very amicable and friendly, to dissuade the party from escalating to violence having been caught in the act. Vostolas views an attempted theft as an opportunity to get a contract signed— if the character wants something enough to try to steal it, surely they'd be willing to part with some metaphysical portion of themselves to get it instead.

The only exception would be the spellbook and scrolls which would be of immediate interest to any caster as they hold various 4th to 8th level wizard spells.</p><ul><li><p><strong>North-West Case.</strong> A tattered old map sits under the glass here, and appears to be covered with crisscrossing lines. It appears to be historical trade routes with notes. Perhaps a keepsake of an older age?</p></li><li><p><strong>South-West Case</strong>. An old wooden carved pipe sits on a pale red velvet pillow. A plaque below it reads \"The smoking pipe of writer Ernest R. W. Faulk.\" A once famous writer of fantasy and folklore, now long deceased.</p></li><li><p><strong>North-East Case.</strong> A large black spellbook and a row of eight scrolls make up this case. There are no labels or plaques, so the contents of this care remain entirely unknown beyond what is visually obvious.</p></li><li><p><strong>South-East Case.</strong> A red journal sits above a broad case containing a red feather quill, a purple feather quill, a quill of gold fashioned like a rose, and a heavy stone stamp seal. An attached plaque indicates these were the writing implements of various authors, and one's private journal.</p></li></ul><h4>Staggered Bookcase</h4><p>This staggered case's shelves are laden with rare and insightful books on the topics of magic and the planes. There is nothing immediately useful contained within the cases, though all of them could be useful for long-term projects, or sold to scholars and collectors.</p></article></section><h3 class=\"border\">Infernal Exposition</h3><p>The central case contains various items that amuse Vostolas and are related to his centuries of making deals for souls, either for his own ends, or for his infernal masters.</p><section class=\"box-text investigation\"><header><h4>Central Display</h4></header><article><p>Vostolas can be asked about the items here, and will explain a bit about their purpose or history. These are noted in the \"Vostolas\" lines under the visual descriptions of the items. No skill checks are associated with these items, as they are on display and meant to be looked at.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Skull &amp; Contract.</strong> A badly bloodied contract and a human skull with a red handprint on its crown. What little of the contract that is legible under the skull and blood indicates the penalties for failure to uphold the contract, one bloodied line reading \"…shall result in swift and immediate extraction of…\" One need only look at the skull and guess how it ended.</p><p><em><strong>Vostolas:</strong> \"Ah, yes, an example of what happens if one refuses to uphold their end of a contract. Swift and immediate extraction, as promised, so executed.\"</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Horn &amp; Scroll</strong>. A loosely rolled length of vellum sits neatly tucked into a silver-gray ram horn, or a horn that looks quite a bit like one. Without opening the paper, it's impossible to glean greater context.</p><p><em><strong>Vostolas:</strong> \"Once a friend said to me 'I would give my right horn for…' well, what doesn't matter, but it turns out he was right, he would give his right horn for it. Easiest deal I ever cut.\"</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Three Keys</strong>. These golden keys each tend with a small golden heart in a cage. They are all similar in design but have slightly different details.</p><p><em><strong>Vostolas:</strong> \"Ah yes, keys to the hearts of mortals. I used to have more, but every now and then someone comes crying they were wrong and that they'd give up everything for the chance to love again. Well, what can you do then?\"</em></p></li><li><p>Single Contract. An old contract detailing an artist's desires for beauty, love, happiness, fame, and adoration from her peers for the rest of her life. The lower section of the contract indicates that the contract holder decided what happened upon contract end.</p><p><em><strong>Vostolas:</strong> \"One of my older contracts, this one was messy, and I didn't have full say on the contract details, so it didn't resolve as cleanly as I'd have liked… I'm still dealing with some of the fallout of it.\"</em></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This is Lyranth's contract. It is completed, and no longer holds power over her, but has left her in her current state. Even if destroyed it won't undo the changes made to her.</p></li><li><p><strong>Double Contract.</strong> A pair of nearly identical contracts, only the top one being truly readable. The name at the top is unfamiliar, and the contract trades a thousand years in service to hell in exchange for magical power, knowledge, and good health. The trick however, is that the contract offers the soul of a sibling as collateral.</p><p><em><strong>Vostolas:</strong> \"I found this one particularly interesting. It's not mine, actually, I'm holding it for someone as a favor. Someone offered their soul and the soul of their sibling for magical power and near immortality for the both of them. Apparently the second sibling was freshly dead at the time, and had no say. Quite fun, that.\"</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Decorated Skull</strong>. This large skull has been carved with rather complex runes that appear to maybe be dwarven, or a very crude variant of it. It covers the whole of the skull and is marked with a pentagram on the crown.</p><p><em><strong>Vostolas:</strong> \"Sometimes you don't have parchment to work on. This contractual skull was made in a cold mountain many years ago, and it's a good example of why you must be flexible to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.\"</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Burned Contracts</strong>. A pair of burned contracts, one far worse off than the other. What is legible about the contracts indicates they would be given money, wealth and power in exchange for their souls. The names are not familiar.</p><p><em><strong>Vostolas:</strong> \"Some get clever and try to burn their contracts, not realizing that the paper is merely a formal record of an agreement and the terms. The actual deal is sworn and sealed by magic between me and the oath taker. I can always reproduce the contracts if lost.\"</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Two Eyes</strong>. A pair of humanoid eyes, they look freshly plucked.</p><p><em><strong>Vostolas:</strong> \"Punishment for welching on a debt. People always forget that contracts are binding and breaking them, whether I see it or not can have… penalties.\"</em></p></li></ul></article></section>"

While Lyranth does have capacity to create some initial statues with her @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsterfeatures.wkIN7WTeX8ebbjtv]{Petrifying Gaze} (and regularly does), she is still an excellent sculptor in her own right. Statues which have been created from living creatures are often perfected through use of her sculptors tools— smoothing out perceived imperfections and making the already life-like statues a more perfect form of themselves. Choose your phrasing carefully when speaking as Lyranth, she will avoid giving the party the impression that all of her statues are created by her petrification.</p><p>Lyranth's attitude toward the party on initial meeting can drastically swing depending on a few key factors:</p><h4>If Lyranth Is The First NPC The Party Meets (with or without Usk)</h4><p>If the party is encountering Lyranth for the first time she will seem excited and exuberant. She is thrilled to meet new people who seem to be able to wander the house with impunity.</p><h4>If Usk Is Introducing The Party</h4><p>Lyranth enjoys tormenting Usk by making him feel uncomfortable— she will incessantly flirt with him, comment on his appearance or physique, or otherwise compliment him. This is not done out of cruelty, she does genuinely like Usk but enjoys teasing him whether he likes it or not-</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Lyranth exclaims with a measure of surprise,</p><blockquote><p>Oh! Look what fine models you have brought me, charming boy! I can always trust you to choose good specimens. When do you plan to pose for me? I simply must capture that jawline.</p></blockquote></section><h4>If Players Have Already Accrued Approval with Vivesna</h4><p>Lyranth considers anyone gaining favor with the lady of the house to be a competitor and threat to her standing and will make efforts to sabotage that standing. She will make snide and biting remarks and find ways to embarrass the party, especially if Vivesna is present. Consider some suitable catty barbs and subtle, backhanded compliments to use on your players if this is the case.</p><h4>If A Party Member Is Described As Particularly Beautiful</h4><p>Lyranth will appear to be keenly interested in them, moving into their personal space in a not-quite uncomfortable way, she will touch parts of them— a cheek, a chin, a bicep—and pay them what will sound like a compliment, such as: \"My, you are absolutely <em><strong>gorgeous</strong></em>.\"</p><p>Though this should be painted as a compliment- it is absolutely not. Lyranth's bitter loathing of empty beauty means that for her, telling someone how beautiful they are is akin to a grave insult. If Vivesna is present during this meeting, you may wish to provide players the opportunity to catch Vivesna looking amused.</p><h4>If Someone Reacts Negatively To Lyranth's Appearance</h4><p>While it won't put Lyranth into an immediately hostile state, any party member reacting to her appearance with outward fear, disgust, or otherwise negative attitude will cause a dramatic shift in Lyranth's mood.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Like a sudden change in weather, Lyranth's face abruptly contorts into a sneer, her head darts forward with the slightest rightward tilt of her chin, and her eyes flicker dangerously.</p><blockquote><p>I see that look on your face- that revulsion, that fear, that disgust. how <strong>dare</strong> you judge <strong>me</strong>? You're just like all the rest.</p></blockquote></section><p>If the offending individual offers an apology:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Lyranth's jaw tightens, her lips purse. Her eyes dart away, as if seeking some other object to fix upon. A deep, slow, deliberate breath passes. The storm of her emotions seems to calm. Before Lyranth speaks again, her expression swiftly softens and her exuberance seems to return. She accepts the apology and cheerily informs you that:</p><blockquote><p>\"...it is water under the bridge.

However dark events transpired, and I ended up here.</p></blockquote></section><h4>The Lost Crescent</h4><p>If the party don't ask based on Usk's questions, Usk will suggest that the party might be able to assist him in reclaiming his scythe.

Either Usk directs the party to Vaxillus' location as part of @UUID[.gSE3RY8CkL0dCswQ]{Quest: A Shadow of Hospitality}, or the party may stumble upon him at one of the following locations:</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.2hdVeUnyNT1PHuFD.JournalEntryPage.A8DIMMvVbFUi5C3F]{S09: Trophy Room}, where he is tightening the spring of a crossbow while seated on the couch, acompanied by one of his @UUID[Actor.RPXEkB8NdH3jBPiK]{hounds}.</p></li><li><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.2hdVeUnyNT1PHuFD.JournalEntryPage.cCuvFSSd8yVROhxS]{S13.

Dance Hall Balcony}, where he can be found racously shouting things like \"Don't move- DON'T MOVE!….damn, it moved\" or \"HAH, GOT THAT ONE RIGHT IN THE ASS\" while repeatedly firing and reloading a crossbow at the spectral dancers below.</p></li></ul><p>Regardless of who they might be, Vaxillus cannot be convinced that anyone in the party, or even the party as a whole, is a threat to him. He will treat them as if they're his underlings or servants, will regularly turn his back on them, and leave the room mid-conversation if he feels like it.</p><p>When the party first meet Vaxillus he views them as a curiosity— strangers don't come to the manor very often—, but this doesn't prevent him from attempting to bully the newcomers. Before engaging in conversation, the gamemaster should familiarize themselves very closely with Vaxillus' @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.Gw3iiZla1BZ1sqdv#traits]{Traits}, specifically Antagonistic and Misanthropic. As Vaxillus is a complex social antagonist, it is important for a GM to understand <em><strong>why</strong></em> he appears to be so needlessly cruel to others.</p><h3 class=\"border\">The Initial Meeting</h3><p>Wherever the party meets him, the initial encounter should be one of thinly veiled hostility as Vaxillus attempts to assert dominance.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>As he becomes aware of you, the young elven man straightens somewhat from his otherwise lazy slouch, drawing his shoulders more square and tilting his chin slightly to the left. His eyes narrow slightly in scrutiny. His tone almost makes every word feel like a challenge.</p><blockquote><p>Mother didn't mention we were getting new servants. What are you all doing milling about here? Shouldn't you be working?</p></blockquote></section><p>What follows should be a somewhat bullying discussion. He'll question the party about why they are in the house, what they want, and their motivations.</p><h4>If The Party, or a Masculine Party Member, Expresses They Want To Work for Vaxillus</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>A positively serpentine smile appears on Vaxillus' face.</p><blockquote><p>It has been a while since I've had some lackies- tell me, how do you feel about hunting?</p></blockquote><p>The gleam in his eye doesn't <strong>quite</strong> suggest that they might be the prey.</p></section><p>This begins @UUID[.lRG0gOguAZCbKZzZ]{Quest: That Bastard Son}.</p><h4>If A Feminine Party Member Expresses They Want To Work For Vaxillus</h4><p>Believing that it will incite an aggressive response and reveal the party's true colors, Vaxillus will put on a display of misogyny. He'll make a show of scrutinizing the person's body in a way that is wholly inappropriate, perhaps even ordering them to turn around so he can see them from behind, and will suggest they see Usk for a maid's uniform.</p><p>The best outcome of this from his point of view would be the target of his bullying, or another party member, attacking him, in which case he will attempt to avoid the attack and mock them for being so quick to anger.</p><p>It is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">very</span></strong></span> important that the GM understands that Vaxillus is not actually a misogynist—he is an <em>antagonist</em>. He will say <strong>anything </strong>if he thinks it will get an inflammatory reaction. This is detailed more thoroughly in his biography: @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.Gw3iiZla1BZ1sqdv]{Vaxillus, The Insufferable Bastard}</p><p><strong>If A Party Member Joins Vaxillus in Mocking Another Member of the Party</strong></p><p>Vaxillus greatly enjoys watching groups of cohesive friends tear each other apart socially. If a party member is critical or hostile in mocking another member of the party, he will make every effort to encourage it, saying whatever he thinks will cause the discord to grow. Joining Vaxillus in mocking a party member earns a small approval gain.</p><p><strong>If The Party Challenges Vaxillus or Become Aggressive</strong></p><p>Vaxillus will openly laugh if challenged- these people can't be serious, they're in <strong>his</strong> house. They're hardly a threat. He will mock them aggressively, and either encourage them to get out of his sight or he will leave the room expressing his boredom. Feel free to include a very patronizing pat on the shoulder to the largest and most imposing party member.</p><p><strong>If The Party Fights Vaxillus During This Event</strong></p><p>Should the party engage Vaxillus in combat, he will focus on dodging, evading, and disengaging with enemies to prevent being hit, all while mocking and goading the party further.</p><p>If the party manages to hit him and deal damage however, he immediately retreats, seeking out his mother to report their actions. This results in a confrontation with @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.CHPlHOdAOkk9F3l4]{Vivesna} and Vaxillus where the party is portrayed as being barbaric, short tempered and destructive. The end result is a medium approval loss with Vivesna, and a dressing down for causing disruption in the house.</p><p>%APPROVAL%vivesna,-4%</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Vivesna regards the party coldly from behind her ornate mask, daggers audible in her clipped tone.</p><blockquote><p>It is because of my beloved son's assurances than this bit of violence sprang from a misunderstanding that I am not having you thrown out into the shadow lands to fend for yourselves.</p></blockquote><p>Vaxillus watches on smugly from his mother's side, nodding along in agreement with her words.</p><p>Vivesna continues:</p><blockquote><p>However, if you lay so much as another finger on Vaxillus there will be no second chances, only darkness and whatever nightmares it holds for you. Do not cause me to regret my act of mercy in this moment.</p></blockquote><p>With that, Vivesna takes her leave. As soon as she is out of hearing range Vaxillus grins and says</p><blockquote><p>I did this for your own good. You need to understand your place in this house, <strong>my</strong> house.</p></blockquote></section><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the party later attempts to ambush or attack Vaxillus after this first meeting event, he will consider it a proper threat on his life. In that case see @UUID[.oCson72GlvABJwQK]{Event: Turning On Vaxillus} for tactics and abilities.</p><h4>If Introduced By Vivesna</h4><p>If the party has earned approval of 5 or more with Vivesna and they have not yet met Vaxillus, she will insist on doing so personally. She introduces them as new guests who have proven helpful around the house, and even comments that they might prove useful in dealing with some of the tasks assigned to @UUID[.lRG0gOguAZCbKZzZ]{Vaxillus}.</p><p>%APPROVAL%vaxillus,1%</p><h4>If Introduced by Vostolas</h4><p>Vostolas' introduction is both flattering, and helpful, making Vaxillus less immediately hostile toward the party.

While he can be stumbled upon in a few locations based on his schedule, there are a lot of reasons that @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.DgKfcMseZCzmxqg8]{Usk} suggests the players make a name for themselves before meeting the manor's Lord.</p><p>Kryn does not like being disturbed, especially by strangers he feels to be unworthy of his attention.</p><p>During their initial meeting, Kryn should be portrayed as barely interested in the party's existence, and unless the party has done something to suitably get his attention (for better or worse) he will likely try to cut the meeting short to get back to the singular purpose he has been pursuing for years: reclaiming his birthright and leaving the shadow realm behind.</p><h3 class=\"border\">The Initial Meeting</h3><p>There are a few ways the party can be summoned to an audience with the Lord of the House— but if they are summoned, the first meeting takes place in the Manor's dining hall. Upon arrival, regardless of who they are with, Kryn will be in position near the northern fireplace. It is worth noting that at no point will Kryn introduce himself by name or title— after all, why should he? Everyone should know who he is, he is their lord, and holds absolute power over them.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>At the far end of the otherwise silent dining hall, a quiet fire crackles. Beside it, an imposing figure in regal garb stares into the fire, presenting his back to the party, a wine glass in his hand. Lost in thought, he doesn't seem to register their presence.</p><p>As the party and their escort advances to the northern end of the room, he half-turns to face them, offering a weary sigh.</p><blockquote><p>What is it?</p></blockquote></section><p>After this point, it will be up to the NPC escorting the party to provide an introduction—Kryn has agreed to this audience, but unless he specifically called for the party to be summoned, likely views it more as a formality than something worthy of interest.</p><h4>If The Party Has Earned Approval 5+ With Vivesna</h4><p>Kryn will be much more amenable if the party has been an aid to Vivesna. Once they have reached an approval rating of 5 or more, Kryn has heard enough about them to at least consider them as potential tools to further his goals. If the party's approval rating with Kryn is less than 3 before Vivesna introduces them, set his Approval of the party to 3.</p><h4>If The Party Has A Negative Approval With Vaxillus</h4><p>Kryn absolutely hates his stepson. If the party have been a thorn in @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.Gw3iiZla1BZ1sqdv]{Vaxillus}' side, he will view that as a mark in their favor. If the party has antagonized Vaxillus into a negative approval rating, Kryn starts this meeting with a minimum of 1 approval for the party.</p><blockquote><p>I hear you've been causing no end of trouble for young Vaxillus.</p></blockquote><p>The man's impassive facade fails to mask a light glint of delight in his eye at the prospect.</p><blockquote><p>A bit of a gamble— betting that frustrating him would endear you to me.</p></blockquote><h4>If Introduced by Vivesna</h4><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.CHPlHOdAOkk9F3l4]{Vivesna} is the only member of the household who isn't dismissed shortly after the party is introduced, and she will remain present during their discussion. Due to the approval rating required for Vivesna to arrange for this introduction in the first place, she will likely try to help the party by guiding Kryn to hear them out—and specifically to consider them useful to furthering his goals.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>The lady of the house sweeps ahead of the party, gown quietly swishing along the carpet and stone. Before she reaches the end of the table, Kryn turns to face her and takes a single customary step to close the distance, taking her hand. He kisses it in greeting, and she places the same hand on his arm as she falls into place beside him.</p><blockquote><p>I have brought them to see you, lord husband.</p></blockquote><p>Her smile is thin,</p><blockquote><p>I should hope they are more useful than appearances might suggest.</p></blockquote><p>The lord's intense gaze settles on the group.</p><blockquote><p>Appearances can be deceiving.</p></blockquote><p>Vivesna offers, helpfully.</p></section><h4>If Introduced By Usk</h4><p>While Usk is a valuable servant to Kryn, there are conversations that Kryn does not want the butler privy to. After Usk introduces the party, he will be politely dismissed and told to see that they are not disturbed. Kryn will trust that the butler would not bring strangers before him unless they had already proved to be useful to others, so he will hear the party out.</p><h4>If Introduced by Vostolas</h4><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.5zgB2b6vG4z8aM1a]{Vostolas} introducing the party raises questions for Kryn, who values the incubus librarian as an ally, but knows better than to take anything a devil offers at face value. Though Vostolas will have no effect on Kryn's Approval, the fact that the archivist brings them to him is enough for Kryn to believe they might be useful in furthering his goals.</p><h4>If Introduced by Vaxillus</h4><p>Kryn's dislike of @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.Gw3iiZla1BZ1sqdv]{Vaxillus} will not win the party any approval. If Vaxillus and not Vivesna, for some reason, is conducting this introduction the party should know they are going to be going into a tense situation. If they are unaware, Usk will take the time to inform them before they go to the meeting.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>A clatter as the dining hall doors are hurled open, and Vaxillus bellows</p><blockquote><p>We have come, your lordship! May I present—</p></blockquote><p>— a booming voice interrupts from beside the fireplace as Kryn turns,</p><blockquote><p>You may not!</p></blockquote><p>barely contained rage visible for only a few brief moments before he regains his composure. His volume lowers, but his tone remains imperious:</p><blockquote><p>Leave us, and close the doors on your way out, they can present themselves.</p></blockquote><p>Turning his back to Kryn, Vaxillus doesn't even try to hide a grin, or the look of glee on his eyes. As he passes, he delivers a patronizing shoulder-pat to one of the party.</p><blockquote><p>I'm sure it'll go splendidly. 'Ta-ta!.</p></blockquote><p>he offers quietly before leaving, dragging the doors closed in a way that makes them creak infuriatingly.</p><p>The party is left to introduce themselves in the awkward silence that follows.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">What Can You Do For Me?</h2><p>Based on the respect (or infamy) they have gained, Kryn views the party as a means to an end. He has specific goals and will do nearly anything to achieve them, including using hapless adventurers. As a result of this meeting, one of a few quests may be offered to test the party's capabilities before he reveals the truth of his long term plan.</p><p>Kryn observes the crackling logs within the fireplace more than he does the party, as though the fire contains some answers that he is trying to unlock.</p><blockquote><p>I am given to the pursuit of a single purpose for which I hope you will prove to be valuable.</p></blockquote><p>He condescends to them, punctuating his statements with a periodic pause to swallow wine from his glass or gently swish it around as though in thought.</p><blockquote><p>While I am Lord of this place, able to bend it and all within to my will, it is only a shadow of its true self, isolated.</p></blockquote><p>He pauses to appreciate his own wordplay.</p><blockquote><p>I wish to reclaim my birthright—to return to society as true Lord of Raventree Manor—and I think you can be useful in achieving that end. If I am to succeed, there are some impediments which must be removed. Show me that we can work together, and you will be richly rewarded when I claim what is rightfully mine.</p></blockquote><p>This begins the @UUID[.HgVUo77b5AE1IwZa]{Quest: Kryn's Ambition}, which contains some further details if the party wishes to pursue discussion of inheritance and the plan to claim the manor.</p><h3 class=\"border\">About Vaxillus</h3><p>Unlike Vaxillus, Kryn doesn't need to be concerned about someone overhearing his assassination plans. Vaxillus is not a threat to him, but he is the kind of annoyance that Kryn would like removed—provided the party can do so without suspicion being placed on Kryn as having suborned it. Kryn will not offer this quest if Vivesna is present during their conversation. If Vaxillus is the one to introduce the party, he offers it almost immediately after Vaxillus leaves the room.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I have something of a pest problem which I think you might be able to handle.</p></blockquote><p>The Lord of the Manor begins, his tone impassive, as though talking about the weather.</p><blockquote><p>By that, I mean that my loving wife has a bastard that has made himself a nuisance. Take him out of play in a way that doesn't implicate me, and I'll know that I can trust your discretion and capabilities.</p></blockquote></section><p>If they accept, the players begin @UUID[.ogTkXNCVctvmUp2t]{Quest: Trimming the Will}.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Primogeniture</h3><p>If Vivesna is present, if the party rejects killing Vaxillus, or if for some reason Kryn doesn't believe the party will be amenable to the mercenary assassination of his stepson, he will instead request the party remove his sister from her claim to inheritance—by taking her life.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I aim to claim my birthright and declare myself as Lord of Raventree Estate, but I know in my heart that my my sister will wrongfully dispute that she has precedence as first-born.</p></blockquote><p>Kryn's upper lip curls slightly as he speaks, in vehemence.</p><blockquote><p>My Father's will should have respected the law of primogeniture, as his first <strong>son</strong>, I am his <strong>heir</strong>— she has no right to claim authority over me. If I am to succeed, she must die. As she is out of my reach, you must.</p></blockquote></section><p>This begins @UUID[.L1YXWE3eswx8YDDp]{Quest: Sororicide}.</p>"

            "The Shadowfell": {
              "name": "The Shadowfell",
              "text": "<p>The Shadowfell is a vast, dead, colorless wasteland where very little lives. Its most common inhabitants are malevolent undead entities and wandering creatures made of shadow that possess boundless hunger, especially for the living.</p><p>This plane serves as a dark reflection of the material plane, and keen-eyed travelers in it will recognize landmarks, though many of them appear decayed, weathered, or twisted in unsettling ways.</p><p>There is no sky in this plane, no sun or moon either, just an endless black void stretching as far as the eye can see. As a result there is no day or night, no sense of time.</p><p>Beyond the manor there is only darkness so deep that not even those with dark vision can see beyond the reach of their arms. Traveling beyond the Shadeward manor is a risky proposition for even the most well prepared party, and is not recommended under any circumstances.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Realm Properties</h2><p>The Manor in Shadow has some particular traits which are universal and change the way certain aspects of reality function. These traits apply to the party from the moment they arrive, and remain with them until they leave. In some cases certain effects may linger, these are noted below.</p><p><strong>Fading Light</strong>: All light sources, magical or otherwise, have their bright and dim ranges reduced by half. For example, a lantern that would normally produce 30 feet of bright light and 30 feet of dim light instead only produces 15 feet of both.</p><p><strong>Deepest Shadow</strong>: Spells and abilities that create darkness or manipulate shadows have their effectiveness enhanced. These spells are treated as being cast one level higher than the spell slot used. Spells that do not have extra casting levels are not affected.</p><p><strong>Lingering Darkness</strong>: Spending time in the Shadow manor has lingering effects on the appearance of those within. After completing a long rest in the Shadowfell every character gains a level of Darkness up to 10.</p><p>The higher a character's Darkness value, the more their physical appearance changes. At first this affects only the character's equipment, armor and clothing, manifesting as a loss of color and reflectiveness.</p><p>As darkness increases this spreads to the character themselves, causing them to take on an increasingly unhealthy pallor, as though deathly ill. At the highest levels their shadows stop matching their movement.</p><p>Completing a long rest outside of the Shadowfell removes 5 levels of accrued Darkness.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Navigating the Shadeward Manor</h2><p>Once the party has either completed @UUID[.zdq5Q3JuOatSJcWq] or ignored Usk and set out on their own, they are free to roam the Manor. However, the Shadeward manor is not without its own @UUID[.ZEhcShHDf0r50xAe], and a careless party could easily find they have gotten themselves in trouble. If the party is escorted by Usk or another resident of the house, they will be treated by the staff, guards, or other residents with some curiosity and speculation—but will not be interrupted in their passing (except perhaps by @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.Gw3iiZla1BZ1sqdv]).</p><h3 class=\"border\">No Way Out</h3><p>Kryn, Vivesna, Vaxillus, and Usk cannot leave the Shadeward manor grounds under any circumstances. Attempts to forcibly remove them by someone else only results in the involved parties dragging themselves back into the manor grounds in an endless loop.</p><p>Other NPCs in this estate can leave the grounds if they choose, but entering the Shadowfell properly is incredibly dangerous and not something they would ever willingly do.</p><p>Spells that would allow a creature to move to another plane, or open gateways for them to move through instantly fail when used by the above list of NPCs. Characters attempting to understand why can make a [[/check skill=arc dc=18]] check to determine that the estate itself is preventing specific people from leaving through powerful outside influence.</p><p>In addition to this, Tymnas is magically bound to the Shadowfell and cannot escape back to the Feywild without outside intervention first to break the binding.</p><h2 class=\"border\">The Shadow Servants</h2><p>When the manor was shattered in three, most of the servants were killed or fled. The butler, @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.DgKfcMseZCzmxqg8]{Usk}, was one of the few to survive relatively intact- but he himself was split across worlds, in a fate mirroring that of the house he tends to. The rest of the manor's staff were not so lucky.</p><p>When it came into being, the Shadeward manor was populated with shadowy servants that cleaned and maintained the structure. Whether or not they are the souls of the dead servants, or simply echoes of deceased, is unclear. Some are troubled by faint memories of what might have been a past life, but others have no real individuality to speak of, and tend to their tasks with silent loyalty.</p><p>Vivesna periodically sends her servants through planar portals, to fetch supplies or unwitting test subjects. Not all return, but she sees them as disposable and is able to replace those that are lost or destroyed.</p><p>Some of the more powerful servants have begun to push back in small and subtle ways against their treatment- but their position remains fragile. The heroes have an opportunity to suppress this would-be rebellion before it can begin, with @UUID[.3KyagCw1Wuw83itW]{Quest: The Shiftless Dead}.</p><h2 class=\"border\">The Seneschal Forgotten</h2><p>There was a time when one more individual walked the halls of the Shadeward Manor. For the first two years after their imprisonment, Usk was given aid in managing household affairs by a seneschal. For those who know where to look, evidence remains of the seneschal's former presence, but curiously, no one speaks of her. The role of seneschal has been curiously vacant, and the devil Vostolas found her quarters vacant but in good enough repair to claim them for himself.</p><p>When the manor was sundered into its separate pieces, one of the guests who had been present in the dining hall was dragged forcibly into the realm as much as Kryn and Vivesna. Thaeda Redstone, a noblewoman and famed artist who had produced many artworks for a variety of rich noble houses, including both the Corvinarus and Annmatar families, became seneschal to Vivesna. Make no mistake— this was not a willing agreement, poor Thaeda simply had no other option. She did her best to help keep the house running, and filled her hours in quiet friendship with Usk. Vivesna made frequent demands upon her artistic talents, and most of the paintings in the Shadeward Manor are the product of her work.</p><h3 class=\"box-text border\">What Became of Thaeda Redstone</h3><p>Thaeda and Vivesna never quite saw eye to eye, but the artist was not the sort to be able to stand up to a demanding and frankly dangerous employer. As time went on the weight of her servitude and the perpetual darkness of the Shadowfell settled upon Thaeda, and she began to withdraw. Morose, she would spend hours and sometimes days in her chambers, refusing to eat or meet with others until even Usk's nervous but well-meaning visits were turned away.</p><p>In her melancholy, Thaeda had been chronicling all that she could remember of what her life had previously been— visits with differing families, memories of artworks she had created, her thoughts and wishes to return to that life. It was there she had made a fatal mistake. Thaeda put to paper the events that occurred on the day of Ylana's Remembrance.</p><p>No one knows how, exactly, Vivesna came to know of the diary— or that this account of the events of the dining hall was written. Perhaps she had spies watching the poor artist, or perhaps she had simply searched the woman's room while she was walking the grounds or bathing. Regardless, people know that Thaeda returned to find Vivesna reading her diary and knew immediately that she was in grave danger. Stumblingly, she tried to pass the diary off as innocent scrawlings, a day-log to help her keep the house running.

Many believed she had just retreated once more into her room, giving into despondency once more—but when she neither responded nor emerged after several days they entered to find her room empty, her bed unslept in.</p><p>Of the matter, all Vivesna had to say was: \"Oh dear. Poor thing. I suppose she fled into Shadow.\"</p><p>And most, save for Usk, found little reason to remember her.

Out here, without walls or roofs to hide the empty void above, it's impossible to ignore that- wherever this place actually is- it isn't home.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Smells</h3><p>Many of the plants that grow in the gardens and greenhouse are the same flowers that Vivesna is so fond of, and their smell fills those parts of the manor grounds as readily as it fills the manor.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Sounds</h3><p>The Shadowfell is mostly empty- but not entirely. Although no wind stirs the branches of the grey-leafed trees, and no birds roost in their boughs, the endless night is sometimes disturbed by the distant and stomach-churning cry of some alien creature. The shadow creatures that call this place home are fast, elusive, and hungry.</p><section class=\"box-text audio\"><div class=\"audio-icon\"><p></p></div><aside class=\"audio-details\"><h4>Exploring the Grounds</h4><p>Play @UUID[Playlist.DcpJEHkI11SaAyC3]{A Garden to Die For} for a dark exploratory ambience.</p></aside></section><p></p><h2 class=\"border\">Inside the Manor</h2><p>The Shadeward manor offers a glimpse into the past glory of Raventree Manor.

He will actively attempt to charm the party, will go out of his way to seem like he is supporting them, and will otherwise be a welcoming and helpful character.</p><p>What the party probably won't know is that everything Vostolas does is in service to the goal of getting them to sign contracts and deals with him. Everything has a price, and Vostolas takes nothing off the table when it comes to negotiating for a piece of someone's soul.</p><p>It is important that GMs portray Vostolas as unashamed of his devilish nature— he does not make any attempt to hide the fact he is an incubus or mask the details of the deals he makes. He is charming enough to negotiate, and will attempt to make particular members of the party feel bad for judging him if they are harsh about his being a devil. If it is obvious that it makes the party uncomfortable to be around the incubus as he appears, he might tuck his wings about himself as a cape and mask his features—losing the horns, glowing eyes, and red skin, looking very much more human.</p><h4>If Introduced by Usk</h4><p>If Usk is the one to introduce the party to Vostolas, he will escort them to @UUID[JournalEntry.2hdVeUnyNT1PHuFD.JournalEntryPage.kYmcdFaNn2UTsY9S]{S05.

The demon? Devil? Creature, surely, seems more interested in your presence than threatened by it. He examines the party head to foot from his seated position, a quizzical brow raised.

While Usk is hopeful that the party will aid him, he is smart enough to hold some knowledge in reserve, and may be reluctant to share deep details of the Shadeward Manor's political situation with strangers who have just arrived.</p><p>The party's first meeting with Usk in the Shadeward Manor can occur in one of two ways which determine which piece of introductory text to use.</p><h3 class=\"border\">Arriving In The Parlor</h3><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Usk dusts himself off and straightens his clothing, smoothing out the wrinkles and rubbing at a small scuff on his forehead- the result of his own tumble. Looking slightly embarrassed, he offers:</p><blockquote><p>I didn’t expect the tear to send you directly to me, but it’s probably best that it did. I am Usk, head butler of the Raventree Estate, valet to the lord of the manor, and the person who was trying to get you here to begin with. I cannot possibly thank you enough for listening to me. I am in rather desperate need of your help.</p></blockquote></section><h3 class=\"border\">Arriving Elsewhere</h3><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Usk arrives slightly out of breath but otherwise composed. He takes a spare moment to sweep his eyes over the party, as though taking count that a certain number have arrived. His smile has a mildly nervous quality. When he begins speaking, he seems to act as though he has not met the party before:</p><blockquote><p>Ah, I'm glad you all seem to have arrived in one piece. Sorry that I've arrived late. I am Usk, head butler of the Raventree Estate, valet to the lord of the manor, and the person who was trying to get you here to begin with.</p></blockquote></section><h3 class=\"border\">Questions and Answers</h3><p>Usk is eager to trade some of his knowledge in exchange for guiding the party in a cause that will ultimately aid his goal of reuniting his shattered selves. As the party speaks with him, use the questions and answers below to help form the dialogue.</p><p>If the party is not interested in listening to Usk, they can attempt to carve their own path through the shadow manor, but will find that without the insight that Usk provides they are lacking key information to smooth their way. They can return to Usk at any time for more information, he is willing to wait, especially since his options are limited.</p><h4>What help do you need?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I need to escape this place. I can feel it tearing my mind and soul in two. It has been for… years, I think? I admit I have no idea how long I’ve been here. We have no sun or moon, no way to tell one day from the next. Regardless, I need out before I am entirely undone and I believe that Lord Kryn might have a way to do so. In short, you need to earn his trust so that he might share his thoughts and plans. If they are viable, you can help him, and we can all escape. Or… that is my hope.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What happened to the manor?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I can’t say for certain what happened, as I wasn’t present- but, there was some sort of explosion in the dining hall. I heard… screaming and the whole house shook like it was going to collapse then I felt a pain unlike anything I’ve experienced before, collapsed and awoke here.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What is this place?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>This is Raventree Estate, the home of the Corvinarus family, but…it is as though it has been swallowed by the night. I can't pretend to understand it, but it is timeless- without moon or sun. Living shadows and restless spirits walk the halls, most strangely cordial, and many of the rooms are not quite as I remember. Lord Kryn's tastes are reflected here, quite unlike his father, who I once served. </p></blockquote></section><h4>Who is Lord Kryn?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Lord Kryn Corvinarus is the second child of Darius and Ylana Corvinarus, and the master of this estate. He is a spellcaster of great ability, keen of mind, and sharp witted. He rules this estate with his wife, the Lady Vivesna, an equally talented wizard and formidable woman in her own right. If you meet them, you must be cautious and curteous, they are not the sort you would want to have as enemies.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Have others come through before?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>They… have, yes. Sometimes by accident, sometimes intentionally… sometimes quite against their will. Not many of them manage to leave, however. It is dangerously easy to earn the ire of the Lord and Lady, and that often ends very poorly for the involved parties. So I am hoping to guide you more directly, to avoid any… unfortunate outcomes.</p></blockquote></section><h4>How does the party leave the Shadeward Manor?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Easier said than done, I’m afraid. There are several ways out of this plane, you’ll want to speak to Vastolas the Librarian or Tymnas the Groundskeeper, they both surely know ways out of this plane. However, none of the residents of the manor can use them. We are permanently trapped here.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What do you know about (a person)?</h4><p>Consult @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.uJ8F15Har6MVMj6a#opinions]{Usk's Opinions}.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Available Solutions</h2><p><strong>Hear Usk out.</strong> Once Usk has explained the situation and answered any questions the party has this quest is considered complete and automatically begins @UUID[.gSE3RY8CkL0dCswQ].</p><p>%APPROVAL%usk,1%</p>"

Unfortunately, this requires the cooperation of the manor's lord, and Lord Kryn is not someone that should be approached carelessly. If Usk's plan has any hope of succeeding, the party will have to make a name for themselves and gain the support of some of the Manor's more influential residents.</p><p>Usk will offer to introduce the party to either Tymnas, Lyranth, or Vivesna and will escort them if that offer is accepted. He will also, reluctantly, suggest the party speak to Vaxillus- but will recommend the party introduce themselves, as Vaxillus and Usk have a combative relationship.</p><h4>What needs to be done?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>You’ll need to earn favor with people in the manor, then once you’ve gotten into their good graces I can arrange for you to meet with the Lord of the manor with the proper backing and clout necessary to prove you’ll be a valuable asset to him. I could arrange a meeting straight away, but he would have no idea who you are, and we would have no usefulness to sway him with.</p><p>That said, the people you need to speak to are the Groundskeeper Tymnas, Lady Vivesna, and Lyranth the Sculptor. You… I suppose, if you wanted… could also speak with master Vaxillus, Lady Vivesna’s son. He holds some sway over his mother, but… perhaps one should only speak to him in desperation.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Why help Kryn?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I admit that I find him loathsome in comparison to the old lord of the manor, but one cannot be too picky about their escape routes when they are in short supply. Perhaps in pursuit of this plan we will find alternatives! I cannot know for certain, so this remains my best chance for now.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What’s in it for us?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Beyond helping a soul suffering great distress?

Once fully turned she will smile broadly, satisfied with the result, and tell the players to leave her, suggesting that they join her the next afternoon in @UUID[JournalEntry.rJvb9Dp9sAvBIIzP.JournalEntryPage.HZepipuQu62GA5JQ] for the unveiling.</p><h2 class=\"border\">A Fatal Revelation</h2><p>The unveiling of Lyranth's statue occurs in the Lord's Chambers during the next afternoon- they will arrive to find Lyranth with the statue of Vaxillus covered in a sheet, placed centrally in the chamber. Kryn, seated in his throne, will look aloof and bored, while Vivesna looks on with interest. A number of other members whom Vivesna would have invited will be present, including Vostolas, several shadow servants, and 4 Onyx Knights.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>The sculptor stands beside the covered statue, a look of pure excitement and joy upon her face. She bows deeply before she begins, floridly:</p><blockquote><p>Dear lady, I wish to present to you and his Lordship my finest creation. I wished to immortalize something which would bring you joy you have found nowhere else.</p></blockquote><p>Lyranth grasps the edge of the drapery, preparing to pull it from the statue. Kryn raises an eyebrow, perhaps noting something in the medusa's tone.</p><p>The drape is pulled and the stone form of Vaxillus is revealed, looking regal and lovingly toward his seated mother.</p></section><p>Call for an Insight check. Players who beat a [[/check skill=ins dc=16]] check will be able to detect a dangerous shift in Vivesna's mood and body language, and have the opportunity to realize the danger they are in. Vivesna is about to do something terrible and violent. Players who beat a 20 will catch Kryn hiding a smile in the brief moment that Vaxillus is revealed, before the expression vanishes from his face to be replaced by his customary impassive mask.</p><p>This situation is precarious.

The woman lets out the briefest of screams, cut short as her body is immediately reduced to dust.</p><p>Behind her, Vivesna's wrathful expression demonstrates the effort with which she barely contains an urge to take out her anger on the rest of the room. She is dangerously quiet as she wrestles to control her anger.</p></section><h2 class=\"border\">Available Solutions</h2><p class=\"important\">Completion of this quest earns the party a @UUID[JournalEntry.D1QzSUnec7ZApnDF.JournalEntryPage.mhIzp2kUkLiWEKB8#milestone-advancement]{Milestone Point}.</p><p><strong>Kidnap Vaxillus for Lyranth.</strong> Whatever method the party uses to subdue Vaxillus, he must be alive upon reaching Lyranth or else everything will fall apart, Lyranth will panic, and turn on the party, attempting to transform them into stone or kill them. If successful however, she will promptly turn Vaxillus to stone, making him into a statue for Vivesna.</p><ul><li><p><strong>(Optional) Collect paralysis poison.</strong> Successfully poisoning Vaxillus will prove difficult as he is unlikely to trust the party at the time this quest is underway, but will quickly disable Vaxillus, making him unable to resist the party. Moving his paralyzed body across the manor is another matter entirely, however.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Convince Lyranth to make a normal statue.</strong> If the party realizes that Lyranth intends to turn Vaxillus to stone they can attempt to talk her down and get her to take a less extreme path. If successful, the party will need to convince Vaxillus to come be a model for Lyranth which is a difficult persuasion check, but becomes more possible the better he likes the party.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Item Rewards: </strong>After revealing the statue to Vivesna and seeing her positive reaction she will tell the party in private that it wouldn't have been possible without them and offer a choice of items from her personal inventory: @UUID[Item.TZBIBMSKGFb2scTM]{Lyranth's chisel} or @UUID[Item.NMZtifOHDFr7ttsa]{Lyranth's Vicious Hammer}.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Report Lyranth’s plan to Vaxillus or Vivesna.</strong> By turning Lyranth over, this will begin the @UUID[.zQxjtTe64pDvdGrI]{Quest: Severance} with Vivesna.</p><h2 class=\"border\">Curing Petrification</h2><p>&amp;Reference[petrified]{Petrification} can be cured with a casting of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell, both of which will be out of reach of the party for most of the adventure.</p><p>There is another option however, which involves using medusa blood to revert the victims back to life. A character proficient in Arcana or History can perform a [[/check skill=arc dc=18]] or [[/check skill=his dc=18]] check to recall this possible treatment. A character with expertise in either will know it without a need to roll. The treatment requires taking a quantity of blood from a medusa sufficient to paint the entirety of the petrification victim- usually fatal for the medusa from which the blood is extracted. This causes the &amp;Reference[petrified]{petrified} victim to turn back into flesh and blood as they once were over the course of six hours.</p><p>The amount of blood required to save a single victim is absolutely fatal to the medusa providing it, but clever (or twisted) players can probably find a way to get enough blood from Lyranth without killing her in the process. Spells and magic items might also be able to create the blood, if those items are owned by the party. However, if Vivesna disintegrates Lyranth in her blind fury, the opportunity to remove the petrification is lost unless the party can find another source of medusa blood.</p><p>If the party finds a way to restore a &amp;Reference[petrified]{petrified} Vaxillus to life, they will recover some of their lost approval with Vivesna.</p><p>%APPROVAL%vivesna,3%</p>"

Either way the party is given a brief moment to explain things to her. Regardless of what they say the following is Vivesna' response:</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>As you finish speaking the words which reveal Lyranth's betrayal, Vivesna slowly cranes her neck. While her expression might be stoic, hidden in part by the mask around her eyes, those eyes have narrowed and taken on a dangerous glint.

She is willing to accept any of the following pieces of evidence:</p><p><strong>Implicate Tymnas if he helped the party.</strong> When named, Vivesna will have the Groundskeeper brought to the meeting for questioning. He will not lie about what the party said to him, asked him to do, or what he said in response. Since he genuinely fears for his life, Vivesna will not punish him for his honesty.

I wish all members of this household were as loyal and forthright as you all.</p></blockquote><p>Vivesna then stands, calls for her guards as well as several more in addition. She commands them to come with her, and Vivesna departs the meeting. The party does not have to follow, but they are welcome to if they want. While moving with Vivesna, they watch her seek out Lyranth in the house and order the guards to cut her down where she stands.

During the course of explaining, Lyranth will deny all wrongdoing and claim that she is being falsely accused, that she has only been attempting to get Vaxillus to pose so that she can carve a statue of him. The party will lose all approval with Lyranth, she will now be hostile to them and will work to remove them from the house at all costs.

So you really only need to go make it, which should be easy if you follow the instructions.</p><p>The only thing I <strong>don’t</strong> have for you are some shadow crystals to act as planar ties for the magic circle. Six should do it. Or one big crystal that you break into chunks would also work. I do know where to get them, though.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Where do we find the crystals?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Well, @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.TxmjQWotcshN0E21]{Kryn} has what you need in his display room, but he won’t part with those. So unless you plan to steal them, or want to ask him and see if he’s feeling generous, you’ll want to find them somewhere else.</p><p>Your best bet are to go dig them out of a shadow beast, or see if Kryn’s father had any lying about in his manor on the material plane. I understand he was quite an avid scholar of planar magic, so it’s likely he had a few on-hand. Maybe in a vault or store room or something like that.</p><p>Remember: you'll need six of them, or enough to make six of them.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Where do we find a shadow beast?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Well, you’re in luck. The vitriolic huntsman @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.Gw3iiZla1BZ1sqdv]{Vaxillus }is planning to hunt a shadow tusk. Or a shadow maw. One of the two. Either one should have the crystals in their stomachs, or thereabouts. Ask him to go along and help hunt, then dig the crystals out of the corpse.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What’s a shadow maw / shadow tusk?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>A terribly big beasty that likes to sneak its way into the grounds and eat the servants and guards. One of them is quite cunning, if I recall. Other isn't, but they are both dangerous. Vaxillus has been talking about hunting one. See if he wants company!</p></blockquote></section><h4>What’s in it for us?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>A working magical gateway that takes you to and from this place. Sorry, that’ll have to do. There's no gold or maidens or magical swords in return for doing something which inherently benefits you.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What’s in it for you?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Very good question. Who wouldn’t want to visit the material plane from time to time?</p></blockquote></section><h4>Does Kryn know about this?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Well, he knows the portal exists, and he knows he can’t use it. He doesn’t know I’m having you fix it, but if you do I can put in a good word with him on your behalf. How does that sound?</p></blockquote></section><h2 class=\"border\">Available Solutions</h2><p class=\"important\">Completion of this quest earns the party a @UUID[JournalEntry.D1QzSUnec7ZApnDF.JournalEntryPage.mhIzp2kUkLiWEKB8#milestone-advancement]{Milestone Point}.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Acquire the Shadow Crystals.</strong> The party needs to acquire enough shadow crystals to slot into the magic portal.

These can be acquired quite easily. See that room’s investigation box for the skill check and actions required to obtain them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Harvest them.</strong> If the party manages to kill both the Shadow Tusk and Shadow Maw in @UUID[.vTy3pbvT9rXbvC82]{Quest: The Shadow Hunt} they can spend half an hour carving open their half-intangible carcasses and digging out the necessary crystals.</p><p>This yields one @UUID[Item.VuKOIm0aJ2TT3ebO] per beast. These crystals can be split into two smaller crystals each, yielding 4 of 6 crystals if both beasts are slain and gutted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask for them.</strong> If the party has at least 6 approval with @UUID[Actor.CnaNkZZQmowYRqWS]{Kryn} or @UUID[JournalEntry.Q2Ugx1bL0kbKlRXR.JournalEntryPage.CHPlHOdAOkk9F3l4]{Vivesna} they can directly ask the shadow estate masters for the crystal, and will be obliged. In this case a servant will go get the crystals from the case and bring them to the party, and they will have all the crystal they need.</p></li><li><p><strong>Steal them.</strong> Though generally unwise to do, the party can simply pick the case lock in the shadow estate display room and take those crystals. Kryn will notice, however, and this will cause a huge approval loss as he does not tolerate theft in his house. </p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Make the bone ash.</strong> The instructions given by Vostolas require several pounds of bone (it doesn’t specify from what sort of creature, just the amount) and twice as much freshly cut live wood. Both must be burned in a pit with a block of incense and then processed into ash. This must be combined with a large amount of chalk, yielding the necessary material to repair the circle. The whole process takes 8 hours from start to finish but does not require any special skills.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repair the Ruined Manor's circle.</strong> Repairing the circle in the @UUID[JournalEntry.rJvb9Dp9sAvBIIzP.JournalEntryPage.rTbR401PXyf17KmK] requires at least one party member proficient in Arcana to painstakingly work at repairing the circle to match the diagrams provided by Vostolas using the bone ash. The work must also be done under bright light to ensure accuracy.</p><p>The entire process takes 12 hours of work, but this time can be split up between multiple proficient party members who can work on the circle at once. The circle only provides enough room for four creatures to work at once without getting in each other's way, however.</p></li></ul><p>Once all of the above steps are completed, uttering the command word (which the party sets during the repair step) opens a gateway that any medium sized creature can walk through. The portal stands for 1 minute before automatically closing.

He tasks the party with removing her from the running, permanently. Kryn will offer a number of key pieces of information based on questions the party may have:</p><h4>Why does Elscieth need to die?</h4><p>The need to kill Elscieth is based on Kryn's suspicion that his father's last will and testament is magically enforced. He doesn't know— and has no way to confirm it—but what he stands to lose if there is someone else in line is too great for him to leave anything to chance.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Kryn holds a moment in contemplation, as though deciding whether he trusts the party enough to reveal his reasons.</p><blockquote><p>I cannot say for certain whether my father placed a magical binding on the estate to ensure the inheritance follows specific rules, but I have no interest in gambling on the old fool's political maneuvering. Removing Elscieth from the running guarantees I am the eldest descendant, and leaves no room for dispute.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What if there are other descendants?</h4><p>Kryn is unaware of any other heirs, and Vaxillus does not stand to inherit as Vivesna's bastard— but if he becomes aware or the party tells him, he will add their names to the short list of people who need to be removed.</p><p>It shouldn't need stating that if one of the members of the party is an heir to the Corvinarus family, revealing that to Kryn will result in Kryn intending to kill them as well. Nothing can be left to chance when power and inheritance are on the table.</p><p>When the possibility of other other descendants is mentioned, have the party make an [[/check skill=ins]] check. For people who roll above DC 16 reveal that an inscrutable expression passes over Kryn's face, above DC 20 reveal that a flicker of alarm appears in Kryn's eyes but he prevents his facial expression from showing it. The notion that he miscalculated the number of potential heirs is concerning for him.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Kryn hesitates the barest moment before responding,</p><blockquote><p>As far as I am aware, there are no other heirs to the estate. Neither I nor Elscieth have children, and as far as I know, my father has sired no children but us. Do you have any reason to believe I'm incorrect?</p></blockquote></section><p>If the party reveals the existence of Byscilla he will order them to dispose of her the same as Elscieth.</p><h4>About The Risks Of Assaulting the Feyward Manor</h4><p>Kryn knows that what he's asking of the party might become a suicide mission—but judges it worth the risk. If the party succeeds, he will know that he can trust their capabilities. If the party doesn't return, he will know that Elscieth is a force to be reckoned with and that he needs to take more drastic steps the next time.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>I believe that you have proven more than capable of handling whatever opposition might appear in your path, and if you haven't found a means of reaching the Feyward manor, that would mean I have overestimated you. Have I?</p></blockquote></section><h3 class=\"border\">Assistance Upon Acceptance</h3><p>Kryn knows the risks of sending agents into the Feyward manor to assassinate his sister, and while he's fine risking the party's life, he will work to empower the party to succeed.</p><p>To cement the party's loyalty and aid them in their elimination of the Fey court, Kryn will arrange a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.mgFqi0ev8f7Ut19y]{Heroes' Feast} for the party before they depart and offer the group their choice of magical items from his personal armory as well as the following advice:</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[Item.oXXEorDqgGATndg5]{Kryn's Invisible Rapier}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[Item.2TpTXZIzWHqpHWOv]{Kryn's Glamoured Armor}</p></li></ul><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>It is no easy task you are undertaking. To improve your chances, we will provide you with a manifestation of our will.</p></blockquote><p>The group is guided to the Dining Hall where a truly grand feast is prepared.</p><p>After the feast, a group of shadow servants, one for each party member, seep through doors and walls before approaching the party each bearing a small ring.</p><p>The rings are adorned with the crest of the Corvinarus family and - unless stopped - the servants take the hand of each party member and slide the ring on either an index or little finger.</p><p>Once accomplished, Vivesna speaks a single word and the tokens briefly pulse with shadow and darkness, before subsiding. The marks thereafter seem to seep unearthly shadow that drifts like water vapor.</p><p>Kryn says proudly:</p><blockquote><p>As our agents these rings will wreath you and your weapons in shadow— making you harder to strike, and making your weapons highly effective against the chaotic overgrowth of the Fey.</p></blockquote></section><p>The rings are @UUID[Item.ZLYdsmrzFZPex9bD]{Umbral Signets} which, while worn, deal additional necrotic damage on weapon and spell attacks against Fey creatures which reside within the Feyward Manor.

This is a man who is burdened. He takes a single sip of wine, watching something beyond the party with distant eyes, reflecting upon some line of thought he is not quite ready to reveal.</p><p>He begins to pace the floor with slow, methodic steps.</p><blockquote><p>You have performed a great service for me— shown yourselves to be worthy of my trust, removed impediments to my ascension, and returned to offer further support….but what I am about to tell you is something known only by those closest to me.</p></blockquote><p>The Lord of Shadow pauses his strides, turning to face the party, perhaps judging their body language or expressions. While his face is the same resolute mask he has cultivated over the past decades, his eyes hold a note of loathing, not at them— but for what he is about to say.</p><blockquote><p>My father was a powerful wizard— make no mistake. Mad as any wizard can be, but powerful. In his pursuit of arcane power, he managed to bifurcate this estate into the realms in which we now stand, and whatever it is that maintains that division lies within the sanctum from which he conducted his research.</p></blockquote><p>His lip curls in scorn as he speaks that phrase, and adds in a tone full of bitter disgust:</p><blockquote><p>For years it has been frustratingly out of reach, but with you, we can finally put an end to his cruelty.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Learning about the Sanctum</h4><p>The Sanctum is accessible only through the ruined incarnation of the manor, and as the residents of the Shadeward Manor are bound and cannot leave it, Kryn must rely on the party to end the imprisonment.</p><p>Kryn has been there once before, when they arranged the sabotage of the rituals Darius had intended to trigger his immortality, though he may be reluctant to reveal that they are here not as a result of Darius' rituals, but by their own actions in causing those rituals to go awry.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>He was fixated on immortality, my father. Dedicated to the idea of remaining alive at all costs.</p></blockquote><p>Kryn muses, toying with the signet ring upon his finger as he speaks.</p><blockquote><p>To further his goals and hide his failures, he built a magical sanctum in some sort of interdimensional space, and bound it to the manor. I don’t know how long he had it before I discovered it, not truly…but I have to surmise that he built it in secret after we lost mother—the timing is too coincidental.</p><p>I have stood in that place and I have seen the unthinkable rituals he pursued, half-finished or otherwise…and I know how to get back there.</p></blockquote><p>He briefly pauses, rephrasing:</p><blockquote><p>I know how <strong>you</strong> can get there.</p></blockquote></section><h4>How do we get in?</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Kryn nods, perhaps having anticipated the question.</p><blockquote><p>In my father's old bedroom, in the ruined estate, there was a magic circle that was used to enter his sanctum. He kept it poorly hidden under a large circular rug. It required the use of a command word to activate, and I suspect it is still there, though I wouldn't expect it to still be functional after all these years.</p><p>It appears that whatever magic split the manors also split the circle, as we have been studying a matching circle in my own bedroom which holds a partial inscription of the magical coding. It is my belief that my sister's Feywild estate also holds a third of this circle. Perhaps with those two you can reconstruct the ruined manor's circle.</p><p>We will lend whatever aid you need in repairing the circle, naturally, but we cannot come with or directly assist you. My father has seen to make that impossible.</p></blockquote></section><h4>How is the circle powered?</h4><p>Kryn isn't familiar enough with the workings of the teleportation circle to speculate on the source of magical power it relies upon.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>His lip curls with no small amount of rue.</p><blockquote><p>That is a question I don’t have an answer to. If the circle is not powered upon its repair then it’s likely that something is impeding the flow of magic to it. My beloved wife may be able to speculate further.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Vivesna</strong> smiles mirthlessly from under her mask. Her voice comes out silky smooth, and controlled.</p><blockquote><p>While it is only a very well educated guess, it appears that my beloved's father was using magical energy drawn from the planes itself. If you've spent any time studying the library magic circle you surely are familiar with some of his handiwork.</p><p>It's very likely that the energy meant for the portal is ending up somewhere else. I would explore the grounds for any sources of magic, or any particularly large and aggressive monstrosities, like overgrown beasties, abominations of nature, arcane anomalies, things of that sort. They might be sapping energy meant for the circle.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What if Darius is alive?</h4><p>If the party suggests that Kryn's father might be alive, have them roll an Insight check. Anyone who makes an successful [[/check skill=ins dc=18]]<strong> check</strong> against him will catch that Kryn convulsively swallows and lets his emotional control slip just long enough to reveal he is genuinely terrified of that thought.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><p>Kryn adjusts his posture a little, perhaps making himself a little more comfortable. The tone of his response is calm and collected.</p><blockquote><p>…I have considered that possibility, but I don’t believe it likely. If he lived, he would have come for us by now. If he is alive though, he will surely trying to stop you.</p><p>You should be prepared to defend yourself, and to kill him if need be. He will almost certainly try to kill you.</p></blockquote></section><h4>What do we do after we get there?</h4><p>Kryn and Vivesna have been in the sanctum before, and can provide a measure of knowledge about what they saw when it was whole—but they have not seen it in its current state, so much of their information is speculative.</p><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Yes, about that. I've had the good fortune to study a few pages from my father's work books, and with my dearest Vivesna's help, have concocted a plan to set things right. Once you have secured the sanctum, you will need to place a control orb into a… what was it he called it, dearest?</p></blockquote><p>Kryn looks to Vivesna, who sits up slightly.</p><blockquote><p>An \"energetic event horizon of conflicting planar energies.\"</p></blockquote><p>Says Vivesna with open disdain and a dismissive flourish of a gloved hand. Her eyes visibly rolling under her mask.</p><blockquote><p>Yes… that.</p></blockquote><p>Kryn waves a hand, creating a shimmering gateway in the air, the great, seething boughs of the Tree of Woe can be seen though it, as can a large orb of darkness and violet light. Kryn reaches through the portal, and claims the orb, plucking it like a fruit.</p><p>He offers it to whoever is brave enough to take it.</p><blockquote><p>Place this orb into the event horizon of the conflicting energies. That will allow me to set things right, and begin to restore the house of Corvinarus to is proper state and station.</p></blockquote></section><p>This grants the party the @UUID[Item.L0dl1x8vPVkAsqNM]{Orb of Shadow Dominion} which is integral for at least one of this adventure's @UUID[JournalEntry.Am8HvuLkr7XcOFYx.JournalEntryPage.WWmG2oDTDLx7TAsi]{Possible Conclusions}.</p><p>The party will need to place it in the nexus of planar energies that form after Darius is finally defeated.

I suppose you could be useful. I’ve got to hunt some shadow game for the kitchen. Ever had shadow meat? Terrible, tastes like nothing. Come with, and pull your weight and I’ll tell my mother you’ve done a favor for the manor.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Upon asking about the quarry:</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Big as the lot of us, with huge fangs and burning eyes. Now that the Scorncrow’s been dealt with by the tree of woe they’ll start coming around again. They aren’t pushovers, but one of them is no match for a group of hunters, provided you all do your part. The thing to know about them is that they are very aggressive, so if it spots you before we launch our trap you’ll need to fend for yourself until we get to you.</p></blockquote></section><h4>Upon asking for tips or tactics:</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Best way to hunt them is to pin them down in melee while shooting at their flanks. If I can do it with just myself and my hounds all of us will make light work of it. You ought to be thanking me for such an easy task.</p></blockquote></section><h4>When the Shadowmaw reveals itself:</h4><section class=\"box-text narrative\"><blockquote><p>Aha! There you are!

This gives him a variable number of additional turns (at least 2) which he can use to cast spells and prepare for battle. The spells he casts on himself are @UUID[Actor.CnaNkZZQmowYRqWS.Item.M61X1J2CdFXUskO7]{Greater Invisibility} and @UUID[Actor.CnaNkZZQmowYRqWS.Item.126EQl9NJWsnl8Hz]{Fire Shield}.

He uses his spells to bombard enemies, punishing foes for clustering together when they do while relying on mobility and control to keep distance to enemies.</p><h4>Metamagic</h4><p>Kryn’s unique ability is his metamagic, which allows him to manipulate spells to change how they work. Whenever he casts a spell he can use spell points to activate the following metamagic features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>@UUID[Actor.CnaNkZZQmowYRqWS.Item.PUxCK9fFO6LeXqEy]{Mutate Spell}</strong>: Kryn uses this metamagic feature to change damage of a fire or lightning spell to his choice of acid, fire, or lightning damage. If Kryn casts a spell on a target and realizes they are resistant to the damage type, he’ll begin using this to circumvent it and ensure his spells remain effective.</p></li><li><p><strong>@UUID[Actor.CnaNkZZQmowYRqWS.Item.zBTHidSOdtI7xNQU]{Quicken Spell}</strong>: Kryn uses this metamagic feature to turn a normal spell into a bonus action cast. This is especially useful since he can quicken a cantrip, which allows him to cast a leveled spell and throw a ranged spell attack, or use his actions to make melee attacks with his rapier followed by a spell cast as a bonus action.</p></li><li><p><strong>@UUID[Actor.CnaNkZZQmowYRqWS.Item.AOEpeBS9CC8RaaJ1]{Heighten Spell}</strong>: Kryn uses this metamagic to ensure that his most debilitating spells affect their intended targets. He will use this metamagic to heighten spells like Disintegrate, Dominate Person, and Lightning Bolt to maximize the damage they can deal.</p></li></ul><h4>Guards</h4><p>If Kryn is outnumbered and outgunned he attempts to flee and raise the guards or call on allies. This potentially will trigger additional encounters which can then be added to the existing one, these include @UUID[.SDVKygH4p4Z5MBtf]{Vivesna}, and @UUID[.7a3qD3AARTCHRFun]{Onyx Knight} patrols.
