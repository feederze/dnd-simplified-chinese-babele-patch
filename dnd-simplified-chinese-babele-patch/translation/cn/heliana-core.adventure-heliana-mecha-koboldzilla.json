      "description": "<p>Greetings, hunter! What you have here is a monster hunt from <em>Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting</em>. Heliana's hunts require your players to find the monster, picking up clues along the way, and then defeat it in an epic multi-wave boss battle. Be<strong> really obvious</strong> with the clues; make sure to give out the associated handouts. After the clues have been collected, but before the boss fight begins, the players should always have a chance to long rest and use what they've learned to prepare for the fight ahead.</p><p></p><p>This hunt makes full use of the Tracking, Harvesting, Crafting, and Cooking rules from Heliana's—be sure to read up on those! Using the Cooking rules to prepare magical meals is a great way the players can monopolise on the clues! Each of these Foundry Adventures comes with:</p><ul><li><p>PDF of the hunt.</p></li><li><p>Three clue handouts to be given to the players before they meet the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Handouts of the fantastical things the players might see along the way.</p></li><li><p>Walled and lit scenes, with each wave's monsters separated by level.</p></li><li><p>Actors with original tokens.</p></li><li><p>Lair actions given their own actor (be sure to put it at initiative count 20!).</p></li><li><p>Magic items that can be found during the hunt, as well as those that can be crafted from the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Spells that the monsters and magic items use.</p></li></ul><h3>About This Hunt</h3><p>This hunt, <em>Mecha Koboldzilla</em>, is intended for 3 to 7 characters and is optimised for a party of 4 with an average party level (APL) of <strong>7, 14, or 20</strong>. Characters who complete this hunt should earn enough experience to progress two-fifths of the way to 8th level or three-fifths of the way to 15th level. The adventurers must prepare to face a colossal, metal construct, piloted by kobolds who’ve been coaxed to zealous levels of battle-readiness by a campaign of misinformation.</p><p>After picking apart information about the alleged end of the world and learning about the weaknesses of Bodrum’s automatons, the party are given a chance to rest before ascending Bodrum Button to face the end of the world. This battle is <strong>deadly</strong> and uses the party’s entire daily XP budget. Equipment for an extended fight, spells and effects that deal acid or cold damage, and strategies that impose Dexterity saving throws will prove terrifically helpful in this endeavour.</p><h3>Credits</h3><p><strong>Lead Designers</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Lead Writer</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Rule Development</strong>: Max Wartelle, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih</p><p><strong>Additional Writing</strong>: João Araújo, Mage Armoire, Tony Casper, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Jethro Mellors, Duncan Watson</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Phylea, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Formatting</strong>: Sally Kay Clark, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Proofing</strong>: João Araújo, Sally Kay Clark, Jessic Gombart, Victor Matyiku</p><p><strong>Art Directors</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Layout</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Cover Illustrator</strong>: Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Interior Illustrators</strong>: Diogo Assunçao, Hannah Elizabeth Baker, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Luciano Javier Carreira, Ivy Dolamore, Aleksa Drageljevic, Sam Jumisko, Michelle Mueller, Derek Murphy, Mikhail Palamarchuk, Joris Sanchez, Ognjen Sporin, Bryan Syme, Chaouki ‘’Ciao’” Titouhi, Denis Zhbankov</p><p><strong>Cartographers</strong>: Cze &amp; Peku, Mad Cartographer</p><p><strong>Cacophonics the Bard</strong>: Jack Patchett</p><p><strong>Ambience</strong>: Michaël Ghelfi Studios</p><p><strong>Marketing Consultant</strong>: Ricardo Evangelho</p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong>: Ethen Adams, Sally Kay Clark, Ricardo Evangelho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Piotr “Narb” Wiśnios</p><p><strong>Playtesters:</strong> A11star, Adam Bohkari, Addy, aj, alpha_spark, Alzebub, Balbowa, Blanket, Buront, Catbath, Constantine, cypheur, Danger7778, Derpy, Douglas, Erunas, Feria, Ghost, GremlinRemy, GrimOptimist, Igris, Jambo Kaka, jasoncelic, Jesse Marek, JonDemand, junkdroid, Kaniki, Kensho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Kobe Montour, Korren, Kristjan the Necrom, luke4495, Megan Pisarik, MementoMorrie, MonoXideAtWork, MrMonneypenny, Naming Fae, narnia3756, NeK0z, Neldu, NickWolf8 , One True Doge, Osirusblue, Phillip , PulsarCologne, RabidAmazonian, Relle, Rohdry, RutledgeHusband, SendHelp, Shadowpaine, Siggy, Sir Mk, SleepySpartan, Solo, Stevie Friesth, Taoko, teepea298, TheNewBadHombre, TinyKitty, Toria, Truwolf, Ulysses, victorcree, Victor Matyiku, vivacia, Watermelon, wyvernvalet, Zachary Nix</p>",

              "text": "<p><span class=\"Squeeze_102-\">Aeons ago, a giant space hamster crash landed in a swampy expanse of the planet the party calls home. Long drained and cultivated, that expanse is now home to the perfectly arable town of Bodrum, a hub for agriculture, wineries, and fat mining. Preserved deep underground, the remains of this incredibly well-fed space hamster are excavated by wheelbarrow and bucket for use as fuel, fertiliser, and fine dining.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">Kobolds, natives of dark spaces and narrow tunnels, excel at this lipid extraction, and they don’t seem to mind the smell, either. Employed by Baron Bodrum Businesses Inc. for the past few decades, these kobolds are an integral part of life in Bodrum. Sure, pies go missing off of window sills and horses become magically unshod overnight, but without these kobolds, Bodrum would be nothing more than a boring backwater producing buckwheat and beer. While most of Bodrum’s townsfolk believe the fat to come from “dinosaurs or something,” kobold oral tradition teaches the hamster truth.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">Branton Quark, winner of the Guild of Artificer’s ignoble ‘Most Likely to Accidentally End the World’ award three years running, has been stirring up trouble in the kobold community. Since losing his job as chief engineer at Baron Bodrum Businesses Inc. a month ago, Quark has been seen posing as an emissary of the Many-Headed Dragon Queen (the costume for which is a very homemade dragon onesie), on Bodrum’s high street. Each day, he hands out flyers detailing the end of the world on the coming equinox at the hands of a second giant space hamster in an attempt to scare off the kobolds.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">Over the past month, the number of kobolds turning up for work has dwindled. Quark showed the kobolds his designs for a giant automaton with which he would fight the space hamster, which they immediately vandalised and stole. They have since excluded him from the fabrication process and bent all their resources to its construction, disappearing from the surface three days prior to the party’s arrival. His plan to make the kobolds leave work has succeeded and he is vying to get his former position at the factory back.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Squeeze_102-\">Meanwhile, in Bodrum, stuff has been going missing. Lots of stuff. Though the populace isn’t aware of the perpetrators’ identity, it is the kobolds that have been busy purloining all the bits, bobs, and other apparatus they need to create Quark’s world-saving machine. Much to the chagrin of the local populace, this includes the town gazebo, which disappeared one night. Baron Bodrum, occasional philanthropist (for tax reasons), has put up a bounty to have the thieves captured, and the goods returned.</span></p><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/adventures/heliana-mecha-koboldzilla/images/journal/MechaKoboldzilla-Scene-Branton_Quark_Dino_Suit.webp\">"
