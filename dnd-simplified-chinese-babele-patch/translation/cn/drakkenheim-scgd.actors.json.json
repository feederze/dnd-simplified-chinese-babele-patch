For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\n<ul>\n<li>While this layer is in place, Spells can't be cast through the wall.

On a failed save, the creature is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a Dispel Magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end Spells and magical Effects.</li>\n</ol>",

He himself is noted for having slain the children of Amarodial “Bitterheart” the Black Dragon of the Eastern Vales when they ventured over the mountains into Caspian territory. That was some time ago, and now, over the age of seventy, Commander Callisto has retired from the battlefield and helps train new recruits. He is a strict commander who expects the best from his knights, and constantly reminds them that if they think he is too harsh, they will be sorely disappointed with how a dragon treats them. Callisto has short gray hair and keeps a gray stubble beard. He has an eyepatch over his left eye and three scars across his face — a memento from one of his earliest battles. Commander Callisto wears the same armor into battle each and every time, complete with its many burn marks, dents, and holes from draconic teeth and claws. He is missing his left arm after having lost it to a red dragon on the Drakeclaw Mountains years ago. Despite his injury he returned with the head of the dragon in tow. Anyone who has made a comment about his missing arm is thrown into the training pit with the commander, who challenges them to beat him in a duel. The Scalebreaker Commander remains undefeated.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I am a stern man with a lot of wisdom from experience. I speak harshly and honestly. In battle there is no place for niceties.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> I train the best, because anything less won't survive long enough to learn better.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> The Scalebreakers are one of the most important forces in all of Caspia, we may not be nobles or High Kings, but you can bet on your life that they know they need us when the monsters of this world come crawling out of their holes.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I am incapable of relaxing. I have been on my guard my whole life and constantly in battles. I don't know if I am capable of settling down.</p><p class=\"p2\">Callisto has a long-standing rivalry with the black dragon Amarodial, who dwells in the Eastern Vales. He has faced the dragon several times and the two are well aware of one another. Since they are separated by the Rust Edge Mountains, their battles have subsided for many years. Still, Commander Callisto dreams of facing the dragon once more. If he is to die, he would rather it be in the jaws of that treacherous beast than lying in a bed.</p>",

As a result, he has angelic features, pale lavender skin, a short black beard, and sparkling opalescent eyes. He is often encountered simply wearing goggles and a stained leather smith's apron over a purple tunic, setting aside his Academy robes for attire more appropriate for his work.</p><p>Alabaster is a peerless master of alchemy and transmutation magic. His experimentations and research involve using delerium to alter the material properties of other matter. Alabaster is well known to have created the formula for aqua delerium. He has already successfully developed a process to use delerium to transform lead into gold, but is now much more interested in using the stones to create some form of life. However, Alabaster is keenly aware of the erratic and chaotic effects of the crystals on flesh, which tend to produce insane, contaminated monsters. Instead, deep within the depths of the Enigma Ziggurat, he has fashioned several prototype human-sized golems with delerium crystal hearts. His unique method has produced magically animated constructs imbued with sentience and personality. Each is a unique and immaculately crafted being with intricate facial features, often decorated with porcelain, glass, and silver. The archmage quietly released a handful of his creations into the world to see what adventures they will find.</p><p><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I seek to finish any conversation as quickly as possible so I can go back to my experiments.</p><p><strong>Ideal.</strong> If it is true that celestial beings created life and the universe, I am merely striving to emulate the example of my ancestors. The world is but a grand experiment, now long forgotten by those who set it in motion.</p><p><strong>Bond.</strong> Delerium is the true philosopher's stone: its transformative properties are supreme. Using its magic, we can transform anything — perhaps even life itself.</p><p><strong>Flaw.</strong> I have created many things in my life. However, I quickly move on to the next project and care little for my past experiments.</p><p>Alabaster is a close confidant, partner, and sometimes lover to Penumbra, the Archmage of Terene. Together, the two are parents to several up-and-coming Academy students.</p>",

If it drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill its space.</p><p>When you cast the spell and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following Effects with it.</p><p><strong>Clenched Fist</strong>. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell Attack for the hand using your game Statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.</p><p><strong>Forceful Hand</strong>. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your Spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.</p><p><strong>Grasping Hand</strong>. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is Grappling the target, you can use a Bonus Action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p><strong>Interposing Hand</strong>. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p>\n        <p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly Components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>\n        <p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following Effects of your choice:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n        <li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all Effects on them described in the Greater Restoration spell.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li>\n        <li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n        <p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend Resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

    "original": "<h2><strong>Vulmungoth, Doom of the Mountain</strong></h2><p class=\"p2\">This <span class=\"s1\">ancient red dragon</span> resides in the caldera of the Dragon's Maw. The dragon has lived here since before recorded history, and spends decades at a time slumbering.</p><p class=\"p2\">Vulmungoth rarely stirs in their lair. The caldera is so inhospitable, most would-be dragon slayers die scaling the volcano. Still, they emerge every century or so to slake their vast appetite, flying down into Elyria to consume mortals and their livestock. Their waking always follows great eruptions from the Dragon's Maw, and many towns and villages are destroyed.</p><p class=\"p2\">Thus, the locals living south of the Drakeclaws grow up with well-made plans for their evacuation and escape should the dragon return. During their last rampage, the dragon descended upon Holy Lumen in a horrible encounter that almost saw Saint Tarna's Cathedral destroyed.</p><p class=\"p2\">Vulmungoth is the last surviving dragon who was a part of the ancient Blood Pact, where the sorcerer-kings melded their bloodlines with draconic magic. Today many sorcerers and dragonborn can trace their distant ancestry to Vulmungoth.</p><p class=\"p2\">Shortly after the fall of the sorcerer-kings, a group of monks of the Sacred Flame attempted to ascend the Dragon's Maw and destroy Vulmungoth for their ties to the Arcane Empire. The dragon devoured most of them. Only a small handful of monks made it off the mountains. The resounding defeat ended the organized attempts by Elyria to defeat the Doom of the Mountain.</p>",

However, Elara nonetheless found herself called to the faith at a young age, and departed her household as a teenager. She returned years later as a devout warrior-priest of the Sacred Flame having spent many years in Elyria under the mentorship of the Divine Matriarch. Now in her early thirties, she has retired from adventure, and taken up the mantle as High <span class=\"s1\">Flamekeeper</span> for the High King of Caspia. However, thanks to her new station, she has now become entangled in the politics which drove her to leave Caspia in the first place.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I speak slowly and calmly to ensure I am understood. I often feel like Caspians yell and shout like wild animals, so a firm but soft voice often puts them in their place.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> Strength is one thing, but having a good head on your shoulders and knowing how to use it will take you much further in Caspia than you might expect.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> I live by the tenets of the Sacred Flame, which I hold in higher regard than my household.

She is well-loved by the people and is regarded as a kind and caring individual, welcoming to all people, and exuding love and compassion to everyone she meets. Greta has established the Kinland Hills as a welcoming place for smallfolk to escape the many wars of Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär. Standing four feet tall, Greta is a rotund elderly woman. She often wears a brightly-colored yellow dress. The lovable mayor has an old wooden cane she uses as a walking stick, and curly, frizzled, brown hair, full rosy cheeks, a round nose, several chins, and a large warm smile that pushes her cheeks up into her bright green eyes.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I naturally speak to everyone as if they were my dear children, offering hospitality and kindness to anyone and everyone.

She is an athletic woman in her early twenties with wide brown eyes, tightly curled black hair, and soft features.</p><p class=\"p2\">She is known as having a good eye for money and is well-versed in politics and trade. She is responsible for many of the diplomatic arrangements, political discussions, and negotiations with other cities and rulers. Verona von Baden is often dressed in a white button up with a brown leather vest, dark trousers, and swash- buckling boots. She carries a shimmering rapier with an ornate golden hilt with an engraving of her family crest upon it. Like her father, she is an avid sailor and ship captain. Her own caravel is known as the Rose of Thorns, a ship built from rosewood with an ornate carved bouquet as its figurehead, white sails, and armed with canons. She has been at the helm of many sea battles, and her swift ship is known and feared by many.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I am a careful listener and observer, knowing what to say to make people around me feel at ease, and get what I need out of them. Kindness is a master manipulator.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong> </span>Money can't buy you happiness, but the more of it you have, the less you need to worry. Having strong allies and good cash flow is the recipe for a happy life.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong> </span>I am the best negotiator and smartest leader this city has ever had, and will prove myself invaluable to the people and my father.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong> </span>My overconfidence and desire to do things myself has seen me in over my head on multiple occasions, whether it be with a pirate's sword to my throat, a political debate, or captured by otherworldly monsters.</p><p class=\"p2\">Verona Von Baden has positioned herself as an incredible leader, both in naval expeditions and battles, but also in political debates and trade. She hopes to not only claim the duchy of Drannsmund after her father steps down, but prove to the people of the city her value as their leader. In doing so, she believes that if no successor is found to rule Westemär, her connections and alliances will ensure she will be the most obvious choice.</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

Zodiac performs most of his research at Starspire Observatory, where he has spent centuries cataloging and monitoring the stars and cosmos. Zodiac rarely interacts with other mages in the observatory, and usually only speaks to the other Academy Directors.

He has had some larger deposits sent to him from Drakkenheim to compare samples. Meanwhile, the elusive mage has tapped into the thin places upon the Island, and is attempting to create controlled doorways to other timelines using delerium. Zodiac wants to explore not only other worlds, but the past and future as well. In particular, he would love to travel back in time to watch the arrival of the elves, and learn how they made the Elfgates to travel between distant planets.</p>",

If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see.

It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\n<ul>\n<li>While this layer is in place, Spells can't be cast through the wall.

(Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.

You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

The <span class=\"s1\"><strong>Academy Director Lich</strong></span> has held his position since the Amethyst</p><p class=\"p2\">Academy was founded, and was among the principal architects of the Edicts of Lumen. Indeed, since the time the Edicts were being drafted, the Divine Matriarchs have known about his undead nature, though they must tolerate this uncomfortable truth under the terms of the agreement.</p><p class=\"p2\">Even still, Xel'vocha's undead nature is not immediately apparent; aside from the High Paladin and the Divine Matriarch, the other members of the Elyrian Cabinet are not aware Xel'vohca is a lich. Upon first meeting he appears as an old man in an ornate wheelchair of strange metal, attended by his personal <span class=\"s1\">shield guardian</span>. He has drooping jowls, sallow skin, sunken octarine eyes, wispy white hair, and an expression of deep sadness upon his face. He wears a simple purple robe and carries a glass-encased delerium orb. Except to incant his magic, Xel'vohca no longer speaks and relies on telepathy to communicate.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> </span>I communicate telepathically in strained and long-winded streams of consciousness, my mind constantly burdened with centuries of thoughts.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> Magic can do great things. Terrible things, but great things indeed. We must wield it with responsibility, but wield it we must.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong> </span>I was there when the first warlocks made their ancient pacts. The burden of the original sin of magic rests upon me, and I will steward the inheritors of the arcane until the last sun goes out at the end of eternity. I think of all mages as my children, and the sorcerer-kings were my wayward sons and daughters. I cannot repeat those mistakes.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> Though my undead heart no longer beats, it pains me to feed my phylactery and sustain myself. The memories of these stolen souls haunts me, so I only do so rarely. As a result, my body has greatly atrophied, and now I fear my mind is slipping into madness as well.</p><p class=\"p2\">Xel'vohca was both the first warlock and the first lich. Far from an evil creature, Xel'vohca has spent thousands of years facing the consequences of the choices he made in life. He is older than recorded history, and was vizier to many of the sorcerer-kings, though he was unable to stop their tyranny.</p><p class=\"p2\">His existence has often been spent trying to make amends for the failures of his past, but this task grows ever harder as new conflicts arise. The destruction of Drakkenheim and the spread of delerium have posed a major challenge to Xel'vohca.</p><p class=\"p1\">Amongst the Directorate, Xel'vohca alone harbors grave doubts about whether using delerium is a good idea, but is the first to admit that he himself is deeply tempted by its power.</p><p class=\"p1\">Today, Xel'vohca keeps his tomb deep within a section of the Dungeons of Nox. This personal mausoleum has been his lair for thousands of years, and he is loath to give up the comforts of his long-established home. Many of the traps and monsters roaming the dungeons are Xel'vocha's designs to keep intrepid heroes out of his business — and far away from the more dangerous artifacts and creations of the sorcerer-kings, which Xel'vohca safeguards from the world.</p>",

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

She has large, spiraling gray horns emerging from her forehead, and keeps her blue green hair in buns along the sides of her head. The archmage has deep, dark eyes, and sharp pointed teeth.</p><p class=\"p3\">Amongst the few who have met her in person, Penumbra is known as being both incredibly charming and extremely disarming. Those who speak with her are caught completely off guard by her outward kindness, and find themselves talking endlessly to her. Only after Penumbra leaves do they realize she never said anything about herself, and simply listened to them talk.</p><p class=\"p3\">Penumbra enjoys the trappings of everyday life, and is fascinated by the people in it. She enjoys spending time amongst the locals and admiring the sandy beaches and warm weather in Terene, though her powerful enchantments cause those who meet her to forget she was ever there. Penumbra's tendency to mingle with common folk has been a concern of the other Directors for some time. They know she travels to cities all over the continent, and often appears in taverns and pubs to hear tales of local problems, or sometimes sends hapless adventurers on dangerous quests to unknown ends.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Traits.</strong></span> I aim to be friendly and humble to the people around me. I am often delighted by mundane non-magical life.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> The more we can learn about the people of this world, the more we can use our magic to change it.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> Alabaster has been with me through thick and thin for years and I admire his dedication and passion.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I often upset my peers with my carefree attitude and nonchalant use of magic.</p><p class=\"p3\">The archmage works from a secret academy stronghold, where she had studied the effects of delerium contamination on the mind to understand the madness it causes. She has been using fish, rats, and birds as test subjects, attempting to imbue them with intelligence enough to manifest psionic abilities. If successful, she hopes to begin testing her method with human volunteers soon, potentially using delerium to imbue non-mageborn with magical powers. Penumbra has an on-again, off-again relationship with Archmage Alabaster of Liberio. The two have several magically gifted children.</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

She is always beaming with a large smile, red dimpled cheeks, and an abundance of chins. She has a round nose and big bright eyes; one is green, the other is a strange crimson red. She carries a short staff made of iron laced with golden swirls. Marigold wears a wide-brimmed, pointed, purple hat and a well-fitted purple Academy tunic. She is always a delight to be around and many Caspians admire her optimistic attitude and overt friendliness.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I speak in excited and friendly tones and am always looking for an opportunity to help out. No one suspects a jovial gnome!</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> Tricking mortals is so easy, you just need to smile and nod and occasionally throw in a mild request and a quick illusion and you can bend them to your will.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> No one suspects the truth of my presence here, and I will continue to play this role and pull the strings of the Amethyst Academy as I see fit.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I am reckless and care little for those around me.

Behind closed doors, Marigold has been heard muttering in deep whispers of unknown languages to herself. She vanishes every night when her duties are done, and even goes weeks or months without communicating with the other Academy Directors. She has spoken briefly of her walking castle, but no one is sure what she refers to, and assume it is another jest. Marigold has been working in secret to study how delerium affects illusion magic. She hopes to create a means of making illusion spells function like summoning spells — conjuring up an illusion and infusing it with delerium to give it form and make it real. If she can master this new advancement, she will be able to create any object, reshape landscapes, manifest riches and items, and reshape reality in ways hitherto unheard of.</p>",

The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

She is secretly a <span class=\"s1\">vampire</span>.</p><p class=\"p2\">Constance Kleinkessel is a voluptuous woman who appears in her late forties. She has gleaming emerald eyes, crimson red lips, a flushed round face, and a small pointed nose. Her jet-black hair is tied up into braids and woven into an intricate headpiece set with pearls. She wears a scarlet gown and is dripping with jewelry. Her painted fingernails are sharpened into points. She often meets guests for dinner, where she licks her lips and runs her fingers on the edge of a cup of red wine.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I could eat you up. I fill my speech with macabre innuendo which mix dining, physical intimacy, and slaughter.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> The living must be made to serve the dead. When my plans come to fruition, mortals will be divided into cattle and corpses.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong> </span>I am bound by bonds of blood to serve dark masters and vampiric overlords, but one day I will take it all for myself.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I can't ever resist a good meal… would you like to stay for dinner?</p><p class=\"p2\">Constance Kleinkessel herself is in fact the sister of Helena I. Originally known as Camilla von Kessel, she has passed through a series of identities to hide her vampiric nature. Every few decades, she marries a hapless nobleman, slowly draining his life force so that he appears to expire from old age. Shortly thereafter, her so-called daughter inherits the estate and the cycle continues.</p><p class=\"p2\">During the Civil War, Constance Kleinkessel used her vampiric abilities to manipulate and scheme alongside Cecilia von Kessel and Lord Commander Elias Drexel to plot the murder of Mannfred von Kessel. She had planned to follow through and murder her co-conspirators, but the subsequent death of Cecilia von Kessel was an unexpected development: she had been planning to target Cecelia's future children with her replacement scheme to seize the throne of Westemär. Since undead creatures are not immune to the effects of delerium contamination, Constance Kleinkessel has also worked closely with her doctor, the malfeasant wizard Deidrick Mors, to experiment with new ways delerium can create augmented vampires.</p>",

He is a hefty man who wears elegant purple robes and a pointed purple hat. He is always smiling and his bellowing laugh echoes through the chambers of his school. He adores the Academy Stronghold and loves meeting and pranking the students. Headmaster Greywell has a tendency to speak in riddles, and half-true jovial warnings. Many a new student is often put off at first when Rupert chuckles “Stay clear of the necromancy section in the library at night, unless you don't mind being possessed!”</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I love riddles, trivia, and curiosities. I adore the look of wonder on a student's face when they are unprepared for the magical madness that is my castle.

However, the Directorate does not love his quirky and rambunctious attitude, and have been waiting for him to slip up for years so they can replace the headmaster.</p><p class=\"p3\">Rupert however, is not a dullard, and knows well the opinion his higher ups have of him. He has a cunning intellect and mind for politics that many do not expect, and carefully treads the line of being regarded by his staff and students as carefree, fun-loving, and a joy to work with, while also making sure he stays well within the guidelines, rules, and structure laid out by the Academy. Whenever he is asked to answer to the Directorate, Rupert comes prepared with ironclad documents and signed papers to prove all his claims, ensuring the Directorate cannot find a sliver of a reason to justifiably remove him.</p>",

If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a Sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the Duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.</p><p>The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become Blinded for 1 minute.</p><p>The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.</p><p>The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the Duration of the spell. An Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic works only against the violet layer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Red</strong>.

The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</li>\n<li><strong>Yellow</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Indigo</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\n<ul>\n<li>While this layer is in place, Spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a Daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Violet</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a Dispel Magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end Spells and magical Effects.</li>\n</ol>",

The spell simply takes effect.</p>\n        <p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following Effects of your choice:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n        <li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all Effects on them described in the Greater Restoration spell.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li>\n        <li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n        <p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend Resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

The <span class=\"s1\">Academy Director</span> always levitates or flies through the air; her long elegant purple robes sweeping across the floors, and her platinum hair is constantly moving as if she were underwater. Writings attributed to Lasaia Nightbreeze have been found in Academy textbooks hundreds of years old, most notably a thousand-year-old tome titled On the Origins of Evocation buried in the great Starspire Observatory. She is sometimes seen drifting through the halls of Paradox Castle like a wayward ghost. She greets students occasionally, but many are uneasy around her and find her blank stares and emotionless expression rather haunting.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I speak in an ethereal voice, and often my words slip into ancient dialects and riddled expressions.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> I know full well the destructive potential of evocation magic. These world-shattering spells must be kept as safeguarded secrets, to be used only in times of dire need.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> The other Academy Directors cannot match my absolute mastery of war magic. Their magic is but parlor tricks compared to the destructive power I command.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I often miss or completely ignore social cues, forgetting that other beings have opinions… or relevant thoughts.</p><p class=\"p3\">There is a rumor amongst many Academy students and even some faculty regarding Lasaia's origins. Students and faculty speculate that she came through the Elfgates when elves first arrived, and unlike the other elves of the world, the archmage knows exactly why and how they came. When Headmaster Rupert Greywell of Paradox Castle once confronted her on the topic in front of several observing students, Lasaia trapped him within a forcecage and classes were canceled. It is well-known that Lasaia has been trying to replace Rupert Greywell for some time and is seeking a good excuse to demote the care-free oaf. In the twisting unrealities of Paradox Castle, there sometimes appears a blue door with a gemstone knob in various locations throughout the school. The door leads to Lasaia's offices and lab, but students who have opened the door have found nothing but an eternal black void stretching out forever. Deep within this secret laboratory, Lasaia Nightbreeze has been working to unlock the full destructive power of delerium. She has assembled a sequestered team of brilliant evokers all sworn to absolute secrecy — the archmage has inscribed an explosive rune on the forehead of each wizard, which will slay them if they utter a single word of their great project outside her lab. Together, they have created the disjunction bomb, a horrifically devastating delerium-based weapon of mass destruction with the power to annihilate an entire city district. Now, they are working on even more powerful variants. One of the compelling outcomes of this research has been the potential for delerium to be used simply as a conventional power source which could unlock wondrous improvements into the lives of common folk, though such quotidian applications bore the archmage. She is convinced delerium is the next evolution of magic, not a frivolous tool.</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.</p><p>The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the Duration of the spell. An Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic works only against the violet layer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Red</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Orange</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</li>\n<li><strong>Yellow</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Green</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.</li>\n<li><strong>Blue</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Indigo</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\n<ul>\n<li>While this layer is in place, Spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a Daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Violet</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a Dispel Magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end Spells and magical Effects.</li>\n</ol>",
