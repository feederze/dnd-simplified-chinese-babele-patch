      "description": "<div><p>It is said that, in order to forge a connection with the sun, each step of this weapon's creation must be carried out exclusively in its <span>bright light</span>, during the hottest days of the year. Whether or not all crafters follow this practice, there's no denying the command that the wielder of this spear holds over the sun's radiant beams.</p><p>This spear has <strong>4 charges</strong> and regains <strong>all</strong> expended charges daily at dawn.</p><div><p><span><em><strong>Luminous Refraction. </strong></em></span>As an action while outside during the day, you can lift this spear towards the sky and expend <strong>1 charge</strong>, causing a beam of pure radiance to descend from the sun into the spear's crystal. The crystal splits the beam into your choice of 2 to 6 smaller beams, each of which targets a different creature you can see within <strong>30 feet</strong> of you. Each creature must make a <strong>DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</strong>, taking an amount of radiant damage dependent on how many beams you produce on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. If the larger beam is split into two, each smaller beam deals [[/r 6d6]] radiant damage. For each additional beam produced beyond the second, roll one fewer [[/r d6]] for each beam's damage.</p><div><p></p></div></div></div>"
