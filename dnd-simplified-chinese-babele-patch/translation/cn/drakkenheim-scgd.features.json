Refer to the Core Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing in this book for the apothecary spell list.</p><p><strong>Formula Book.</strong> You have a book or collection of notes that you study to prepare your apothecary spells, develop your esoteric theories, and record your occult practices. You may use your formula book as an arcane focus for your apothecary spells. You may describe this book any way you like. Some examples of your book's appearance include:</p><ul><li>A large leatherbound tome with yellowing pages bound shut with an iron lock</li><li>A scattered assortment of scribbled notes loosely held together by rope</li><li>A pristine journal with perfect edges and beautiful penmanship</li><li>A leather briefcase with two small golden locks</li><li>A medical bag with surgical symbols on the sides</li><li>A beat-up satchel slung over one shoulder with vials and bottles poking out of every pocket</li></ul><p>If the book is destroyed or lost, you can recreate it using inks and paper during a long rest.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know three cantrips of your choice from the apothecary spell list. You learn additional apothecary cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Apothecary table.</p><p><em><strong>Elementary Reformulation.</strong></em> Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one apothecary cantrip you know with another cantrip from the apothecary spell list.</p><p><strong>Preparing and Casting Spells.</strong> The Apothecary table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your apothecary spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your apothecary spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of apothecary spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the apothecary spell list. When you do so, choose a number of apothecary spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your apothecary level (minimum of one spell). A spell you prepare must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Apothecary table's Slot Level column for your level.</p><p>For example, if you are a 5th-level apothecary, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, in any combination. To cast the 1st-level spell<em> cure wounds</em>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of apothecary spells requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your apothecary spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and occult knowledge. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an apothecary spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p class=\"save-dc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p class=\"save-dc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><strong>Ritual Casting.</strong> You can cast an apothecary spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section of the Core Rules) as a spellcasting focus for your apothecary spells.</p>",

Mists swirl about you in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you, which moves with you. The area within the mists is lightly obscured.</p><p>Creatures who begin their turn in the mists must make an Intelligence saving throw. The save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. A creature who fails this saving throw takes 3d8 psychic damage and has its speed halved. Additionally, they cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn. When you manifest the mists, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected.</p>",

To look into them is as if floating through the cosmos lost in the void of space.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Your touch becomes cold as ice and your skin becomes pale. Some might think you undead or sickly. You appear as if you had died in the cold of space.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Your voice has a slight echoing nature to it. As if there is more than one entity speaking through you. Your own voice is most prominent but when listening carefully one can make out a chorus of celestial voices speaking through you.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You give off a faint smell of ozone — acrid and sulfuric, as if lightning had just struck nearby. It seems unnatural and otherworldly.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>You develop a third eye in the middle of your forehead that is unblinking, and seems to pierce into people's minds as it stares upon them.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Your veins glow with a soft radiant light, giving you the appearance of a walking constellation of stars and cosmic energy.</td></tr></tbody></table>",
