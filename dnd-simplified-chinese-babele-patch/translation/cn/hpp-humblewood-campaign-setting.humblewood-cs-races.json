      "description": "<p>Cervans are a versatile deer-like folk who make their homes in small, intimate villages throughout Humblewood. More insular than other humblefolk, cervans often reside deep in the most ancient parts of Humblewood’s vast forest, in tree stands and groves far from birdfolk perches.</p><h2>Hale and Hearty</h2><p>Cervans have a robust physique and are rarely sick. They are one of the longest-lived races among the humblefolk. Though their wariness has earned them a reputation as timid, cervans are cautious because they remain active and alert, and generally prefer practice to contemplation. Cervans like to pursue skills independently in order to give themselves a sense of purpose. This striving is what propels some cervans to posi- tions of great import throughout the Wood. A happy cervan is one who is hard at work.</p><h2>Wary and Practical</h2><p>One of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges. Even under such circumstances, cervans have maintained positions of leadership and delegated responsibilities to make sure that villages are run in accordance with the old cervan teachings, ensuring that work necessary for survival in the most remote villages is accomplished, so that all its inhabitants may be kept healthy and happy.</p><p>The ability to balance their innate caution with practical considerations is one of the cervans’ greatest strengths. Cervans teach that the best means of survival in any situation is to remain calm and weigh one’s options. The best cervan leaders favor this approach.</p><h2>The Sight</h2><p>Cervans have a unique ability to bounce back and survive a physical shock that might kill others. Occasionally, cervans who survive such traumas are granted mystical visions. Sometimes these are flashes of insight into the world around them, sometimes portents of doom, and other times visions of a far away future. Known among cervans as “The Sight”, this phenomenon is elusive, and out of the control of mortals. Cervans who have seen visions in this way are known as “The Sighted”, and after this initial event, some will suddenly find themselves receptive to visions of the past, present, and future.</p><p>A cervan whose Sight has been triggered is encouraged to hone it, so that they might take on the role of a seer within their village. However, these efforts aren’t always met with success. The Sight will sometimes visit a cervan only once in their lifetime, with no amount of training granting a glimpse of such visions again. This is believed to be for the best, as cervans acknowledge that those who are truly Sighted carry knowledge that can be both a blessing and a curse.</p><h2>The Blessing of Cairith</h2><p>While it’s not unusual for some cervans to have small antlers or buds visible on their heads, only rarely is a cervan born who can grow a full set of antlers. These cervans are a different subrace — pronghorns — and are thought to be specially blessed by their Amaranthine Cairith, a sacred spirit of life and growth believed to watch over all cervans. Unlike other subraces, pronghorn and grove cervans are the same people. The arrival of a pronghorn cervan is an event to cele- brate, as it can occur only once in a generation.</p><p> </p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Cervan-Priest-Mask.webp\" /><p> </p><h2>Cervan Traits </h2><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Cervans reach maturity around 12 years. They live long lives compared to the rest of the Humblefolk, between 100 and 150 years, something they attribute as much to their way of life as the blessing of Cairith. Pronghorns generally live longer than grove cervans, which is considered a sign of Cairith’s favor.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em>. Cervans are pragmatic in their thinking, and generally prefer to keep their philosophies flexible in order to prioritize what they believe is important for both themselves and their communities. They lean towards neutral alignments.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Grove cervans stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, and have light builds, weighing between 130 and 180 pounds. Pronghorn cervans are taller and tend toward heavier, more muscular builds, standing around<br />7 feet tall, and sometimes weighing over 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Practical</strong></em>. Cervans are eminently practical and like to spend their time learning useful skills for life in their woodland villages. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Athletics, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.</p><p><em><strong>Surge of Vigor</strong></em>. All cervans possess a great tenacity and will to survive, which allows them to bounce back from even the most devastating blows. If an attack deals over half of your current remaining hit points in damage, (even if your hit points are reduced to 0 by the attack) you immediately regain hit points equal to <strong>1d12 + your Constitution Modifier</strong>. You can’t use this feature again until you have completed a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk, and speak Cervan (Cervan has no written component).</p><p><em><strong>Subrace</strong></em>. There are two main subraces of cervans: Grove or Pronghorn. Choose one of these subraces. </p><h2>Grove Cervan Traits</h2><p>As a grove cervan, you are swift and agile, able to quickly maneuver out of harm’s way. You are also incredibly versatile, and can fulfill a variety of roles within a village or an adventuring party.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Swift</strong>. Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet. </p><p><em><strong>Standing Leap</strong></em>. Your base long jump is 30 feet, and your base high jump is 15 feet, with or without a running start.  </p><p><em><strong>Nimble Step</strong></em>. Opportunity attacks made against you are rolled with disadvantage.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Jerbeens are small mouse-like folk with long, furred tails that help them balance. In proportion to the rest of their body, a jerbeen’s legs are long and powerful. Jerbeens can be found in a variety of places across the Wood, usually forming their own communities within birdfolk perches and humblefolk villages. Seldom do they live alone. A jerbeen’s home can contain several generations, including extended family and cousins living together under one roof. Jerbeens have a strong sense of family and like to surround themselves with good company wherever they rest.</p><h2>Outsize Courage</h2><p>Jerbeens are the smallest inhabitants of Humblewood, dwarfed by nearly every kind of creature they encounter. While they are quick and nimble, and possess an affable attitude, they are not very strong, brave, or powerful on their own. When they stand with a group, jerbeens are emboldened: the presence of others reassures them, granting them the courage to face even the largest threats head on. They excel in team strategies, helping one another solve problems that could not be surmounted alone.</p><h2>Community First</h2><p>The communal slant of jerbeens stems from more than just their love of good company: jerbeen are kind and considerate creatures, known for their joviality and charm. Being small and not particularly strong gives them a perspective that allows them to easily empathize with others, though not all jerbeens share this compassionate outlook. Some respond to the dangers outside their community by becoming insular and fearing all non-jerbeens. Jerbeens value privacy, but true isolation from friends, families, or loved ones is considered to be the worst possible fate a jerbeen could suffer.</p><p> </p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Jerbeen-Swashbuckler.webp\" /><p> </p><h2>Jerbeen Traits</h2><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Dexterity increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Jerbeens grow quickly, reaching maturity around 5 years. They are the shortest lived of all the humblefolk races, living just about 40 years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em>. Being small and facing many threats in the world, jerbeens are sensitive to the feelings of others, and tend towards good alignments. They also lean more towards lawful alignments due to their co-operative nature.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Jerbeens have incredibly small and light bodies, standing between 2 and 3 feet tall, and weighing between 20 and 40 pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>.

You have advantage on Strength saving throws and saving throws against being frightened as long as you are within 5 feet of an ally who isn’t frightened or incapacitated that you can both see and hear.</p><p><em><strong>Team Tactics</strong></em>. You can use the Help action as a bonus action.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk and Jerbeen.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",

      "name": "Hedge",
      "description": "<p>The most diplomatic and good natured of all the humblefolk, hedges like to live quiet lives in villages throughout the Wood, or within the safety of birdfolk perches. They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures.</p><p>Despite their sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born of cowardice, their behavior stems from a desire to respect the feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be of utmost importance in hedge society.</p><h2>Sensitive and Kind</h2><p>Hedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement.</p><p>Hedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation, coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community.</p><p>One of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional wounds run deep with hedges.</p><h2>One With the Forest</h2><p>Gifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm, hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to the connection possessed by some gallus. This has granted hedges special magical gifts, such as the ability to speak with the smallest ground-dwelling creatures in the Wood, and the power to cause flowers to bloom. It is quite common for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share their home.</p><p>Hedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees. Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature, near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a few small gardens wherever they live.</p><h2>Dressed for Comfort</h2><p>Hedges need special consideration when wearing clothes, and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other clothes which fit easily over their quills. When not actively flared out, these tough quills naturally flatten, becoming smooth to the touch. However, if suddenly frightened, their quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can ruin a hedge’s clothing.</p><p>Adventuring clothes made specifically for hedges are available in nearly every major city in Humblewood, and tailors throughout the Wood are familiar with making alterations to suit a hedge’s needs.</p><p> </p><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Hedge-Bard.webp\" /><p> </p><h2>Hedge Traits</h2><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Hedges take longer to mature than most other races, reaching adulthood around 20 years. They also live for a long time, with many reaching 120 years or more.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em>. Hedges are compassionate, empathetic, and diplomatic, tending towards good alignments. They also favor neutral alignments, as hedges have a great respect for the balance of nature.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Hedges have short, rounded body shapes, standing between 3 and 4 feet in height, and weighing between 40 and 70 pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Natural Burrowers</strong></em>. You have a burrowing speed of 15 feet. You are capable of burrowing through soil, but are unable to dig through anything more substantial with just your clawed hands. </p><p><em><strong>Spiny Quills</strong></em>. The backs of hedges are covered with spiny quills, which makes it impossible for hedges to wear armor. These quills provide exceptional protection, therefore you have a <strong>base armor class of 14 + your Dexterity modifier</strong>. Even though you can’t wear armor, you can still benefit from the armor class bonus provided by shields so long as you are proficient with them.</p><p><em><strong>Curl Up</strong></em>. You can use your action to curl up, exposing attackers to a wall of your toughened quills. While curled up you cannot move, attack, or cast spells with somatic components, and your base armor class becomes 19. You cannot benefit from any Dexterity bonus to armor class while curled up, but you can still use shields.</p><p>Any creature that misses you with a melee attack while you are curled up takes [[/r 2d4]] points of piercing damage from your sharp quills. If a creature hits you while you are curled up, you are knocked &amp;Reference[Prone]{prone} in your space at the end of the turn. You may uncurl yourself at any point during your turn.</p><p><em><strong>Forest Magic</strong></em>. You have a deep connection to the magic of the Wood. You know the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.SbSvZKkJASyk8jKo]{Druidcraft} cantrip. Additionally, you can cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X8w9EzYLGc4vQ1H2]{Animal Messenger} as a 2nd level spell once with this trait, and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p><em><strong>Speak With Bugs</strong></em>. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with creatures of the beast subtype that represent insects, spiders, worms, and other creepy crawlies, regardless of their size.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk and Hedge.</p><p> </p>",

      "description": "<p>Vulpins are fox-like in appearance, with light builds and sharp fangs. One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn’t entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious. Sometimes their drive to succeed can make it difficult for them to empathize with others.</p><p>Vulpins feel just as deeply as other folk of the Wood, but they possess a keen survival instinct which sometimes causes them to take courses of action that are selfish. Moreover, they are sharp and savvy, possessing an uncanny force of personality that allows them to easily sway the trust of others. In the right situations, vulpins can be true friends, and in the wrong ones, deadly enemies.</p><h2>Artful and Cunning</h2><p>Vulpins are naturally intelligent, rivalled only by corvums. However, where corvums are studious, vulpins are more creative. They enjoy the arts and the pursuit of leisure. Some devote their lives to mastering an art form; learning sculpture, poetry, or refined swordplay. Even though vulpins come from every walk of life, they also have a reputation for being snob- bish and looking down on others.</p><p>All vulpins have a natural connection to the magic of the Wood, though they channel it in specialized ways. The right look from a vulpin can bewitch or terrify, and vulpins who are truly skilled can command an entire room through sheer force of presence.</p><h2>Prodigious Predators</h2><p>Before the Humblefolk Treaty was signed, vulpins controlled a large part of the Wood outside the influence of the birdfolk, and bands of vulpin raiders provided their own kin with a wealth of plundered goods at the expense of birdfolk and other humblefolk alike.</p><p>Those days are long since gone, but the memory of the sinister vulpin has yet to fade from the minds of the humblefolk, who endured great suffering at their hands.</p><p>A few vulpins have attempted to change public opinion, but the majority are unconcerned with their notoriety. Vulpins learn from a young age that they are of two natures: the sophisticated and the savage. While sophistication and elegance are generally preferred, it is considered common sense that vulpins should know when to keep their fangs hidden and when to bear them.</p><p> </p><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Vulpin-Noble.webp\" /><p> </p><h2>Vulpin Traits</h2><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>.

They reach adulthood at 15 years, and live well past 90 years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em>. Vulpins aren’t innately evil, but their difficulty empathizing with others means they are only rarely good aligned. Most vulpins find strict authority distasteful, preferring chaotic alignments over lawful ones.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Vulpins cut dashing figures and are usually lean and muscular. They stand between 4 and a half and 5 and a half feet tall, but are relatively lightweight, weighing between 90 and 140 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>.

Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.</p><h2>Touched</h2><p>To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.</p><p>These inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.</p><h2>Of Two Worlds</h2><p>While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends.</p><p>Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring the company of those who understand them rather than those who pass judgement.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Luma-Cleric-of-Ardea-Mask.webp\" /><p> </p><h2>Luma Traits</h2><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>.

    "Pronghorn Cervan": {
      "name": "Pronghorn Cervan",
      "description": "<p>Cervans are a versatile deer-like folk who make their homes in small, intimate villages throughout Humblewood. More insular than other humblefolk, cervans often reside deep in the most ancient parts of Humblewood’s vast forest, in tree stands and groves far from birdfolk perches.</p><h2>Hale and Hearty</h2><p>Cervans have a robust physique and are rarely sick. They are one of the longest-lived races among the humblefolk. Though their wariness has earned them a reputation as timid, cervans are cautious because they remain active and alert, and generally prefer practice to contemplation. Cervans like to pursue skills independently in order to give themselves a sense of purpose. This striving is what propels some cervans to posi- tions of great import throughout the Wood. A happy cervan is one who is hard at work.</p><h2>Wary and Practical</h2><p>One of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges. Even under such circumstances, cervans have maintained positions of leadership and delegated responsibilities to make sure that villages are run in accordance with the old cervan teachings, ensuring that work necessary for survival in the most remote villages is accomplished, so that all its inhabitants may be kept healthy and happy.</p><p>The ability to balance their innate caution with practical considerations is one of the cervans’ greatest strengths. Cervans teach that the best means of survival in any situation is to remain calm and weigh one’s options. The best cervan leaders favor this approach.</p><h2>The Sight</h2><p>Cervans have a unique ability to bounce back and survive a physical shock that might kill others. Occasionally, cervans who survive such traumas are granted mystical visions. Sometimes these are flashes of insight into the world around them, sometimes portents of doom, and other times visions of a far away future. Known among cervans as “The Sight”, this phenomenon is elusive, and out of the control of mortals. Cervans who have seen visions in this way are known as “The Sighted”, and after this initial event, some will suddenly find themselves receptive to visions of the past, present, and future.</p><p>A cervan whose Sight has been triggered is encouraged to hone it, so that they might take on the role of a seer within their village. However, these efforts aren’t always met with success. The Sight will sometimes visit a cervan only once in their lifetime, with no amount of training granting a glimpse of such visions again. This is believed to be for the best, as cervans acknowledge that those who are truly Sighted carry knowledge that can be both a blessing and a curse.</p><h2>The Blessing of Cairith</h2><p>While it’s not unusual for some cervans to have small antlers or buds visible on their heads, only rarely is a cervan born who can grow a full set of antlers. These cervans are a different subrace — pronghorns — and are thought to be specially blessed by their Amaranthine Cairith, a sacred spirit of life and growth believed to watch over all cervans. Unlike other subraces, pronghorn and grove cervans are the same people. The arrival of a pronghorn cervan is an event to celebrate, as it can occur only once in a generation.</p><h2>Cervan Traits </h2><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Cervans reach maturity around 12 years. They live long lives compared to the rest of the Humblefolk, between 100 and 150 years, something they attribute as much to their way of life as the blessing of Cairith. Pronghorns generally live longer than grove cervans, which is considered a sign of Cairith’s favor.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em>. Cervans are pragmatic in their thinking, and generally prefer to keep their philosophies flexible in order to prioritize what they believe is important for both themselves and their communities. They lean towards neutral alignments.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Grove cervans stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, and have light builds, weighing between 130 and 180 pounds. Pronghorn cervans are taller and tend toward heavier, more muscular builds, standing around<br />7 feet tall, and sometimes weighing over 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Practical</strong></em>. Cervans are eminently practical and like to spend their time learning useful skills for life in their woodland villages. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Athletics, Medicine, Nature, or Survival.</p><p><em><strong>Surge of Vigor</strong></em>. All cervans possess a great tenacity and will to survive, which allows them to bounce back from even the most devastating blows. If an attack deals over half of your current remaining hit points in damage, (even if your hit points are reduced to 0 by the attack) you immediately regain hit points equal to <strong>1d12 + your Constitution Modifier</strong>. You can’t use this feature again until you have completed a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk, and speak Cervan (Cervan has no written component).</p><p><em><strong>Subrace</strong></em>. There are two main subraces of cervans: Grove or Pronghorn. Choose one of these subraces. </p><h2>Pronghorn Cervan Traits</h2><p>As a pronghorn cervan, you were born larger and stronger than others in the community and found yourself laden with expectations from a very young age. It is up to you whether you embrace your position of privilege, or rebel against the constraints thrust upon you by cervan society.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Strength score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Robust Build</strong></em>. Your carrying capacity is doubled, as is the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p><p><em><strong>Antlers</strong></em>. You have a set of large, strong antlers that can be used to make devastating charge attacks. You can use your unarmed strike to gore opponents, dealing <strong>1d6 + your Strength Modifier</strong> piercing damage on a hit. </p><p>Additionally, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line towards an opponent, you can spend a bonus action to charge them, dealing an extra [[/r 1d6]] points of piercing damage. If the target of your charge is Large or smaller, they must make a <strong>Strength saving throw</strong> against a DC of your Proficiency Bonus + 8 + your Strength Modifier. On failure, the target is pushed 10 feet away from you into a space of your choice.</p>",

Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.</p><h2>Touched</h2><p>To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.</p><p>These inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.</p><h2>Of Two Worlds</h2><p>While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends.</p><p>Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities.

They are crafty, hearty, and tough, but their true strength lies in the potential they see when looking at the world around them. Mapachs have incredibly light hands and a great degree of fine motor control that doesn’t diminish with age. They are also adept at climbing and sneaking. This, combined with their love of trinkets, has earned them an undeserved reputation as thieves. While there are exceptions, most mapachs are quite good-natured, if a little eccentric.</p><h2>Resilient Opportunists</h2><p>Mapachs are adept at surviving tough woodland conditions, and at intuiting the right course of action when faced with a problem. They are also inveterate opportunists. Some may consider them brash, but mapachs know that opportu- nities rarely present themselves and are quick to act on them. Mapachs are alert and have a keen awareness of their surroundings. Only the truly foolhardy among them are taken in by obvious traps.</p><h2>Canny Craftspeople</h2><p>One of the traits mapachs are most well-known for is their ability to find a use for just about anything. This knack for creating functional or useful items out of debris, junk, or on-hand materials is known as “scroungecraft”, and is a cultural staple among mapachs. This activity is considered an art form among mapachs, on par with the high art of other peoples. Scroungecrafting demonstrates creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness, but is misunderstood by outsiders who see it as primitive or crude. Genius ideas created by mapach hands frequently began as scroungecraft prototypes. Many who have built such interesting or unique creations achieve celebrity status among mapachs, going on to showcase their skills in loosely-organized scroungecraft fairs.</p><h2>Hubs of Invention</h2><p>Mapachs are often loners, but when they do establish communities with humblefolk or birdfolk, they have a habit of fostering innovation wherever they go. Mapach ingenuity was responsible for the contraption upon which Alderheart’s pulley system was based.

Mapachs stand between 4 and 5 feet tall, and encompass a variety of builds from svelt to wide, weighing between 90 and 160 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision</strong></em>. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Mapachs are most comfortable under the cloak of night.</p><p><em><strong>Expert Climbers</strong></em>. You have a climb speed of 20 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Resilience. </strong></em>You have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage.</p><p><em><strong>Scroungecraft.  </strong></em>You are proficient with tinker’s tools. Additionally, you have the ability to construct crude but functional versions of common items using materials present in your surroundings. You may spend 10 minutes to craft these materials into any tool or piece of adventuring gear worth 30 gold pieces or less. The item will be completely functional, even capable of passing for a disguise (if you crafted an article of clothing). Tools, along with any other item that would logically break on its first use (caltrops, arrows), will become useless afterward. Scroungecrafted items will otherwise last 1 hour before falling apart.<br /> <br />Depending on the materials available, a Game Master (GM) may rule that you cannot craft an item in this way. For example, a vial of acid might be easy to make if you happen to be near a nest of acidic beetle larvae, or bark can be bound into a makeshift flask, but it would be difficult to create a passable facsimile of silken robes from a pile of leaves.</p><p>Should you have access to the proper materials, you can spend 8 hours converting an item you have scroungecrafted in this way into a permanent version, so long as you start this process before the item falls apart. Items crafted in such a way will function exactly as a normal version of the item, and if you have proficiency in the tools used to craft them, they can even look professionally-crafted. Otherwise, they retain a rather rough, cobbled-together appearance. </p><p>You can also use scroungecraft to repair broken equipment, provided you have the materials on hand. Though, how long your repairs hold together is up to the GM.</p><p><em><strong>Skulker.</strong></em> You have advantage on Stealth checks made in dim light and darkness.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Birdfolk and Mapach.</p><p> </p><p> </p>",
