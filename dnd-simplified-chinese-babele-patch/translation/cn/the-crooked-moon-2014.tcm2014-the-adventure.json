After all, you came here to roll the dice yourself. No sir, you and I are just a couple of sinners. The only difference between us is that you have nothing, and I have exactly what your heart desires. Now won’t you go ahead and shake this humble sinner’s hand?”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\"><em><strong>- Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p4\">Murkwater Bend is one hell of a place to make your fortune. Prosperity and riches of all varieties come easy to the free folk who call the lawless swamp town on stilts home. But the misfortune that follows comes just as easily, the sinister cost of the deals made with Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner—a crocodilian gambler and magician.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The treacherous swamp known as the Drowned Crossroads sits at the lowest point of Wickermoor Hollow. The people of the stilt-town of Murkwater Bend favor freedom and vice, enjoying the natural separation from the strict laws and social customs that govern the valley’s other regions.</p><p class=\"p7\">Years ago, a sudden strike of prosperity came to Murkwater Bend, with gold flowing freely and luck seemingly being on the side of the swamp-folk. People came from all over Wickermoor Hollow in hopes of finding their own fortune in the bayou.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\">But luck doesn’t hold out forever, and the good times were not meant to last. In recent years, the people of Murkwater Bend have been struck with terrible misfortunes, and some whisper of the whole swamp being jinxed. Instances of accidents, disease, and financial ruin have increased dramatically, with no end to the bad luck in sight.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Even worse, the hex has brought the Drowned Crossroads to unnatural life, with the swamp itself rising up to drag unsuspecting travelers into its murky depths. In the Midnight Hour, haunting brass music can be heard throughout the mire, and the distant lights of a ghastly riverboat drift through the gloom, always just out of reach.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Murkwater Bend is jinxed, and its people are being swindled into bad deals that cost them their very souls. Characters drawn to the town by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Find a cure for Adela Druskenvald, whose hand is afflicted with a withering hex.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Discover the source of the town’s misfortune by treating with Vander Boone.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">Brave the Drowned Crossroads to find Mister Crossroads, then make a bargain with him or purchase his wares to earn passage aboard the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> riverboat.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Disrupt the soul-powered boiler in the riverboat’s Boiler Room.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Mister Crossroads, the key NPC, to weave his sly malevolence throughout. Study the rules to Liar’s Dice (see “Test of Luck” later in the chapter) to efficiently oversee tense games of chance. Carefully read through the list of Dark Bargains<span class=\"s8\">*</span>, Cursed Curios<span class=\"s8\">*</span>, Paranormal Potions<span class=\"s8\">*</span>, and Familiars<span class=\"s8\">*</span> to make the meeting with Mister Crossroads in his Sinner’s shack as enticing as possible. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “Bayou Boogie,” ensures a thrilling final encounter filled with twists and turns.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 6 characters.</p>",

Now won’t you go ahead and shake this humble sinner’s hand?”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>- Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner -</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Murkwater Bend is one hell of a place to make your fortune. Prosperity and riches of all varieties come easy to the free folk who call the lawless swamp town on stilts home. But the misfortune that follows comes just as easily, the sinister cost of the deals made with Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner—a crocodilian gambler and magician.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>The treacherous swamp known as the Drowned Crossroads sits at the lowest point of Wickermoor Hollow. The people of the stilt-town of Murkwater Bend favor freedom and vice, enjoying the natural separation from the strict laws and social customs that govern the valley’s other regions.</p><p>Years ago, a sudden strike of prosperity came to Murkwater Bend, with gold flowing freely and luck seemingly being on the side of the swamp-folk. People came from all over Wickermoor Hollow in hopes of finding their own fortune in the bayou.</p><p>But luck doesn’t hold out forever, and the good times were not meant to last. In recent years, the people of Murkwater Bend have been struck with terrible misfortunes, and some whisper of the whole swamp being jinxed. Instances of accidents, disease, and financial ruin have increased dramatically, with no end to the bad luck in sight.</p><p>Even worse, the hex has brought the Drowned Crossroads to unnatural life, with the swamp itself rising up to drag unsuspecting travelers into its murky depths. In the Midnight Hour, haunting brass music can be heard throughout the mire, and the distant lights of a ghastly riverboat drift through the gloom, always just out of reach.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Murkwater Bend is jinxed, and its people are being swindled into bad deals that cost them their very souls. Characters drawn to the town by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p>Find a cure for Adela Druskenvald, whose hand is afflicted with a withering hex.</p></li><li><p>Discover the source of the town’s misfortune by treating with Vander Boone.</p></li><li><p>Brave the Drowned Crossroads to find Mister Crossroads, then make a bargain with him or purchase his wares to earn passage aboard the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> riverboat.</p></li><li><p>Disrupt the soul-powered boiler in the riverboat’s Boiler Room.</p></li><li><p>Destroy Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Mister Crossroads, the key NPC, to weave his sly malevolence throughout. Study the rules to Liar’s Dice (see “Test of Luck” later in the chapter) to efficiently oversee tense games of chance. Carefully read through the list of Dark Bargains*, Cursed Curios*, Paranormal Potions*, and Familiars* to make the meeting with Mister Crossroads in his Sinner’s shack as enticing as possible. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “Bayou Boogie,” ensures a thrilling final encounter filled with twists and turns.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 6th level characters.</p></div>"

The crocodile-folk himself was only able to survive through the fate-bending power of his patron, an ancient death spirit known as Snake Eye Jack. Leaving the sea behind, he found himself bouncing between bounty hunts and other dangerous jobs armed with his patron’s jinxcraft and the sigil-etched cutlass that once gave him his piratical moniker.</p><p>In time, he made a home in the swamp, known as the Drowned Crossroads, feeling at ease around the scoundrels that lurked within. The rogues of the swamp did not care for the crocodile man, and the common folk of the bayou feared his strange magic and garishly hexed sword. They even coined ugly legends about him that claimed he devoured children and stole souls.</p><p>Work dried up, attempted cons and thievery failed, and Briggsy found himself penniless, purposeless, and reviled. This potent cocktail of isolation, resentment, and bad luck made him deeply resent his patron, believing that Snake Eye Jack had turned his back on Briggsy despite the years of service. Through the bitterness, the cunning croc-folk came up with a plan.</p><p>One night at the Midnight Hour, Briggsy rowed into the bayou and tossed his hexed cutlass overboard at the exact point where the two ancient roads had once crossed centuries ago. This offering summoned Snake Eye Jack, a many-armed man of shadow and bone with serpents’ eyes glowing a neon green and pink. Briggsy challenged his patron to a game of dice, making an offer the death spirit could not refuse.</p><p>The pair diced all night, and through Briggsy’s guile and treachery, he beat Snake Eye Jack and bound him in a hexed coffin. Claiming the full power of his former patron for himself, the croc-folk became a master of misfortune and jinxcraft, conjuring forth a magical blunderbuss with his new abilities. However, the cost was great. His body rotted as if he had been dead for weeks, and his left arm withered to bone.</p><p>Briggsy didn't mind. He moved into an abandoned shack on stilts at the heart of the swamp and decided to become what the people of Murkwater Bend believed him to be: the bogeyman of the Drowned Crossroads.</p><h2>Heart’s Desire</h2><p>From then on, Briggsy called himself Mister Crossroads, but many of the folk who called upon him for favors and charms dubbed him the Grinning Sinner after his crocodile smile and tricksy magic. People of the swamp come to Mister Crossroads for simple jinxes and curses, but the croc-folk’s favorite “associates” are the truly desperate.</p><p>He makes deals with these unfortunate souls, whether they're someone trying to escape a hell of their own making or in search of their wildest dreams. Shortly after sealing the pact through a signed contract or a simple handshake, the luck of the new victim would turn around, and they would get exactly what Mister Crossroads promised.</p><p>But the Grinning Sinner is clever, and there are always loopholes in every deal. After weeks, months, or even years, the luck runs out, and the joy and fortune granted by the jinxcraft turns to ash. Eventually, each and every one of them experiences a terrible misfortune that costs them their life and grants their soul to Mister Crossroads, which he uses to fuel the soul-binding magic that keeps Snake Eye Jack bound within his hexed coffin. As added insult, their lifeless corpse rises as an Undead thrall to join his crew of the damned.</p><h2>Captain of the Damned</h2><p>When Mister Crossroads isn't making deals in his swamp shack, he captains the opulent <em>Dead Man’s Hand </em>riverboat, which thrums with his jinxcraft power. Acquired from a foolish gambler—Elias—the riverboat moves about the Drowned Crossroads, mooring at random locations each night, only able to be found by those who have made a deal with Mister Crossroads.</p><p>Keeping the riverboat fueled and Snake Eye Jack bound requires a constant supply of damned souls. His most recent and precious catch is Adela Druskenvald herself, who made a foolish bargain with Mister Crossroads in desperation to avoid her most terrifying visions and prophecies of calamity. The Grinning Sinner’s current target and most vexing foe is Vander Boone, the self-proclaimed “Bayou King” of the Drowned Crossroads (described in “NPCs of the Drowned Crossroads” below).</p><p>Between Elias’s riverboat, Adela’s powerful soul, and Vander’s large following, Mister Crossroads hopes to stack his crew with hundreds of new corpses and stock up on enough soul-stuff to keep Snake Eye Jack imprisoned forever.</p><p>These grand schemes are motivated by fear and doubt. He knows that, should his former patron ever break free, his own doom would come swiftly, and the soul he traded to Snake Eye Jack many years ago would be tormented for all time.</p></div>"

Within Wickermoor Hollow, Crossroaders are often labeled as scoundrels, thieves, or gamblers—and many are—but most swamp-folk are regular fisherfolk, traders, hunters, trappers, and artisans who’ve learned the secret ways of surviving in the wetlands. Some important swamp-dwelling characters in this adventure are featured below.</p><h2>Elias Greaves</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin-left:10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Elias_Greaves.webp\" alt=\"\" height=\"330\" /><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.ib9r1CCX6ZBZo3kY]{Elias (eh-LYE-us) Greaves}</strong> was a gambler from the world of the living who dreamt of wealth and influence far beyond his station. Seemingly blessed by Lady Luck herself, he won big at every gambling hall he visited, eventually growing bored and craving a new challenge. He found a way to board the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> and travel to Druskenvald, where he met Phillip and Adela.</p><p>Despite his powerful new friends, his luck ran out in the lands of death, and his fortune was quickly spent. Soon, he was stuck playing low stakes games aboard the<em> Laughlin Lullaby</em>, a riverboat that traveled up and down the Silverbell River in Wickermoor Hollow. In desperation, he made a deal with Mister Crossroads to turn his luck around.</p><p>After shaking the croc-folk’s hand, his luck instantly turned around, and he even won ownership of the riverboat in a poker bet. He renamed it <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> in reference to the skeletal left hand of his new patron. The gambler enjoyed years of prosperity, but as always, the Grinning Sinner exploited the man’s greed and the fine print in the deal, and it all came crashing down.</p><p>When Mister Crossroads came to collect, he claimed Elias’s soul, his walking corpse, and the fine riverboat, which the trickster turned into his base of operations. He then threw the gambler’s spirit into a soulfire boiler to power the hexes that kept Snake Eye Jack imprisoned in the jinxed coffin. Elias was special. As a living soul who traveled aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, his spirit would burn bright and long, keeping the Grinning Sinner’s game going for years.</p><p>Elias’s shambling corpse mindlessly serves aboard the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>, but it was recently reawakened when his old friend Adela Druskenvald made a deal with Mister Crossroads. A fragment of his soul stirred in his withered hand, which ripped free from the animated corpse and crawled through the swamp in search of help against the Grinning Sinner.</p><h2>Vander Boone, the Bayou King</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin-right:10px;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Vander_Boone.webp\" alt=\"\" height=\"330\" /><p>Folk often come to Murkwater Bend to trade or scheme, but prize fights draw in the largest crowds. <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.hNSeGmhZIKX0Gsrk]{Vander Boone}</strong> (chaotic neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY]{Bandit Captain}</strong>) was one such prize fighter, a brigand-turned-boxer renowned throughout the swamps. He was popular and successful, but he longed for more. He wanted real power, real control, and real respect.</p><p>One night, just short of a year ago, Vander met Mister Crossroads and asked for the power to rule the Drowned Crossroads. All would pay tribute to him and seek his approval. But when the Grinning Sinner extended his hand, Vander pulled back, shook his head, and told Mister Crossroads he would do it himself. The flabbergasted croc-folk swore that Boone would regret his decision as he walked away.</p><p>Vander has declared himself the Bayou King and named himself the protector of the Drowned Crossroads. He has amassed a small legion of small-time thugs, decked them out in stylish purple-and-black uniforms with his prize money, and created a protection racket in Murkwater Bend. Unlike most bandit captains, however, Vander has proved to be a surprisingly canny leader. He understands the motivations of the countless rogues within the town and strives to keep them in balance.</p><p>He was surprised when everyone readily paid his taxes, leaving him with the job of managing the town while maintaining its lawlessness as much as possible. Recently, however, the Grinning Sinner has sent his Undead crew across the swamp to hunt down the Bayou King. Vander’s crew clashes with Mr. Crossroads’ minions nearly every night, and though the Bayou King has been steadily losing ground and has retreated to his fort in Murkwater Bend, his noble defense of the village has made him more beloved than ever.</p><h2>Lyla Webb</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Lyla_Webb.webp\" alt=\"\" height=\"330\" /><p>A native of the Drowned Crossroads born to a family of fisherfolk, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.iL29vgKsKdohKFyf]{Lyla (LYE-luh) Webb }</strong>(chaotic good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{Priest}</strong>) had dreams that were much bigger than a life of catching catfish.

She learned their ways and became a skilled jinxcraft practitioner, using her magical abilities to help the people of the bayou as well as aid her work as a trader.</p><p>Now an adult, she has become a shrewd and resourceful businesswoman who has numerous contacts throughout the Drowned Crossroads and a knack for fencing stolen goods that the rogues of the swamp bring her.

Dressed in a black fur coat, wide brimmed hat, and long woolen gloves, she is clearly trying to seem incognito despite just how out of place her outfit is.

Following the events in Foxwillow, she had offered to join the pilgrims of the Patient Lady to help the townsfolk start rebuilding their lives after the destruction of Raum. However, this was a lie so she could secretly go to the Drowned Crossroads after a terrifying vision and prophecy. She’s just returned from her trip after making a deal with Mister Crossroads.</p><p>The prophecy stated, “You and your king shall leave this place on ashen winds when the Crooked Moon snarls with rage and not a night before,” which shook her to the core. In desperation, she secretly sought out the magician in the swamp after hearing tales from her new confidant Gaston Doray.</p><p>Mister Crossroads promised that Phillip’s power would return when it was time to leave the valley, and all it cost was her wedding ring. In desperation, she accepted. After leaving the Drowned Crossroads, she had forgotten the path she took to get there, and her entire left arm began withering away. This affliction can only be reversed if her wedding ring is recovered and returned to her finger or if Mr. Crossroads is killed, though Adela doesn't know this.</p><p>She pleads with the characters to head to the swamp and find a cure for her arm, offering them [[/award 150gp]] each in return. She also asks them to keep the arrangement secret and to not tell Phillip, promising an extra 50 gp each for their discretion.</p><p>After the characters are finished talking to Adela, she leaves to return to the Druskenvald Estate, telling them that she must keep up appearances so Phillip doesn’t worry.

Lose, you owe it to your king to kill that jinxed crocodile.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><h3><strong>Victory or Defeat</strong></h3><p>Resolve the game’s outcome quickly to move things along or draw it out with cross talk at the table to increase the tension (see \"Liar's Dice Rules\" below).</p><p><em><strong>Victory.</strong></em> If one of the characters wins the game, the Bayou King smiles proudly and asks the characters how much they’re being paid. If they honestly reply that Adela is paying them [[/award 150gp]] apiece ([[/award 200gp]] if sworn to secrecy), he scowls at the price but accedes to pay them that upon delivering proof of the Grinning Sinner’s demise.</p><p>If they lie about the price, they must succeed on a [[/check DEC DC 15]] check to convince him. Naming a price of [[/award 300gp]] apiece or higher imposes disadvantage on this check. On a success, he agrees to pay whatever price they name, up to a maximum of [[/award 300gp]].</p><p><em><strong>Defeat.</strong></em> If the Bayou King or Lyla wins, Vander smiles and shakes his head. He admits the characters may not have the luck of a master gambler but believes that they may have enough moxie to muscle through. After all, they owe him now to kill the Grinning Sinner.</p><p><em><strong>Time to Rest.</strong></em> After the game, Vander lets the characters rest in the fort, offering a small room to share with enough bedding for all of them. Before retiring for the evening, he invites the characters to eat and drink with him, providing an opportunity for the characters to learn more about the Bayou King, the Drowned Crossroads, and the Grinning Sinner. The downtime of the dice game and remaining evening are enough for the characters to take a long rest.</p><h2>Screams in the Night</h2><p>After the characters bid goodnight and retire, they’re jolted awake by piercing screams echoing through the fort. The Grinning Sinner’s Undead thralls have infiltrated Murkwater Bend, scaling the fort walls. When the characters reach the throne room, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Outside, shrieks split the night air as the throne room descends into chaos. The Bayou King’s scoundrels scramble for weapons, casting fearful glances toward the door. Suddenly, it flies open, and a blood-streaked sentry stumbles in, gasping, “They’re here… Over the wall…” before collapsing in a heap.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Vander Boone turns to you, his voice a fierce growl: “Get outta’ here! Take the north road and head to the Sinner’s shack. Keep running ‘til you hear his cursed strings playin’ in the swamp. Board his riverboat, cut that grinnin’ croc down, and end this nightmare!”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The Bayou King will hear no protest. If the characters enter the village’s streets and fight, even against his wishes, you can draw your own map of the streets and challenge them with four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.IyIybE5t2adMEVUM]{Ghasts}</strong> led by a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Wou9MoWctZhNBzi0]{Ferryman}</strong>*. Another similar group arrives on initiative count 20 of the fifth and tenth rounds of combat. Staying to fight is foolish, and Lyla Webb joins the fray to spur them on to defeat Mister Crossroads and free Snake Eye Jack.</p><p>Otherwise, the characters flee as the town dissolves into a frenzied melee. Waves of the living dead stagger through the streets, their hollow eyes seeking only to kill. Amid the chaos, the characters slip past the carnage unscathed and take the north road, where wooden walkways give way to a soggy, mud-choked path leading into the stinking mire.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_DROWN_Screams%20in%20the%20Night_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/design/border-section-top-horned.webp\" height=\"55\" style=\"margin:10px auto;border:none\" /><h1><strong>Liar's Dice Rules</strong></h1><div style=\"max-width:750px;margin:0 auto;font-size:1.05em;text-align:justify;text-indent:2em\"><p>The rules of Liar’s Dice are simple, and Lyla is content to explain them to the characters if they’re unfamiliar. The players in this game are Vander, Lyla, and the characters.</p><ul><li><p>Each player has a set of five 6-sided dice, and each round they roll them in secret and look at their own dice (rolling in cups is recommended).</p></li><li><p>1s are considered wild and can be used as any number. For instance, a player with two 4s and two 1s would actually have four 4s.</p></li><li><p>The first player (starting with Vander in round one) makes a bid on how many dice of a certain face were rolled by all players in total. For example, Vander starts by safely bidding “two 2s”.</p></li><li><p>After each bid, the next player to the left can challenge the bid, and all players reveal their dice. If the challenged player overbid, they lose a die for the rest of the game. For example, if there was only a single 2 showing between all players (unlikely, but possible), Vander would permanently lose a die in all future rounds. If the challenged player did not overbid (if there were two or more 2s for example), the challenging player permanently loses a die for the rest of the game instead. Once the challenge is resolved, players reroll their dice, and the player who lost a die makes the first bid in the new round.</p></li><li><p>If the next player to the left doesn’t wish to challenge, they must raise either the number of dice (“three 2s”), the face (“two 3s”), or both (“four 4s”). There is no limit to how high either number can be raised in the next bid, other than the natural cap of 6 for the face portion of the bid.</p></li><li><p>This process of bidding and challenging continues around clockwise with play always passing to the next player on the left.</p></li><li><p>When a player loses all five of their dice, they are eliminated from the game.</p></li><li><p>The winner of the game is the last person with any dice remaining.</p></li></ul><p>You will know both Vander and Lyla’s dice. That’s okay—they know how to communicate under the table to gain an advantage.</p><p><em><strong>Special Rules.</strong></em> Characters with certain skill proficiencies can manipulate the game to their advantage, letting the characters be better gamblers than their players. Show the players the following rules.</p><p>If you have proficiency in the listed skill or tool, you can use that special trait on your turn. You can use any combination of these traits up to a total of three times during the game:</p><p><strong>Hard Read (Insight).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, one opponent of your choice must reveal their dice to you, and only you.</p><p><strong>Deft Hands (Sleight of Hand).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, you can change one of your dice to any number.</p><p><strong>Sly Reveal (Stealth).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, show your dice to one opponent. They can choose to show you theirs.</p><p><strong>Poker Face (Deception).</strong> When an opponent challenges a bid you made this turn, you can succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check against DC 15 or the other player’s Wisdom score, whichever is higher, to make them balk and withdraw their challenge.</p><p><strong>Daring Dicer (Gaming Set: Dice).</strong> Immediately after rolling your dice, you may change any number of your dice to the face of your choice.</p><p><strong>Fated Luck (Any).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, you can reroll all of your remaining dice.</p></div><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><h3>Variant: Quick Liar’s Dice</h3><p>If you’d prefer an alternative to playing a game of Liar’s Dice within your game session, you can leave the game to ability checks using tools.</p><p>Using the guidance in the gaming set tool, you can call for [[/check WIS DC 20]] checks using proficiency with dice to determine the winner of the game. Any gambler who fails to meet or exceed 20 loses, and if multiple gamblers succeed on the check, the gambler with the highest total wins.</p><p>To add a bit more nuance, you can allow Charisma (Deception) checks using the dice instead, with advantage if the player has proficiency with both dice and the Deception skill.</p></aside></div>"

Upon entering the Captain’s Quarters (area B8), the ship warps into a grand, garish arena—the stage set for a final showdown with Mister Crossroads.</p><h2>Dead Man’s Hand Features</h2><p>Areas within the riverboat casino have the following features unless its description says otherwise:</p><p><strong>Lighting.</strong> Exterior areas have dim light shed by paper lanterns and glowing jinxcraft sigils etched all over the exterior of the riverboat. Interior areas have bright light from chandeliers and mirrored walls. All of these lights glow with vibrant neon colors and are fueled by burning soulfire that the Grinning Sinner has collected; a character who succeeds on a [[/check ARC DC 15]] or [[/check REL DC 15]] check realizes this.</p><p><strong>Music.</strong> Bright and upbeat jazz music plays throughout the entire riverboat, magically projecting from the band that plays in the Gambling Hall (see area B3). It is surprisingly catchy, no matter one’s musical tastes. Creatures who can hear the music have disadvantage on saving throws to maintain concentration.</p><p><strong>Jinxcraft Sigils. </strong>Every location has glowing jinxcraft sigils etched into the walls, floors, and ceilings that keep Snake Eye Jack imprisoned and use his spectral essence to fuel the operations of the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>. This fills the riverboat with his power over luck, both good and bad. Attack rolls score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20, and they automatically miss on a roll of 1 or 2. This is cumulative with features such as a champion fighter’s Improved Critical (who would score critical hits on a roll of 18, 19, or 20).</p><p><strong>Gamblers.</strong> Dozens of people from across Wickermoor Hollow and the rest of Druskenvald sit at casino tables, playing cards or dice or betting on enchanted horse figurines made to race, or they mingle at the ship’s well-stocked bar. They are all cursed—enthralled by the seductive power of the casino. They are friendly and happily lead characters around and share their favorite games, but they know little about the ship or its campaign and direct them to ask the Undead casino staff (who they seem to think are still living people). Gamblers become hostile to anyone who interferes in their games.</p><p><strong>Curse of the High Roller.</strong> When a character who isn’t yet cursed by the casino finishes a game of chance here, they must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 8]] saving throw or be cursed and &amp;reference[charmed apply=false] by the Grinning Sinner. While charmed in this way, they are enthralled and want nothing more but to gamble, drink, flirt with patrons, and otherwise keep enjoying the area of the casino they’re currently in. They can repeat this saving throw after 10 minutes, ending the effect on a success. A character who fails two of these repeat saves in a row becomes fully captivated, makes no more saving throws, and has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws made to harm casino patrons or otherwise disrupt the convivial atmosphere of the riverboat while cursed. The curse is then permanent until broken by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse} </em>spell or similar magic, or if the Grinning Sinner damages the character, forces them to make a saving throw, or dies.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/15-2_Dead_Mans_Hand.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>Dead Man's Hand Locations</h2><p>The following areas are found on map 15.2.</p></div>"

Undead laborers shuffle about, mending broken pipes, hauling crates, and carrying out the grim tasks required to keep this sinister casino running. Trapped within the boiler lies the tormented soul of Elias Greaves. Freeing him releases Elias from the Grinning Sinner’s grip, granting the characters a powerful advantage and cutting off the soul-fueled hexes that bind Snake Eye Jack, signaling Mister Crossroads’ inevitable downfall.</p><p>However, the disruption immediately alerts the Sinner to the characters’ presence (see “Don’t Grieve for Greaves” below).</p><p><em><strong>Soulfire Boiler.</strong></em> This coffin-shaped, sigil-etched boiler is tended by a mighty spirit called the Soulfire Engineer (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ET4PEVEiNJLU4f7c]{Wraith}</strong>). She serves the Grinning Sinner by incanting jinxcraft hexes that eternally regenerate Elias’s soul to keep the magenta soulfire burning. She demands the characters leave if they enter the boiler room and attacks if they remain or retaliate. When initiative is rolled, the boiler belches forth 5 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PuPo4H4Dcxigf0fY]{Specters}</strong> and a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.MpKdd5Ma6eTYH4TG]{Soulfire Stoker}</strong>*, and they join the fight.</p><p><em><strong>Blasting Furnace.</strong></em> When combat breaks out here, the flames in the boiler blaze and belch out through the furnace doors and gaps in the plating. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), creatures in the room must make a [[/save DEX DC 13]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 2d6 fire]]{7 (2d6)} fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

If a character is attuned to the hand, this does not break the attunement.</p><p>He runs to meet the characters while they are still in the belly of the ship and wearily thanks the characters for freeing his soul. He answers any questions they may have about who he is, what happened to him, what he knows about Mister Crossroads and Snake Eye Jack, and how the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> came into his possession (see \"NPCs of the Drowned Crossroads\" earlier in this chapter).</p><p>Through the awakening of his hand, he deduced the Grinning Sinner’s plan in his deal with Adela Druskenvald. He knows his own soul was able to power the boiler because he traveled aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> in life.</p><p>With his soul running out of anima to drain for the boiler, his usefulness has been running out. Mister Crossroads plans to swap Adela’s soul into the boiler once she succumbs to the withering curse. Such a powerful soul would fuel the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> and Snake Eye Jack’s prison for all time.</p><p><em><strong>Elias’s Gift.</strong></em> Elias’s soul is tattered and weary, and he wishes to depart so he can finally rest.

From the depths of what was once Glitterdeep Mine, rich with veins of gold, silver, and iron, the contamination spreads. Seventy years ago, a suspicious cave-in occurred, and the few rescuers who returned spoke of terrors before they condemned the mine, leaving it abandoned.</p><p class=\"p6\">Now called Skitterdeep Mine after its many-legged inhabitants, it is mentioned only in hushed tones, with wary glances over shoulders in fear of the crawling minions and the hag rumored to have brought ruin upon its darkened tunnels.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A trio of ancient hags known as the Vermintoll Coven has long wrought their wicked magic upon the fields, forests, and villages of Wickermoor Hollow. Seventy years ago, the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger corrupted Skitterdeep Mine—a once thriving source of precious ores.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s7\">Using illusion, hearty food, and strong drink, she wormed her way into the miners’ trust. Then, she poisoned and twisted them all into grotesque abominations and collapsed the tunnels, trapping the wretched souls within. A cadre of knights attempted a rescue, but they too fell to Stonoga’s influence as she warped their flesh to create new minions.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">Over the years, fear and superstition shrouded the Skitterdeep Mine. Travelers still vanish near its entrance, taken as material for her pestilent experiments. The infestation has now spread beyond the mine, skittering throughout the walls, beneath the earth, and within the bodies of Wickermoor Village.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Wickermoor Hollow is infested with countless centipedes that devour foodstuffs, spread disease, and even burrow into the bodies of the townsfolk. The source of the infestation is the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger, who seeks a new supply of human flesh for her twisted experiments deep within her abandoned mine. With each passing night, the vermin that have taken over town claim more victims and devour more food stores, threatening widespread death and famine. Characters drawn to the mine by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Discover and trace the source of the tunneling vermin to Skitterdeep Mine, and face the horrors within.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Stonoga Blackstinger and end the Skitter Plague.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger, the key NPC. Review the Quest Hooks to provide a compelling reason for the characters to venture to the abandoned mine. Finally, read through the locations of Skitterdeep Mine so you are ready to improvise encounters as the characters explore.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">This chapter is designed for four level 7 characters.</p>",

From the depths of what was once Glitterdeep Mine, rich with veins of gold, silver, and iron, the contamination spreads. Seventy years ago, a suspicious cave-in occurred, and the few rescuers who returned spoke of terrors before they condemned the mine, leaving it abandoned.</p><p>Now called Skitterdeep Mine after its many-legged inhabitants, it is mentioned only in hushed tones, with wary glances over shoulders in fear of the crawling minions and the hag rumored to have brought ruin upon its darkened tunnels.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>A trio of ancient hags known as the Vermintoll Coven has long wrought their wicked magic upon the fields, forests, and villages of Wickermoor Hollow. Seventy years ago, the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger corrupted Skitterdeep Mine—a once thriving source of precious ores.</p><p>Using illusion, hearty food, and strong drink, she wormed her way into the miners’ trust. Then, she poisoned and twisted them all into grotesque abominations and collapsed the tunnels, trapping the wretched souls within. A cadre of knights attempted a rescue, but they too fell to Stonoga’s influence as she warped their flesh to create new minions.</p><p>Over the years, fear and superstition shrouded the Skitterdeep Mine. Travelers still vanish near its entrance, taken as material for her pestilent experiments. The infestation has now spread beyond the mine, skittering throughout the walls, beneath the earth, and within the bodies of Wickermoor Village.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Wickermoor Hollow is infested with countless centipedes that devour foodstuffs, spread disease, and even burrow into the bodies of the townsfolk. The source of the infestation is the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger, who seeks a new supply of human flesh for her twisted experiments deep within her abandoned mine. With each passing night, the vermin that have taken over town claim more victims and devour more food stores, threatening widespread death and famine. Characters drawn to the mine by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p>Discover and trace the source of the tunneling vermin to Skitterdeep Mine, and face the horrors within.</p></li><li><p>Destroy Stonoga Blackstinger and end the Skitter Plague.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger, the key NPC. Review the Quest Hooks to provide a compelling reason for the characters to venture to the abandoned mine. Finally, read through the locations of Skitterdeep Mine so you are ready to improvise encounters as the characters explore.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 7th level characters.</p></div>"

Her unnaturally tall and lanky body has morphed over the years to more closely resemble the centipedes she favors, losing her nose and most of her toes and stretching her neck out by several feet.</p><p>Just as it was her sister Vessla’s role in the coven to twist souls in preparation for sacrifice to the Crooked Queen, Stonoga is tasked with corrupting bodies. She cares not for the matters of mind and spirit, as all life to her is simply meat to be molded beneath her jagged fingers. But despite this, she has a jovial disposition, taking glee in savoring the suffering of her victims.</p><p>Unlike her sisters, she prefers to hide away in the deepest, darkest holes in the earth where she can be embraced by the squirming swarms of her beloved centipedes. It is in these places that never see the light of the moon where she conducts her alchemy, witchcraft, and fleshcrafting.</p><p>Stonoga has been waiting for the night that her younger sister Vessla is slain, a moment foreseen and deemed a necessary sacrifice by her older sister Golub. The two older hags conspired to allow the weasel hag to be butchered in the Crooked House, but Stonoga has no idea that she herself was deceived. Golub Graygullet believed the middle sister needed to die too, as whispered by the Crooked Queen with the promise of being elevated within the inevitable crooked court of Kehlenn.

The familiar of Stonoga Blackstinger, he shares his mistress’s glee in the horrid reshaping of flesh into new forms. He can command the squirming hordes of centipedes that crawl throughout Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>Rather than being a collector of body parts like his weasel counterpart Filthy Jasper, Oswald prefers to create grotesque homes out of his master's victims. He burrows deep into Humanoid carcasses and rearranges the rotting innards to his liking, often lurking within for weeks at a time. Sometimes, he even digs into a healthy person to corrupt and prime their body for flesh shaping while they still live.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto 1em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter16_Plague.webp\" alt=\"\" /></div></div>"

The sick only have a few nights to live before succumbing to the affliction. A solution must be found before it’s too late.</p><h2>Infestation</h2><p>The village is infested with thousands of centipedes sent by Stonoga Blackstinger. These vermin consume food stores, burrow into the flesh of the living, and spread a magical contagion that afflicts those bitten by the creatures (see “Skitter Plague” below).</p><p>After the characters finish a long rest in Wickermoor Village, four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.wTFFZ0NBnE3NKN4e]{Skitterswarms}</strong>* emerge from the walls and floor of wherever they are staying and attack. Creatures hit by the swarms’ attacks must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw or be afflicted with Skitter Plague. Dozens of small mundane centipedes crawl throughout the floorboards as well.</p><p>When the characters step out into the streets of Wickermoor Village after dispatching the skitterswarms, many people are gathered here having fled their homes from centipede infestations. When asked about what’s going on, the plight is consistent across the townsfolk’s stories:</p><ul><li><p>They awoke with dozens of centipedes crawling in their beds, many having been bitten.</p></li><li><p>Their stored food is infested with centipedes, and much of it has been eaten.</p></li><li><p>Some larger, more grotesque, and especially vicious centipedes have dug into certain people’s skin.</p></li><li><p>People quickly started falling ill, coming down with fever, breaking out into mauve-colored pustules, and vomiting black bile.</p></li></ul><p>Over the next few hours, ten more villagers succumb to the unknown malady, all with similar stories. If nothing is done, the Skitter Plague will become an epidemic.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Skitter Plague</strong></h3><p><em><strong>Magical Disease</strong></em></p><p>Skitter Plague was created by the hag Stonoga Blackstinger, and it spreads through the bites of her grotesque centipedes, ignoring disease immunity. A creature bitten by any centipede under Stonoga’s control must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 12]] saving throw or suffer the following effects [[/r 1d4]] hours after infection:</p><p><strong>Fever. </strong>The creature gains level of &amp;reference[exhaustion apply=false] that can’t be removed until the contagion ends on the creature.</p><p><strong>Crawling Blisters.</strong> Blisters that feel like crawling centipedes form on the creature’s skin. When the creature finishes a long rest, it takes [[/damage 1d4 necrotic]]{2 (1d4)} necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction can’t be removed until the contagion ends on the creature. A Humanoid that dies from this contagion explodes into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.wTFFZ0NBnE3NKN4e]{Skitterswarm}</strong>* at the next Midnight Hour, the corpse’s flesh and bones turning into a malleable putty-like substance that can be split apart and carried by centipedes back to Skitterdeep Mine.</p><hr /><p><em><strong>Fighting the Plague.</strong></em> A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}</em> spell suppresses the effect of the contagion for 24 hours. Nightly at the Twilight Hour, an infected creature makes a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the plague ends for it.</p><h2><strong>Trail of Corruption</strong></h2><p>The characters can investigate the town to find where the centipedes are coming from by succeeding on a group [[/check INV DC 15]] or [[/check SUR DC 15]] check, discovering a sprawling network of tiny tunnels in the earth that seem to be coming from the northwest of Wickermoor Village.</p><p>After deducing the direction from which the centipedes are burrowing into town, the characters are approached by Mrs. Oakum (see chapter 11), who works for Siv Harga at the butcher shop. She tells the characters that the centipede infestation perfectly matched stories that her father used to tell her about the old abandoned mine in the wooded hills northwest of Wickermoor Village. Use the details below to guide the conversation with her:</p><ul><li><p>Her family used to live in a small community of hill-folk that worked in mining, logging, and trapping.</p></li><li><p>Decades ago, the old Glitterdeep Mine had a terrible cave-in that trapped dozens of miners within.</p></li><li><p>Thousands of huge, monstrous centipedes were seen skittering in the hills and into the mine.</p></li><li><p>A large rescue party was organized, but those who went into the mine never returned.</p></li><li><p>The rumor among the community was that it was a hag that caused the tragedy.</p></li><li><p>Swearing vengeance, a posse of riders was rallied to kill the hag and her minions, but they were never heard from again.</p></li><li><p>Fear of vile magic and the loss of work in the mine caused the community to dwindle.</p></li><li><p>Folks who know the old story have called the abandoned mine Skitterdeep for years.</p></li></ul><p>Mrs. Oakum offers to guide the characters through the hills but says she won’t get too close to the mine, fearing the hag that lurks in the depths. If the characters accept her help, the journey to the mine is the ideal opportunity to have her true identity as a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.7tRhrxuknTpHpYcA]{Werewolf}</strong> be revealed through an inadvertent transformation, whether it be through danger that the characters experience or hunger triggered by a forest creature.</p><p>If the characters don’t take it upon themselves to investigate the mine, Morgan the apothecary (see chapter 11) requests their assistance. They stress that if nothing is done, the sickness will overwhelm the town, and there will not be enough healers to tend to the ill—made worse by the indifference of the de facto surgeon Randall Graham, who believes the situation will resolve itself without taking drastic action. If necessary, Morgan offers the characters a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of Healing}</em> (greater) each to find the cause of the sickness and eliminate it.</p><p>Characters who monitor the health of afflicted villagers over the course of the night, or Morgan the apothecary if the characters don’t think to, realize that the illness is likely fatal over the course of several nights.</p><h2>Sisterly “Love”</h2><p>If the characters are not in Wickermoor Village when you wish to initiate the events of this chapter, a carrier pigeon finds them wherever they are, delivering a letter from postmaster Theodora Mayville. She informs them of the town’s infestation and her own suspicion that the centipedes were coming from Skitterdeep Mine.</p><p>She claims that she sent out a rider, who normally delivers large parcels, to investigate the mine, but he never returned. Theodora implores the characters to head to the mine themselves and put an end to the infestation, offering [[/award 50gp]] to each character once the plague is halted.</p><p>This is a ruse by Golub Graygullet (see chapter 8) to lure the characters into finding and killing her sister Stonoga as a sacrifice in honor of the Crooked Queen. If the characters follow this quest hook, they are confronted by a lone <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.80MeeiJWRBHrLuCR]{Fleshdobbin}</strong>* when they are three miles out from the mine—the flesh-crafted parcel rider that Theodora had sent to his doom.</p></div>"

Having survived for centuries by heeding nature in its bounty and wrath, these simple folk have a certainty in their beliefs and an assurance that all will be well, despite the strange, supernatural, and often violent happenings around them. It is here where the characters must learn to live and find their place.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Wickermoor Village is the oldest settlement in Wickermoor Hollow, the valley for which it’s named. The circumstances of its founding are as forgotten as its founder, but the people that live there take comfort in the Old Ways they adhere to, which haven’t changed in many generations. While the village is simple and rustic, many comforts and services offered in other small towns can be found here, and things have been relatively prosperous for the community even in the face of the occasional death or terror.</p><p class=\"p7\">Despite being so isolated from the rest of Druskenvald, the people of Wickermoor Village are welcoming to outsiders, though they secretly try to persuade newcomers to join the community and worship the Old Ways.</p><p class=\"p7\">To the unwary visitor, the town seems uneventful. However, it harbors a secret. A wicked cult operates in the shadows, communing with the malevolent specter known as the Crooked Man and the trio of revolting hags called the Vermintoll Coven. They seek to unleash Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen, and bring about the incarnation of her consort, the Horned King. If not stopped, their scheming will lead to the disintegration of all Druskenvald.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Wickermoor Village will serve as the central hub for <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign, from which frequent excursions will take the characters to various settlements throughout Wickermoor Hollow. Phillip and Adela Druskenvald will reside here for much of the adventure.</p><p class=\"p7\">The village contains several NPCs and locations central to the events of the adventure’s main plot, as well as suggestions for various side quests. Many other NPCs have little direct bearing on the narrative of the adventure, but you can use them to expand upon your own subplots and encounters. Most NPCs can interweave with characters’ stories and goals through Fateweaving (see chapter 9).</p>",

We share the songs and rituals of the Old Ways. We love nature. We fear it. We rely upon it. We appease it.”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>- Mayor Wendel Somerton -</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>An isolated and superstitious folk live in the village called Wickermoor. Having survived for centuries by heeding nature in its bounty and wrath, these simple folk have a certainty in their beliefs and an assurance that all will be well, despite the strange, supernatural, and often violent happenings around them. It is here where the characters must learn to live and find their place.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>Wickermoor Village is the oldest settlement in Wickermoor Hollow, the valley for which it’s named. The circumstances of its founding are as forgotten as its founder, but the people that live there take comfort in the Old Ways they adhere to, which haven’t changed in many generations. While the village is simple and rustic, many comforts and services offered in other small towns can be found here, and things have been relatively prosperous for the community even in the face of the occasional death or terror.</p><p>Despite being so isolated from the rest of Druskenvald, the people of Wickermoor Village are welcoming to outsiders, though they secretly try to persuade newcomers to join the community and worship the Old Ways.</p><p>To the unwary visitor, the town seems uneventful. However, it harbors a secret. A wicked cult operates in the shadows, communing with the malevolent specter known as the Crooked Man and the trio of revolting hags called the Vermintoll Coven. They seek to unleash Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen, and bring about the incarnation of her consort, the Horned King. If not stopped, their scheming will lead to the disintegration of all Druskenvald.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Wickermoor Village will serve as the central hub for <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign, from which frequent excursions will take the characters to various settlements throughout Wickermoor Hollow. Phillip and Adela Druskenvald will reside here for much of the adventure.</p><p>The village contains several NPCs and locations central to the events of the adventure’s main plot, as well as suggestions for various side quests. Many other NPCs have little direct bearing on the narrative of the adventure, but you can use them to expand upon your own subplots and encounters. Most NPCs can interweave with characters’ stories and goals through Fateweaving (see chapter 9).</p><img src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Leafs%2001.webp\" width=\"250\" class=\" centered\" style=\"border:0\" /></div>"

Never got around to responding, but hey, maybe it’s still there!”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Adela gently touches his arm, beaming. “Oh Philly, isn’t this just serendipity? I bet the villagers will be jazzed to see you!”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Phillip nods, giving her hand a playful squeeze. “That’s right, darling! Let’s treat this little hiccup as a stroke of luck—a chance to see new sights!” With a flourish, he twirls his cane and turns to you with a wink. “Since you handled that train so well, how about escorting us to Wickermoor Village?”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The trek to the village takes four hours through dark woodland and gloomy moors until the characters finally see the lights of the town flickering in the distance.</p><p>When they arrive at the town, the streets seem suspiciously empty. A ritual sacrifice, intended to save the town from danger, is playing out.</p><h2>The First Sacrifice</h2><p>When the characters arrive at Wickermoor Village, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>You finally arrive at Wickermoor Village and find a quaint town comprised of humble, timber-framed buildings with shingled roofs. You walk through empty streets and hear the tolling of bells from the clocktower that rises up from a large building at the center of town. You enter the circular town square, where a weathered statue of a featureless man stands across from a huge, gnarled oak covered in hundreds of carved faces.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Suddenly, a shrill shriek shatters the quiet, and you notice a struggling human shape at the base of the tree, bound and staked to the ground. Then, you hear deep, guttural growling from across the square. A pack of wolves led by a huge, shaggy pack leader approaches the squirming figure, their jaws slavering and eyes filled with bloodthirst.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The pack of animals entering town from the east contains six <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.yawTeS8u2FCfzzZH]{Wolves}</strong> led by a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.EYiQZ3rFL25fEJY5]{Dire Wolf}</strong>. They’ve been attracted by the shrieks of the bound sacrifice. Filled with the hate of the Crooked Queen, they are supernaturally aggressive and can’t be calmed or tamed by nonmagical methods.</p><p>The characters begin the encounter 120 feet from the tree to the west, and the pack is 120 feet east of the tree. The sacrifice is pinned by ropes to the ground to the north of the base of the Oak of Many Faces (area V10) and cannot escape without assistance. This encounter uses map 11.1.</p><h3><strong>Get Your Goat</strong></h3><p>When a character gets within 30 feet of the bound form, if they succeed on a [[/check INV DC 15]] check, they realize the form is not a person after all. They automatically succeed if they move to within 5 feet of the form.</p><p>A human-sized fabric doll made to look like a person is staked to the ground, and a smaller lump within the doll is struggling to get free.</p><p>A character can cut, tear, or rip the ropes or the doll itself to free the creature within. When they do, a baby <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.y8sRU8Ks2lcrGsaf]{Goat}</strong> (Tiny with no Ram attack) struggles free of the fabric and runs in a random direction to escape the area. A character can catch the baby goat as an action with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, or by grappling the goat. If the goat escapes while the wolves remain a threat, there is 50 percent chance that the wolves attack the goat or the characters.</p><p>If the characters do not interfere, the wolves devour the baby goat from within the fabric doll and then leave. Phillip and Adela look on in horror as this happens but do not pressure the characters to intervene.</p><h2>A Wickermoor Welcome</h2><p>Once the wolf attack is dealt with, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The door of a large building facing the town square opens, and a short and portly middle-aged man emerges. He wears a finely tailored three-piece suit and a matching bowler hat, the latter of which he removes in deference as he approaches.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>“A thousand apologies for the chaos, Lord Phillip! We were not expecting you this evening, and you caught us in the middle of one of our sacred traditions.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Please accept my sincere and heartfelt welcome to Wickermoor Village. I am Mayor Wendel Somerton. I am so pleased you’ve finally accepted my invitation to our humble community.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Mayor Somerton welcomes the characters and the Druskenvalds with grace and warmth, explaining that the attempted sacrifice they stumbled upon was a yearly ritual to feed the beasts of the woods and the roots of the great oak with an offering of lifeblood. Such a sacrifice in honor of the Green Queen (see “Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen” in chapter 8) ensures bountiful hunts and healthy livestock for the coming year.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/11-1_The_Founders_Round.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h3><strong>Sacrificed the Goat?</strong></h3><p>If the characters allowed the wolves to devour the baby goat, Mayor Somerton thanks them for not disturbing their customs and assures them that the Green Queen has witnessed their deference to the Old Ways and has granted them her vitality. The characters gain [[/damage 1d12 healing]]{6 (1d12) temporary hit points}.</p><h3><strong>Saved the Goat?</strong></h3><p>If the characters intervened and saved the goat, Mayor Somerton brushes off the interruption of the ritual and claims, “the oak still feeds on the blood of the stalking beasts.” However, a character who succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 17]] check can tell he is disturbed by the disruption but is feigning otherwise due to his desire to ingratiate himself with Phillip and Adela.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Mayor_Wendel_Somerton.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><h3><strong>What Wendel Knows</strong></h3><p>Mayor Somerton is pleasant and welcoming but carries himself with reserved poise. Use the details below to guide the conversation with him:</p><ul><li><p>He assures Phillip and Adela that the Druskenvald Estate (area V24) is in pristine condition and its servants are ready to fulfill their every want and need.</p></li><li><p>He shares the town’s history and provides a brief insight to the methods of the Old Ways (see chapter 8).</p></li><li><p>He suggests establishments the characters should visit (see “Wickermoor Village” later in the chapter) and recommends the Green Queen Inn for lodging.</p></li><li><p>He presents Wickermoor Village as a prosperous and happy town, but if pressed by a character who succeeds on a [[/check PER DC 15]] or [[/check ITM DC 15]] check, he admits that there have been more disappearances, illnesses, and deaths than usual.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Time to Traverse Town</strong></h3><p>When the conversation with Mayor Somerton winds down, Phillip bids the characters farewell.</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>“We’ve had some adventures, eh? Adela and I are exhausted, and I need to see whether this mayor is telling the truth about the state of this manor I apparently own. We’re going to go settle in now, but do come visit tomorrow for dinner!”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>If the characters state they want to stay with the Druskenvalds, Phillip politely declines. He says that he doesn’t know the situation at the estate, and the characters have done enough already. A character who succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 15]] check can tell there is a clear unease about him after the harrowing trip and perhaps more.</p><p><em><strong>Parting Ways.</strong></em> Phillip gives each character [[/award 10gp]] and tells them to get rooms at the inn for the evening—his treat. Then, he and Adela take the path up the hill toward the Druskenvald Estate.</p><p><em><strong>Watchful Eyes.</strong></em> Many townsfolk watched the attempted sacrifice through shuttered windows and cracked doors. Some devout Followers of the Old Ways (see chapter 8) may be offended and feel hostile toward the characters if they disrupted the ritual. Others may be more forgiving and see this as an opportunity to persuade them to convert.</p><p>Some of the townsfolk recognize Phillip and Adela, but most are unaware of life outside of Wickermoor Hollow. The malevolent cultists in service of the Crooked Queen can see their presence strongly, and the more worldly Newcomers (see chapter 8) know of and admire Phillip’s lordship over Druskenvald.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/maps/map%20region/MAP_11_2_Wickermoor_Village.webp\" alt=\"\" /><p><em><strong>First Night in Town.</strong></em> If characters arrive in the Evening Hour, most businesses are closed. However, the characters can walk the streets to see what’s in town—and they can visit many of the locations and NPCs during the following night before their dinner with the Druskenvalds (see chapter 12).</p><p><em><strong>Getting Rooms.</strong></em> The only place that rents decent rooms in Wickermoor Village is the Green Queen Inn. Alda Farnum, owner and proprietor, offers single rooms for [[/award -1gp]] per night, or triple rooms for [[/award -2gp]] per night, which includes a hot bath and a hot breakfast in the Twilight Hour. The first night’s sleep for the characters is peaceful and uneventful.</p><p><em><strong>What Now?</strong></em> From this point forward, you are encouraged to play out the story based on your own inclinations and preferences, as well as the actions and goals of the characters. If you incorporate Fateweaving (see chapter 9) into the adventure, find reasons for the characters to run into their Connection NPCs (see “Wickermoor Village” below).</p><p>Once the characters are ready to accept the Druskenvalds’ dinner invitation, they can travel up the hill on the northwest side of town to the Druskenvald Estate, which is ready to turn crooked (see chapter 12).</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter11_Wickermoor_Village.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div></div></div>"

              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap11\"><p class=\"h3\">Creating Your Own Adventures</p><p>The overarching narrative of <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign focuses on the secret plot of the minions of the Crooked Queen to release Kehlenn from the Crooked Tree and give flesh to the Horned King, ushering in an age of disintegration, annihilation, and crooked rebirth (see chapter 8). This plot is woven throughout the chapters of this adventure, with each new foe defeated bringing their plan closer to fruition. Refer to the “Back in Wickermoor Village” section of subsequent chapters to see how the town will be affected by the story’s development.</p><p>However, the information earlier in this chapter includes just a handful of the people, places, and plots that are possible in Wickermoor Village. This town should provide the framework to create your own adventures that you can interweave throughout the events of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>. Use the details below as inspiration for fleshing out the adventure and making it truly your own.</p><h2>Subplots</h2><p>If you wish to give the characters some downtime from the main plot and steer them toward some lower stakes side quests, you can use the subplots below. You will need to create hooks to draw the characters’ attention to these plots and decide on the details to fit them best in your story. They can be used in between any adventure chapters when the characters return to Wickermoor Village.</p><h3><strong>The Return of Gory Gus</strong></h3><p>A year ago, the cold, calculating killer Gus Strong—called “Gory Gus” by the population—was tried and then beheaded before the Oak of Many Faces (area V10) as punishment for his crimes. On the anniversary of his beheading, one of the townsfolk is murdered in the same way that Gus killed his victims. Evidence points to one of the characters being the killer. Clues can be found and followed to exonerate the character, showing that Gory Gus’s apprentice has picked up her master’s gory trade.</p><h3><strong>A Bad Seed</strong></h3><p>Villagers begin falling ill under mysterious circumstances during a special picnic celebrating a recent rich bounty of fruit, honey, and dairy. Clues at the picnic point to cursed apples being the culprit. The characters can investigate the apple orchard, where one of the townsfolk has entered a pact with Fiends in return for riches and power. The diabolist and the Fiends must be killed to break the withering curse that is affecting the picnic attendees.</p><h3><strong>The Bloody Cup</strong></h3><p>The village hosts an annual sporting and gaming event where teams from different parts of Wickermoor Hollow come together to compete. This year, the events of the competition turn bloody—or bloodier than normal—as “accidents” begin to plague the competition. The characters can compete on behalf of Wickermoor Village or watch, but without their intervention, the competition turns into a bloodbath.</p><h3><strong>The Play’s the Deadly Thing</strong></h3><p>Hickock and Company, a traveling troupe of actors led by the flamboyant George Hickock, comes to town to perform a play in the Green Queen Inn theater at the request of Alda Farnum. A cast member dies under mysterious circumstances. Can the characters solve the murder? More importantly, can they finish the play titled <em>The Prince in Gold?</em></p><h3><strong>The Lottery</strong></h3><p>A stranger comes to town, promising a great prize for people who willingly take part in a lottery. The stranger fails to reveal that, while the winner does receive a grand prize, someone—or several folks—lose the lottery and must pay a terrible price. The characters can intervene at risk of paying the price themselves.</p><h2>Town with a Secret Cult</h2><p>A secret cult operates within the shadows of Wickermoor Village, and behind every kind, smiling face could lurk one of its members. You can use the NPCs showcased earlier in this chapter as written, but are encouraged to adjust their alignments, allegiances, and goals in ways that best enhance your unique adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>.</p><p>Because of the secretive and deceptive nature of the cult that serves the Crooked Queen and its direct connection to the prominent faith of the Old Ways, any NPC can secretly be a villain for the characters to uncover in a shocking twist. Alternatively, conniving NPCs that the characters believe to be sinister can be revealed to have been subtly working against Kehlenn’s minions all along.</p><p>For ease of reference, below are the various groups of people in Wickermoor Village as written for the baseline adventure. Feel free to rearrange these lists as best suits your needs, keeping in mind the impact on Fateweaving Threads (see chapter 9) and future quest hooks. You are encouraged to prepare for the climactic confrontation with the cult of the Crooked Queen atop Rowan’s Rise (see chapter 23), making sure to foreshadow and consider the connections that the characters make with NPCs throughout the adventure.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\"

      "description": "<blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><span class=\"s3\"><em><strong>“I once knew the kiss of the sun, the song of the mourning dove, the caress of leaf and branch. I ruled a world of green, and my subjects were of the forest, from the smallest hare to the greatest elk. Now, the cycle is shattered, and all that remains is sin. Even my own soul is sin. All that’s left to be done is disintegration. All that remains is annihilation.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\"><em><strong>- Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p4\">The Wytchwood bows to the Crooked Queen. At its heart stands a Crooked Tree, a barren oak that thirsts for revenge. The deposed queen need only wait a little longer. Her patience wears thin, and her old wounds still fester. It is in this dark wood that desperate bargains and sacrifices will be made, and only fate can tell the true cost.</p><p class=\"p6\">Now, Phillip Druskenvald, once the most powerful being in all the land, moves toward his sealed fate and certain doom. The final reckoning of Druskenvald is at hand, and the land itself holds its breath.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The end is coming to Druskenvald. With the sacrifices of the Fallen and the Lord of Fools, the Horned King is primed for his hellish birth, his influence now spreading beyond the tree line of the Wytchwood. At the gnarled forest’s heart, the Crooked Queen calls Phillip Druskenvald to her barrow so she may exact her vengeance and bring about the annihilation she has craved for millennia.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">The blazing ritual and massacre atop Rowan’s Rise have caused great turmoil within Wickermoor Village. With so many lost, townsfolk are looking for salvation. This is especially true of Phillip Druskenvald, who lost the love of his life to the burning Wicker Man and is now desperate to return her to life. He does not yet know that Adela’s soul is bound to Kehlenn as the final sacrifice needed for her escape from her tomb and prison.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">In his grief, Phillip has sequestered himself away in the Green Queen Inn. Now out of options, he desperately hopes to use the primeval magic of the Old Ways to bring his beloved back to him. This is doomed to fail, and the lord of the land will be utterly powerless. In his lowest moment, Phillip will finally hear Kehlenn’s call and will answer.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The time for the final confrontation with Kehlenn has come. Her vengeful designs have all worked toward this moment to ensnare Phillip within the Crooked Tree and transform him into the Horned King. Unless the characters stop the ritual, her consort will ascend to godhood, the Crooked Queen will be free, and all of Druskenvald will be annihilated and experience a horrid, crooked rebirth. Characters who enter the Wytchwood following the Quest Hooks later in the chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Search the forest for Phillip Druskenvald.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Defeat the Horned King, and prevent the Crooked Queen from returning.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Perform a sacrificial ritual to sever Kehlenn’s bonds with Druskenvald forever.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Before running this chapter, consider the wants, goals, and connections of the characters to present them with the most alluring offers from the Horned King. Reviewing the final battle, “Born King,” will help create a climactic and terrifying final encounter. Finally, refreshing yourself on the details of the setting and history of Druskenvald, as well as the key NPCs of the adventure, particularly Kehlenn and Phillip Druskenvald (see chapters 1 and 8), will ensure a satisfying and cathartic finale for <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">This chapter is designed for four level 13 characters.</p>",

At its heart stands a Crooked Tree, a barren oak that thirsts for revenge. The deposed queen need only wait a little longer. Her patience wears thin, and her old wounds still fester.

With the sacrifices of the Fallen and the Lord of Fools, the Horned King is primed for his hellish birth, his influence now spreading beyond the tree line of the Wytchwood. At the gnarled forest’s heart, the Crooked Queen calls Phillip Druskenvald to her barrow so she may exact her vengeance and bring about the annihilation she has craved for millennia.</p><p>The blazing ritual and massacre atop Rowan’s Rise have caused great turmoil within Wickermoor Village. With so many lost, townsfolk are looking for salvation. This is especially true of Phillip Druskenvald, who lost the love of his life to the burning Wicker Man and is now desperate to return her to life. He does not yet know that Adela’s soul is bound to Kehlenn as the final sacrifice needed for her escape from her tomb and prison.</p><p>In his grief, Phillip has sequestered himself away in the Green Queen Inn. Now out of options, he desperately hopes to use the primeval magic of the Old Ways to bring his beloved back to him. This is doomed to fail, and the lord of the land will be utterly powerless. In his lowest moment, Phillip will finally hear Kehlenn’s call and will answer.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>The time for the final confrontation with Kehlenn has come. Her vengeful designs have all worked toward this moment to ensnare Phillip within the Crooked Tree and transform him into the Horned King. Unless the characters stop the ritual, her consort will ascend to godhood, the Crooked Queen will be free, and all of Druskenvald will be annihilated and experience a horrid, crooked rebirth. Characters who enter the Wytchwood following the Quest Hooks later in the chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p>Search the forest for Phillip Druskenvald.</p></li><li><p>Defeat the Horned King, and prevent the Crooked Queen from returning.</p></li><li><p>Perform a sacrificial ritual to sever Kehlenn’s bonds with Druskenvald forever.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, consider the wants, goals, and connections of the characters to present them with the most alluring offers from the Horned King. Reviewing the final battle, “Born King,” will help create a climactic and terrifying final encounter. Finally, refreshing yourself on the details of the setting and history of Druskenvald, as well as the key NPCs of the adventure, particularly Kehlenn and Phillip Druskenvald (see chapters 1 and 8), will ensure a satisfying and cathartic finale for <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 13th level characters.</p></div>"

Each represents a key fury in the characters’ journey through Wickermoor Hollow, their fates intertwined in the struggle for Druskenvald’s soul.</p><h2>Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Kehlenn.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>In ages past, Kehlenn once ruled the domain now known as Druskenvald as an archfey goddess called the Green Queen. Her world of rebirth allowed for no sapient life, and reborn souls existed only in the wild flora and fauna. This new life was always brutal, short, and filled with terror, but wholly natural as she saw it.</p><p>This untouched world of green changed forever when Phillip Druskenvald arrived. How he found her and where he received the power to depose her, she never learned, but it was not long before she was reduced to a pile of bones in a barrow and a weakened fey spirit bound to a single tree.</p><p>As Phillip remade the domain in his image, Kehlenn remained. As Phillip forgot the violent conflict that usurped her, Kehlenn remembered. And with each passing year, her slow recovery from the crushing defeat brought greater awareness of the hubris of the man who named her domain after himself.</p><p>She powerlessly witnessed the vile desecration of her once-green world with the introduction of sapient life using her stolen power. The resulting hatred consumed her entire being, and over the millennia, she was twisted into the Crooked Queen, a moniker she now bears with spiteful pride.</p><p>The moment she has waited eons for has finally arrived. The sacrifices required to bring an end to Phillip Druskenvald and reclaim the power he stole from her have come to fruition, one after the other, just as she had planned for so long. All that remains is for Phillip to kneel, and she will remake him just like he remade her precious domain.</p><h3><strong>All Will Be Crooked</strong></h3><p>Kehlenn’s freedom is nothing short of apocalyptic. She seeks not only to reclaim Druskenvald but to reshape it in her twisted image. Her eons of solitude and imprisonment have spoiled her once-green nature and transformed her into vengeance incarnate.</p><p>While she once sought to restore the natural cycle of life, death, and rebirth, she now only seeks the total annihilation of Druskenvald. Her ultimate goal is the corruption and disintegration of every sapient being, returning them to nature as she now defines it. She plans to rebirth them into crooked mockeries of what they once were—to live a terrifying, painful, and short life before perishing and being reborn to experience their horrible existence over and over again for eternity.</p><p>Now that the final stages of the Crooked Queen’s plan are in motion, there is no need for subterfuge, and Kehlenn has no interest in hiding her intentions. She will be honest with the characters, offering up her tale to persuade them to see her side of the story and turn them against Phillip in his final agonizing moments as a parting knife in the back.</p><h2>The Horned King</h2><p>The Horned King is Kehlenn’s cruel and powerful creation, made from sin itself. Through temptation and desire, he seeks to corrupt souls and bring about her vengeance. He is a monstrous shade of Phillip Druskenvald himself, woven from fragments of his very soul. This terrible entity intends to replace the lord of the land and sit at the right hand of his Crooked Queen.</p><p>The Horned King remains bound within the Wytchwood, his incorporeal form unable to cross its borders. Yet with the sacrifice of the Lord of Fools, his influence has begun to creep into the lands beyond. He bides his time, stalking the forest and whispering temptations throughout Wickermoor Hollow, slowly ensnaring its inhabitants.</p><p>The Horned King is subtle in his methods. His greatest pleasure lies in softly seducing the most disciplined and pious souls—those who believe themselves above vice—into giving in to their hidden desires. His whispers are a constant pressure, a slow unraveling of restraint. The more they resist, the deeper his influence burrows, until even the most virtuous souls find themselves standing before their own corruptive acts.</p><p>At the command of his Crooked Queen, the Horned King seeks to achieve physical form through the possession and metamorphosis of Phillip Druskenvald. After consuming Phillip’s soul and becoming corporeal, he plans to leave Wickermoor Hollow and siphon the energies of all of Druskenvald. If not stopped, he will use this immense power to finally free his queen from her prison to remake the domain in her crooked image.</p><h2>Phillip Druskenvald</h2><p>Phillip Druskenvald is a broken man at his lowest point. He is consumed by guilt, desperation, and the agonizing pain of loss following the death of Adela. Despite having fallen for Kehlenn’s trap and acting as the architect of his own downfall, he is still filled with the misguided belief that he can somehow control or undo what he has set in motion.</p><p>This mindset is what has led him to seek the power of the Old Ways. His forward-thinking obsession with progress and the future has brought him nothing but destruction, so his last hope lies with the primeval powers that existed before he brought civilization to the domain. However, his attempts to harness this power to resurrect Adela in the Green Queen Inn have failed, shattering him further.</p><p>This humbled husk of a man is whom Kehlenn calls out to once the ritual fails, her whispers laced with the promises to return Adela’s soul and her life. With no further options before him, Phillip set off into the Wytchwood to seek the Crooked Queen in the desperate hope he can finally make things right. Like a sacrificial lamb, he is oblivious to his imminent slaughter and the ritualistic power his death will provide.</p></div>"

However, knowing that Phillip vanished after discovering Adela’s charred remains within the Wicker Man—hearing from villagers that he has locked himself away within the Green Queen Inn—may prompt them to seek him out.</p><h2>The Last Hope</h2><p>Wickermoor Village has been thrown into chaos in the aftermath of the massacre on the moors. The revelation that many townsfolk were behind the dreadful events has left the village divided and in disarray. Unrest simmers and power structures unravel. Some cling to old superstitions, while others look for new leadership, each with their own interpretation of what has happened and what must be done to make things right.</p><p>If Mayor Somerton survived the events on Rowan’s Rise and did not fall in league with the nefarious cultists of the Old Ways, the panicked townsfolk blame him for everything that has happened and swiftly turn on him, imprisoning or even killing him. If Constable Doris Squire still lives, she is powerless to bring order to the chaos, disheartened by the evident betrayal of Deputy Howie Butterman.</p><p>The characters may find themselves drawn into this turmoil, as various people vie for their favor or assistance. But nothing is more pressing than discovering the fate of Phillip Druskenvald. Some want him captured and punished for bringing suffering and death to Wickermoor Hollow. Others want him rescued, viewing him as the only possible authority figure that can prevent Wickermoor Village from falling to anarchy. Both sides implore the characters to investigate.</p><p>After a brief inquiry, some townsfolk claim to have seen Phillip Druskenvald stumbling into the Green Queen Inn—his face pale and his eyes haunted.</p><h2>Chaos Reigns</h2><p>If the characters choose to delay or ignore the rising threat of the Crooked Queen, time becomes their greatest enemy. The longer they wait, the stronger the Horned King’s influence grows. One by one, villagers begin to fall to their vices. Pure bedlam and pandemonium are but a few short nights away as even the most disciplined, chastened, and restrained people give in to their basest desires.</p><p>The townsfolk that the characters confront discover the evil impulses that had once lain dormant in the corrupted villagers’ hearts. They also learn that the common thread among them was that all of them heard the seductive whispers of a three-eyed beast that stalks the dark woods. Those who confess and admit their transgressions, deeply shamed, plead with the characters to discover what is happening and put an end to it.</p></div>"

While the innkeeper was alive, she had been too forthcoming with Phillip to get on his good side and hinted at a powerful tome. After Adela’s death, this tome became his last hope.</p><p>Even with his shattered psyche, Phillip correctly deduced the location of the ancient book and performed the terrible rite within. The endeavor failed and opened the door to Phillip’s mind, welcoming Kehlenn in. Following the botched resurrection, the Crooked Queen sent a vision that implied the possession of Adela’s soul and the willingness to return her if he would only find her in the Wytchwood. Phillip immediately left the inn to find Kehlenn’s resting place beneath the Crooked Tree.</p></div>"

There have been few visitors that have dared to walk among the primeval trees since the forgotten times when the forest was young. Only a small collection of trophies buried beneath the Crooked Tree serve as evidence of those doomed souls’ existence. For the unwary, the Wytchwood is a place of endless misdirection and a tomb for all those who become lost within.</p><h2>Features of the Wytchwood</h2><p>There are no clear paths in this untouched wilderness—only beasts tread here. Unless otherwise stated, the Wytchwood has the following features:</p><p><strong>Canopy.</strong> The forest’s canopy is 60 feet above the ground.</p><p><strong>Fitful Rest.</strong> Creatures that finish a long rest take [[/damage 3d6 psychic]]{10 (3d6)} psychic damage after regaining hit points for the rest. They also find their belongings moved about and arranged on the ground in strange patterns, with no evidence of how or when it happened.</p><p><strong>Lighting.</strong> The light of the Crooked Moon passes through the sparse tree cover and sends shadows dancing about the forest floor. The entire forest is lightly obscured.</p><p><strong>A Quiet Place.</strong> Dense needles on low-hanging branches dampen sounds that fail to echo through the wood. Sounds can’t be heard beyond 120 feet from their source, even if shouted or magically produced (such as with the <em>Knock</em> spell).</p><h2>Entering the Wytchwood Early</h2><p>If the characters want to explore the Wytchwood before the events of this chapter, Kehlenn wraps the wood in an impenetrable glamour. Until Phillip Druskenvald heeds the Crooked Queen’s call in the wake of the Wicker Man’s burning, the Wytchwood has the following features:</p><p><strong>Twisting Paths.</strong> No matter how long a visitor explores or what methods they employ to find or mark their way, travelers in the wood find themselves trekking back toward the edge of the forest where they entered.</p><p><strong>Hunted.</strong> Travelers in the Wytchwood are at the mercy of Kehlenn’s creatures. Every night that characters explore the wood during the Witching Hour, roll [[/r 1d12]]. On a roll of 2 or higher, a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.zCFEcKc4a46mHGjB]{Hypnovulfen}</strong>* attacks the characters before the hour is up.</p><h2>Into The Dark Woods</h2><p>The Wytchwood is a two-night trek from Wickermoor Village across the moors to the north. In his grief-stricken journey, Phillip has left an unmasked trail, not caring who might follow. The characters venture into the forest with one goal: to find the Crooked Tree, where Phillip has gone to confront the Crooked Queen.</p><p>When the characters enter the Wytchwood, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The moment you step into the wood, darkness and quiet surround you. The pine and fir trees before you bend subtly at odd angles in an endless expanse that feels truly ancient.</strong></em></p></blockquote><h2>Tracking Phillip</h2><p>The characters can follow the messy trail left by Phillip with relative ease. Upon first entering the Wytchwood and after each encounter until the characters arrive at the Crooked Tree, a character can make a [[/check SUR DC 13]] check to find muddy footprints, crushed pine needles, and snapped branches, which lead to the next encounter after an hour of travel. A character has advantage on this check after an encounter if any of the characters successfully found Phillip’s Clue (see “Wytchwood Encounters” later in this chapter). Characters will always experience the encounters in order, and they always are at least one hour of travel through the wood apart.</p><p>If the check fails, the characters lose the trail and wander for one hour until they are attacked by monstrous denizens of the forest. Roll on the Hungry Woods table to determine what creatures attack.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.PS4TYAewIXVGPtck]{Hungry Woods}</strong></em></p><p>After the characters defeat the attacking creatures, they may repeat the check to continue tracking Phillip. On a success, they proceed to the next encounter after an hour of travel. On a failure, they wander for another hour and are attacked by the monsters of the Wytchwood once more.</p><h2>On Cloven Hoof</h2><p>The Horned King stalks the Wytchwood, an incorporeal spirit unable to take physical form until his unholy union with Phillip Druskenvald. His arrival is signaled by the snapping of branches under an enormous bulk, the rumbling of earth from heavy footfalls, and the hot, putrid breath of a huge panting beast.</p><p>His form is that of a massive black goat with three ruby-red eyes. While stalking the characters, he never fully reveals himself, always keeping just beyond sight. The characters might catch glimpses of a bloody eye, some shaggy black hair, or a jagged gray horn between the trees.</p><h3><strong>Within Temptation</strong></h3><p>While the characters are traveling between encounters (see “Wytchwood Encounters” later in this chapter), the Horned King will make his presence known and call out in a low, rumbling, and seductive voice. His goal is to pry into the characters’ hearts to determine what they truly desire, erode confidence in their mission, plant seeds of doubt in their allies, and elicit curiosity for what he can truly offer them. To properly persuade the characters, have the Horned King visit them two or more times before Encounter 4.</p><p>A character can gauge the intentions behind the Horned King’s words with a successful [[/check INS DC 18]] check. They sense that, while his words are carefully measured, he is earnest about learning their true desires and offering them what they want, but for a clearly ulterior purpose.</p><p>The Horned King never answers the characters’ questions outright and continues to steer the conversation to the things they crave most, especially vices. Those who demand gifts or bargains are denied until he makes his final offer (see “Live Deliciously” later in this chapter).</p><p><em><strong>Impotent Wrath.</strong></em> Any attempts to engage the Horned King in combat are futile, but he won’t vanish simply because of an attempted ranged attack or spell. Any character who attempts to initiate combat with the Horned King before the final confrontation (see “Born King” later in this chapter) must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 18]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[frightened apply=false] for one minute. While frightened in this way, the character must drop whatever they’re holding, use their action to Dash, and use their movement to run away from the Horned King after being filled with the dread of what lurks in the hearts of mortals.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:1em 0\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter24_On_Cloven_Hoof.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h3><strong>Conferring with the Horned King</strong></h3><p>The Horned King thrives on sin and desire, with the power to turn mortals toward corruption (see “The Horned King” earlier in this chapter). He initiates conversations with questions that play into the characters’ wants, fears, and struggles in hopes to tempt them. Some example responses include:</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/MAP_35_Crooked%20Tree%20Flowchart.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><ul><li><p>“Why do you carry such a heavy burden alone? There are easier paths.”</p></li><li><p>“Do you wish to suffer forever? The pain can end with a spoken word.”</p></li><li><p>“Do you truly believe you have all the answers? There are many secrets yet to discover.”</p></li><li><p>“Why do you rush toward your fate? There is peace in letting time pass you by.”</p></li><li><p>“Why do you struggle against the inevitable? Lay down your weary head and rest.”</p></li><li><p>“Would you like to live deliciously? Life need not be filled with tragedy and loss.”</p></li></ul><p>If asked questions by the characters, his answers are cryptic and always drive toward temptation. Use the following to guide responses if the characters speak with the Horned King:</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong> I am he who stalks the deepest woods and darkest hearts. I am in the heart of every mortal. I am the very thing you desire most. I am the Horned King, consort of she who watches from the Crooked Tree.</p><p><strong>What do you want from us?</strong> I ask for nothing besides friendship and loyalty. And in exchange, I offer you the means to live deliciously. You come to my woods burdened, and I offer to alleviate that which weighs down your soul.</p><p><strong>Why should we trust you?</strong> Trust? You need not trust me to see the truth in my words. You need only walk the path I tender.</p><p><strong>What do you know of the Crooked Queen?</strong> She is the first, and she shall be the last. There is nothing but the forest. There is nothing but my queen.</p><p><strong>What of Phillip?</strong> He is an honored guest in these woods and has been given safe passage.</p><p><strong>What happens if we refuse you?</strong> It is your choice, but not one to be made lightly. Refuse, and nothing will protect you from what is to come. Accept, and you may find comfort and succor.</p><h2 style=\"clear:both\">Wytchwood Encounters</h2><p>The Wytchwood is not just a physical space but also a manifestation of the Crooked Queen’s will.

This can be anything of great personal value to the character: a cherished item, a piece (or person) of their past, or even a part of themselves (reducing an ability score by 2, giving up a class feature, etc.). Whatever is offered is lost forever.</p><p><em><strong>Sacrifice.</strong></em> As an action, a character can touch the goat skull, offer a sacrifice, and roll [[/r 1d20]]. On a 10 or higher, the sacrifice is accepted. However, Kehlenn in her Crooked Tree rages against her potential banishment. On a 9 or lower, Kehlenn receives a number of Ritual Points equal to the amount the roll failed by (10 minus the total rolled). Kehlenn can use these points to reduce future rolls before a character rolls the d20 for their sacrifice, potentially turning success into failure. On a failure, a character can try again on subsequent turns with a new sacrifice.</p><p><em><strong>Last Act.</strong></em> A character whose sacrifice isn’t accepted can choose to give their all to assure the queen’s demise—the character can sacrifice their own life. A character who takes this option dies and can’t be restored to life. The sacrifice is accepted, and the Crooked Queen is powerless to stop it.</p><p><em><strong>Resolution.</strong></em> If the characters fail in making their sacrifices 6 times, or if any of the characters ignore the pleading of Phillip’s spirit and don’t offer a sacrifice, the ritual completes in the Crooked Queen’s favor, and the Horned King reforms (see “Crooked Defeat” earlier in this chapter). If each character’s sacrifice is accepted before that, the ritual collapses, and Kehlenn is untethered from Druskenvald and bound forever within the Crooked Moon.</p><h2>Underneath the Crooked Moon</h2><p>When the final sacrifice is accepted, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>As the final sacrifice is accepted by the goat skull, its empty eye sockets fill with a glowing orange light that spreads along the cracks in the bone, up its horns, and to the wooden moon through the twine that holds it aloft.

The glowing ember, guided by the will of Adela Druskenvald, drifts down and lands at the base of the Crooked Tree.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>In an instant, it bursts into flame. Shrieks of rage, pain, and hate fill the night sky for just a moment before silencing as the entire tree is fully engulfed from root to bough. You look up to the face of the Crooked Moon above, and where once had been a leering grin is now a scowl twisted with malice.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The radiating energy of the sacrificial ritual fades as the tree burns, and the eternal night of Druskenvald quiets. For a brief moment, the shimmering blue-green specters of Phillip and Adela appear before you, embracing sorrowfully, before fading into nothing.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Those that still live find themselves watching the ancient trunk and branches collapse in flames, as safe as if they were sitting around a campfire sharing a story.</p><p>The primeval bonds that tied Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen, to the land of Druskenvald have been severed. She is trapped within the Crooked Moon, fated to forever look down impotently on the people she so bitterly hates.</p><p><em><strong>Level Up.</strong></em> The characters reach 14th level, if they are still 13th level, when they complete the ritual and defeat the Crooked Queen. If you plan on continuing the adventure to level 20 (see chapter 26), they remain at 13th level and instead increase one ability score of their choice by 2.

It is recommended to select an order for the characters receiving their narrative Climax that allows for time to breathe in between each one so that every character gets their appropriate spotlight.</p><p>Some moments are a natural fit for happening immediately after the burning of the Crooked Tree, while others fit better later as the characters “catch their breath” physically, emotionally, and spiritually after their harrowing experience. These Climaxes should all be initiated while the characters are still within the Wytchwood, but not all of them must be at Kehlenn’s barrow, so you can initiate these impactful moments at various points throughout the trek out of the woods. For characters who wish to use teleportation magic to immediately leave the Wytchwood, you may determine that these spells fail despite the banishment of the Crooked Queen, caused by the surging energies called forth by the final sacrifice to burn the Crooked Tree.</p><p>Finally, while the immediate effects of the respective Climaxes and the resulting Catharses may be fitting to happen immediately following each Climax, you are encouraged to allow some time to pass for the characters to fully process each of the climactic moments of their narrative journeys. The Catharsis of each character’s Thread of Fate can be fully implemented during the conclusion of the campaign as presented in the Epilogue (see chapter 25).</p></aside></div>"

To outsiders, it promises solace and a retreat from life’s troubles. But behind its iron doors lurks a nightmare. Beneath the polished facade and soft-spoken promises, Matron Lethica pursues her sinister ambition: the Lethic Serum. The concoction claims to cure all ailments—but at a terrible cost. Those who undergo its treatment lose more than their pain; their bodies mutate, their memories fade, and they become hollow vessels for Lethica’s cruel vision of salvation.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Memory’s Rest Sanatorium rises from the mists of Moonsong Lake, a sanctuary for those seeking relief from their troubles. Its founder, Matron Lethica, has transformed the Isle of Mourn into a place of healing—or so its reputation would suggest. In truth, the sanatorium’s wards are filled with pained silence and the anguished cries of those seduced by this mask.</p><p class=\"p7\">To perfect her serum, Lethica and her staff—the corrupted nurses, surgeons, and horrors born of her failures—have turned the sanatorium into a prison. Patients vanish often. Those who do not return have succumbed to the mutagenic effects of the Lethic Serum and have transformed into abominations in the image of the true source of the serum.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\">An eldritch horror known as the White Worm has been imprisoned by the matron in the caverns beneath the sanatorium. This otherworldly being’s ichor serves as the base of the Lethic Serum, and its alien mind gives endless inspiration for Lethica’s abominable experiments, treatments, and goal of twisting the bodies and minds of everyone. Only through the death of the widow can the people be spared this sickening evolution.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Memory’s Rest Sanatorium is a place of suffering, alchemy, and unspeakable transformation. The characters are tasked with uncovering its secrets and ending Lethica’s sinister dreams. To prevail, they must navigate the halls of the sanatorium, confront its many horrors, and face the Weeping Widow herself. Characters drawn to the sanatorium by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Learn what is happening to patients in Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Create an antidote to the Lethic Serum</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Find Lethica’s secret Laboratory (area L27) and the cavern below.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Slay Matron Lethica, the Weeping Widow.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, study its most important NPC, the Weeping Widow, to understand her motivations and methods. Familiarize yourself with the sanatorium’s layout, key areas, and inhabitants so you are prepared to run encounters in whatever order the characters explore. Finally, review the climactic battle, “The Chemical Evolution,” to ensure a satisfying and epic finale.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 7 characters.</p>",

To outsiders, it promises solace and a retreat from life’s troubles. But behind its iron doors lurks a nightmare. Beneath the polished facade and soft-spoken promises, Matron Lethica pursues her sinister ambition: the Lethic Serum. The concoction claims to cure all ailments—but at a terrible cost. Those who undergo its treatment lose more than their pain; their bodies mutate, their memories fade, and they become hollow vessels for Lethica’s cruel vision of salvation.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>Memory’s Rest Sanatorium rises from the mists of Moonsong Lake, a sanctuary for those seeking relief from their troubles. Its founder, Matron Lethica, has transformed the Isle of Mourn into a place of healing—or so its reputation would suggest. In truth, the sanatorium’s wards are filled with pained silence and the anguished cries of those seduced by this mask.</p><p>To perfect her serum, Lethica and her staff—the corrupted nurses, surgeons, and horrors born of her failures—have turned the sanatorium into a prison. Patients vanish often. Those who do not return have succumbed to the mutagenic effects of the Lethic Serum and have transformed into abominations in the image of the true source of the serum.</p><p>An eldritch horror known as the White Worm has been imprisoned by the matron in the caverns beneath the sanatorium. This otherworldly being’s ichor serves as the base of the Lethic Serum, and its alien mind gives endless inspiration for Lethica’s abominable experiments, treatments, and goal of twisting the bodies and minds of everyone. Only through the death of the widow can the people be spared this sickening evolution.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Memory’s Rest Sanatorium is a place of suffering, alchemy, and unspeakable transformation. The characters are tasked with uncovering its secrets and ending Lethica’s sinister dreams. To prevail, they must navigate the halls of the sanatorium, confront its many horrors, and face the Weeping Widow herself. Characters drawn to the sanatorium by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p>Learn what is happening to patients in Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</p></li><li><p>Create an antidote to the Lethic Serum</p></li><li><p>Find Lethica’s secret Laboratory (area L27) and the cavern below.</p></li><li><p>Slay Matron Lethica, the Weeping Widow.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, study its most important NPC, the Weeping Widow, to understand her motivations and methods. Familiarize yourself with the sanatorium’s layout, key areas, and inhabitants so you are prepared to run encounters in whatever order the characters explore. Finally, review the climactic battle, “The Chemical Evolution,” to ensure a satisfying and epic finale.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 7th level characters.</p></div>"

She seeks to “free” all people from their pain and sorrow, believing that erasing suffering is the only path to peace. She holds all she meets in contempt and disgust, using her seemingly noble purpose to manipulate and recruit a staff that is both loyal and adoring.</p><h2>Tragedy of the Widow</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Matron_Lethica.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>Long ago, a white-haired elf named Lethica Nightborne was a high priestess of a goddess of evening, peace, and healing who takes the form of a barn owl. Her duty was to heal those sick in body or mind, which she achieved through blessings from her goddess, as well as the brewing of natural remedies. She found joy bringing peace to countless souls, but her life would be made complicated when she encountered her husband-to-be.</p><p>After meeting the traveling knight Sir Marius Renathyr, Lethica discovered a happiness greater than she ever thought possible. Their romance was passionate, and their marriage filled Lethica with purpose. Lethica believed she and her chivalrous love would make the world a better place.</p><p>Fate had another plan. After her husband bared his vampire fangs and attempted to feed upon her (see chapter 14), he fled in shame. She followed him and uncovered the extent of his wickedness, shocked to learn his soul was damned and pledged to a devil. The knight she knew and loved was dead, and her new life as a widow was one of endless grief.</p><p>To ease her suffering, she redoubled her commitment to the restorative pursuit that had once brought her such comfort. She found the Isle of Mourn, drawn by stories of crystalline pools in the caverns beneath the earth said to have miraculous healing powers. The legends were true, and after she verified the water’s potency, she began construction of a hospital on that very site, where she vowed she would bring an end to all pain.</p><p>Lethica used the waters of the pools to heal the sickly, but her joy did not return. She was hollow and bitter, and she grew resentful of her goddess for failing to prevent her tragedy. Disavowing her goddess and the Nightborne name, she turned toward scientific practices that allowed her to develop more potent medicines as the hospital continued its construction.</p><h2>Eater of Memory</h2><p>Lethica discovered she was a natural scientist and that her brilliance was unmatched. However, despite numerous breakthroughs, she could not cure every affliction. In particular, she found that several of her patients suffered from painful memories just as she did. This scientific dead-end troubled her until inspiration struck while she walked the endless caverns beneath the fledgling hospital.</p><p>She came across the ruins of a dead civilization that worshiped an eldritch being from beyond the stars who endlessly hungers for memories. For years, she studied the etchings of a forgotten language, learning how to make contact with a being known only as the White Worm. Lethica had finally found the secret that would allow her to unlock the full potential of her medicine.</p><p>In the cavern beneath the hospital, she performed a ritual that summoned forth the White Worm. By accepting its parasitic offspring within her form, Lethica appeased the creature and formed a psychic bond with it. Her skin turned pallid, her blood violet, and her tears an inky black that forever ran down her face and stained her cheeks. Then, Lethica activated the trap she had set, using her potent science to imprison the weakened grub and constantly drain its alien gore. This ichor, infused with the water of the enchanted pools, formed the base of the Lethic Serum, her greatest work.</p><p>When injected, the serum removed a subject’s memories, feeding them to the White Worm to keep it alive. While it remedied physical afflictions, it also warped the body into something wholly alien. Lethica saw this transformation as a cure to suffering and committed to spreading it to everyone, whether they sought it or not. This became the sole purpose of the completed hospital, which she dubbed Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</p><p>Despite her proclaimed noble goal of freeing her patients from their pain, Lethica is equally motivated by a hatred that others should enjoy a blissful life when she cannot. Her foul experiments seek to perfect the serum and produce it at such a scale that the waters of Wickermoor Hollow would transform all living things within. She has even created a variety of apparatuses to pump the serum into the pools below the sanatorium.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter17_Memorys_Rest.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div></div><h2>Parley with the Widow</h2><p>Matron Lethica spends her waking hours immersed in her alchemy and overseeing the operations of Memory’s Rest Sanatorium. She meets with visitors to offer reassurances, veiled in kindness and empathy, while quietly assessing whether they can be swayed, used, or eliminated. She is most commonly met in the Matron’s Office (area L4), presenting herself as a visionary who carries the burden of humanity’s pain. She spends the remainder of her time in her quarters (area L19) or her Laboratory (area L27).</p><p>Any challenge to her authority or questioning of her methods is met with unwavering confidence. She maintains a calm and composed demeanor, speaking with the precision of a scholar and the gentleness of a healer. Do not be fooled, however; she is cold and ruthless, convinced her work will liberate the world from suffering—no matter the cost.</p><p>If the characters meet Lethica and speak with her, these are her answers to some common topics:</p><p><strong>Who Are You?</strong> “I am Matron Lethica, steward of this hospital. You may think of me as a healer—one who is unafraid to confront the hardships others dare not face.”</p><p><strong>Why Do You Operate this Place?</strong> “To salve the sorrows of this senseless world. I brew the antidote to pain itself.”</p><p><strong>What Set You on this Path?</strong> “My own loss drives me. My own sorrow. All the memories which I long to forget but mustn’t. I cannot be idle until I have erased the pain from others.”</p><p><strong>Why Do You Cry?</strong> “A side effect of my work. Nothing more.” A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check determines this to be a lie.</p><p><strong>Have You Tried Lethic Serum Yourself?</strong> “I must not. I endure so others may heal.”</p><p><strong>What is the Lethic Serum?</strong> “An alchemical distillation of my own design. It has yet to fail to erase the pain of those who accept its tranquility. It is the key to salvation.”</p></div>"

Unquestioningly loyal orderlies carry out their duties under the watchful eyes of Nurse Godlee. Doctor Belkin’s surgeons operate as a well-oiled machine of experimental horrors. Even Hugo, Lethica’s hulking enforcer, bears the scars of her cruel obsession.</p><h2><strong>Hugo, the First Experiment</strong></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:10px 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Hugo.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.hLT7vvWy7nwzK9Yc]{Hugo}</strong> is Matron Lethica’s ward, bodyguard, and the ultimate proof of her alchemical ambitions. Born of a cursed fomorian bloodline, Hugo’s immense strength was overwhelmed by debilitating pain and horrific visions so severe that they harmed those around him and threatened to end his own life. His suffering drove him to Lethica during the earliest days of the hospital, where she promised comfort and relief through her alchemy. She kept her word—quieting the agony of his curse—but at the cost of turning him into a mutated servant entirely dependent on her.</p><p>The first step in silencing Hugo’s torment was to close his three eyes with needle and thread. In a short time, Hugo’s body became riddled with scars from countless surgeries. Metal tubes and implanted reservoirs ensure constant delivery of the alchemical cocktail that suppresses Hugo’s pain and emotions, though this was no mercy. Viewing Hugo as the perfect test subject due to his rapidly healing biology and seeming unwillingness to die, Lethica pushed his physical and emotional limits to advance her alchemical mastery. Despite this, Hugo’s devotion to Lethica is absolute—she soothed his pain and, in his eyes, everything she does is justified.</p><p><em><strong>Meeting Hugo.</strong></em> Accustomed to his own form of veil, Hugo relies on his other senses to navigate the world. He is attuned to the sanatorium and immediately rushes to pacify any commotion within its walls, though he mostly stalks the Second Floor to avoid disturbing new arrivals.</p><p><em><strong>Hugo’s Fate.</strong></em> Despite his near-death experience and agonizing transformation, fragments of Hugo’s sympathy and kindness survive. If he still lives when Matron Lethica is destroyed, Hugo is left adrift, overwhelmed by the loss. If approached with compassion and empathy, Hugo might abandon his violent ways and seek peace beyond the borders of Wickermoor Hollow, learning to forget the horrors he witnessed and discovering that he no longer needs Lethica to be free.</p><h2>Sarah Godlee and the Orderlies</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:10px 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Sarah_Godlee.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.VNDl4dT1f0NcMxfC]{Nurse Sarah Godlee}</strong> was one of the first to accept the Lethic Serum and serves as the second-in-command to Matron Lethica. Unlike the other orderlies, she wears no mask, as her form was only mildly contorted by the serum. Freed of the troubles that hindered her former life, she now runs the sanatorium’s night-to-night operations as its undisputed enforcer. While Matron Lethica cloaks her methods in gentleness, Godlee prefers intimidation, control, and cruelty.</p><p>Godlee thrives on power, both over the orderlies under her command and the patients she claims to care for. She sometimes pilfers valuables from the patients to indulge her sense of authority.</p><p>Nurse Godlee deeply admires Matron Lethica to the point of obsession, finding her employer’s decades-long grief over her husband a constant source of pain. She wishes for Lethica to let go of her past and forget Marius Renathyr just like the patients of the hospital. She believes removing collected mementos to be the right step, but would never dare cross her matron. However, she will find common cause with the characters if they can convince her they wish to help.</p><p><em><strong>Meeting Nurse Godlee.</strong></em> When the characters first enter the hospital, Nurse Godlee is overseeing the patients’ mealtime in the Common Room (area L9) on the First Floor. During waking hours, she retires to her quarters (area L17) to watch over the Airing Grounds (area L10) or tour the sanatorium to instruct Hugo and the other orderlies.</p><p><em><strong>The Veiled Orderlies.</strong></em> All fifteen of the orderlies who now preside over the sanatorium were formerly patients. Each of them wears the same, matching uniform. They also don stark white porcelain masks to conceal the unsightly deformities left by the Lethic Serum. While they are still capable of reasoning, the orderlies obey the commands of Matron Lethica and Nurse Godlee without question.</p><h2>Doctor Belkin and the Surgeons</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Doctor_Belkin.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.BFRyWTWq2dJGFKye]{Doctor Belkin}</strong> is the architect of Memory’s Rest’s most horrifying experiments. When Belkin was first exposed to the Lethic Serum, its effects on him were unique. His mind opened to the White Worm’s influence, and he was found the following night in the caverns below the hospital having removed the top of his own skull—a colony of pale, writhing larvae now burrow within, driving his every thought. The White Worm had revealed the “truth”: salvation lies not in erasing trauma but in perfect symbiosis with the worm’s parasitic gifts.</p><p>Belkin is a fierce disciple of Matron Lethica, and he believes in spreading the White Worm’s influence to elevate all beings to a higher state of existence. His experiments focus on creating mutated hosts for more worms, ensuring their spread to the wider world. His reverence for his alien deity is immense, and Belkin is always looking for new converts to worship the worm. He will find common cause with the characters if made to believe they are genuinely interested in serving the eldritch entity.</p><p>When operating on the first floor of the sanatorium, the doctor hides his exposed brain with a surgery cap, bringing a calming demeanor to his nervous patients. He will treat the characters with kindness, but if he perceives the characters as a threat to the White Worm, he will unleash his experiments and surgeons to eliminate them.</p><p><em><strong>Meeting Doctor Belkin.</strong></em> Doctor Belkin spends most of his time in the Experimental Wing of the Second Floor monitoring his trials and testing subjects he thinks are strong enough to survive his extreme procedures. To maintain appearances, Belkin also conducts medical examinations for new admissions, using these moments to evaluate potential candidates for his operations.</p><p><em><strong>The Wormhost Surgeons.</strong></em> Belkin’s six acolytes have survived similar procedures under his scalpel. They are now extensions of his will, hosting their own colonies of parasites. To conceal their deformities, they wear bloodied surgical smocks, masks, and caps, though the faint squish of the larvae beneath their flesh often betrays them.</p><p>The surgeons work in chilling synchronization, communicating in low, guttural gurgles. While outwardly loyal to Belkin, their true allegiance lies with the White Worm.</p><h2>Patients of Memory’s Rest</h2><p>The patients (neutral, human noncombatant <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners}</strong>) of Memory’s Rest Sanatorium represent a wide spectrum of suffering from every corner of Wickermoor Hollow. Each has been admitted seeking relief, only to become unwitting subjects in Matron Lethica’s experimental pursuits. All patients within Memory’s Rest are under the effects of the Lethic Serum, which relieves whatever malady brought them here but erases their memories and identity. The patients in the Patient Register table could be met by the characters during their stay in Memory’s Rest, though it is not comprehensive.</p><p>You choose where a patient is within Memory’s Rest at any given time, whether they are alone or escorted, and what their condition is.

When it is injected into a Humanoid as an action, the target takes [[/damage 2d6 poison]] damage and must make a [[/save CON DC 21]]saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s speed becomes 0, it becomes &amp;reference[poisoned apply=false] for 8 hours, and it becomes &amp;refrence[stunned apply=false] while poisoned in this way. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of every hour, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target succeeds on the initial save, it becomes incapacitated for 1 hour. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>Success or failure, for the next 24 hours, the target can't remember anything from before it was injected by the serum. Until the target's memories return, it has disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks.</p><p>If a Humanoid is injected with the serum again while already poisoned by it, the target loses all of its memories permanently and suffers a mutation in 1d4 hours as determined by the Serum Effect table below.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.xxP4PjU1vXRGNnfR]{Serum Effect}</strong></em></p><h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3><p>Only an antidote can fully restore memories suppressed or removed by the Lethic Serum. A creature that has transformed into a mutant nurse can also be rejuvenated by the antidote, returning to its former self after a long rest.</p><p>To concoct the solution, its ingredients must be found and combined in a special alchemical process. Characters can learn of this antidote through clues found in the sanatorium, reading Lethica’s serum diagrams in her quarters (area L19), or by succeeding on a [[/check ARC DC 21]] or [[/check MED DC 21]] check after spending 1 hour analyzing a creature affected by the Lethic Serum. The antidote requires three ingredients:</p><p><strong>Mnemonic Residue. </strong>A silvery lavender ash harvested from the Crematorium (area L18), formed only by the incineration of creatures infused with Lethic Serum</p><p><strong>Noetic Extract.</strong> A pale viscous fluid siphoned from brains preserved in Monster Containment (area L22)</p><p><strong>Unrefined Ichor.</strong> An amethyst-purple liquid produced by the White Worm, found in Lethica’s Quarters (area L19), the Laboratory (area L27), or the Grotto of Tears</p><p>When all ingredients have been gathered, a character can craft the antidote in the Laboratory (area L27) or by using an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.i89okN7GFTWHsvPy]{herbalism kit} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.SztwZhbhZeCqyAes]{alchemist's supplies}. A successful [[/check ARC DC 18]] check or [[/check INT DC 13]] (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.SztwZhbhZeCqyAes]{alchemist's supplies}) check produces 1 dose per 10 minutes of work and consumes the ingredients. Failure depletes one random ingredient but does not destroy the others.</p><p>As an action or a bonus action, the antidote can be loaded into a syringe or injector. It can be injected into a creature with an action.</p><h2>Lockdown</h2><p>When Lockdown is triggered, Memory’s Rest Sanatorium transforms into a prison designed to contain patients, alchemical secrets, and intruders alike. Lockdown ensures control is maintained and that any threat to Lethica’s work is crushed.</p><p>At your discretion, Lockdown can be initiated whenever combat breaks out, a patient goes missing, a body is found, or a member of the staff suspects foul play. Covert panels are located every 20 feet along the corridors on both the First and Second Floor, which require a ward key to activate. These panels can be forced open and activated with a successful [[/check SLT DC 25]] @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.woWZ1sO5IUVGzo58]{thieves' tools}. Hidden switches are also located in the Matron’s Office (area L4) and Nurse Stations (area L5).</p><p><em><strong>Receding Light.</strong></em> The glass tubes that illuminate Memory’s Rest don’t immediately blink off when Lockdown occurs. As the glowing steam within the tubes vents out of the facility and through the Engineering Room (area L20), its violet light rushes out of rooms over the course of 3 rounds and retreats down hallways as though being chased by the shadows (see “Creeping Dark” below).</p><p><em><strong>Wailing Siren.</strong></em> As the light recedes, an ear-splitting alarm like a pained scream reverberates through the building and is loud enough to be heard across the entire island (see “Engineering Room” later in this chapter). It lasts 5 rounds before fading.</p><p><em><strong>Time-out.</strong></em> When the orderlies hear the siren, unless there is an immediate threat, they prioritize sedating all patients on the First Floor with their Inject action (dealing no damage), rendering them unconscious. Once this task is complete, they begin a thorough search through the sanatorium to find and eliminate danger and to communicate with senior staff like Nurse Godlee and Matron Lethica.</p><p>Doctor Belkin and his surgeons congregate in the Experiment Lab (area L26) and Monster Containment (area L22) to keep their experiments out of danger during Lockdown. Unless the source of danger is obvious, Hugo (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.mkR54wUHh2EX8eY6]{Serum Brute}</strong>*) patrols the main hallways and is hostile to any creature that isn’t a staff member. Lethica calmly makes her way back to her Laboratory (area L27) in the event of a Lockdown to ensure her research is safe before returning to the sanatorium halls.</p><p>During Lockdown, Memory’s Rest Sanatorium has the following features:</p><p><strong>Creeping Dark.</strong> Magic that suppresses sight fills the hospital, halving the range of all light sources and darkvision.</p><p><strong>Self-Acting Locks.</strong> Closed doors lock themselves, or lock automatically when they are closed. Elevators cease to function.</p><p>Only Lethica can authorize the end of Lockdown, which is typically performed by Nurse Godlee in the Engineering Room (area L20).</p><p><em><strong>Subdued and Sedated.</strong></em> If the characters are overwhelmed in combat, they are not killed. They awaken in the Sedation Hall (area L16), revived with 1 hit point. Their equipment is replaced with hospital gowns, and they are surrounded by Lethica and her orderlies. This is a disastrous scenario that can mark the end of the campaign without clever negotiation, luck, or external help.</p></div>"

Fix your gaze on the brilliant, many-colored lanterns and the ever-grinning Chuckles the Clown! Those cries in the night? Simply howls of delight, nothing more. The Fallen are defeated! The Fool’s Day Festival will be happy. It must be happy.

This wicked clown has a perverse death wish and seeks to goad the characters into slaying him as his own ritual sacrifice. While he brings joy to the townsfolk, Chuckles delights in mocking the characters, belittling their previous exploits, and even attacking villagers they care about, so long as it brings them one step closer to killing him. The characters’ goals are:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p7\">Play carnival games to earn tickets.</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Rescue the forced revelers through tickets or combat or by severing their enchantments.</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Free Phillip and Adela Druskenvald from their forced revelry.</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Destroy Chuckles, the Lord of Fools.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, you should review Wickermoor Hollow’s townsfolk (see “Forced Revelers” below) to decide the most compelling NPCs to include in this chapter. Read through the festival events (see “Festival of Fools Locations” below) so you can smoothly run games for the characters. Finally, study the climactic battle, “Parade of Fools,” to fill the encounter with menace and hilarity.</p><p class=\"p8\">This chapter is designed for four level 10 characters.</p>",

Though Wickermoor Hollow is draped in shadow and fear, the lights of the Fool’s Day Festival pierce the gloom. Of all the celebrations in Wickermoor Village, none is more cherished—rife with costumed revelers, dancing bears, grand feasts, and lamplight dances.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Ignore the sinister fact that people vanish each festival night. Fix your gaze on the brilliant, many-colored lanterns and the ever-grinning Chuckles the Clown! Those cries in the night? Simply howls of delight, nothing more. The Fallen are defeated! The Fool’s Day Festival will be happy. It must be happy. The parade is coming, and you will be so, <em>soooo</em> happy.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Fool’s Day Festival consumes Wickermoor Village, led by Chuckles, Lord of Fools. This wicked clown has a perverse death wish and seeks to goad the characters into slaying him as his own ritual sacrifice. While he brings joy to the townsfolk, Chuckles delights in mocking the characters, belittling their previous exploits, and even attacking villagers they care about, so long as it brings them one step closer to killing him. The characters’ goals are:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p7\">Play carnival games to earn tickets.</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Rescue the forced revelers through tickets or combat or by severing their enchantments.</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Free Phillip and Adela Druskenvald from their forced revelry.</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Destroy Chuckles, the Lord of Fools.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, you should review Wickermoor Hollow’s townsfolk (see “Forced Revelers” below) to decide the most compelling NPCs to include in this chapter. Read through the festival events (see “Festival of Fools Locations” below) so you can smoothly run games for the characters. Finally, study the climactic battle, “Parade of Fools,” to fill the encounter with menace and hilarity.</p><p class=\"p8\">This chapter is designed for four level 10 characters.</p></div>"

            "The Lord of Fools": {
              "name": "The Lord of Fools",
              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap21\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Lord of Fools</p><p><span class=\"s7\">Chuckles, Lord of Fools, is an evil spirit in clownish guise. He dances and cavorts as the malevolent jester of the Horned King, tormenting mortals for his master’s vile amusement. Chuckles’s true form is a grotesque balloon with a leering clown’s face, draped in multicolored ribbons, usually resting atop a maypole. This totem projects a puppet-like jester illusion that calls itself Chuckles, luring victims into a false sense of security.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Tears of a Clown</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Chuckles.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Once, long ago, a troupe of performers roamed the lands of Druskenvald. Each had their role: Bjorn the Horned Bear, Apia the Queen Bee, Chateau the Dancing Manor, Libro the Singing Tome, Cloche the Chiming Bell, and Cicogna the Stilted Stork. Leading them all was Chuckles the Great Fool.</p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">Though Chuckles played the merry fool on stage, his heart was heavy, for his troupe, though beloved, was starving and impoverished. Clowning brought little coin. His tears caught the attention of the woman with a crooked smile, who whispered of a wonderful king who could erase his troubles if he would become his jester.</span></p><p class=\"p8\">Desperate, Chuckles followed the Crooked Queen into the Wytchwood and communed with the Horned King, whose power grew each year. Chuckles, driven by despair, would do anything for his troupe.</p><p class=\"p8\">“Anything?” asked the Horned King.</p><p class=\"p8\">“Anything,” said Chuckles, foolishly.</p><p class=\"p8\">“Forever?” asked the Horned King.</p><p class=\"p8\">“Forever,” said Chuckles, sealing his doom.</p><p class=\"p8\">Chuckles is now nothing more than a spirit dancing futilely at the right hand of the Horned King, yearning for death’s sweet release. If Chuckles frees his king, he too is set free. For ages, he has danced, waiting for the Fallen to be sacrificed. Now, he has arranged to be the final sacrifice for the Horned King, just as Adela Druskenvald will be for the Crooked Queen.</p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">This masterstroke will prepare the Horned King’s spirit for incarnation through Phillip Druskenvald (see chapter 8), releasing Chuckles from his cursed servitude and letting him dance into the night one last time.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Parley with THE FOOL</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Lord of Fools views life as a cruel, endless joke, trapped in a wretched role as the Horned King’s jester. He craves not just the characters’ participation in his games but their hatred. Their wrath and other deadly sins are the true feast for the Horned King.</p><p class=\"p8\">These are some responses to common questions the characters may ask of this wicked clown:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Who Are You?</strong> “Sweet sweeties, I’m Chuckles the Great Fool! There isn’t a person alive who doesn’t love my japes ‘n jokes. So if you don’t… then you must already be dead!”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>How Do You Know Us?</strong> “Why wouldn’t we know who you are? You’re known far and wide as the heroes who are finally cleaning up Wickymoor Hollow!” (Chuckles is an agent of the Horned King and has been using <em>Scrying</em> to observe the characters.)</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Why Are You Happy to See Us?</strong> “I’m a kooky-crazy clown, sillies! And it’s festy-val time! Can’t I enjoy my own party?” (The characters are his only hope of escaping his torturous existence as the Horned King’s jester!)</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What is this Festival?</strong> “Fool’s Day is a way to escape the sad-sad-suffering of this sad-sad-world. Don’t you want people to be happy? Besides, this year’s festy-val is speci-all.” (Fool’s Day is an age-old tradition, but this one is special.)</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Special, Huh?</strong> “Because of you, my hip-hip-heroes! You’re the guests of honor! The cream of the crop! The slayers of the fabulous Fallen! We’ve never had killers like you in our midst!” (This is the unvarnished truth. Even if it’s omitting the bit about the ritual.)</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_FOOLS_Seeking%20out%20the%20Revelers_Finished-LARGE%20VERSION.webp\" /></div>"

When the characters arrive back in town from their last adventure, the Fool’s Day Festival will begin soon or is already in progress, as determined by you (see “A Puckish Dream” below). The Lord of Fools plans to ruthlessly antagonize the characters, turning their former friends from Wickermoor Village into their enemies.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Forced Revelers</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">This chapter works best if the characters have become close with some NPCs in Wickermoor Village.</p><p class=\"p8\">These NPCs have become bewitched by the Lord of Fools, forced to don garish costumes and party endlessly. The forced revelers:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p7\">Have the Charmed condition</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Are Friendly and are delighted to be a part of the festival in their mesmerized state</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Don’t become Hostile or attack unless attacked or forced to make a saving throw</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Characters are able to free a charmed reveler by:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p7\">Cashing in tickets at the Prize Counter (area C3)</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Reducing a reveler to 0 hit points</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Any effect that ends the Charmed condition</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Bringing them to the Silent Church (area C5)</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Select twelve NPCs from the Forced Revelers table or use NPCs that the characters have formed bonds with.

If the characters search for these figures instead of playing Chuckles’s ridiculous games, they can ask around the festival for clues. After spending 1 hour searching, any participating characters make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check. Compare the check's total to the “Carnival Cavalcade” table.

It laughs until blood spurts from its nose and then crashes down onto Wickermoor Hollow, setting the valley ablaze. They awake with a jolt, hearing the festival outside.

A successful [[/check INS DC 8]] check reveals that these two are without a doubt Phillip and Adela, but the way they act like nothing is amiss is unsettling; it’s as if the wounds and blood are nothing more than stage makeup, and it is clear that the Druskenvalds are in a state of delirium.</p><p class=\"p8\">Before the characters investigate further, Chuckles cartwheels in.

All that’s left is to kill you… or me. Either way, what an entrance.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">At least three revelers dance around the maypole. When this fight begins, check how many of the captured villagers (see “Forced Revelers” earlier in this chapter) were not saved. They are present here and are magically compelled to dance around the maypole with their masks removed, screaming for help.

Yorgrim, the necropolis’s caretaker, stands alone against a rising tide of undeath, slowly corrupted by the incessant whispers of the malicious, ravening spirits he has sworn to entomb and imprison. Unless aided by the characters, the jailer will break, and a wave of shrieking spirits will crash upon Wickermoor Hollow and devour every living soul within.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Maidenmist Cemetery sprawls across the fogbound, rolling hills to the southeast of Wickermoor Village, riddled with headstones, crypts, mausoleums, and every other kind of grave marker. It serves as the final resting place for all mortal beings in Wickermoor Hollow and has done so for millennia. None know who first built the cemetery, for it has always been there. It is said that the wrought iron fence that surrounds it inches forward night by night, forever welcoming the endlessly increasing deceased.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">For years, a ghostly orc known as Yorgrim has served as the sole gravedigger and sexton of the cemetery. However, he is not just a caretaker for the dead that he buries and for whom he performs the final rites. He also serves as a warden, for the cemetery’s true purpose is a prison for thousands of screaming spirits that seek only to corrupt and consume the souls of both the living and the dead.</p><p class=\"p7\">The cemetery’s secret is that it was built upon a tear into the Shroud, which normally serves as an impenetrable barrier around Druskenvald, but here it serves as a gateway for the twisted spirits to cross over into the realm freely. These souls are filled with inhuman wrath for being deprived of a true afterlife; left unchecked, they would spill across the valley and the entire domain beyond, feasting upon the living.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The haunted hills of Maidenmist Cemetery have never been safe for the living, but the warding lights of the necropolis have gone out, and their caretaker slowly succumbs to the corruption of the Shroud. Now, the cemetery is a prison overrun with rioting dead. Only the relighting of the balefire beacons and the sealing of the tear into the Shroud can stop the coming tide of death. Characters who are drawn to Maidenmist Cemetery by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Find Yorgrim, the Gravedigger.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Light the five extinguished balefire beacons.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Discover the source of the dead’s corruption within the sepulcher.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy the Chained Reaper and seal the tear to the Shroud.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Yorgrim, the key NPC, to convincingly convey his grim duty and descent into corruption. Refresh yourself on the stories of the other Fallen (see chapter 8) to provide the characters with inspiration in performing their rites. Review the locations of Maidenmist Cemetery so you are prepared to improvise encounters as the characters explore.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 9 characters.</p>",

I am but one light in the darkness. One soul against the crushing weight of the hate and hunger of death. It is happening. It is inevitable. I will break, and so will the chains around the shrieking dead. My friends... Forgive me... I have failed...”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>- Yorgrim, the Gravedigger -</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The gates of Maidenmist Cemetery have burst open, and the raging dead rise from their graves to escape. Yorgrim, the necropolis’s caretaker, stands alone against a rising tide of undeath, slowly corrupted by the incessant whispers of the malicious, ravening spirits he has sworn to entomb and imprison. Unless aided by the characters, the jailer will break, and a wave of shrieking spirits will crash upon Wickermoor Hollow and devour every living soul within.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>Maidenmist Cemetery sprawls across the fogbound, rolling hills to the southeast of Wickermoor Village, riddled with headstones, crypts, mausoleums, and every other kind of grave marker. It serves as the final resting place for all mortal beings in Wickermoor Hollow and has done so for millennia. None know who first built the cemetery, for it has always been there. It is said that the wrought iron fence that surrounds it inches forward night by night, forever welcoming the endlessly increasing deceased.</p><p>For years, a ghostly orc known as Yorgrim has served as the sole gravedigger and sexton of the cemetery. However, he is not just a caretaker for the dead that he buries and for whom he performs the final rites. He also serves as a warden, for the cemetery’s true purpose is a prison for thousands of screaming spirits that seek only to corrupt and consume the souls of both the living and the dead.</p><p>The cemetery’s secret is that it was built upon a tear into the Shroud, which normally serves as an impenetrable barrier around Druskenvald, but here it serves as a gateway for the twisted spirits to cross over into the realm freely. These souls are filled with inhuman wrath for being deprived of a true afterlife; left unchecked, they would spill across the valley and the entire domain beyond, feasting upon the living.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>The haunted hills of Maidenmist Cemetery have never been safe for the living, but the warding lights of the necropolis have gone out, and their caretaker slowly succumbs to the corruption of the Shroud. Now, the cemetery is a prison overrun with rioting dead. Only the relighting of the balefire beacons and the sealing of the tear into the Shroud can stop the coming tide of death. Characters who are drawn to Maidenmist Cemetery by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p>Find Yorgrim, the Gravedigger.</p></li><li><p>Light the five extinguished balefire beacons.</p></li><li><p>Discover the source of the dead’s corruption within the sepulcher.</p></li><li><p>Destroy the Chained Reaper and seal the tear to the Shroud.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Yorgrim, the key NPC, to convincingly convey his grim duty and descent into corruption. Refresh yourself on the stories of the other Fallen (see chapter 8) to provide the characters with inspiration in performing their rites. Review the locations of Maidenmist Cemetery so you are prepared to improvise encounters as the characters explore.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 9th level characters.</p></div>"

Haunted by the failures of his past and the loss of his friends to their respective sins, he goes about his duties with grim determination, never relenting despite the constant cracking of his soul and the chains that bind the spirits he keeps imprisoned.</p><h2>The Penitent Pilgrim</h2><p>Before coming to Druskenvald, Yorgrim was a seer for his people, the orcs of the Shadestone Clan. He communed with the spirits of the deceased, performing their burial rites and guiding them to the afterlife. However, he was deceived by his chieftain and unwittingly performed a necromantic ritual that slaughtered his entire community and annihilated their souls with unspeakable and forbidden power.</p><p>Yorgrim took his vengeance, but it was a hollow victory. His people were dead, and their souls would never find peace. As a self-imposed penance, the seer etched the name of every fallen orc onto a heavy stone that he chained to himself, committing to carrying the weight forever as he sought to wander the land and bring peace to souls that were not yet beyond help.</p><p>For years, Yorgrim trudged across the land, a dour pilgrim performing burial rites for countless souls until his body finally gave out beneath the crushing weight of his penance. However, his spirit did not yield, and he arrived in Druskenvald not reborn but instead fated to forever exist as a ghost, still chained to the heavy gravestone even in death.</p><p>In this new realm, with so many restless dead in need of peace, Yorgrim wandered Druskenvald, performing rites alone until he finally made connections with five other souls as powerful and burdened as his. Despite his gloomy disposition, Yorgrim developed an affection for and eventual friendship with Ol’ Jericho Sticks, Sir Marius Renathyr, Captain Briggsy Kratch, Lethica Nightborne, and Farryn of the Greenwood, regularly visiting each throughout his wayward travels.</p><h2>The Shroud Warden</h2><p>Shortly after meeting his new friends and softening his stony heart, he discovered the mysterious Maidenmist Cemetery in Wickermoor Hollow. Deep within the sepulcher at the center of the necropolis was a small tear into the primordial mists of death called the Shroud (see chapter 1), and the shrieks and whispers of the tortured souls within concerned Yorgrim deeply. He feared an apocalyptic reckoning should the shrouded abominations freely pass into Druskenvald.</p><p>Feeling as if he had discovered his true purpose, he bound himself to the cemetery and took up the mantle of its sexton and gravedigger, performing the burial rites for the thousands of dead he found there. His duty was to provide this service for every new death in Wickermoor Hollow. This prevented the spirits of the Shroud from slipping through to possess and reanimate the corpses that lay within the earth of the necropolis.</p><p>However, as the years went on, the tear to the Shroud grew larger, and Yorgrim beseeched his friends for aid. All agreed, and each of the six unlikely companions offered a fragment of their soul to kindle great braziers of spectral balefire, the light of which repelled the Shroud and the abominable spirits within.</p><p>After parting ways, Yorgrim would never see his friends again; the lighting of the beacons bound him to the cemetery as a jailer and warden of the shrieking spirits and occasionally restless dead within. In his duty, he took up a lantern tethered to the anima of his soul that serves as his primary weapon and tool to keep the unruly spirits chained.</p><p>As each of his former friends fell one by one to the sin of the Horned King, the balefire beacons dimmed greatly, and Yorgrim’s nightly duties became far more challenging. When the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> crashed into Wickermoor Hollow, bringing the ghastly fog of the Shroud with it, the tear in the sepulcher grew immensely. And following the deaths of each of the Fallen, their respective balefire beacons have gone completely dark. Now, Yorgrim expends every measure of his being to keep the riotous and raging dead from spilling forth, his own soul weakening with every passing night.</p><h2>Parley with the Gravedigger</h2><p>Yorgrim is dour, grim, and stoic, but he is not cruel. He views the characters as the only hope to relight the balefire beacons and investigate the source of the Shroud. He is not talkative and speaks with few words but doesn’t withhold important information that the characters need to know.</p><p>These are some responses to common questions the characters may ask of this spectral sextant:</p><p><strong>Who Are You?</strong> “I am called Yorgrim. This is my cemetery. I serve the dead here.”</p><p><strong>What Is this Place?</strong> “The graves of Maidenmist bear the dead of the hollow. Centuries of souls rest here. It was here before me. It will be here after me.”</p><p><strong>Are You Dead?</strong> “My life ended long ago, but my duty did not. It persists until I atone for my sins and failures. This is my burden to bear.”</p><p><strong>Who Is the Dog?</strong> “This is Isolde. She is a grim, a spirit bound in duty to the dead. We are of a kind. She is my sole companion.”</p><p><strong>What Is the Shroud?</strong> “The Shroud is an element. Like the air you breathe and the earth you stand upon. It is death incarnate. It should not be here. Not even in an afterlife.”</p><p><strong>What Are the Shrouded?</strong> “Souls once living but devoured and corrupted by the Shroud. They have lost everything they once were in life. Abominations.”</p><p><strong>You Were Friends?</strong> “The monsters you killed were my friends. Before they succumbed to corruption, they had strong wills and good hearts, like you. They fell to their burdens, like you might yet. None are immune to the weight of failure.”</p><p><strong>Why Would We Perform Rites for Villains?</strong> “We will not perform the rites for the evil you faced. We do not mourn the Crimson Abbot, the Grinning Sinner, or the rest. I mourn who they were when there was light in their souls. It is for them we perform the rites. It is the only way.”</p><h2>Isolde, the Grim</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Isolde.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>After isolating himself, Yorgrim found companionship in <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.UCktkgladT4vEA8K]{Isolde (ih-ZOAL-duh)}</strong>, a type of guardian spirit known as a grim. These spectral watchers guard cemeteries, graveyards, and other burial sites and can take the form of any animal. Isolde (neutral good <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.qoFEjfrANBdrCP6m]{Ghost}</strong>) manifests as a black hound with bright white eyes. She is deeply loyal to Yorgrim, and carries in her mouth a hooded lantern lit with a spark of the gravedigger’s soul.</p><p>While Isolde is similarly bound to Maidenmist Cemetery like her master, she is able to exit its cold iron gates and walk beyond its borders. In recent years, she has served as the primary messenger between Yorgrim and Mori Shade, the undertaker of Wickermoor Village. With a supernatural intuition that only a dog can possess, she can sense that Yorgrim is suffering from the gibbering of the Shroud and is close to breaking.</p><h2>The Shrouded</h2><p>The shrouded are malicious, ravenous spirits entirely stripped of their anima—the soul-stuff that retains an individual spirit's essence and identity. Having lost whoever they might have been in life, the shrouded exist as devouring forces of the primordial element of death itself, filled only with the hunger to corrupt and consume souls that retain their anima, whether they be living or dead. They only feel rage and hate for those who don't share their fate, forever drifting through the Shroud and seeking new prey to corrupt into shrouded themselves.</p><p>In Maidenmist Cemetery, numerous shrouded have spilled forth from the tear in the depths of the great sepulcher, and some have even slithered out between the cracks of the ancient tomb. They drift through the ghastly rolling fogbanks or possess the corpses once interred in the earth but now shamble about the necropolis.</p></div>"

Alarm bells toll from the clocktower, and if the characters do not dispatch the Undead, the ghasts are brought down by a rallied militia of armed townsfolk (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS]{Guards}</strong>) led by Constable Doris Squire (lawful neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knight}</strong>), suffering heavy losses.</p><p>After the ghasts are defeated, a character who succeeds on a [[/check MED DC 10]] or [[/check INV DC 10]] check can deduce that the risen corpses had been dead for varying lengths of time, with the oldest ghast having been dead for centuries and the freshest one only several weeks deceased.</p><p>Mori Shade (see chapter 11) arrives shortly after the battle and recognizes the most recently deceased corpse as Gregor Bolton, a once-burly workman who died from a fall while repairing the roof of Mayor Somerton’s manor.

She then works with the townsfolk to collect the corpses from the battle and the funeral home, piling them on the outskirts of town to burn them, ensuring that they do not rise in undeath. If the characters interrupt the burning, the ghasts rise once more during the Dusk Hour of the following night.</p><p>If the characters fail to act, another group of townsfolk volunteers to make the journey to the cemetery. They never return, and can be found shambling among the Endless Gravestones (area Y3) as <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW]{Zombies}</strong>.

It has existed for centuries, its original builders lost to time. Countless dead rest here through every manner of burial and interment, and each of the thousands of grave markers that cover the land is never more than a few feet away from the next.</p><h2>Through Cold Iron Gates </h2><p>It takes approximately half a night’s travel southeast at a normal pace to reach the edge of Maidenmist Cemetery from Wickermoor Village, crossing the Silverbell River by way of an old cobblestone bridge. With each passing mile, the landscape becomes increasingly foggy, and the air grows colder. When the characters arrive at the cemetery, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The night is strangely cold and quiet as you arrive at Maidenmist Cemetery. A tall iron fence stretches out on either side of you, with thick, tightly spaced pickets that look like prison bars. The gate, flanked by metal sculptures of hooded reapers, hangs askew, bent as if it had been smashed open from the inside. The landscape before you, dotted with thousands of tombstones, rises in elevation before disappearing into the dense fog that shrouds the hills, wisps of blue-green mist billowing amidst the gray. A faint wail sounds from somewhere in the rolling fog.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>A 15-foot-tall iron fence encircles the entirety of Maidenmist Cemetery, its base heavily reinforced with stone. A Tiny creature can pass through the fence’s narrow pickets.</p><p>A character who examines the bent gate and succeeds on a [[/check INV DC 13]] check finds a 50-foot chain in the damp earth, along with several broken links, as if it snapped from a single violent thrust against the inside of the gate.</p><p>A cobblestone path leads into the cemetery up the hill, but it disappears into the fog. The blue-green mist is reminiscent of the Shroud, which the characters experienced during their trip aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>.</p><h2>Maidenmist Cemetery Features</h2><p>Unless otherwise noted, Maidenmist Cemetery has the following features:</p><p><strong>Ghastly Mist.</strong> Eerie, billowing mist rolls across the landscape. The entire cemetery is lightly obscured out to 60 feet, and heavily obscured beyond that distance.</p><p><strong>Lighting.</strong> The light of the Crooked Moon is caught and refracted in the mist, bathing the cemetery in dim light.</p><p><strong>Shrouded Spirits.</strong> Corrupted spirits lurk in the mist, searching for souls to devour. Every hour that the characters travel through the mist, three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.S5NNrWLkqfQKTs1h]{Shrouded}</strong>* (one of each variant) attack until they are destroyed.</p><p><strong>Wails of the Damned.</strong> The mist of the cemetery is interwoven with the Shroud, and the shrieking souls within wail incessantly. Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration have disadvantage.</p><p><strong>Corrupting Shroud.</strong> If a creature that isn’t a shrouded dies in the cemetery, it is corrupted by the Shroud and rises 10 minutes later, hostile toward all creatures that aren’t Undead. A Humanoid rises as an Undead, as determined on the Restless Dead table below. An Undead creature rises as a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.S5NNrWLkqfQKTs1h]{Shrouded}</strong>* (random variant).</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.X9e27C3qbrYU6rOb]{Restless Dead}</strong></em></p><h2>The Phantom Gravedigger</h2><p>While Yorgrim clings to his identity and duty, the weight of his penance and the insurmountable struggle against the tide of undeath has taken a toll on the gravedigger. His spirit is weak, tired, and fated to become the malevolent Chained Reaper. Before this transformation takes place in the Tomb of the Shrouded (area Y15), his shade can barely interact with the physical world, with most of his remaining power focused in the spectral lantern he always carries.</p><p>Therefore, when Yorgrim (found in area Y2) joins the characters in Maidenmist Cemetery, he doesn't use a stat block, has immunity to all damage, and can’t be affected by spells or other magical effects. His size is Medium, and he has a speed of 30 feet. He can move through other creatures and can share a space with them.</p><h3><strong>Balefire Lantern</strong></h3><p>Yorgrim carries a spectral azure lantern that is as incorporeal as he is, which sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once all six balefire beacons are lit, the lantern dims, shedding bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.</p><p>The lantern has the following features:</p><p><strong>Azure Protection.</strong> Creatures in the lantern’s bright light are immune to the Shrouded Spirits and Corrupting Shroud features (see “Maidenmist Cemetery Features” earlier in this chapter) of the cemetery’s mist.</p><p><strong>Balefire Warding. </strong>All<strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.S5NNrWLkqfQKTs1h]{Shrouded}</strong>* cannot enter the lantern’s bright light. Shrouded in the lantern’s light have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.</p><h3><strong>Gravedigger Actions</strong></h3><p>While Yorgrim is generally unable to interact with the physical world, when the characters are in danger, he summons up what little strength he has left to help.</p><p>While carrying the balefire lantern, on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Yorgrim causes one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><p><strong>Balefire Burst.</strong> Yorgrim’s lantern erupts with balefire. Each creature of Yorgrim's choice within the lantern’s bright light must make a [[/save DEX DC 15]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 1d8 fire]]{4 (1d8)} fire damage and [[/damage 1d8 necrotic]]{4 (1d8)} necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Chained Phantom</strong>. Yorgrim hurls a spectral chain to bind a foe. One creature Yorgrim can see within the lantern’s light must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 15]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[restrained apply=false] for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. </p><p><strong>Garish Light.</strong> Yorgrim unleashes a blinding flare from his lantern. Each creature of Yorgrim's choice within the lantern’s bright light must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[blinded apply=false] until initiative count 20 on the following round.</p><p><strong>Grave Resilience.</strong> Yorgrim's lantern imparts vitality. Each creature of Yorgrim's choice within the lantern’s light gains [[/damage 2d12 temp]]{13 (2d12) temporary hit points}.</p><h2>Balefire Beacons</h2><p>Six beacons of balefire, each with its own hue, are meant to roar in braziers around the cemetery to ward it from the encroaching Shroud. Five have gone dark and must be reignited to banish the eldritch fog and the vicious spirits within from all outdoor locations of Maidenmist Cemetery. This is the only way to open the doors to the Great Sepulcher (area Y2) so that the characters and Yorgrim can investigate the growing tear in the Shroud deep beneath the cemetery.</p><p>The balefire beacons have gone out following the deaths of the Fallen, the powerful beings whose souls were used to spark the flames. To reignite these beacons, the characters must travel across the cemetery to assist Yorgrim in performing each of the Fallen’s final rites at their flame’s respective brazier. The beacons, their locations, and the Fallen whose souls they were sparked from are as follows:</p><p><strong>Crimson Beacon.</strong> Flame of Sir Marius Renathyr (see chapter 14), found in the Highborn Crypts (area Y4).</p><p><strong>Violet Beacon.</strong> Flame of Lethica Nightborne (see chapter 17), found in the Cremation Gardens (area Y5).</p><p><strong>Amber Beacon.</strong> Flame of Ol’ Jericho Sticks (see chapter 13), found in the Potter’s Field (area Y6).</p><p><strong>Magenta Beacon.</strong> Flame of Captain Briggsy Kratch (see chapter 15), found in the Mausoleum Lanes (area Y7).</p><p><strong>Emerald Beacon.</strong> Flame of Farryn of the Greenwood (see chapter 18), found in the Burial Mounds (area Y8).</p><p><strong>Azure Beacon.</strong> Flame of Yorgrim, found in the Shadestone Sanctuary (area Y9).</p><p>The Azure Beacon is the only one that remains ablaze. When each of the remaining five beacons is lit, its corresponding sconce above the doors of the Great Sepulcher (area Y2) and within the Balefire Chamber (area Y11) lights with the same-colored flame. When all six beacons are lit, the sepulcher's doors unseal.</p><h3><strong>Final rites</strong></h3><p>To perform the final rites of the Fallen, a 1-minute ritual led by Yorgrim must be conducted at a balefire brazier. During the ritual, the characters must slay the attacking monsters and succeed on six ability checks. The specific details to complete the ritual are as follows:</p><p><strong>Spark the Flame.</strong> Special kindling connected to the Fallen, kept entombed at the respective cemetery location, must be placed in the brazier and ignited, beginning the ritual. Roll initiative! If 1 minute passes without the beacon becoming fully lit, the flame goes out, and a character can offer a fragment of their soul to restore the kindling, gaining 1 level of exhaustion. The characters can then attempt the ritual again.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice a Soul.</strong> The ignition of the flame draws the attention of hostile cemetery monsters corrupted by the Shroud, committed to preventing the beacon from being lit. These monsters must be slain during the ritual as an offering to the balefire (see \"The Beacon is Lit\" below).</p><p><strong>Hold Back the Shroud.</strong> The ravenous Shroud is drawn to the ritual, kept at bay with immense effort from Yorgrim. It billows around the fringes of the light cast by Yorgrim’s lantern (see “Balefire Lantern” earlier in this chapter), waiting for the light to be snuffed out. Everything outside of the lantern’s light is heavily obscured. Additionally, any character who leaves the light and steps into the Shroud is attacked by three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.S5NNrWLkqfQKTs1h]{Shrouded}</strong>* (one of each variant).</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter19_Gravedigger.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div></div><p><strong>Honor the Fallen.</strong> Once the balefire flame is lit, it burns small and must be stoked. As an action, a character can make a contribution to the ceremony that honors who the Fallen were before they fell. The character makes a DC 15 ability check. Each of the Fallen has a list of suggested “resolution proficiencies” that have the best chance of contributing to the ritual.

Billowing plumes of eldritch mist roil throughout the room, spilling forth from a huge gyrating tear in reality that hovers near the tomb’s ceiling. The Shroud itself spills forth, heralded by the shrieking of tormented souls.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The door slams shut behind you, and Yorgrim stares up at the tear into the Shroud, his spectral face filled with despair. “No… It was the size of a headstone only one month ago… I must close this tear once and for all… It must be me…”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>This chamber has imprisoned the tear into the Shroud for centuries, but the crash of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> into Wickermoor Hollow and the deaths of the Fallen have allowed the Shroud to corrupt even the balefire that had once kept it at bay. It is here where the Shroud is at its strongest, allowing it to finally defeat its jailer. Stone coffins sit on all three levels of the chamber.</p><p><em><strong>Platforms.</strong></em> A three-pronged platform rises from the main floor of the tomb, accessible by three separate sets of stairs. A second three-pronged platform hangs 20 feet above the first, held aloft by enormous chains, accessible by three sets of stairs on the first platform.</p><p><em><strong>Shrouded Tear.</strong></em> 20 feet above the second platform and 10 feet below the tomb’s ceiling is a 20-foot wide oblong-shaped tear into the Shroud, which rapidly spills forth blue-green and gray mist, causing the whole chamber to be lightly obscured.</p><p><em><strong>Corrupted Balefire.</strong></em> Eerie blue-green light of the Shroud emanates from eight braziers throughout the tomb, filling the space with bright light. This corruptive light is so powerful that it renders Yorgrim powerless, eliminating the features of his lantern and preventing any actions (see “Gravedigger Actions” and “Balefire Lantern” earlier in this chapter).</p></div>"

These souls are not for you to feast upon!”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Despite his determination, the gravedigger is too hollow and too weak. The azure lantern flickers and dims, and Yorgrim’s will breaks. His face falls and he lets out an exhausted whisper. “The voices spoke true. I have failed.”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>In an instant, a shrieking tendril of the Shroud bursts forth from the tear and crashes into Yorgrim’s spirit. It billows around him until the final glimmer of azure is enveloped in mist, a plume that grows to an enormous size amidst the cacophony of shrieking spirits and rattling chains.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>With a burst of blue-green flame, the fog is expunged, and before you floats a colossal avatar of death. Yorgrim, still burdened by his gravestone, heaves a scythe of corrupted balefire and glares at you through skeletal eye sockets.

Additionally, once the characters arrive in Wickermoor Hollow with Phillip and Adela Druskenvald, the ancient power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen, ensnares them and prevents them from leaving the province. Wickermoor Hollow has the following features if you wish to keep the characters trapped and alone:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>In the Mist.</strong> No magic, such as <em>Plane Shift</em> or <em>Teleport</em>, can transport a creature beyond the borders of Druskenvald without being shepherded by a Stranger.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Crooked Grasp. </strong>Physical and magical travel out of Wickermoor Hollow is made impossible by ancient wards. When a creature tries to exit, it gets lost and ends up being teleported to a forest within the valley.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Cut Off.</strong> Any attempts to communicate magically with creatures outside of Wickermoor Hollow automatically fail.</p><h3><strong>Fear of the Dark</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">In a horror campaign, requiring all characters to deal with the aspects of night that instill fear in humanity can increase the tension and dread. You can use the following optional rules to limit certain characters’ features to make the sleeping hours more horrifying. If you wish to implement them, be sure to discuss the details with your players ahead of the campaign to ensure it enhances the fun for your table.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>All Must Sleep.</strong> While in Druskenvald, characters who don’t need to sleep during long rests in other realms must sleep to stave off exhaustion, though they can still resist magic that might put them to sleep, if able.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Creeping Dark.</strong> Characters who benefit from darkvision find this trait suppressed, though magic that grants darkvision such as from a spell or magic item still functions. This does not affect monsters or NPCs.</p><h3><strong>Time in Druskenvald</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">As a realm of eternal night, Druskenvald’s unusual time cycle (see chapter 1) is an essential part of the setting’s atmosphere. While a sun never rises above the horizon, the amount of light and the color of the sky change throughout each night, from the purple of Twilight Hour, through the orange glow Dusk Hour, to the blues of Nightfall Hour and Evening Hour, and finally the pitch black of Midnight Hour and Witching Hour.</p><p class=\"p4\">Note the time when describing the land’s natural light and weather, and reflect it through the dialogue of NPCs who have an intuitive sense of Druskenvald’s unique night cycle. While it can be tricky to enforce this language throughout the game, and it’s fine to refer to real-world time periods for clarity, using cues like “We leave at the Twilight Hour” or “Let’s settle in before the Witching Hour” makes for a more immersive experience.</p><h4><strong>Time in Druskenvald</strong></h4><table class=\"foundry-header-red\" border=\"0\"><thead><tr><th>Period Name</th><th>Equivalent Time Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Twilight Hour</td><td>Morning (7 to 11 a.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Dusk Hour</td><td>Midday (11 a.m. to 3 p.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Nightfall Hour</td><td>Afternoon (3 to 7 p.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Evening Hour</td><td>Evening (7 to 11 p.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Midnight Hour</td><td>Late Night (11 p.m. to 3 a.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Witching Hour</td><td>Early Morning (3 to 7 a.m.)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Overland Travel</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">Wickermoor Village serves as the hub of the adventure, and most chapters involve the characters traveling from what little safety is offered there to another remote location within Wickermoor Hollow. Though travel in the valley is rarely straightforward, you may pick up each chapter where it begins and convey the characters back to town after each chapter by briefly narrating the travel in between.</p><p class=\"p4\">If you choose to simulate overland travel between each location, the following options can help your players get a better sense of Wickermoor Hollow’s size:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p15\">Use the map of Wickermoor Hollow to estimate travel distances. The map of this province is deliberately not to scale, and the details on it are not precise, which allows for flexibility in this folktale adventure. However, an easy shorthand in determining travel distances is that most of the areas throughout the valley are a three-to-five night trek from Wickermoor Village, depending on how treacherous and overgrown the terrain is. Exceptions to this include Foxwillow and Maidenmist Cemetery, which are a one-to-two night walk on foot.</p></li><li><p class=\"p15\">No journey is a direct route, and there are few well-traveled roads in the valley. It is up to your discretion how many nights it takes to follow the valley’s winding paths to the characters’ destinations.</p></li><li><p class=\"p15\">Change the weather and vary terrain to create a feeling of distance. Successful Nature, Perception, and Survival checks can aid travel and avoid dangers.</p></li><li><p class=\"p15\">You can add combat encounters with creatures featured in Appendix A or other sources to reinforce the coming chapter’s themes and make the valley feel dangerous. These encounters should serve the narrative and not feel random.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p3\">Overland travel can give characters time to reflect, interact, and plan. Strategically allot moments for travel when the story has an opportunity to slow down; it can make the valley feel alive and hint at the horrors that await. But, do not dally when precious game time is limited—jump to the next step with a brief description.</p><h3><strong>Mortality</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">Death is never far in Druskenvald. When a character dies, their spirit lingers in Druskenvald until the Crooked Queen is defeated. At your discretion, if there is little chance for resurrection, you may offer players a chance to deny their character's death by accepting a Dark Bargain of your choice (see chapter 6), which restores the character to life with all of their hit points. This is a great narrative opportunity to add additional consequences aside from what is included in the features of the Dark Bargain.</p><p class=\"p4\"><em><strong>Deaths of the Druskenvalds.</strong></em> Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are two key NPCs whose fates play a pivotal role in the climax of the adventure. Their deaths are fated to occur in chapters 24 and 23, respectively. Any attempts by the characters to kill Phillip and Adela fail, and the ancient power of Kehlenn teleports them to safety so they can be sacrificed at the right moment.</p><h2>Character Advancement</h2><p class=\"p3\"><em>The Crooked Moon</em> takes characters from level 1 to level 14. The campaign is designed with specific story moments for character advancement instead of awarding XP. Nearly every chapter advances the characters’ level at its conclusion. Use the table below to guide level advancement throughout the adventure.</p><p class=\"p4\">If you and your players wish to continue the dreadful folktale past the primary storyline of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, refer to the rules and guidance in Chapter 26: Moonfall.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter8_Ghostlight_Express.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div></div></div>"

Simplified guidance for performing this reading is provided in the chapter, but below are rules to enhance the experience in a way that affects the adventure and foreshadows what’s to come.</p><h2>Fabled Rewards</h2><div style=\"max-width:750px;margin:0 auto;font-size:1.05em;text-align:justify;text-indent:2em\"><p class=\"p2\">Many Fabled Heirlooms—magic items that level up with the characters—are presented in this book and can be found throughout the adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>. However, provisioning the characters with a veritable treasure trove of powerful items could quickly trivialize the threats that await them.</p><p class=\"p4\">Therefore, the Fated Tarot Reading provides a method to determine which of the Fabled Heirlooms the characters can acquire. When Adela performs the reading aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, she uses only a portion of a full 78-card tarot deck. Instead, she shuffles the 22 most important cards, known as the Major Arcana, and pulls one for each character. Each card corresponds to a Fabled Heirloom or a powerful boon that can be found at specific points throughout the adventure (see “Major Arcana” below).</p><p class=\"p4\">When the reading is complete, make note of which cards were pulled. Then, as you run the adventure, keep an eye out for sections titled “Fated Tarot Reading,” each of which features a Major Arcana card, its corresponding item or boon, and the location it can be found or the circumstance needed to achieve it. Only implement the features of these sections that include the cards that were drawn during the reading. Ignore all other instances of these chapter sections.</p><p class=\"p4\">To determine these randomly, you can use your own tarot deck, shuffling the 22 Major Arcana cards and pulling them at the table. Alternatively, you can roll on the Fated Tarot table below. If you wish to equip the characters with items that are fitting for their abilities or story, you can simply choose a card for each character instead of drawing randomly. If you want to provide the characters with additional power throughout the adventure, you can have each character receive a two-card reading.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.PgDCRgyABMbAxork]{Fated Tarot Table}</strong></em></span></p><p></p></div><p></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/HK_inked.webp\" width=\"300\" class=\" centered\" /><h2><span class=\"s1\">Major Arcana</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Below are all 22 Major Arcana cards that can be pulled in the Fated Tarot Reading, along with Adela Druskenvald’s interpretation of the cards, who always pulls the cards in the upright position.

              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap09 top-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">Fateweaving</p><p>Fateweaving provides an optional framework to intertwine the characters’ individual stories throughout the adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, allowing for a more personalized experience that does not require heavy alterations to the broader narrative. You can implement this system to provide each character with a call to action, rewards tied to narrative progression, and the opportunity to experience a full personal arc.</p><p class=\"p3\">These character arcs all end with the climax and conclusion of the main adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, and the narrative results that the characters achieve are often immense and intended to come with the end of a protagonist’s story as a player character. Fateweaving is written with the intention that your campaign concludes in the Epilogue and does not proceed into the events of Moonfall (see chapter 26), though you can adjust to allow for play beyond the scope of the adventure.</p><h2><span class=\"s2\">How to Use Fateweaving</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">You can incorporate Fateweaving into your adventure by taking the following steps, each of which is expanded upon later in this section:</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Select a Goal.</strong> Have each player pick a Thread of Fate from the list of thirteen presented below, which provides a specific goal for their character. Each character should follow a different Thread so they can experience their own unique story.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Personalize.</strong> Work with each player to incorporate the Thread of Fate into their character’s backstory and motivation. They (or you) will need to make one major choice to customize the Thread to the specific character.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Review Touchpoints.</strong> Once the Threads of Fate are selected and personalized, review the six major Narrative Touchpoints for each Thread that you will weave into your adventure. These are the key story moments that provide each character with a complete arc.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Follow Symbols.</strong> Each Thread of Fate has a unique symbol associated with it. As you read through the adventure, keep an eye out for the symbols connected to the characters’ Threads, each instance of which marks a location or moment when and where a Narrative Touchpoint occurs.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Implement Touchpoints.</strong> As you run the adventure, incorporate each character’s Narrative Touchpoint at the appropriate place, and make it clear that the relevant character has the spotlight when this occurs.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Distribute Rewards.</strong> Each time a character completes a Narrative Touchpoint, reward them with its respective boon listed in the following section.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Finish the Story.</strong> Continue this process until the adventure concludes, where you can deliver the final emotional Catharsis of each character’s arc.</p><h2><span class=\"s2\">Narrative Touchpoints</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Fateweaving provides a full narrative arc for each character’s personal journey that unfolds in six major moments throughout the adventure called Narrative Touchpoints. These take each character from the Incitement of their quest all the way through the Catharsis at the end of their story. The location of each Narrative Touchpoint within the adventure differs depending on a character’s Thread of Fate.</p><p class=\"p3\">Each of the Narrative Touchpoints are written to be open ended and not prescriptive so that they are easily customizable for a wide variety of backstories. It is up to you how to tailor each one to the specific character. Each Touchpoint should be accessible without ability checks and should not be easily missed.</p><p class=\"p3\">Familiarizing yourself with the six types of Narrative Touchpoints and their associated rewards will help you interweave each progressive step along every character’s journey.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Incitement</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The first Narrative Touchpoint connects a character’s Thread of Fate with the story of <em>The Crooked Moon</em> and affirms that the goal of their personal quest lies ahead in Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This inciting moment can occur either aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> (chapter 10) or in the Crooked House (chapter 12).</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Reward.</strong> A character who encounters their Incitement receives inspiration.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Connection</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The second Narrative Touchpoint takes the form of meeting a villager from Wickermoor Village who bears a particular connection with a character’s Thread of Fate and offers clues, aid, and guidance. Make note of how this Connection NPC's partnership with the character might affect their allegiances and potential involvement in future plot developments, particularly during the events of Wicker’s Vigil (see chapter 23).</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This NPC can be found in Wickermoor Village (chapter 11) and should only be encountered after the character has completed their Incitement Touchpoint but before they follow a quest hook that leads to their Discovery Touchpoint.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Reward.</strong> In addition to gaining an ally whose attitude becomes friendly, a character who meets their Connection gains the effects of the <em>Bless</em> spell for 24 hours.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Discovery</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The third Narrative Touchpoint involves the character achieving the first key victory of their quest and learning a shocking truth or obtaining hidden knowledge about their Thread of Fate that points them toward the major Confrontation of their arc.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This moment of Discovery occurs while the characters explore one of the following locations during chapters 13–17: the Fields of the Crow, the Crimson Monastery, the Drowned Crossroads, Skitterdeep Mine, or Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Reward.</strong> A character who uncovers their Discovery gains a Twist of Fate that lasts until it is expended. Once per turn, when a creature the character can see makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, the character can expend one Twist of Fate to replace the d20 roll with a 1 or a 20.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Confrontation</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s5\">The fourth Narrative Touchpoint involves confronting a major challenge, threat, or dilemma that was pointed to in the knowledge gained from the Discovery Touchpoint. This allows the character to achieve a victory crucial to their Thread of Fate and to learn of one final objective they must complete in order to finish their personal quest.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This momentous Confrontation can occur during chapters 18–22 when the characters face the horrors of Hartsblight Forest, Maidenmist Cemetery, the Roving Rookery, Fool’s Day, or the Crooked Nightmare.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Reward.</strong> A character who prevails after their Confrontation increases one ability score of their choice by 2. This increase can’t raise a score above 24.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Climax</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The fifth Narrative Touchpoint is the grand finale of the character’s story arc, where they complete the final objective of their Thread of Fate and fully realize the goal they sought to achieve in Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This epic Climax occurs during chapter 24, with the character’s ultimate objective intertwined with the defeat of the Horned King and the Crooked Queen.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Reward.</strong> In addition to finally accomplishing the goal of their personal quest, a character who resolves their Climax gains a feat of their choice.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Catharsis</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The sixth and final Narrative Touchpoint is the conclusion of the character’s personal story arc, resolving their Thread of Fate and providing the outcome that results from achieving their goal.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This final Catharsis occurs at the end of the adventure during the Epilogue.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Reward.</strong> The emotional Catharsis achieved through the resolution of a character’s story arc.</p><h2><span class=\"s2\">Threads of Fate</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Edwadia_%20Sister%20Serenade%20Art%20Nouveau%20book%20cover.webp\" width=\"200\" /><p class=\"p2\">Threads of Fate are thirteen possible personal story arcs that can be woven into the adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>. Each Thread provides a goal for a character to pursue, plot elements to incorporate into their backstory, player choices that personalize the experience, the call of adventure that sets the character on the path to Druskenvald, and six Narrative Touchpoints throughout the adventure that provide a full character arc and rewards for resolving each step.</p><p class=\"p3\">For ease of use, each Thread of Fate has thematic and narrative connections to one of the thirteen new backgrounds included in this book (see chapter 4). However, any character can select any Thread regardless of their background. Share these Thread options, their initial story elements, and any starting questions with your players, but keep the details of the Threads’ Narrative Touchpoints (presented in the following pages) a secret. You can also use these as inspiration to create your own Threads of Fate.</p></div>"

The last mistake!” but cannot be shaken from their stupor.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Confrontation.</strong> While in the Festival Square of the Festival of Fools (area C2), the character is drawn to a strange calliope. They discover a moon-shaped button hidden behind a panel and words etched in their own handwriting: “The Goat Lies.” When pressed, a discordant but familiar version of the song plays, provoking a vision that ends with a large goat’s skull and someone screaming “Sacrifice it!”</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Climax.</strong> Following the triumph over the Horned King and the sacrifice to burn the Crooked Tree, the character’s original memories return. Remembering endless variations of the Crooked Queen’s victory, the character realizes that in their past, they unlocked the ability to manipulate time. Through time travel, they worked through several timelines to guide this version of the character to succeed. With this newly remembered power, they have the opportunity to create a new timeline that avoids all the previous deaths.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character decides to attempt an even greater victory with less bloodshed, they disappear in a flash of light, and their companions never see them again in the current timeline as they travel through time to prevent as many deaths as possible.

The deity guides the character to where the adventure begins.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Associated Background.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.42ueBq6RRHbaBEr8]{Cultist}<span class=\"s1\">*</span></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Pholsense_Archbishop-Renault-Drawing.webp\" width=\"200\" /><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Narrative Touchpoints</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Incitement.</strong> In the Gallery of the Crooked House (area H4), the character is drawn to a bust of a religious figure. A plaque beneath it describes how the individual brought a deity’s influence to Wickermoor Hollow many years prior by first amassing a large gathering of followers, whose worship allowed for the god’s power to grow in the province. The character’s deity confirms this is the next step.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Connection.</strong> While traveling near the Abandoned Church in Wickermoor Village (area V19), Weston Murdoch approaches the character, recognizing them as a missionary. While he encourages them to worship the Brightsinger, he simply appreciates “new godliness” coming to Wickermoor Hollow. Throughout the adventure, he can direct the character to worshipers of a variety of faiths.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Discovery.</strong> After the defeat of the Crimson Abbot at the Crimson Monastery (see chapter 14), many followers of the Crimson Faith become disenfranchised or emboldened to escape the faith. Many approach the character and quickly convert to their deity. They agree to spread word of the new faith throughout the valley. This grants more power to the character’s deity, who tells them that the Shroud repels the divine, and this barrier must be addressed.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Confrontation.</strong> Following the defeat on the Chained Reaper in the Tomb of the Shrouded of Maidenmist Cemetery (area Y15), the character feels a connection to their deity, who commands them to sanctify this original source of the Shroud in the valley to allow their god to pierce through. Following a blessing by the character, their god tells them that a complete antithesis to godliness stalks the realm and must be destroyed.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Climax.</strong> Following the destruction of the Horned King and the burning of the Crooked Tree, their deity confirms that the primary enemy of the gods has been destroyed and, with the character’s invocation, the divine intervention will begin. Additionally, the god offers to shepherd anyone in the valley to the afterlife of the deity. This rapture must be initiated and led by the character.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character invokes the salvation to whisk away souls in a rapture, they and many willing people throughout Wickermoor Hollow rise into the air and fade in divine light. The intervention of the deity’s choice occurs in the valley. If the character does not initiate the rapture, only the intervention occurs, and they are called to spread the word of their god beyond Wickermoor Hollow.</p></div>"

The fields remember. With every rustle of the stalks, every whispered secret, I feed. Come now. Let the stalks say your name. Let the crows sing your story. I’ll harvest what you hide.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\"><em><strong>- Raum, the Harvest Terror -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p4\">A demon has come to Foxwillow. Once a quiet town cradled by endless cornfields, now these fields devour any who dares enter. They belong to Raum, the Harvest Terror—a demonic scarecrow with the head of a crow, cursed with an insatiable hunger for secrets. His very being is nourished by forbidden truths, yet he doesn’t merely feed on them. He weaves them into chaos, turning neighbor against neighbor, sowing discord as effortlessly as seeds. Only the destruction of Raum can save this once-peaceful town.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">East of Wickermoor Village lies the town of Foxwillow, known far and wide as the breadbasket of Wickermoor Hollow. The people of this idyllic town are friendly, rural folk. They worship the Patient Lady, dutifully tend to the fields, help one another, and never speak ill of other souls… to their faces, at least. But evil lurks below the façade.</p><p class=\"p7\">Secret resentments have multiplied in recent months, darkening Foxwillow like the shadow cast by a murder of crows. People have grown suspicious of others, certain their neighbors harbor vile secrets. Crops have failed (sparing only the corn), insects swarm, and cattle waste away and die, while the Foxwillow folk blame each other for negligence, laziness, and stupidity.</p><p class=\"p7\">It began six months ago when Ol’ Jericho Sticks disappeared. A living scarecrow, Jericho had wandered Foxwillow for generations, crafting effigies for the fields and singing as evening fell. When he vanished into the corn, no trace of him remained. Whispers of murder spread, and hidden grudges tore the town apart.</p><p class=\"p7\">As blame grew, the crops withered—except for the cornfields to the east. Worse still, more townsfolk disappeared, their places taken by grotesque scarecrow effigies (see “The Harvest Terror” later in this chapter).</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Foxwillow is a haunted husk of a town. None dare trust enough to band together, nor is anyone brave enough to venture into the corn where the lost have vanished. Characters drawn to the town by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have these goals:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Venture to Foxwillow with the quest-giver, William Lodge.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Stop the survivors in Foxwillow from turning on each other.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Offer secrets to Raum (their own, or secrets learned within Foxwillow) to gain entrance to the demonic corn maze demiplane known as the Fields of the Crow.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Survive the dangers of the Fields of the Crow and find Raum.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Raum, the Harvest Terror.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Raum, the key NPC, to infuse his menace throughout. A casual reading of the Foxwillow locations helps when you improvise interactions. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “The Wicked Harvest,” ensures a smooth and gripping final encounter.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 4 characters.</p>",

Once a quiet town cradled by endless cornfields, now these fields devour any who dares enter. They belong to Raum, the Harvest Terror—a demonic scarecrow with the head of a crow, cursed with an insatiable hunger for secrets. His very being is nourished by forbidden truths, yet he doesn’t merely feed on them. He weaves them into chaos, turning neighbor against neighbor, sowing discord as effortlessly as seeds. Only the destruction of Raum can save this once-peaceful town.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">East of Wickermoor Village lies the town of Foxwillow, known far and wide as the breadbasket of Wickermoor Hollow. The people of this idyllic town are friendly, rural folk. They worship the Patient Lady, dutifully tend to the fields, help one another, and never speak ill of other souls… to their faces, at least. But evil lurks below the façade.</p><p class=\"p7\">Secret resentments have multiplied in recent months, darkening Foxwillow like the shadow cast by a murder of crows. People have grown suspicious of others, certain their neighbors harbor vile secrets. Crops have failed (sparing only the corn), insects swarm, and cattle waste away and die, while the Foxwillow folk blame each other for negligence, laziness, and stupidity.</p><p class=\"p7\">It began six months ago when Ol’ Jericho Sticks disappeared. A living scarecrow, Jericho had wandered Foxwillow for generations, crafting effigies for the fields and singing as evening fell. When he vanished into the corn, no trace of him remained. Whispers of murder spread, and hidden grudges tore the town apart.</p><p class=\"p7\">As blame grew, the crops withered—except for the cornfields to the east. Worse still, more townsfolk disappeared, their places taken by grotesque scarecrow effigies (see “The Harvest Terror” later in this chapter).</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Foxwillow is a haunted husk of a town. None dare trust enough to band together, nor is anyone brave enough to venture into the corn where the lost have vanished. Characters drawn to the town by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have these goals:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Venture to Foxwillow with the quest-giver, William Lodge.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Stop the survivors in Foxwillow from turning on each other.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Offer secrets to Raum (their own, or secrets learned within Foxwillow) to gain entrance to the demonic corn maze demiplane known as the Fields of the Crow.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Survive the dangers of the Fields of the Crow and find Raum.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Raum, the Harvest Terror.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Raum, the key NPC, to infuse his menace throughout. A casual reading of the Foxwillow locations helps when you improvise interactions. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “The Wicked Harvest,” ensures a smooth and gripping final encounter.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 4 characters.</p></div>"

The scarecrow, a wandering tunesmith, held a secret inside of him, literally and figuratively: a crow demon lurked within Jericho’s straw-stuffed body and was the true and terrible power that gave him life.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Ol’ Jericho Sticks</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Raum_and_Jericho.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Jericho was a haunted scarecrow—but a friendly one. He traipsed about the farmlands around Foxwillow, singing songs to drown out the sounds of sorrow within him. The people of Foxwillow loved the straw-stuffed drifter who wove through the rows of straw and stover, serenading the fieldhands on his banjo as they worked.</p><p class=\"p7\">But eventually, even music was not enough to resist the voice inside his head. As the decades passed, the demon that Jericho called “Virgil” grew in power and slowly spread his discord to the people of Foxwillow. As a result, the townsfolk became more suspicious of him, filling the scarecrow with increasing self-doubt. Virgil preyed on this uncertainty, manipulating the wounded psyche of his host until Jericho gave in to the whispers.</p><p class=\"p7\">When Jericho realized the demon inside him was gaining control, he retreated into the cornfields to keep his beloved Foxwillowers safe. Tragically, the struggle was short. His soul was devoured by Virgil, and the two merged into a new demon in the crumpled scarecrow body. He is now Raum, the Harvest Terror, a crow-like Fiend with a body of straw and rusted metal.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">The Scourge of Foxwillow</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Raum <em>(rah-OOM)</em> loves to destroy all that Jericho loved to create. He stalks the rural lands of eastern Wickermoor Hollow, wielding sharp blades and sharper words to drive fear into the hearts of all who live there. He takes special glee in luring people from Jericho’s beloved Foxwillow into his demiplane of endless corn mazes, the Fields of the Crow, to steal their bodies, souls, and secrets.</p><p class=\"p7\">Jericho is gone forever, but tiny scraps of his kindly consciousness still cling like rotten flesh to Raum’s vile bones. If the characters learn the tender secrets of Ol’ Jericho Sticks, what’s left of him fights back and aids them (see “Gathering Information” and “The Wicked Harvest” later in this chapter).</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/MAP_41_Relationship_chart_crows.webp\" width=\"300\" class=\" centered\" /><h2><span class=\"s5\">Raum’s Curse</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Raum feeds on secrets and delights in destruction. Learning secrets sustains him and grants him greater power. Not only do they increase his demonic magic, but they also empower him to manipulate mortal hearts. He has two primary means of harvesting secrets:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Black-Feathered Spies.</strong> Murders of crows gaze hungrily upon Foxwillow in numbers great enough to make bare trees look flush with black leaves when they gather. They are always listening, waiting to report back bits of information to Raum.</p><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>Gateway to the Stalks.</strong> The second method is the gateway to the Fields of the Crow. All who approach it of their own free will are addressed by Raum directly. They are bidden to sacrifice a damning secret if they wish to gain entry to Raum’s domain. This sacrifice empowers Raum’s game statistics (see “The Wicked Harvest” at the end of this chapter). At your discretion, this secret sparks nasty rumors about the character who divulged it back in Foxwillow and Wickermoor Village.</span></p></div>"

When the characters meet the NPCs in town, use these descriptions and the Foxwillow Relationship Chart at the end of this section to help you roleplay them.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">William Lodge</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_William_Lodge.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">A tenant farmer of the wealthy Thatcher family, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.5jMZIjyURhd2xvmP]{William}</strong> (Neutral Good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong>) lives on the outskirts of Foxwillow and tends grains and gourds while raising livestock. As such, he has a close relationship with both the people of Foxwillow and of Wickermoor Village, which he often travels to monthly for market.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Changing William’s Attitude</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Though indifferent toward the characters when they meet him, his attitude increases one step to Friendly if they agree to join him in saving Foxwillow. His attitude decreases one step to Hostile if they intentionally cause destruction or loot the town (such as looting the statue in area J2) but increases one step if they take action to help (such as putting out fires when the town is burning).</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s9\">His attitude increases one step if the characters demonstrate selfless heroism or emotional tenderness. His attitude decreases one step if they are selfish or try to Influence him to learn a secret from him and fail their Charisma check.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>William’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Though unmarried himself, William had an affair with another farmer’s wife, Martha Langtree, who soon had a son with him. This son is the middle Langtree child, Isaac.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning His Secret.</strong></em> As an Influence action, a character convinces William to reveal this secret with a successful [[/check ITM DC 15]] or [[/check PER DC 15]] check.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Martha Langtree</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Martha_Langtree.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.evDgavXpsvSvXDzN]{Martha}</strong> (Lawful Good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong>) is a widow of ten years who works her farm with the help of her three children Adelaide, Isaac, and Rosemary. Lean and toned from years of hard work, she has a brash personality and is often called a force of nature by the townsfolk.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Martha loves all her children dearly but worries for them. Adelaide has acted strangely since Ol’ Jericho Sticks vanished, then Rosemary vanished a week ago. Just this dusk, Isaac went missing too and Adelaide seems unconcerned. Martha is at her wits’ end and inadvertently started a brawl in the Old Windmill (see “Foxwillow in Flames” later in this chapter) while William was out of town seeking aid.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Changing Martha’s Attitude</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Despite the horrors occurring at her doorstep, Martha is easy to befriend. She becomes immediately Friendly if they save Jonah from death in the “The Burning Mill” encounter. Otherwise, she is Indifferent.</p><p class=\"p2\">Her attitude increases one step if the characters demonstrate selfless heroism or emotional tenderness. Her attitude decreases one step if they are selfish or try to Influence her to learn a secret from her and fail their Charisma check.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Martha’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Farmer Malachai, Martha’s husband, was a violent drunk, and Martha accidentally killed him while defending herself. She has kept this secret ever since to protect her children.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning Her Secret.</strong></em> As an Influence action, a character convinces Martha to reveal this secret with a successful [[/check ITM DC 15]] or [[/check PER DC 15]] check. This secret is in addition to her extramarital role in William’s secret (see above).</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Adelaide Langtree</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Adelaide_Langtree.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.zr5NA2G0xwn86uBJ]{Adelaide}</strong> (Chaotic Evil, human<strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCultist0000000]{Cultist}</strong>) is the eldest child of Martha at twenty-five years old. She was a difficult child who played over-competitively with the other children and enjoyed morbid practical jokes to peeve her unpleasant father, like hiding rat carcasses in his boots overnight. Jericho was her best friend because she had a hard time making friends with other kids her age.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">As she grew older, Adelaide’s antisocial behavior deepened. Jericho vanished on her twenty-fifth birthday, and ever since, she’s wandered into the cornfields after her nightly work, only returning when it’s time for bed. Some whisper she killed Jericho, while others claim she’s searching for her only friend. None who followed her into the corn have ever returned.</p><p class=\"p7\">Three weeks after Jericho’s disappearance, she found him—now the monstrous, crow-headed demon, Raum. The Harvest Terror spoke with Jericho’s voice, calling himself her best friend, vowing to love her if she revealed her secrets. She confessed witnessing her father’s abuse and her mother’s fatal act.</p><p class=\"p7\">The demon Raum told her that he is an angel sent to reveal the evil secrets in Foxwillow. Confused, but seduced by his words, Adelaide has spent recent months gathering secrets and luring folks into the cornfields, where Raum spirits them away to wander forever in the Fields of the Crow.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Changing Adelaide’s Attitude</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Adelaide is fully in Raum’s thrall. She can’t be swayed from being Hostile toward the characters.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Adelaide’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">In her communion with Raum, Adelaide has learned William’s secret—that her brother Isaac is really her half-brother. She’s been manipulated into believing that her mother’s infidelity and her half-brother’s birth are the real causes of her fear and suffering in childhood. She was goaded by Raum into murdering Isaac, and she hid his corpse in the basement of the Old Windmill (area J1), where it is incubating a demonic servant of the Harvest Terror.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning Her Secret.</strong></em> Adelaide’s murderous secret is revealed when the characters find her brother’s corpse in the Windmill Cellar (area J9b). If her mother Martha is told of what happened, Martha weeps and gives the characters a handmade brass locket her brother made for her to try and earn her love as a child.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Jonah Sawyer</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Jonah_Sawyer.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.1ZWk2BR1uBsQcYMe]{Jonah}</strong> (Neutral Good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thug}</strong>) has a reputation as a rugged, broad-shouldered man with a humor as hefty as his sinewed frame. As Foxwillow’s butcher, he’s often seen in a bloodstained apron striding through town. His signature platform shoes, worn to keep his feet dry from pigs’ blood, earned him the nickname “Heels.” His only daughter, Liza, has gone missing in recent nights.</p><p class=\"p7\">Though he’s truly not responsible for all Foxwillow’s ills, Jonah has been on edge lately, burdened by guilt over the town’s curse and the disappearance of his daughter. In a fit of rage, he cursed William Lodge, and his shame has made him antagonistic toward his neighbors (see “Foxwillow in Flames” later in this chapter).</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Changing Jonah’s Attitude</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Suspicious by nature, Jonah is difficult to befriend. If characters talk with him about breaking the curse, he asks if they think whoever caused the curse was evil, or just misguided. His attitude increases one step to Friendly if they say they’ll be sympathetic to the curse-maker or that they’ll keep an eye out for Liza. If they suggest that they’ll kill the person who cursed Foxwillow, he becomes fearful and Hostile, refusing to speak at length.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Jonah’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Jonah has harbored resentment for William Lodge for years, though he no longer recalls why. By all accounts, William is well-liked and even sells livestock to the butcher. But Jonah recently discovered William had been selling him scrawnier stock than he sells to Siv Harga in Wickermoor Village, who pays a higher price for well-cared-for prize beasts.</p><p class=\"p7\">In a fit of ire, Jonah slaughtered a lamb and invoked an old folk hex his grandmother once whispered about. He cursed William’s fields and herds and—to his horror—the curse took root. Now, Foxwillow’s crops and livestock wither—save for the demon-infested cornfield, which thrives unnaturally. Jonah, wracked with guilt, grows defensive, fearing the town’s ruin rests on his shoulders.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning His Secret.</strong></em> As an Influence action, characters convince Jonah to reveal this secret with a successful [[/check ITM DC 15]] or [[/check PER DC 15]] check.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Isaac Langtree</span></h2><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20gm/TOOL_MAP_40_Relationship_chart.webp\" /><p class=\"p5\">A boyishly handsome man of twenty-one, Isaac Langtree ran the Hooded Lantern, his family’s tavern, but he continued helping his mother on the farm when able. He vanished the night before the characters arrived, but not into the cornfield. He was lured into the basement of the Old Windmill (area J1) by his sister Adelaide and ritualistically murdered. His corpse is there still.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Isaac’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Charm and good looks made him popular in town, but he secretly despised the quaint, folksy ways of his rural neighbors. He had developed an especially intense dislike of manual labor after apprenticing as a butcher under Jonah Sawyer in his youth. Each market night, he skimmed money from his mother and stashed it under a floorboard in the tavern in preparation to leave for a life on the road. He was trying to convince his sister Adelaide to skip town with him when she killed him.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning His Secret.</strong></em> Isaac’s duplicitous secret is revealed when the characters find his secret cache under a floorboard in the Hooded Lantern (area J4).</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Scarecrow Townsfolk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_ADV_FIELDSOFTHECROW_Demon%20of%20secrets.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Most of Foxwillow’s people have vanished, lost in the Fields of the Crow. Their bodies, twisted under Raum’s control, are now grotesque scarecrows—burlap stuffed with straw and pumpkin heads carved into haunting mockeries of their former faces. Their spirits, however, are doomed to wander the endless maze of cornstalks. Only Raum’s destruction frees the lost spirits and turns the scarecrows back into people.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\">These scarecrows litter the town, sitting slumped in homes and shops, grim reminders of those they replaced. Descriptions of several scarecrows are found in each area.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Jumpscarecrow!</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the investigation of the town is slowing down, [[/r 1d3]] <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Plgibu7fguyYVcTG]{Pumpkin Heads}</strong><span class=\"s10\">*</span> spring to life and attack. After the scarecrows are defeated, have a friendly NPC rush up and share a Vital Clue or Optional Clue they’ve learned (see “Investigating Foxwillow” later in this chapter) to give the characters a new lead.</p><p class=\"p7\">These scarecrows are the missing townsfolk’s mortal bodies. If a pumpkin head is reduced to 0 hit points by Fire damage (burning the body) or Bludgeoning damage (squashing the pumpkin head), the mortal body is also destroyed in a similarly gruesome way when it reverts back to its original human form after Raum is defeated. Other types of damage typically just muss the straw or burlap, leaving the mortal body with scars but no lasting wounds once reverted.</p></div>"

Jeremiah asks William to repeat it and pleads with the characters to listen. William Lodge is a salt-of-the-earth, middle-aged farmer with a folksy accent and an earnest love for his village in his eyes. He lives on one of the failing farms on the outskirts of town, so he doesn’t know the whole story, but he explains what has happened as best he knows it,</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Ol’ Jericho Sticks, the living, singing scarecrow, vanished from town six months ago. Ever since, townsfolk have been accusing one another of murdering the beloved handyman and songster. (If asked for more information on Jericho, William explains that no one knows how the friendly strawman came to be, but he’s been beloved by Foxwillow since before William was born.)</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s6\">After a few months, no one in town trusted each other, and recently everything started going wrong. All crops but the corn failed, livestock withered and died, and strange sigils started appearing in the cornfields.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s6\">Then, only weeks ago, townsfolk began going missing, seemingly replaced by mysterious scarecrows.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s6\">Hardly anyone is left in Foxwillow, and most everyone has barricaded themselves inside their houses. No one sets their suspicions aside to work together.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Jeremiah explains that while the farmers of Wickermoor Village produce as much food as possible, they still rely on the grain Foxwillow produces to feed the town. If the characters break the curse upon Foxwillow, save its people, and salvage the harvest, Jeremiah rallies the town to chip in and pay them each [[/award 50gp]].</p><p class=\"p7\">If Phillip Druskenvald is with the characters at the time or learns of the request from them later, he offers to match the [[/award 50gp]] from his own funds and says he wants to take a more active role in helping the people of Wickermoor Hollow since it’s technically his responsibility as Lord of Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters have more questions, William says he’ll be happy to talk about the villagers and the specifics while they travel, offering passage on his horse-drawn cart; it’ll take them a couple nights to reach Foxwillow, so there’ll be plenty of time.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter13_Scarecrow.webp\" /><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p><h1></h1></div></div>"

Sharing the secret feeds Raum, granting him greater strength and control over the character (see “The Wicked Harvest\" later in this chapter).</p><p class=\"p7\">Those who share someone else’s secret can also enter. This grants Raum extra power, but no control over the character.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Sneaking In</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">When someone enters the Fields of the Crow, the stalks remain open for them, and only them, for up to 1 minute. However, those who make a successful [[/check STE DC 18]] check slip through unnoticed by Raum. If this check fails, they are ejected from the corn as described earlier.</p></div>"

Feed me your secrets and drift into eternal sleep.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">After entering the demonic realm of Raum, the characters experience a reality warp into a waking nightmare as they are trapped in an infinite corn maze. They must reach the center of the maze to find and destroy Raum. Along the way, they find wandering spirits of the people of Foxwillow. Destroying Raum saves these spirits, but freeing them from their listless wandering grants the characters boons in the final confrontation.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Time Pressure</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">While in the Fields of the Crow, the characters feel, with growing dread, their sense of self slowly slipping away. After three hours, the characters’ souls are ripped from their bodies, condemned to wander the Fields of the Crow for eternity. Their bodies transform into scarecrows, forever trapped in Foxwillow. This could mark the end of the campaign—unless a path to salvation remains. Perhaps a new band of adventurers is introduced, guided by the willful spirits of the fallen, or the Crooked Man, acting for the Crooked Queen, offers salvation at a dreadful price.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Which Way?</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">This maze has no map. Instead, those lost inside must choose the correct path at three Junctions to reach Raum. Each Junction is a 50-foot-radius clearing with three new paths to choose from: Left, Right, or Center. To discover which path is correct, a Search action and a successful [[/check PRC DC 18]] check allows the characters to discern which path has the loudest cawing of crows. On a failure, they only learn which path is the quietest (narrowing their options down to two). If the check fails by 5 or more, the crass cacophony of the crows surrounds them, making it impossible to discern the paths. The correct order of paths to follow is:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\"><strong>First Junction:</strong> Left Path</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><strong>Second Junction:</strong> Right Path</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><strong>Third Junction:</strong> Left Path</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">When the characters enter the maze, they travel through the winding, 5-foot-wide paths of the maze for 10 minutes before reaching a Junction with three paths and a random encounter (see “Random Encounters” below). If they choose the wrong path at any Junction, they wander for 10 minutes before reaching a Dead End (also a 50-foot radius clearing in the corn maze and a random encounter). They must then backtrack to the last Junction to choose again.</p><p class=\"p7\">If they choose the correct path, they wind through the corn maze for 10 minutes before reaching the next Junction. When they choose the correct path from the Third Junction, they travel for 10 minutes before reaching the center of the maze. See “The Wicked Harvest,” for the final battle against Raum.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Random Encounters</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Each time the characters enter a Junction or Dead End for the first time, roll once on the Cornfield Encounters table and once on the Cornfield Environment table below to determine what creatures are in that Junction or Dead End and what environmental effects are in play. Roll again if you roll a result that’s already been used. After all encounters and environments have been rolled, any further random encounter results in a Crowstorm with Disorienting Crowsong.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_FIELDS_FILLER.webp\" /><p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s12\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.iOAphQmx4wgwdntu]{Cornfield Encounters}</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Controlled by Secrets.</strong></em> Adelaide Langtree (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.9qrckgonmfCl6Vsx]{Corvodaemon}</strong><span class=\"s10\">*</span>) is here. As a chosen disciple of Raum, she has the power to manipulate characters who have given up their secrets to Raum to buy entrance to the maze. Should the characters find themselves here, Adelaide can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDominatePe]{Dominate Person}</em> at will (spell save DC 14), targeting only someone who paid their own secret to enter the maze and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability. This use of the spell plays on the character’s fears about their secret coming to light, so targets that have immunity to the frightened condition automatically succeed on the saving throw.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Crowstorm.</strong></em> The twisting maze of moving corn narrows, and suddenly the characters are surrounded by screeching crows from all sides. An enraged <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.CwhH1UpLfAWahAes]{Crowstorm}</strong><span class=\"s10\">*</span> attacks in a frenzy. The characters can defeat or evade the crowstorm to proceed through the maze.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Familiar Faces.</strong></em> Two Foxwillowers are chained to stout, blood-stained wood poles in the center of the Junction. Their heads are bowed, and they call weakly, begging for help when they see the characters. Choose whichever two villagers the characters formed the best relationship with. The figures are imposters created by Raum’s stolen secrets and crow spies. The imposters use the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmDoppelganger00]{Doppelganger} </strong>stat block and immediately begin reading the character’s surface thoughts with <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsterfeatures.Item.w5mFTTFsdKC7TXgg]{Read Thoughts}<strong>.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p7\">As a Study action, a character who examines the figures and succeeds on a [[/check INV DC 15]] check—made with Disadvantage if the character is more than 10 feet away—notices subtle, unsettling warps of facial features that give away the disguise. Anyone that doesn’t succeed on the check is surprised when the imposters attack.</p><p class=\"p7\">The imposters’ chains vanish and they attack as soon as someone comes within reach, or when they realize their ruse failed. When defeated, they dissolve back into whisps of nightmare and fade away.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Lost Soul.</strong></em> The spirit of someone from Foxwillow is being tortured for any secrets it has left to hide by two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.9qrckgonmfCl6Vsx]{Corvodaemons}</strong><span class=\"s10\">*</span>. The spirit has AC 14, HP 40, and a Speed of 20 feet. It fails all ability checks and saving throws and can’t take actions. Only one demon attacks the spirit each turn, and they only use their Feeding Frenzy action when attacking the spirit; the other demon focuses on the characters. If someone destroys the demons or escapes from them to the next Junction before the spirit is reduced to 0 hit points and devoured, it thanks them and promises to aid them against the Harvest Terror before fading away. Each character gains Heroic Inspiration.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter13_Adelaide_transforming.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s12\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.xGJk7rcoxwLfchGr]{Cornfield Environment}</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p7\">Blood Rain. The ground shakes and thunder booms as a storm suddenly arises. Blood rains down in sheets, the thick liquid blinding and stinging eyes. The air becomes heavy and hot, and the stinking smell of copper becomes suffocatingly thick. Each character must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw or have the &amp;reference[poisoned apply=false] condition while in this Junction.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Body of Crops.</strong></em> The corpses of people Raum has not yet returned as scarecrows form a nauseating crop circle in the middle of this clearing. Corn sprouts from the corpses in various states of decay—stalks rip out of chest cavities, biceps, and even mangled faces with lifeless, staring eyes. Choose twelve spaces in this Junction to place these corpses when the characters first enter it. A character who comes within 5 feet of a gruesome corpse or starts its turn within 5 feet of one must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 13]] saving throw or gain 1 &amp;reference[exhaustion apply=false] level from horror and disgust.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Disorienting Crowsong.</strong></em> A murder of crows circles above the corn maze clustering thick enough to blot out the orange moon, and their song becomes a disorienting cacophony. At the start of each character’s turn while in this Junction, roll [[/r 1d6]] and subtract the number rolled from their attack rolls and spell save DC until the start of their next turn. Anyone who paid a secret hears Raum taunting them about it in the crowsong and must roll [[/r 1d10]] instead.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Shadows of the Lost.</strong></em> Shadowy, insubstantial figures rise out of the ground in this Junction—screaming images of all the people that the Harvest Terror spirited away into the Fields of the Crow.

The demons seek to shred the intruders, prioritizing anyone attacking or catching amber-eyed crows (see “Growing Murder” below). The demons have the following special considerations:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">The demons lack the Multiattack action.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">If a corvodaemon takes any damage, it vanishes in a swirl of feathers and black mist. It reforms in an unoccupied space of the Harvest Terror’s choice on Initiative count 0 (losing Initiative ties).</p></li></ul><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Growing Murder</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">A murder of amber-eyed crows surrounds the Harvest Terror in a 5-foot Emanation with the following effects:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">A creature other than a demon has Disadvantage on attack rolls while in this area.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">A creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 13]] saving throw or have the &amp;reference[prone apply=false] condition.</p></li></ul><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Devourer of Secrets</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">While the murder of crows persists, the Harvest Terror can take a Bonus Action to catch and devour one of the amber-eyed crows. Each time it does, the following occurs:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">The Harvest Terror gains [[/damage 10 temp]]{10 temporary hit points}. Each crow beyond the first increases this number by 10.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The Emanation of crows increases by 5 feet.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">The characters can stop Raum from devouring crows in two ways:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Catching.</strong> A character can catch a crow with an Unarmed Strike to grapple it, catch it in a Net, or any other method that you deem acceptable. To grab a crow by hand, a character must enter the murder.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Destroying.</strong> An amber-eyed crow is a Tiny Fiend with AC 14, HP 5, and +0 to any D20 Tests it is forced to make. It automatically succeeds on Dexterity saving throws against areas of effect and takes no damage from such effects that would deal half damage on a successful save.</p><p class=\"p5\">Each time a crow is caught or destroyed, it vanishes in a puff of amber motes, and the characters hear a whispered secret, such as “I always loved you,” “I took it,” or something similar, with no indication of who the secret belonged to.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Ending the Phase</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">When the Harvest Terror devours three amber-eyed crows, or when six crows are destroyed or captured, the swarming murder explodes into feathers and its effects end. Any remaining corvodaemons have 20 hit points and no longer vanish when they take damage.

              "name": "The Moon is Falling",
              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap26\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Moon is Falling</p><p>One terrible night, the Crooked Moon lets out a horrific shriek and speaks with Kehlenn’s voice, delivering a message that echoes across Wickermoor Hollow: the moon shall fall, and doom will come in thirteen nights. Slowly but surely, the moon begins to grow larger in the sky as it descends toward the valley.</p><p class=\"p6\">The inhabitants of Wickermoor Hollow react in a variety of ways—some turn to panic, others to prayer, and surprisingly, many resign themselves to the end. However, most are too preoccupied with the destructive effects of the eight evils that have risen and the horrors they’ve unleashed upon the land. This development will stress or empower the relationships that the characters have nurtured during their time in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Impending Doom</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The characters must now hunt down these emerging evils, racing against time as each victory delays the moon’s fall—but not its inevitable approach. Further, every moment wasted allows the once-dormant threats to grow in power and cause mass destruction ahead of the impending apocalypse.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Countdown to Extinction</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">As soon as the Crooked Moon begins falling, it will crash into Wickermoor Hollow in exactly thirteen nights. If this occurs, the resulting collision and explosion of primordial energy annihilates the entirety of Druskenvald, including the characters if they are still within the realm when the moon makes impact. This ends the campaign.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Achieving Victory.</strong></em> The only way to prevent Druskenvald’s downfall is to kill all eight of the ancient evils bound to Wickermoor Hollow and reject Kehlenn’s final bargain. This returns the Crooked Moon to its rightful place in the sky and ensures that the Crooked Queen is powerless forever.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Tracking Time.</strong></em> As each of the thirteen nights progresses, keep track of how many nights are left before the inevitable collision. Clearly describe to the players that the moon is growing larger in the sky and its face is growing more menacing. Also, consider how the people of the valley act in the face of a seemingly inevitable death.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Delaying the Inevitable.</strong></em> Each time one of the ancient evils is slain, the descent of the moon stops for 24 hours. This means that if the characters continually kill the powerful enemies before them, they have a full twenty nights to stop the doom.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Turn Back Time.</strong></em> If you wish to give the characters additional time or believe they have earned help, the Vagrant arrives right before the collision and aids them. He plays a powerful song on his fiddle that turns back time 72 hours, buying the characters three additional nights. Due to the timeless nature of the ancient evils, any of them killed before or during this reverted time remain dead.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>The Old Fears</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Eight fearsome beings bound to the land of Wickermoor Hollow stir and rise to power, having felt the gaze of the Crooked Moon upon them. Imbued with Kehlenn’s primordial energies, they have exchanged their own ties to Wickermoor Hollow so that the moon can continue to plummet toward a cataclysm with the promise to remake the realm in their own image. They are as follows:</p><p class=\"p11\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.cHU2ledbj9sUQ5Eq]{The Galloping Headsman}.</strong> A headless phantom of fiery wrath driven by revenge.</p><p class=\"p11\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.LMsz0Wec48jVB1a9]{The White Worm}.</strong> An eldritch being from beyond the stars that feasts on memories.</p><p class=\"p11\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.YlLuWhpb0HwH9nzA]{The Tall Man}.</strong> A twisted and corrupted archfey that stalks the woods for victims.</p><p class=\"p11\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.fCG5qm0hX4DtsndY]{The Wild Titan}.</strong> A gigantic manifestation of the wilds that seeks to unleash savagery.</p><p class=\"p11\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Jl4mI8O0O6D9pLuV]{The Barrow King}.</strong> A long-dead king seeking glory who commands Undead legions.</p><p class=\"p11\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.7rdR1klh875p8ABz]{The Jinxed Leviathan}.</strong> An enormous swamp beast imbued with the essence of bad luck.</p><p class=\"p11\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.z190J9aT9xcdLXhF]{The Dusk Mother}.</strong> A tormented spirit of loss that spreads her misery to all.</p><p class=\"p11\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.ZpqpWxE5kzFjsW72]{The Brimstone Behemoth}.</strong> A volcanic colossus of hellfire that ushers in armageddon.</p><p class=\"p5\">The characters must defeat these legendary creatures in order, each one more powerful than the last, if they hope to save Druskenvald. The subsequent sections of this chapter feature the eight ancient evils, including the following tools to craft an exhilarating adventure for each:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">A quest hook that points the characters in the direction of the ancient evil.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The effects of the legendary creature’s presence on the land, which are in addition to its lair features (see appendix A).</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">How the locals are tormented, affected, and corrupted by it.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">What types of monsters and minions that might serve it.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The circumstances of the final showdown with the powerful being.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">How the afflicted people react to the destruction of the creature.</p></li></ul><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter26_Moonfall.webp\" /></div>"

Due to corruption at the highest levels of the town’s leadership, this headsman was falsely accused of murder, dragged through an unjust trial, and beheaded before the whole town. While its townsfolk exclaimed justice, the blood that spilled on the soil bound the centaur’s spirit to the fields. With the power of the Crooked Moon, the Galloping Headsman thunders through the farmland, seeking justice against his killers’ descendants, whipping them up in a frenzy of paranoia that spelled his doom so many years ago.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Hysteria in Foxwillow</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The distrust sown by the secrets revealed during the Harvest Terror’s attack has boiled into all-out conflict, plunging the farming community into mass hysteria. A farmer from the town seeks out the characters and tells them that neighbor has turned against neighbor, and folks are being condemned to death by beheading. The executioner is rumored to be a spirit of fiery wrath that rides to meet each of the condemned, lops off their heads, and adds them to its collection.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Fields of Vengeance</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The fertile farmland around Foxwillow—so easily corrupted by the demonic influence of Raum—craves vengeance and has come to life under the ghastly influence of the Galloping Headsman.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Stone Pressing.</strong></em> The earth itself opens up, attempting to swallow the accused and crush them with the stones within. For every mile traveled, characters must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 17]] saving throw or fall into a sinkhole and have the &amp;reference[restrained apply=false] condition. While Restrained in this way, a character takes [[/damage 1d8 bludgeoning]]{4 (1d8)} Bludgeoning damage at the start of each of their turns. A Restrained character repeats the save at the end of each of their turns, freeing themself on a success.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Choking Crops.</strong></em> The crops attempt to choke the life out of the wicked. The first time a character enters any field that bears crops, its roots, stalks, or vines attempt to strangle the character. They must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 17]] saving throw or gain the &amp;reference[grappled apply=false] condition for 1 minute (escape DC 15). While Grappled in this way, the character gains 1 &amp;reference[exhaustion apply=false] level at the end of each of their turns. A character who can't be Charmed succeeds automatically. The crops have AC 5; HP 10; Vulnerability to Fire damage; Immunity to Bludgeoning and Psychic damage.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Mob Injustice</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">When the characters arrive at the Foxwillow Farmland, they find its people are Hostile to them, accusing them of witchcraft, murder, sabotage, and of causing the incoming apocalypse. Some cunning townsfolk even attempt to act as friends to earn their trust before turning them over to frenzied mobs.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Vengeful Wrath.</strong></em> The wrathful emotion of the Galloping Headsman spreads like a virulent plague. Whenever a character comes within 20 feet of a Foxwillow villager, the character must succeed on a [[/save CHA DC 17]] saving throw or lose the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. On a success, the character is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Wandering Mob.</strong></em> Roving gangs of vigilantes hunt the characters in the hopes of capturing, imprisoning, trying, and executing them. Every 1 hour that the characters spend within 1 mile of the town center of Foxwillow, they must succeed on a group DC 17 Dexterity (Stealth) check or be detected and attacked by 20 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmTough000000000]{Toughs}.</strong></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>All Hallows’ Evil</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The emergence of the Galloping Headsman has twisted the Foxwillow farmland’s flora, fauna, and people, and it has awakened monstrous creatures with a burning vengeance:</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Vengeful Spirits.</strong></em> The Headsman has riled up the spirits of the dead that faced wrongful deaths and seek retribution.

They revere this being as an angel of judgment, punishing their town for the wickedness of their neighbors. The characters must learn where they can find this spirit to put an end to the mass hysteria.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Tarnished History.</strong></em> The characters can investigate Foxwillow to learn about the village’s dark past. If the characters succeed on a group [[/check HIS DC 17]] or [[/check INV DC 17]] check, they learn the headsman’s story and that he was beheaded before the covered bridge to the east of town toward the edge of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Bloody Trail.</strong></em> The characters can tail a mob as it dispenses its “justice” or even infiltrate its ranks with a successful group [[/check STE DC 17]] or [[/check DEC DC 17]] check to witness the attempted execution of a falsely accused villager.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>The Headless Horseman</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Characters who arrive at the covered bridge can lure out the vengeful spirit with the offering of the execution of a Foxwillow local or by inciting its warped sense of justice. <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.cHU2ledbj9sUQ5Eq]{Galloping Headsman}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> rides out from the darkness of the bridge’s cover and charges the characters, seeking to behead them all and slake its never-ending thirst for vengeance.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Reckoning’s End.</strong></em> With the Galloping Headsman’s destruction, the town is freed from his oppressive judgment. The people of Foxwillow gain clarity and realize that they must aid their neighbors in these final nights. Grateful to the characters, they decide to spend their final hours feasting and celebrating instead of falling to despair.

Imprisoned for many years beneath Memory’s Rest Sanatorium, it feasted upon the memories of the hospital’s patients before escaping into the depths of Moonsong Lake. After recovering from its long torment and being fed countless ancient memories by the Crooked Moon, it has undergone a metamorphosis into its true form as a cosmic horror. It now ravenously hungers for the memories of Druskenvald until the land itself is forgotten.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">A Feast for Worms</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Moonsong Lake is infested with worms. These parasites slither through the water supply and infect the people who live upon its shores.

In every community, a legend is born from the universal fear of the end of all things. This collective belief manifested a Fiend of titanic proportions made from hellfire and dying earth that possesses a malevolent will and a single desire: armageddon. As the Crooked Moon makes its final descent, its baleful gaze calls down its first sacrifice the maiden once known as Rowan (see chapter 23), who has now ushered in the Brimstone Behemoth to Druskenvald.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The End of All Hope</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s11\">Kehlenn’s sneering moon is low in the sky, with surging primordial energies trailing its incessant descent. A rumbling felt throughout Wickermoor Hollow serves as a prelude to an enormous eruption from Rowan’s Rise, destroying the hill and turning the surrounding moors into a volcanic hellscape that stinks of brimstone. Screaming Fiends rise from rivers of lava and plumes of hellfire and take to the skies, heralding in the being that will end Druskenvald. All peoples across the valley can see the blaze and turn to despair. None are safe, and all shall perish underneath the Crooked Moon.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Hell on Earth</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The entirety of Wickermoor Hollow is the domain of the Brimstone Behemoth. The scorching of the valley is the first wound that will bring about the demise of Druskenvald. Hellish volcanic eruptions send fiery death across the valley, and the people within twist and transform into Fiends that join the legions of the apocalypse.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>The Sky is Falling.</strong></em> Boulders of lava and hellfire rain down across the valley. Every hour, there is a 50 percent chance that they crash toward the characters, who must each make a [[/save DEX DC 20]] saving throw against the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplMeteorSwar]{Meteor Swarm}</em> spell.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Mark of the Beast.</strong></em> The corruption of armageddon afflicts the valley. Every hour, the characters must succeed on a [[/save CHA DC 20]] saving throw or gain one Mark of the Apocalypse. A character who gains three marks permanently transforms into a Fiend under the command of the Brimstone Behemoth. To determine which, roll [[/r 1d2]]. On a 1, they transform into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmBalor000000000]{Balor}</strong>. On a 2, they transform into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmPitFiend000000]{Pit Fiend}</strong>. A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplRemoveCurs]{Remove Curse}</em> spell removes one or two accumulated marks.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Lambs to the Slaughter</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">People from all over Wickermoor Hollow flee their homes and seek shelter and protection from others, praying, begging, and pleading for salvation from the end of everything.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Prayer for the Dying.</strong></em> Groups of faithful gather and pray to the Green Queen, the Patient Lady, the Brightsinger, and any other god who will listen. The characters can stay and spend an hour praying to make a group [[/check REL DC 20]], [[/check INS DC 20]] or [[/check PER DC 20]] check. On a success, the characters collectively gain one use of the cleric’s Divine Intervention feature and must unanimously decide how it is used.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Wolves in Sheep’s Clothing.</strong></em> Secret servants of the Brimstone Behemoth operate a doomsday cult. If the characters step within 5 feet of a cultist, the cultist explodes into hellfire and brimstone. Any character within 20 feet of the sacrificed cultist must succeed on a [[/save DEX DC 20]] saving throw or take [[/damage 3d6 fire]]{10 (3d6)} Fire damage plus [[/damage 3d6 necrotic]]{10 (3d6)} Necrotic damage and gain 1 &amp;reference[exhaustion apply=false] level as their bodies and souls are seared.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>The Burning Legion</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">As the Brimstone Behemoth rises, it is joined by an army of Fiends, fallen angels, and otherworldly beings that share in the goal of bringing apocalypse to as many worlds as possible.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Seventh Seal.</strong></em> Malicious Fiends of all varieties erupt from the shattered, molten earth, and corrupted angels fall from burning skies, taking the form of <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmBarbedDevil000]{Barbed Devils}</strong>,<strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmBeardedDevil00]{Bearded Devils}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmBoneDevil00000]{Bone Devils}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.CwhH1UpLfAWahAes]{Crowstorms}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmDeva0000000000]{Devas}</strong> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmGlabrezu000000]{Glabrezu}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmGibberingMouth]{Gibbering Mouthers} </strong>(Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmHellHound00000]{Hell Hounds}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.saFBY6zjByhqHaie]{Heralds of Fools}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmHezrou00000000]{Hezrou}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmHornedDevil000]{Horned Devils}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmManticore00000]{Manticores}</strong> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmNalfeshnee0000]{Nalfeshnees}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmNightmare00000]{Nightmares}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmPlanetar000000]{Planetars} </strong>(Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmRakshasa000000]{Rakshasas}</strong>, and <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmVrock000000000]{Vrocks}</strong>.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Inferno.</strong></em> Beings of hellfire and brimstone join the infinite legions, taking the form of <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmAdultBrassDrag]{Adult Brass Dragons}</strong> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmAdultRedDragon]{Adult Red Dragons}</strong> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmChimera0000000]{Chimeras}</strong> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmEarthElemental]{Earth Elementals}</strong> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmEfreeti0000000]{Efreet} </strong>(Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmFireElemental0]{Fire Elementals}</strong>(Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmFireGiant00000]{Fire Giants}</strong> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmGargoyle000000]{Gargoyles}</strong> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSalamander0000]{Salamanders}</strong> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.rAQGFdLEjXhY6W0Y]{Soulfire Stokers}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> (Fiend), <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.WqTPP2mqg3KIUiyr]{Wildpyres}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> (Fiend), and <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmXorn0000000000]{Xorn}</strong> (Fiend).</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Revelations</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Although the creature of the apocalypse is bringing doom to Wickermoor Hollow, its physical form does not manifest unless commanded by its summoner, Rowan. Otherwise, it is content to suffuse the land with its power of the end of things. The only way to face, battle, and kill the beast is to confront the spirit of Rowan atop the volcanic mound and draw her ire. Only then will she lose her sense and draw the beast forward to attempt to destroy the characters. However, it requires particular information to provoke the spirit enough to initiate the final battle.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Final Folklore.</strong></em> The last hope of Wickermoor Hollow may be the local legends kept alive by those who adhere to the Old Ways. By seeking these stories from those knowledgeable of the valley’s lore and succeeding on a group [[/check PER DC 20]] or [[/check ITM DC 20]] check, the characters can learn the truth of Rowan. She was a malevolent maiden who sought apocalypse, and her fiendish dabbling made her the prime candidate for Kehlenn’s first sacrifice. By appealing to the innocent maiden she once was, the characters who condemn her for her wickedness and how much she had fallen will turn the spirit to rage.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s5\"><em><strong>Family Ties.</strong></em> The only person Rowan cared for was her sister, whose descendant still lives in Wickermoor Village. By scouring any records for Rowan or her family and succeeding on a group [[/check ARC DC 20]] or [[/check HIS DC 20]] check, the characters discover which townsfolk is her sister’s descendant and use this knowledge against her. By appealing to the love of her family she once had, the specter's conflicted feelings will boil into a vengeful wrath.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>The Number of the Beast</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s11\">When the characters ascend the ruins of Rowan’s Rise and face the shimmering maiden at the center of the bursting brimstone, her wrath is as fiery as the doom she has brought to the valley. With a cry to the moon above and the hellfire below, she heralds the apocalypse. <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.ZpqpWxE5kzFjsW72]{The Brimstone Behemoth}</strong></span><span class=\"s9\">*</span><strong> </strong><span class=\"s11\">erupts from the sulfuric lava with an earth-shattering bellow and seeks to annihilate the characters and Druskenvald along with them.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>To the Farrows and Fields.</strong></em> When the Brimstone Behemoth is destroyed, it explodes in a catastrophic burst of stinking lava that pours down upon Wickermoor Hollow. The lava instantly cools and hardens, forming countless scars upon the landscape. In time, they will provide nutrient-rich soil for a new age of fertility and regrowth.</p><p class=\"p6\">Rowan’s spirit calms, and she has a final moment of clarity, apologizing to the characters for everything she brought to pass before fading forever. With no champions remaining, the Crooked Moon gazes upon the characters themselves.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s5\"><em><strong>Ability Score Improvement.</strong></em> When the characters destroy the Brimstone Behemoth, they increase one of their ability scores by 4 or two of their ability scores by 2.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Fabled Heirloom.</strong></em> The <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.HHoa7wlwP0vFbAIe]{Hide of the Brimstone Behemoth}</em><span class=\"s10\">*</span> remains in the hardening lava after the colossus explodes.</p></div>"

She offers them one last chance to annihilate Druskenvald and remake it in their image.</p><p class=\"p6\">The Crooked Queen knows she has been defeated, her final gambit failed and spent. Her last chance for revenge is to convince the characters to accept the power of remaking Druskenvald, which would obliterate all those within and allow them to create a new realm. She is too proud to beg or plead, but appeals to their deepest desires, just as her destroyed consort, the Horned King, once did.</p><p class=\"p6\">If the offer is accepted, the Crooked Moon crashes into the land, and all of Druskenvald, as well as every soul within it besides the characters, is destroyed. Left alone, the characters swim in a green sea of raw rebirthing energies and may unanimously decide the nature of their new realm. If the offer is refused, the moon returns to the sky, and the face in the crescent disappears as Kehlenn fades from existence, the last of her primordial power expended.

Folk go about their daily routines, and the pigeon hag watches and waits for the return of the Crooked Queen. She hides in plain sight amongst them, learning everything they know and guiding what they believe. Golub Graygullet, disguised as Postmaster Theodora Mayville, subtly controls the flow of information and manipulates the minds of the people so that they fall in place when the time is right to free Kehlenn. Until then, she bides her time and pulls the strings, every moment filled with haughty contempt.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A master plan is in the works, hatched by Golub Graygullet, who arrived in town seventy years ago with her dovecote that can secretly walk about the valley on pigeon legs. After the characters arrived in Druskenvald, she knew the time for sacrifice had arrived. Pulling the strings of the people of Wickermoor Village like a puppet master, she has helped guide the townsfolk’s interactions with the characters every step of the way through news carried by the pigeons she commands.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">Believing herself to be the true mastermind behind the Crooked Queen’s return, she sought the destruction of the Fallen and even betrayed her two sisters, understanding their deaths to be critical sacrifices to return her mistress to power. However, Golub herself has been deceived. Kehlenn promised the pigeon hag that she would serve at her left hand as a grandmother hag of legendary power, but this was a lie.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">The fabled prophecy and sacrificial ritual require one final conjuring from Golub before she herself is slain in sacrifice. Soon, she will be reborn with her sisters as a horrific abomination in the bowels of the Crooked House (see chapter 22). The minds of the townsfolk, so subtly influenced for years, must be made perfectly malleable for the revelry of the coming Lord of Fools (see chapter 21) and celebration at the feet of the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise (see chapter 23).</p><p class=\"p7\">One final bewitching enchantment is brewing to cause a mass hysteria whipped up by a sudden murder in town. It is through the violent urges of the agitated mob that Golub plans on finally disposing of the characters, whom she views as pawns that have outgrown their usefulness.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A shocking murder blamed on the characters whips the people of Wickermoor Village into a frenzied mob but was, in truth, caused by a bewitching enchantment cast by the pigeon hag, Golub Graygullet. Once the town descends into mass hysteria, she escapes in her Walking Dovecote, sending mind-broken monsters to wreak even more havoc. Before the village burns and its townsfolk tear each other apart, the Walking Dovecote must be found, and Golub must be killed. Characters spurred to seek out the dovecote by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Escape unjust imprisonment by the people of Wickermoor Village.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Uncover the true identity of Golub Graygullet.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Track down the Walking Dovecote and destroy Golub Graygullet.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p8\">This chapter is designed for four level 10 characters.</p>",

Folk go about their daily routines, and the pigeon hag watches and waits for the return of the Crooked Queen. She hides in plain sight amongst them, learning everything they know and guiding what they believe. Golub Graygullet, disguised as Postmaster Theodora Mayville, subtly controls the flow of information and manipulates the minds of the people so that they fall in place when the time is right to free Kehlenn. Until then, she bides her time and pulls the strings, every moment filled with haughty contempt.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A master plan is in the works, hatched by Golub Graygullet, who arrived in town seventy years ago with her dovecote that can secretly walk about the valley on pigeon legs. After the characters arrived in Druskenvald, she knew the time for sacrifice had arrived. Pulling the strings of the people of Wickermoor Village like a puppet master, she has helped guide the townsfolk’s interactions with the characters every step of the way through news carried by the pigeons she commands.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">Believing herself to be the true mastermind behind the Crooked Queen’s return, she sought the destruction of the Fallen and even betrayed her two sisters, understanding their deaths to be critical sacrifices to return her mistress to power. However, Golub herself has been deceived. Kehlenn promised the pigeon hag that she would serve at her left hand as a grandmother hag of legendary power, but this was a lie.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">The fabled prophecy and sacrificial ritual require one final conjuring from Golub before she herself is slain in sacrifice. Soon, she will be reborn with her sisters as a horrific abomination in the bowels of the Crooked House (see chapter 22). The minds of the townsfolk, so subtly influenced for years, must be made perfectly malleable for the revelry of the coming Lord of Fools (see chapter 21) and celebration at the feet of the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise (see chapter 23).</p><p class=\"p7\">One final bewitching enchantment is brewing to cause a mass hysteria whipped up by a sudden murder in town. It is through the violent urges of the agitated mob that Golub plans on finally disposing of the characters, whom she views as pawns that have outgrown their usefulness.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A shocking murder blamed on the characters whips the people of Wickermoor Village into a frenzied mob but was, in truth, caused by a bewitching enchantment cast by the pigeon hag, Golub Graygullet. Once the town descends into mass hysteria, she escapes in her Walking Dovecote, sending mind-broken monsters to wreak even more havoc. Before the village burns and its townsfolk tear each other apart, the Walking Dovecote must be found, and Golub must be killed. Characters spurred to seek out the dovecote by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Escape unjust imprisonment by the people of Wickermoor Village.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Uncover the true identity of Golub Graygullet.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Track down the Walking Dovecote and destroy Golub Graygullet.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p8\">This chapter is designed for four level 10 characters.</p></div>"

Her whispers and enchanting spells also manipulate people of all variety to her cause, and she even possesses the power to make mighty monsters her minions.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Golub Graygullet</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Gollub_Graygullet.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Golub Graygullet (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.KdPNwELUxUB6SwlF]{Pigeon Hag}</strong><span class=\"s8\">*</span>) is the leader of the Vermintoll Coven, as well as the eldest and most powerful of the three hags. Her short and stout body resembles the pigeons she adores, with taloned fingers, a beak-like nose, a puffed-up neck, and mauve skin.</p><p class=\"p7\">Just as it was her sisters’ roles to corrupt the soul and body of sacrifices to the Crooked Queen, Golub corrupts her victims’ minds through the control of information and magical enchantments she weaves. A malignantly proud creature, Golub views every mortal as merely a pawn, tool, or puppet to help advance her own aims, viewing her tactics of seeking, manipulating, and distributing information as far more tasteful than the more uncouth methods favored by her sisters.</p><p class=\"p7\">Golub is obsessed with not merely acquiring information, which she primarily gathers through the eyes and ears of her pigeon spies, but in controlling its flow. Every written communication in Wickermoor Village passes through her hands, and she alone decides what is passed on, withheld, or altered. She listens, watches, and whispers from her perch in the Walking Dovecote, choosing whether to deliver truths or lies that aid in her grand designs, even among the Vermintoll Coven and cult of the Crooked Queen.</p><p class=\"p7\">Preferring the comforts of town and leveraging the close proximity to the victims of her mental corruption, Golub lives among the people of Wickermoor Village disguised as Theodora Mayville, the postmaster (see chapter 11). To ensure a more reliable and long-term disguise, she wears the skin of the person she impersonates, needing to change bodies every decade or so to avoid drawing suspicion. The one thing she cannot change between personas is the vibrant lilac eyes cast by her bewitching enchantment. When Golub uses a victim's skin, the disguise is flawless and can't be perceived as false, even through magical means, which detect her as a Humanoid. Golub also has Advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks while in this disguise.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Peeping Albert</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Peeping Albert (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.HKOXEFjHbucrRayC]{Vermin Familiar} </strong>(Pigeon)</span><span class=\"s9\">*</span><span class=\"s5\">) is Golub’s pigeon familiar, a pudgy bird that eerily resembles a person, with a wrinkled bald head, human-like ears, and hands instead of talons. He serves as Golub’s most precious child and her chief spy. Albert gains a sick satisfaction from peeping on the townsfolk of Wickermoor Village and listening in on their conversations, eagerly awaiting the praise he’ll receive when he reports back to his mother.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Sharing Golub’s distaste for the weasel hag and centipede hag, Albert has a puffed-up superiority complex and looks down on his counterparts Filthy Jasper and Slippery Oswald. When the vile pigeon familiar is not spying on the villagers, he is always seeking new young women with lilac eyes so that Golub can prepare her next disguise.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Geneva Fairchild</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Geneva Fairchild (Lawful Good, human </span><span class=\"s7\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong></span><span class=\"s5\">) had a difficult upbringing in a superstitious household that believed her lilac eyes were an ill omen. Despite the strained relationship with her parents, Geneva grew into a compassionate and hardworking young woman in large part due to the tutelage of her mentor Theodora Mayville.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Theodora, who had lilac eyes herself, instilled in Geneva a pride for her unique feature that some in Wickermoor Village saw as a sign of malign witchcraft. The young apprentice to the postmaster learned everything she could about mail, freight, and even river shipping, eventually becoming an invaluable assistant in the post office’s day to day business.</p><p class=\"p7\">However, Geneva’s true role in assisting Theodora is serving as the unwitting next form of Golub Graygullet. The pigeon hag had not been planning on making the change to a new disguise for several years, but the characters’ arrival in Wickermoor Hollow has hastened her timeline. If the characters do not expose Theodora before the last of the Fallen has been destroyed, young Geneva is killed, her skin worn by Golub as a younger and more unassuming disguise.</p></div>"

The primary quest hook, “A Murder Most Fowl” below, occurs sometime after the defeat of the Chained Reaper (see chapter 19). If the characters uncover the true identity of Theodora Mayville before the Chained Reaper is defeated, see “Postmaster Exposed” later in this chapter.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">A Murder Most Fowl</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">While the characters are in Wickermoor Village, they are approached by Geneva Fairchild, who is in a blubbering panic. She tells them that she found Theodora Mayville murdered in the post office and is scared to go to the constable’s station because of Constable Squire’s callous nature and previous distrust for Geneva’s lilac eyes. She fears that because she was the last person seen with Theodora, she will be blamed for the murder, so she asks the characters to help her investigate the scene.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">In truth, Geneva Fairchild is dead, and her skin is being worn by Golub Graygullet the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.KdPNwELUxUB6SwlF]{Pigeon Hag}</strong></span><span class=\"s8\">*</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>(as detailed in \"Golub Graygullet\" previously). The false Geneva takes the characters to the post office (see area V20 in chapter 11), which has been locked (DC 15). A large “Closed” sign hanging over the door. Within, the stench of death is heavy in the air, and the corpse of Theodora Mayville is sprawled out on the floor, both of her eye sockets empty. As an action, a character who examines the corpse and succeeds on a [[/check MED DC 15]] or [[/check INV DC 15]] check determines that, while the corpse maintains a normal form, it has no bones or internal organs. In truth, this “second skin” is all that remains of Golub’s former disguise.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>The Master Stroke</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">This is a deception to turn the townsfolk against the characters. Before seeking them out, Golub sent a letter to the constable’s station from Theodora Mayville, accusing the characters of threatening her and Geneva with violence and claiming that the pair feared for their lives. A posse of townsfolk led by Constable Squire and Deputy Butterman make their way to the post office while the characters investigate.</p><p class=\"p7\">Geneva lingers by the door of the post office, never moving deeper into the room. When the characters discover that Theodora’s corpse has no bones or organs, if they accuse Geneva of foul play, or if enough time has passed for the posse to get close, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Suddenly, Geneva lets out a bloodcurdling shriek.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p12\"><em><strong>“They killed her!

Down the road, the town’s dovecote lurches back and forth, then suddenly rises into the air, held up by enormous, grotesque pigeon legs that protrude from its underside. Gray, feathery wings erupt from its shingled roof as the legs begin to strut away from Wickermoor Village, hopping through the air as its wings flap rapidly.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p12\"><em><strong>From the direction of the Founder’s Round, you hear the agitated shouting of at least a dozen angry voices.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">Golub casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplWordofReca]{Word of Recall}</em> to teleport to the Pigeon Roost (area R2) of her Walking Dovecote, commanding it to use its Dash action to flee from Wickermoor Village (see “Walking Dovecote Features” later in this chapter), heading northward through the moors. It is unlikely that the characters can catch up to the dovecote at this time, but if they do, see “Walking Dovecote” later in this chapter.</p><p class=\"p7\">The corpse of Geneva Fairchild remains on the floor of the post office, her eyes removed. Characters who examine the remains can determine that there are no bones or organs in the same manner as Theodora Mayville’s body.</p><p class=\"p7\">The posse of townsfolk consists of twelve <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmTough000000000]{Toughs}</strong>, led by Constable Doris Squire (Lawful Neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmKnight00000000]{Knight}</strong>) and Deputy Howie Butterman (Neutral Evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSpy00000000000]{Spy}</strong>). They have been bewitched to be Hostile toward the characters, and fail to notice the escaping dovecote. If the characters confront the mob, Constable Squire produces the letter from Postmaster Mayville containing the accusations of threats.</p><p class=\"p7\">As a Search action, a character who observes the crowd and succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 18]] check can discern that they have been Charmed with magic. The characters may be able to talk their way out of the situation, but if any of the posse see the corpses of Theodora Mayville or Geneva Fairchild, they attack and attempt to apprehend the characters to face trial for murder.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Postmaster Exposed</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">If the characters confront Postmaster Theodora Mayville—who is actually the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.KdPNwELUxUB6SwlF]{Pigeon Hag}</strong></span><span class=\"s8\">*</span> <span class=\"s5\">Golub Graygullet in disguise—before she kills Geneva, she attempts to dissuade the characters from their accusation and alleviate suspicion. </span>In truth, Theodora is dead and her skin is being worn for a flawless shapeshifted form (as detailed in \"Golub Graygullet\" previously).</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters persist in their accusations of villainy or attack Theodora, Golub is forced to act. She lets out a sinister cackle and casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplWordofReca]{Word of Recall} </em>to teleport to the Pigeon Roost (area R2) of her dovecote, which she commands to rise on its pigeon feet and flee Wickermoor Village. The corpse of Theodora Mayville is left behind, its eye sockets empty.</p><p class=\"p7\">A character who inspects the body and succeeds on a [[/check MED DC 15]] or [[/check INV DC 15]] check discovers that while the corpse keeps its form, it has no bones or internal organs. It is up to the characters to decide how they deal with the corpse and the postmaster’s disappearance.</p><p class=\"p7\">In her employer’s absence and following the shocking disappearance of the dovecote, Geneva Fairchild attempts to take over as the town’s new postmaster, swapping to mail delivery by rider on horseback. This persists while the characters continue their adventures and defeat the Fallen. On their travels, they might see the transformed dovecote walking far off in the distance, but never drawing near until the time is right.</p><p class=\"p7\">Once the Chained Reaper is destroyed, Golub makes her move and bewitches the town with a charm. Geneva accuses the characters of plotting to assassinate Mayor Somerton and whips the town into a violent mob.</p></div>"

However, spurred on by the accusations of murder and the enchantments of Golub Graygullet, they are now united in blaming the characters for their ills.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Until Golub Graygullet is destroyed, all of Wickermoor Village’s inhabitants are Hostile toward the characters. The streets are patrolled by groups of people at all hours of the night seeking the “murderers” that brought misfortune to their home. Each angry mob that wanders throughout the town consists of twelve <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmTough000000000]{Toughs}</strong> led by three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWarriorVeteran]{Warrior Veterans}</strong>, which attack the characters on sight and cannot be reasoned with. They will initially attempt to knock the characters Unconscious for imprisonment to stand trial, but if any villagers are slain by the characters, they fight to the death.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">As a Study action, character who observes the villagers and succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 18]] or [[/check ARC DC 18]] check deduces that the mob is bewitched by an enchantment. The charm is powerful, but the use of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDispelMagi]{Dispel Magic}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplRemoveCurs]{Remove Curse}</em> is enough to suppress the effects of the enchantment for one hour. Once the hour has passed, the villager loses their sense once more and is whipped up into a frenzy against the characters.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>The Stealthy Approach</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Although the village is crawling with angry townsfolk at all times, the characters can attempt to sneak through town. For every 10 minutes spent in Wickermoor Village, the characters must succeed on a group [[/check STE DC 15]] check or be detected by a wandering mob (see “Mass Hysteria” above). The DC lowers to 10 if they hide within a building or similar structure to allow these mobs to pass, though nearly every door and window has been locked.</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters are staying at the Green Queen Inn, any possessions left in their rooms are removed and kept in the inn’s storage room. The door to the room is locked but can be picked with a successful [[/check SLT DC 15]] check using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbtulThievesToo]{Thieves' Tools}.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>The Birds</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Although the dovecote has walked off from Wickermoor Village, numerous pigeons roost on the roofs of every building in town. Golub can speak through them, regularly taunting the characters as they stealthily navigate town. Characters who attempt to climb on the roofs of any building or spend more than one hour outside in the open are attacked by four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.tKTrAX9RUUNwcG9Q]{Squabswarms}</strong><span class=\"s8\">*</span>.</p><p class=\"p7\">Peeping Albert (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.HKOXEFjHbucrRayC]{Vermin Familiar} </strong>(Pigeon)<span class=\"s9\">*</span>) remains in town as long as the characters are there, attempting to spy on them and commanding the mundane pigeons in service of their mistress. He can be spotted with a successful [[/check PRC DC 15]] check and flees if attacked.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Powder Keg</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The charm on the people of Wickermoor Village continues to increase in its potency as long as Golub Graygullet lives. While the town is united in its vitriol against the characters, it won't be long until they turn on each other as accusations fly regarding the aiding and harboring of the characters.</p><p class=\"p7\">If the charm persists for one week after first afflicting the townsfolk, tensions boil over and violence breaks out. Four townsfolk, including one named NPC (see chapter 11) are killed in the conflict. Three homes and one named location (see chapter 11) are burned beyond repair. For every subsequent week that passes, the number of people killed and buildings destroyed doubles.</p></div>"

The range of the hag’s spellcasting is not limitless, so the dovecote never strays too far from Wickermoor Village.

Every night of travel, the characters must succeed on a group [[/check STE DC 13]] check or be spotted by the pigeon familiar. Characters who keep their eyes to the sky and succeed on a [[/check PRC DC 15]] check notice Peeping Albert flying 250 feet away. He will attempt to flee and warn Golub, and if he is not killed, the Walking Dovecote moves onto its next destination early (see “The Rookery Roves” above), uprooting itself and moving on that very night. The characters can see the dovecote walking in the far distance and must track it to its new location once more.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">While Golub weaves her sinister spells and continues to twist the minds of the townsfolk of Wickermoor Village, she also dominates the minds of monsters and communities near the Walking Dovecote’s present location and sends them into the wilds to harry the characters’ travel.

Golub can give the dovecote simple commands it follows without her being present to oversee it. The dovecote settles when commanded or if it has no other instructions from Golub.

With each renewal, the gruesome process repeats itself—an eternal vessel for the Crooked Queen’s insatiable hunger for sacrifice.</p><p class=\"p7\">Steeped in the blood of its past, the Crooked House, now called Druskenvald Manor, readies its horrors for the unlucky pair that now call this place home. The Crooked Queen’s influence lingers, her vile energy feeding the house, and the tormented spirits within turn their gaze toward new prey.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">The Crooked House bends and contorts into its true twisted, ruined, and haunted form with the helpless Druskenvalds trapped inside.

With not a single right angle in its bizarre construction, the abandoned manor is an uncanny monument to the Crooked Queen. Her minions infest the place, and the wicked weasel hag, Vessla Browntooth, is its primary corruptor. She twists the souls of the living and dead trapped within the crooked walls. Only with the death of this hag can the horrors of the Crooked House be put to an end.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Crooked House stands as a haunted manifestation of Kehlenn’s ancient power, twisted and alive with malevolent energy. It warps all who dwell within, unravelling and corrupting their very souls in preparation for sacrifice.</p><p class=\"p7\">Victims’ shattered souls and suffering feed the house, which reconfigures itself after each cycle of torment, shaping anew for the next doomed inhabitants. With each renewal, the gruesome process repeats itself—an eternal vessel for the Crooked Queen’s insatiable hunger for sacrifice.</p><p class=\"p7\">Steeped in the blood of its past, the Crooked House, now called Druskenvald Manor, readies its horrors for the unlucky pair that now call this place home. The Crooked Queen’s influence lingers, her vile energy feeding the house, and the tormented spirits within turn their gaze toward new prey.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">The Crooked House bends and contorts into its true twisted, ruined, and haunted form with the helpless Druskenvalds trapped inside. The Crooked Man, Vessla Browntooth, and the repulsive creatures within await new souls ripe for sacrifice. Characters drawn to the house by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Enter the Crooked House in search of Phillip and Adela Druskenvald after first meeting the Crooked Man.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Conduct a séance to commune with the spirit of Joseph Patrini, who can point the characters to the hag in the attic.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Investigate the house and face the spirits within to collect all six mementos from the ghosts of the slain Lockwood Household.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Find the secret door to the attic and use the mementos to gain access to the Cauldron Room (area H17).</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy the weasel hag Vessla Browntooth.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the history of the Crooked House and the tragedy that befell the Lockwoods to help improvise the spectral encounters, including the séance with Joseph Patrini. Reading through the locations of the Crooked House will prepare you for the characters’ investigation, no matter the order they choose.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 3 characters.</p></div>"

              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap12\"><p class=\"h1 section\">A Haunted History</p><p>Seventy years ago, the Lockwoods took their fateful carriage ride to Wickermoor Hollow, leaving behind the crowded streets of Cyril (see chapter 1). Eustace Lockwood believed he was bringing his family to a peaceful valley, free from the city’s toils, where nature would cradle them.</p><p class=\"p7\">Their new manor, perched ominously atop a hill, loomed over a quaint village. Rebuilt by local hands upon the bones of its predecessor, it was grand yet unsettling. The builders didn’t question the hidden attic that appeared in the altered architectural plans—an attic soon claimed by Vessla Browntooth, her evil familiar, Filthy Jasper, and her swarm of twisted weasels.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s8\">The house was built atop the ruins of an ancient locus of Kehlenn’s primeval power, making it the ideal dwelling to corrupt and trap souls, all of which would feed the power of the Crooked Queen. And such an elaborate and crooked construction provided the hag with ample opportunity to torment the numerous inhabitants over the years.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">For a short time, the Lockwoods flourished. Eustace, his wife Petunia, children Sally and Arthur, and Petunia’s elderly mother Keziah enjoyed the manor’s deceptive warmth. Their servants, the Patrinis, shared in their bliss, as did their son Francis, Sally’s best friend of the same age.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">But the joy was fleeting. Illness and nightmares crept in—the work of Vessla’s vile enchantments. No medicine, not even the most skilled healers of Wickermoor Village, could combat the mounting corruption. Eustace, plagued by nightmarish visions, succumbed to madness, slaughtering his family and the Patrinis. The body of Francis was never found.</p><p class=\"p7\">Families came and went, all drawn to the village’s quiet charm. Yet, the tale always ended in tragedy. Eventually, the cursed manor was seemingly abandoned, falling to the village when no one dared return. Yet, no matter whether the manor was occupied or not, the circular window at the highest point of the house always shone with an eerie glow during the Witching Hour.</p><p class=\"p7\">Mayor Wendel Somerton, blind to the horrors, gifted the estate to the Druskenvalds, a move suggested by Randall Graham, the town’s scheming barber and doctor. Graham, knowing the house’s sinister nature and eager to see the Druskenvalds consumed, sought to unleash the house's malice on the new residents.</p></div>"

As with her sisters, she is a crooked Fey from the primeval times of Kehlenn’s reign, becoming more crooked with every passing year. She delights in the vermin that earned the coven its names, particularly favoring the weasels that scurry and scrape throughout walls of the Crooked House.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Vessla is the shortest and meanest of the trio, with a nose that is as long and pointed as her teeth and many other unsavory features that evoke the weasels she cherishes and commands.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">Her witchcraft specializes in the corruption and siphoning of mortal souls, which manifests through horrific nightmares and phantasmal visions. This power is enhanced by the hoard of humanoid teeth, collected by her loyal weasels and her beloved familiar, Filthy Jasper.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">Recently, she captured Phillip and Adela Druskenvald after they settled into the manor home, and she began performing an elaborate ritual to prepare their souls for sacrifice.

After the bloodbath, Eustace hanged himself, urged on by Vessla Browntooth. She crammed his broken corpse into a narrow crawlspace beneath the house, snapping nearly every bone to make him fit.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">From that cursed night onward, his soul was bound to the Crooked Queen’s will, his spirit as distorted as his crumpled remains. Eustace now stalks the manor as a crooked specter in a tattered suit, twisted beyond recognition. Even when not with the house, his bond to it and the queen remains unbroken. With each soul claimed by the house, the queen's power deepens in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p7\">The Crooked Man’s aim is to free the Crooked Queen from her prison and restore her reign over Druskenvald. As her loyal minion, he roams Wickermoor Hollow like a shadow, aiding the schemes of the Vermintoll Coven and the cult of the Old Ways, drawing ever closer to unleashing the queen's malice.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Lockwood Household</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">After Eustace Lockwood’s bloody rampage, the spirits of his murdered household became trapped in the Crooked House, where they remain to this day. While the house has claimed many souls over the years, the ghosts of the Lockwood Household’s six victims manifest more strongly than the others.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Petunia Lockwood</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The dour but dutiful wife of Eustace Lockwood, Petunia, had been looking forward to moving to a more agrarian community. Her true love was in tending all manner of plants, especially her beloved bergamot trees. She viewed the Lockwood Estate as her chance to finally enjoy her husband’s wealth—which was the only reason she married him.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Sally Lockwood</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Sally was Eustace and Petunia’s first child, but she never received much attention from her parents. Suffering from regular nightmares, Sally developed phobias and paranoias at a young age. The only time she felt safe was when she was surrounded by her dolls and other toys.</p><p class=\"p7\">On the night of the murders, Sally managed to escape the Crooked House before succumbing to her wounds on the path down the hill. Her spirit eventually reincarnated into the dog now called Shuck (see “Shuck” below).</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Arthur Lockwood</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Arthur was born in Cyril but spent most of his short life in Wickermoor Village. He was a sickly baby, but no doctors that the Lockwoods hired could discover an underlying illness. His regular wailing led to him being left in the nursery for most hours of the night.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Keziah Endicott</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Keziah, Petunia’s elderly mother, was widowed at a young age, and she moved in with the Lockwoods. Coming from a wealthy and eccentric family, she developed many hobbies over her long life—landscape painting, taxidermy, and raising albino peafowl. Her active social life intrigued many strange folk from the town with a strong reverence for the Old Ways.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Joseph Patrini</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Joseph came from a long line of butlers and took the profession very seriously, so he unquestioningly followed his employers to Wickermoor Village. He brought his wife, son, and love of music. While the Lockwoods abandoned Pholsense’s faith of the Silver Path (see chapter 1), Joseph never wavered and believed the divine would protect him in his strange new home.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Gail Patrini</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Gail found less joy in being a housekeeper than her husband, but she relished being a mother. She never trusted her employers and found Keziah’s strange hobbies especially unsettling. Her intuition allowed her to save her son on the night of her death, sacrificing herself so that Francis survived.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Francis Patrini</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Francis, a clever and funny child, was the precocious son of Joseph and Gail Patrini. He was best friends with Sally Lockwood and would unsuccessfully try to get the girl to go on small adventures with him despite her inherent fears.</p><p class=\"p7\">He was saved from the murderous Eustace Lockwood by his mother but was deeply traumatized by the experience. He became unable to speak coherently, and the memories of his former life became fragmented, eventually becoming known to all in Wickermoor Village as Old Rusty (see chapter 11).</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Jenkin Family</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Jenkin family serves as caretakers for the Druskenvalds during their stay, having long tended the homes of Wickermoor’s elite. Three years ago, Mayor Somerton assigned them to the old Lockwood Estate, an honor laced with dread. Like the villagers, they had heard the whispered tales of the cursed house. Nevertheless, they moved in, preparing for the Druskenvalds.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Walter_Jenkin.webp\" width=\"250\" /><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Walter Jenkin</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">A handsome and affable sort, @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.X3EHiRDw1XdlevSh]{Walter Jenkin} (Lawful Neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong>), lost his voice within weeks of arriving. No healer could explain the sudden silence. Now, he communicates through writing and sign language, which his family also knows and can translate. Entering the manor makes him nervous, sensing its malice, though he never speaks of his fears.</p><p class=\"p7\">Known for his loyalty and dutifulness, Walter has an almost reverent respect for Mayor Wendel Somerton and his other former employers. And in this new position, he has already become devoted to the Druskenvalds, despite having only just met them.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Gilly_Jenkin.webp\" width=\"250\" /><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Gilly Jenkin</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.MLb6KhISPXDOhKnV]{Gilly Jenkin} (Lawful Neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong>) has known Walter since they were children, and they have loved each other just as long. She is not as devoted to the Druskenvalds as her husband; her concerns lie more with their daughter. She was pregnant with Dani when they first became employed by Mayor Somerton over a decade ago, and she is overly protective of the girl. Gilly feels the presence of the strange forces in Wickermoor Village, and she fears her daughter Dani has some sort of strong connection to these powers.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Dani_Jenkin.webp\" width=\"250\" /><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Dani Jenkin</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.UC10TAPDieUb6eYH]{Dani} (Neutral, human noncombatant </span><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong><span class=\"s5\">) was born to Walter and Gilly within a couple of weeks of their move to the mayoral manor to serve Mayor Somerton’s family. Now ten years old, she senses the ghosts and disturbing forces around her, knowing things a child shouldn’t. Though she cannot yet control her abilities, her bond with the powers of the Old Ways grows.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Shuck</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKHOUS_Shuck%20and%20Wisp_Finished.webp\" width=\"200\" /><p class=\"p5\">A red-furred dog that never leaves Dani’s side, Shuck (Neutral good <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWolf0000000000]{Wolf}</strong>) was a stray before the Jenkins took him in. Unbeknownst to the family, Shuck is the reincarnated soul of Sally Lockwood,<em><strong> </strong></em>a victim of the Crooked House who escaped just before her death. Shuck guards Dani fiercely. If any of the characters are evil, or if they use supernatural abilities that are in any way associated with the Crooked Queen, Shuck growls at them if they get anywhere near Dani.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Wisp</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The estate’s gray cat has earned Walter’s affection but terrifies Dani. The cat is no ordinary feline; it is a shapeshifted <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.N6ttfwgb1ckMzfST]{Ketgrinn}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span>, a Fey in service to Vessla Browntooth. Wisp stole Walter’s voice and torments Dani by speaking to her when they are alone. Shuck loathes Wisp, sensing his true nature, and stays close to protect Dani from the lurking evil. If the ketgrinn’s true form is exposed and slain, Walter’s ability to speak is restored.</p></div>"

Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>An old man with wild red-gray hair and filthy clothes scrambles toward you.

They feed. They laugh. Every step leads to his return. Its return. Her return. Disintegration. Annihilation.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">The characters can try to calm Old Rusty, but even if he’s made calm, he has nothing coherent to offer the characters. Rusty, whose true identity is Francis Patrini, was just a child when the Crooked House took his family away 70 years ago, and the traumatic experience left him forever changed.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Learning More</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters attempt to learn more about the Crooked House and its history, either now or at some other point when they're in Wickermoor Village, they don't get far. Most of the superstitious locals are so terrified of bringing evil upon themselves that they will not even speak of it out loud.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">Even the Newcomers, who pride themselves on reason, dismiss talk of cursed houses as mere fairy tales, unwilling to believe in the supernatural so close to home.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">They claim that while some of the families there have had bad luck, those same families may merely have been treating the place as a temporary vacation home before moving away. They genuinely believe—or hope—that the Crooked House is just a house, no matter how spooky its name and reputation are.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s13\">The most sinister members of the Followers of the Old Ways (see chapters 8 and 11) know the true history and encourage the notion that the house is perfectly safe.

Before your eyes, the pleasant, albeit uncanny façade of the building shifts. The house’s appearance becomes shadowed and patchy, with mold and rot spreading across its walls. The angles and lines of the walls, eaves, windows, and roofs shift into jarring and impossible angles. It is a house out of a nightmare.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p12\"><em><strong>The tidy gardens nearest the house are quickly overgrown with weeds and thistles. Petals, bright and flourishing just seconds before, wilt and drop away. The house now shows decades of disrepair.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p12\"><em><strong>A twisted form appears from nowhere on the porch and waves to you. It calls out, “Welcome to the Crooked House, friends. We’ve been expecting you.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">As the characters get closer, describe to them the form of the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.0KmT8pNN6lQ0fjH3]{Crooked Man}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span>: a tall, lanky, contorted version of a person. His limbs jut off at odd angles, and his neck bends to the side in the manner of a hanged corpse. Clad in a tattered suit and a bent-top hat that covers his eyes, he smiles with an impossibly large grin filled with crooked, yellow teeth.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>A Crooked Chat</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters strike up a conversation with the Crooked Man, be careful not to give away too much about the plot of the adventure too soon. Let the hints and the foreshadowing start in vague and unsettling means. Some answers he might give to those asking about him include:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">“Who I am is unimportant. What I am is for you to find out. I am your destiny. You will be crooked too.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Phillip and Adela are inside, waiting for you. They are getting to know the house. Or, more accurately, the house is getting to know them.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Phillip, Adela, you, and all your kind are a curse upon this once beautiful land. You will return from whence you came in blood and fire.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Go on in and enjoy the refreshments I’ve prepared for you. Phillip and Adela will be with you shortly.”</p></li></ul><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Farewell for Now…</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters attempt to attack the Crooked Man in any way, he invokes the power of the Crooked House and simply disappears. Otherwise, after the Crooked Man has said everything he has to say, he doffs his hat toward the characters, gives a mocking bow, and vanishes. As if on command, a cacophonous boom of thunder shakes the house, and a violent storm rolls in. The sky opens up with pouring rain and howling winds.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">The Crooked Man appears to the characters at least once per floor (see “The First Floor,” “The Second Floor,” and “The Third Floor” later in this chapter), but no matter what the characters do, he will not attack them throughout their investigation of the Crooked House. Additionally, you can have him appear and disappear at your discretion to maintain tension and dread throughout this chapter.</span></p><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div></div>"

Most of the name plaques have been worn away, but with closer inspection, the characters can uncover the tragic history through a few noteworthy portraits described below.</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>The Lockwoods.</strong> The patriarch in this portrait bears an unsettling resemblance to the Crooked Man. The plaque, though weathered, reveals the names: Eustace Lockwood, his wife Petunia, their daughter Sally, their infant son Arthur, and Petunia’s frail mother, Keziah. Standing beside them are their servants—Joseph and Gail Patrini, along with their son Francis.</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>The Druskenvalds.</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>The familiar faces in this portrait are rendered in a chilling light. Though the characters cannot know it, this painting foreshadows the Druskenvalds’ doom. Adela stands uncharacteristically stoic, adorned with a woven wicker choker and vibrant red and orange flowers in her hair. Phillip is weeping, a black crown of six points atop his head and a crescent moon pin glinting from his right lapel.</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>The Characters. </strong>The most shocking of all is the final portrait—it features the characters themselves. They grin widely in the frame, but their mouths are empty, void of teeth, their hollow smiles a haunting omen.</p><p class=\"p5\">Vessla Browntooth laid curses on the portraits. A character who examines the paintings must succeed on a [[/save CHA DC 10]] saving throw or take [[/damage 1d6 psychic]]{3 (1d6)} Psychic damage and be cursed. When the cursed character rolls a 1 on a D20 Test, a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.u5pKJAtHzkur3ciJ]{Boogleswarm}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> emerges from cracks or holes in the walls and attacks that character immediately.

On a circular table by the cobweb-choked fireplace is a wooden spirit board of impeccable craftsmanship. A small heart-shaped planchette rests atop it, engraved with the initials “A.D.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s13\">This spirit board clearly belongs to Adela Druskenvald and can be used to conduct a séance that can give the characters critical information to unravel the mysteries of the Crooked House. A character who succeeds on a [[/check ARC DC 10]] check knows that to begin the séance, two or more characters must place a hand on the planchette and ask if there is a spirit in the room.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">If two or more characters agree to use the spirit board, it summons the spirit of Joseph Patrini, the servant who was murdered by Eustace Lockwood 70 years ago. A pleasant fire crackles to life in the fireplace, and the planchette moves to “HELLO.”</p><p class=\"p7\">The spirit board has numbers, letters, and the words “YES,” “NO,” “HELLO,” and “GOODBYE.” If one of the characters using the spirit board asks a question, the spirit of Joseph Patrini will answer to the best of his ability.</p><p class=\"p7\">His memories are muddled, clouded by time and the horrors he’s witnessed, and though far from omnipotent, he remembers the night of Eustace Lockwood’s rampage with grim clarity. He knows of the hag lurking in the attic and the six cursed mementos that will unlock the hidden chamber where she waits.</p><p class=\"p7\">You can decide what information to provide and what to hold back, but if clever questions are asked, be sure to reward the characters with useful information. Use this opportunity to provide clues, foreshadow, and increase the tension. Below are some possible questions and answers to guide your own play:</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Who are you?</strong> PATRINI</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Are Phillip and Adela here?</strong> YES</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Where are they?</strong> UPSTAIRS</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>How did you die?</strong> MURDER</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Who killed you?</strong> EUSTACE LOCKWOOD</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Who is responsible for this?</strong> HAG</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Where is the hag?</strong> ATTIC</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>How do we get to the attic?</strong> 6 MEMENTOS</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>What are the mementos?</strong> GEM KEY CUP DOLL BEAR PIN</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Where are they?</strong> EVERY FLOOR</p><p class=\"p5\">Roll [[/r 1d10]] every time the characters ask a question. On a 1, every character using the board takes [[/damage 1d4 psychic]]{2 (1d4)} Psychic damage. For each damage roll after the first, increase the damage die as follows: [[/damage 1d6 psychic]]{1d6}, [[/damage 1d8 psychic]]{1d8}, [[/damage 1d10 psychic]]{1d10}, and to a maximum of [[/damage 1d12 psychic]]{1d12}.</p><p class=\"p7\">As the séance draws to its close, Patrini offers one final, urgent message. This is your chance to reveal any critical information the characters may have overlooked. If they have gathered all the necessary clues, Patrini’s final words are etched in chilling clarity: “FIND MY SON HE LIVES.” This refers to Old Rusty, the groundskeeper of Wickermoor Village (see chapter 11).</p><p class=\"p7\">The planchette slowly drags itself to “GOODBYE,” and the fire in the hearth extinguishes with a hiss, plunging the room into a suffocating darkness. Any attempts to resume the séance are met only with cold, dead silence.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Mementos.</strong></em> A list of the locations of the six mementos needed to break the barrier to reach Vessla Browntooth is included in area H16.</p></div>"

One eye socket is empty, and the other features a dull red bloodstone.</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">The landscapes in the room were all feverishly painted by Keziah Endicott in the final year of her life, inspired by her dreams in the Crooked House. A character who inspects the paintings and succeeds on a [[/check INV DC 15]] check discovers her signature and that each one contains hidden weasels, centipedes, and pigeons, all grotesque.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">The peacock statue animates and attacks (use the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmBasilisk000000]{Basilisk}</strong> stat block, except it is a Construct) when a creature attempts to remove its bloodstone.

Each of these trophies is frighteningly uncanny, with figures in unnatural poses, enormous glass eyes, and strangely bulging hides.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">This is the threshold to the secret attic door, which is hidden beneath layers of shadow and sealed by a powerful magical barrier. Should the characters touch the trapdoor, these creatures defend the entrance to the attic.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Secret Trapdoor.</strong></em> A character can succeed on a [[/check PRC DC 10]] check to spot the trapdoor hidden in the ceiling.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the stuffed brown bear within this room emits a pulse of psychic energy, and each character must succeed on a [[/save INT DC 10]] saving throw or take [[/damage 1 psychic]]{1} Psychic damage.</p><p class=\"p24\"></p><p class=\"p7\">On the second round, the DC increases to [[/save INT DC 11]]{11}, and the damage increases to [[/damage 1d4 psychic]]{2 (1d4)}.

On the fourth and subsequent rounds until the pulse is stopped, the DC is [[/save INT DC 13]]{13} and the damage [[/damage 1d8 psychic]]{4 (1d8)}.</p><p class=\"p7\">The characters can locate and destroy the instigating trophy causing the psychic pulse using various ability checks. A total of three successful checks allows the characters to locate the focus of this source: the brown bear in the northeast corner of the room. Each successive check helps the characters narrow it down more. The DC is 14, but after a successful ability check, further uses of the same check increase by 3.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">For example, if the first character succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, the next Wisdom (Perception) check is DC 17, and the third is DC 20. However, if the second check attempted was an Intelligence (Arcana) check instead, the DC would only be 14 instead of 17. Therefore, different tactics working together are more effective than one tactic used repeatedly.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Use the following checks as a guide for what characters might attempt—and be flexible:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Wisdom (Perception) to notice where the noises are loudest and the movements more visible.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Intelligence (Investigation) to discern patterns and direction in the noise and motion.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Intelligence (Arcana) to focus on the arcane energies and their most likely points of emanation.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Wisdom (Insight or Medicine) can observe the other characters in the room and how they are reacting to the pulse based on their location in the room.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s5\">Spells like <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDetectMagi]{Detect Magic}</em> can’t find the exact source but can narrow the focus and count as one automatic success. The same spell can’t generate another success.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">After three successful checks, or any alternative solutions to the problem you deem effective, the characters locate the stuffed brown bear.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Weasels.</strong></em> When initiative is rolled, [[/r 3d4]]{7 (3d4)} <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWeasel00000000]{Weasels}</strong> scurry out of the walls and attack, speaking with one voice: “Vessla Browntooth will eat your flesh!”</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\"><em><strong>Spirit Inside.</strong></em> When the characters identify the instigating bear, they also discover that a woman has been sewn inside with only her face sticking out of the bear’s neck beneath its crooked snout.

It is a living, breathing entity offering its departed passengers their final journey to life after death. For many, this trip is their last fleeting taste of civilization before being plunged into the terror of what waits beyond the reach of both the hallowed and profane.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is the introductory adventure to <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign, but it can also be played as a standalone one-shot. The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> can materialize anywhere it is required, always at night, and most frequently near graveyards or standing stones. The chapter’s thrilling conclusion can occur in any forest where the train crashes and transforms, leaving the characters stranded in isolation.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> thunders her call, ferrying wayward souls through the Shroud of death to the life that waits beyond. But among the spectral passengers bound for Druskenvald and restless spirits trapped aboard the ghost train is a crooked shade that plots to derail this fateful journey.</p><p class=\"p7\">Characters who find themselves aboard the ghost train through the Quest Hooks might initially only want to reach their destination, but they may soon have additional goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Free the haints—lost souls trapped on the train—by resolving their unfinished business, trapping them in a Soul Can, or destroying them.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Meet Phillip and Adela Druskenvald and possibly have their fortunes told.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Pursue the Phantom Trainhopper to the Tender.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Survive the battle with the corrupted Ghostlight Locomotive.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the key NPCs, locations, and concepts featured in this chapter and chapters 1 and 8 so you can deliver strong story moments and establish critical worldbuilding. A casual readthrough of each area of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> will help you improvise interactions. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “When It’s Time,” ensures a terrifying and tone-setting final encounter.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 1 characters. By the end of the chapter, the characters will have advanced to level 3. At your discretion, characters may also begin the adventure at level 2 or 3.</p>",

Once you board, there’s no turning back, no stepping off until you’ve reached your destination.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\"><em><strong>- The Vagrant -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p4\">Hear that? The solemn notes of a lone fiddle followed by the bellowing sound of a train whistle means you possess a one-way ticket into the unknown. Those sounds herald the arrival of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>. It only stills and quiets for a transient moment before it lurches forward once more into its eternal voyage between life and death, so hop aboard.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> is more than a mere vessel. It is a living, breathing entity offering its departed passengers their final journey to life after death. For many, this trip is their last fleeting taste of civilization before being plunged into the terror of what waits beyond the reach of both the hallowed and profane.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is the introductory adventure to <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign, but it can also be played as a standalone one-shot. The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> can materialize anywhere it is required, always at night, and most frequently near graveyards or standing stones. The chapter’s thrilling conclusion can occur in any forest where the train crashes and transforms, leaving the characters stranded in isolation.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> thunders her call, ferrying wayward souls through the Shroud of death to the life that waits beyond. But among the spectral passengers bound for Druskenvald and restless spirits trapped aboard the ghost train is a crooked shade that plots to derail this fateful journey.</p><p class=\"p7\">Characters who find themselves aboard the ghost train through the Quest Hooks might initially only want to reach their destination, but they may soon have additional goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Free the haints—lost souls trapped on the train—by resolving their unfinished business, trapping them in a Soul Can, or destroying them.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Meet Phillip and Adela Druskenvald and possibly have their fortunes told.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Pursue the Phantom Trainhopper to the Tender.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Survive the battle with the corrupted Ghostlight Locomotive.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the key NPCs, locations, and concepts featured in this chapter and chapters 1 and 8 so you can deliver strong story moments and establish critical worldbuilding. A casual readthrough of each area of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> will help you improvise interactions. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “When It’s Time,” ensures a terrifying and tone-setting final encounter.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 1 characters. By the end of the chapter, the characters will have advanced to level 3. At your discretion, characters may also begin the adventure at level 2 or 3. If the characters begin this adventure at a higher level (see “Quest Hooks” below), a few modifications are included in certain areas of this chapter.</p></div>"

            "The Ghostlight Locomotive": {
              "name": "The Ghostlight Locomotive",
              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap10\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Ghoslight Locomotive</p><p>The Ghostlight Locomotive is an old black train engine that rides rails made of mist and pulls the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>. This ghost train has but one primary purpose: to ferry the souls of the dead to Druskenvald so that they might be reborn for a second chance at life. On rare occasions, it grants passage to living beings who wish to pass between the realms of life and death.</p><p class=\"p7\">To make this run, the train must travel through the Shroud, a shrieking eldritch fog that envelops numerous afterlives and realms of death. The passage is always dangerous due to the devouring nature of the ghastly mist that can obliterate any soul, living or dead.</p><h2>Ghosts in the Machine</h2><p class=\"p5\">To keep itself running, the train burns souls for fuel. Though this may seem a terrible truth, a balance is struck between the spirits that are ferried and those that are consumed. Souls unfortunate enough to become fodder in the ghost train’s firebox were once Wayward Haints—restless spirits that cannot rest or pass on due to unresolved affairs in life—but have deteriorated into soul coal (see “Haints” below) after spending years trapped on the train. This heavy toll ensures the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> can continue to serve its purpose as ferry for the dead, granting them safe passage from the enveloping annihilation of the Shroud.</p><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:6px;bottom:6px;left:6px;right:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:relative;z-index:3\"><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><p><strong>GM Tip</strong></p><p class=\"p11\">As you progress through this chapter, let the tension build slowly. Characters may be meeting each other for the first time. The modular encounters in each train car should not only challenge characters but also gradually build unease before the conclusion in the woods.</p><p class=\"p12\">If you are running the full Crooked Moon adventure, read through each adventure chapter at least once so you feel comfortable with any potential outcomes before you begin. Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are involved in multiple chapters; this is the characters’ first opportunity to learn about them and make their own first impressions. Their interactions will shape the characters’ relationships and decisions in future events.</p><p class=\"p13\">If you are running this chapter as a standalone one-shot, then you might allow the characters to rejoin the Vagrant on the train to head toward their next adventure, wherever that may be. You can also ignore the Fateweaving guidance that ties characters to the overarching campaign of The Crooked Moon.</p></aside></div></div>"

            "NPCs of the Ghostlight Express": {
              "name": "NPCs of the Ghostlight Express",
              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap10\"><p class=\"h1 section horned\">NPCS of the Ghostlight Express</p><p>In addition to the NPCs listed below, the train teems with the insubstantial souls of the departed. Some are on a path to rebirth in Druskenvald, while others are Wayward Haints (see “Haints” below) trapped aboard by their unresolved past lives.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Phillip and Adela Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are going home. They ride the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> back to Druskenvald, the domain of death they rule together as husband and wife. Even at first glance, it is plain to see the loving bond between the pair.</p><p class=\"p7\">Phillip is a man of vision who believes that keeping a forward-thinking attitude will solve any problem, championing “modern” ideals and striving for “progress.” Dapper, charming, and overconfident, the lord of Druskenvald is well-liked by the land’s people despite his general aloofness to their present struggles. He is a tall, thin man with dark, slicked-back hair and a pencil-thin mustache. He carries an ornate black cane topped with a silver goat skull.</p><p class=\"p7\">Adela is outgoing, enthusiastic, and caring, always looking at the spiritual side of every situation. She does not need to look far, however, for even in a world filled with magic, she possesses a tether to the spirit world and formidable powers of divination that let her peer into the future with second sight. She is supremely supportive of her husband and believes her positivity helps him appreciate the amazing world he has fashioned for them. She is short and petite with wavy brown hair, almost always wearing a glamorous dress accented by a glittering necklace with a planchette hanging from its chain.</p><p class=\"p7\">When the characters first encounter Phillip and Adela (see area G3), they greet the newcomers with warmth and curiosity. They may be willing to share details about the realm of Druskenvald and themselves (see chapter 1), but they frequently turn the questions back on the characters in genuine interest.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s8\">The Druskenvalds have one overarching goal: make both life and death a grand old time. Life here in the afterlife is sweet, and they do what they can to make sure it stays that way. While many afterlives strip away much of what it means to be mortal, Druskenvald does the opposite. Phillip especially finds beauty in the messy, imperfect, and oftentimes sinful nature of mortal folk and strives to maintain that in the realm he rules.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">It is left to your discretion what business Phillip and Adela were attending to in the mortal realms—and if they are even willing to share. Regardless, by the time they appear in this story, the experience is happily behind them. With nothing but time to kill on the train, their recent past has melted away, and they welcome any distraction that might cheer the final stretch toward their destination: their sprawling manor home called Chateau Clair de Lune.</p><p class=\"p7\">Use this opportunity to create a connection with Phillip and Adela, since these two NPCs will interact with the characters throughout <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Vagrant</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_The_Vagrant.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">The Vagrant, an amiable frogman with mottled green skin, serves as a “Stranger” (see chapter 1) who ferries the souls of the dead to the “other side.” The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> is his chosen vessel for this sacred responsibility, and he serves as the ghost train’s conductor and engineer. He wears the tattered garb of a vagabond, complete with a wide-brimmed hat where he always keeps three railroad spikes.</p><p class=\"p7\">Bound by his eternal duty, the Vagrant offers safe passage to the souls of the dead who will be reborn in the realm of Druskenvald. A consummate storyteller, he believes each passenger that boards the ghost train has a tale to tell, which he is happy to do in the form of a song aided by his well-worn fiddle.</p><p class=\"p7\">The Vagrant has a strange kinship with the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> as its sole caretaker. Through the eons, the few who have come to know this ferryman have wondered if the Vagrant himself is bound to the train just as much as the haints who cannot disembark. But none ever learned the truth of the frogman’s origins, and his story remains a mystery.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Story and a Song</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Meeting the Vagrant is an otherworldly experience, heralded by the sound of his fiddle preceding the arrival of the train. The Vagrant has a fondness for all the souls he guides, so when the shock of his sudden appearance subsides, the dead and the living alike find themselves facing a cordial, smiling frogman ready with a story, a song, and a wink.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\">Though he may seem lighthearted and carefree, he holds his role as ferryman with immense gravity. The locomotive that pulls the cars of the ghost train cannot speak for itself, so the Vagrant speaks on its behalf. When conversing with the characters, he always maintains his friendly disposition, no matter the question or topic. Some things he might say include:</span></p><p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Who are you?</strong> “Well now, you can call me the Vagrant. Just a humble ferryman, guidin’ souls to the other side.”</span></p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>What is the Ghostlight Locomotive?</strong> “Ah, the heart of the train, it is. It’s no mere engine—no, it’s got a will of its own, you see. And only it can get us where we’re headed.”</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Where are we going?</strong> “Druskenvald, o’course! Or the lord and lady’s chateau to be specific. That’s where this line ends, for now. But the tracks . . . they ain’t always the same.”</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>What are these spirits?</strong> “Passengers just like you, plain and simple.”</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>What happens if we stop the train?</strong> “Heh, stoppin’ it? Well, that’d be stoppin’ fate itself. No more ticket holders from here ‘til the chateau. Ain’t no peace in derailing destiny—best you stay aboard.”</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Haints</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Haints are tethered apparitions, their lanky, ethereal forms shimmering a ghastly blue-green and floating slightly off the surface of the train car floors. Their clothes are worn and tattered, billowing as if caught in a perpetual breeze. Some haints repeat actions and phrases from their past lives, trapped in a loop of obsessive memories, while others might repeatedly relive moments of joy, sorrow, or fear.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_The_Phantom_Trainhopper.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p7\">A <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aEPVMByT2COU30KF]{Wayward Haint}</strong><span class=\"s12\">*</span> is a spirit trapped between the worlds of the living and the dead. They are not free souls, usually due to some lingering guilt or an unresolved connection to the mortal world. Not all haints are inherently wicked, but their lack of freedom to cross over into their next form of existence takes a toll on their psyche and disposition. As haints, they are tethered to the train forever until their burden is lifted or they deteriorate into soul coal and become fuel for the train.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Bound Spirits</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Haints that remain bound to the train become its minions if they have not been freed prior to its transformation into the corrupted Ghostlight Locomotive.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Vacant Vessels</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Haints fear empty bottles and jars, which can be found in the Passenger Car (area G1) or Lounge Car (area G3), because they can be trapped inside of them with the proper technique. A character who contemplates the haints and succeeds on a [[/check HIS DC 16]] or [[/check REL DC 16]] check recalls the Bottle Trap trait in the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aEPVMByT2COU30KF]{Wayward Haint}</strong><span class=\"s12\">*</span> stat block. Bottles containing a haint count as Soul Cans (see “When It's Time” later in this adventure).</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Phantom Trainhopper</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">There is one soul aboard the train who doesn’t have a ticket to ride: the <strong>@UUID[Actor.UXvfXXYLkjrjVYGB]{Phantom Trainhopper}</strong> (@UUID[Actor.xA6qV8U9Cte3eGkC]{Shadow}). In life, they were a member of a secret cult in the living world that worships Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen. Tonight, they were ritually sacrificed so their spirit could sneak aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> on this rare evening that Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are passengers.</p><p class=\"p7\">Granted exceptional power in death by Kehlenn’s chief minion, the Crooked Man, this malevolent shade carries a curse aboard to corrupt the spirits that the Ghostlight Locomotive uses for fuel. With help from the devouring Shroud, the Phantom Trainhopper turns the ghost train against the Vagrant and strands the Druskenvalds—and coincidentally, the characters—in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p7\">Once the shade releases Kehlenn’s curse, it’s just a matter of time before that curse reaches the Tender (area G8), and, ultimately, the locomotive. Unwittingly, the characters likely play an integral part in bringing about The Crooked Queen’s goal by unsealing the final door and letting the curse in.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter8_Tarot_Reading.webp\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p></p></div></div></div>"

They may be picked up together or individually, but if you are running this chapter as a standalone adventure, the characters should board as a group.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\">While the ghost train may itself provide enough interest for some to board on sight, others may desire some goal or justification to accept the Vagrant’s invitation. For a full-length campaign, talk with your players to establish the circumstances that lead their character to embark when the train arrives, even if begrudgingly.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">You may choose whichever Quest Hook you feel will most enthrall the players. Here are a few examples:</p><p class=\"p16\"><strong>Fate.</strong> The characters have an exclusive invitation to ride the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, a rare and mysterious opportunity, because it is their destiny. Each character, unbeknownst to them, has a ticket in their pocket, and each has their own rationale for boarding the train.</p><p class=\"p17\">Adela Druskenvald foresaw the characters’ arrival through her tarot cards and believes the travelers are here to aid them on their trip, though she cannot see why. The Vagrant may make knowing cryptic remarks but refuses to elaborate. If asked, circular logic abounds. The Vagrant is here to pick up the travelers because they have tickets, and they have tickets because Druskenvald is their destination.</p><p class=\"p16\"><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Death.</strong> The characters have died. They may have died all together, or they might have died at different times in different places. When the events of the adventure kick off, the Vagrant makes the rare decision to instantly reincarnate the characters into their new living bodies, which likely take the form of the reborn species of Druskenvald (see chapter 2). Alternatively, they can be reborn in their previous body or as a different species not native to Druskenvald. Either way, they find themselves standing together on the platform of a ghostly train station awaiting what comes next.</span></p><p class=\"p17\">This unique hook can follow an existing campaign in which all the characters died, but the players want to continue with a new version of their existing characters. If the characters in this scenario are higher than 3rd level, you should adjust the difficulty of this chapter and the future events of the campaign, or alternatively, you and your players should agree that the experience of dying reduces all characters back to 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p class=\"p18\"><strong>Homeward Bound.</strong> The characters are originally from Druskenvald, but through strange circumstances they spilled out of the Shroud into the mortal realms. All they want is to get back to where they came from, and have finally found a location they believe the <em>Ghostlight Express </em>will be arriving so they can go home at last.</p></div>"

The Vagrant extends his hand and gestures to pass him the ticket.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p21\"><em><strong>“Best hurry now,” he says with a wink, “train won’t wait forever.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Ghostlight Express Features</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Unless otherwise stated, the train car areas of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> have the following general features:</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Ceilings. </strong>All cars have 9-foot-tall ceilings and are encased by steel support beams.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Lighting.</strong> Flickering brass lamps illuminate each train car, shedding bright light throughout.</p><p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Doors.</strong> Each car of the train has two interior vestibule doors, one at the front and one at the back, with two exceptions: the Passenger Car (area G1) has an additional boarding door on its right side, and its rear door is an exterior door that leads out the back of the train. Both are sealed with <em>Arcane Lock</em> spells the Vagrant can bypass. The Tender (area G8) has no door at its front.</span></p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Spectral Passengers. </strong>Ghostly forms of passengers appear and fade away randomly throughout the train cars. They are moving on to the afterlife, avoiding the fate of becoming a haint. While they seem to sometimes watch the characters, they don’t respond to any attempted interaction.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Windows.</strong> The train’s windows don’t open and have AC 18, 30 hit points, and a damage threshold of 15. If a window is broken, the Shroud floods the car and affects spirit passengers as described in “The Shroud Beyond” below.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Shroud Beyond</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">In the unlikely scenario where the interior of the train is exposed to the Shroud, roll initiative! For each round the door, window, or breach remains open, the billowing mist of the Shroud devours a spirit passenger and turns them into a hateful <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSpecter0000000]{Specter}</strong>. These creatures are bloodthirsty and attack the characters until destroyed.</p><p class=\"p7\">[[/r 1d4]] rounds after the breach occurs, the Vagrant lets out a shrill whistle on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties). The breached door or window closes or reforms, and no more passengers are corrupted.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Haints on the Haunt</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">While most of the passengers are here to cross over into Druskenvald and be reborn, some are burdened by unresolved grievances from their past lives and are instead tethered to the train until they can let go of their attachment (see “Haints” above).</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Unfettering a Haint</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aEPVMByT2COU30KF]{Wayward Haints}</strong><span class=\"s12\">*</span> can’t leave the train car they are found within. Each of the bound spirits has a story to tell, though they may only remember vague details. To progress the adventure, the characters must free the haints from the train, which can be accomplished with two general methods.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Destruction.</strong> Destroying a haint breaks its bond to the train, though it leaves an echo of pain behind that comes back to haunt the characters later (see area G8).</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Resolution.</strong> Alternatively, the characters can help the haints resolve their unprocessed emotions toward their unfinished business. A haint’s binding is resolved either by helping it reach an understanding of its emotional bindings (see “Helping a Haint” below) or by bringing it the token that completes the missing piece of that understanding, as described in each haint’s entry in the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> locations. When a haint moves on and is freed from the train, each character regains [[/damage 1d6 healing]]{1d6 hit points}, gaining any excess beyond their hit point maximum as temporary hit points.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Helping a Haint.</strong></em> Bringing a haint their lost token is the safest way to achieve resolution, but there is a riskier alternative. A character can interact with a haint in some way and make an ability check, trying to help it come to terms with its unfinished business. Each haint has a list of suggested “resolution proficiencies” that have the best chance of helping it reach resolution. Ability checks using these skills are against DC 12. Other checks can work at your discretion, but these checks are against DC 15 unless you feel the justification is especially fitting.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\">Each time a check using a given skill or tool proficiency is successful, the DC of further uses of that proficiency to help the same haint increases by 2. Characters are better served by applying a variety of approaches.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s13\">Each successful ability check helps the haint reach a resolution, and after three successes, the haint is freed. However, with each failure, the haint grows more impatient and agitated. After three failures, it loses itself to rage and despair, becomes hostile, and attacks the characters. At that point, they have no choice but to destroy it.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Switcheroo!</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The first time the characters pass through the interior vestibule door at the front of a car, it leads to a random train car they have not yet visited. When this happens, characters who pass through the vestibule doors vanish through a portal of swirling mist and wait in limbo. Once all characters have followed, the door closes behind them and they arrive at a random car, as determined by rolling on the Random Car table.</p><p class=\"p7\">Once a car has been entered, it is locked into place, and the rest of the train behind it remains consistent until the train crashes (see “Off the Spectral Rails” later in the chapter). Additionally, vestibule doors already passed through can be traveled through as normal, with no need to gather in the swirling mist.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\">To determine the next car that the characters enter, roll on the Random Car table. Once a car is visited, reroll if its number is rolled when the characters visit subsequent cars.</span></p><p class=\"p22\"><span class=\"s14\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.n17REsHJpkanK7iV]{Random Car}</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p5\">The Random Car table doesn’t include the Passenger Car (area G1), which is always at the back, and the Tender (area G8), which is always at the front and can only be accessed once all six of the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aEPVMByT2COU30KF]{Wayward Haints}</strong><span class=\"s12\">*</span> have been saved or destroyed.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\"><em><strong>Level Up.</strong></em> The characters reach 2nd level, if they are still at 1st level, after they save or destroy three wayward haints.</span></p></div>"

He is happy to spare a moment to answer any questions the characters may have (see “The Vagrant” section earlier in this chapter) and offers the following:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">He warns the characters of the presence of haints within some of the train cars, admitting that—while he wishes he could do more to help them on their way—he doesn’t mind their presence.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">He tells the characters not to open exterior doors or windows, which keep out dangerous spiritual mist.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">He suggests they might enjoy the company of two more lively travelers on board: Phillip and Adela Druskenvald.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s11\">He then excuses himself to his cab in the Ghostlight Locomotive, which is attached to the Tender (area G8).

The jar can be used to trap a haint (see the Bottle Trap trait in the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aEPVMByT2COU30KF]{Wayward Haint}</strong></span><span class=\"s12\">*</span><span class=\"s11\"> stat block).

If any character tries to leave the Passenger Car or attempts to closely inspect or attack the Phantom Trainhopper, or if the conversation dies down, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>One passenger among the blankly staring spirits stirs.

He simply and calmly explains the situation and asks for their assistance. Despite his voice coming from the train car itself, he converses with characters from his cab in the locomotive. Use the information below to guide the conversation with the Vagrant:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">The shadowy stowaway they just fought let the misty Shroud into the train, which corrupts spirits.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">There are six haints aboard who are more prone to corruption, which is dangerous, as they are the base source of the ghost train’s fuel.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s11\">The haints must be released from the train before they can be corrupted, either by resolving the unfinished business from life that fetters them or by destroying them if necessary (see “Unfettering a Haint” above).</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Once the haints are released one way or the other, the characters should check the Tender (area G8) for any corruption, as it contains the train’s fuel stores.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The Vagrant must stay in his cab to keep any lingering Shroud mist from the locomotive.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The Vagrant asks the characters not to alarm Phillip and Adela Druskenvald if they run into them. “Ain’t no call to rile up the Lord and Lady over a scuffle.”</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">With one final crackle, the Vagrant’s voice fades from the Passenger Car, and the characters can’t interact with him again until later (see “Off the Spectral Rails” later in the chapter). The characters can begin their journey through the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\"><em><strong>Lingering Curse.</strong></em> After the battle, characters who succeed on a [[/check PRC DC 13]] check notice wisps of ghastly blue-green mist shot through with black root-like veins lingering in the air—remnants of the clouds that billowed in. The mist slowly snakes forward and slinks under the forward vestibule door. It can’t be dispersed or affected in any way, and they lose sight of it once it slips away. This is the lingering curse of the Phantom Trainhopper that aims to reach the Tender (see area G8) to corrupt the fuel of the Ghostlight Locomotive.</span></p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/10-1_Passenger_Car.webp\" /></div>"

She is welcoming to the group and eager to trade stories and talents. The love between Phillip and Adela is evident from the start, as they frequently turn to one another to share observations, mostly positive, about the characters’ comments and questions.</p><p class=\"p7\">When asked where they’re headed, they tell the characters about their fabulous manor home called Chateau Clair de Lune (see chapter 1). It’s clear that they prefer more “civilized” living and tend to visit cities and other more metropolitan areas.</p><p class=\"p7\">Phillip is slightly less sociable than Adela, but this says very little, and he is quite pleasant with the characters. He’ll offer to get characters any beverage they enjoy and is initially forthcoming with details about himself. If he senses that the characters are prying, rude, or deceptive, he buttons up and stops sharing.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s13\">If the characters mention the Phantom Trainhopper, Phillip and Adela are unconcerned and have full trust in the Vagrant to handle any complications that may have arisen.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Tarot Reading.</strong></em> Adela Druskenvald is a clairvoyant with a passion for the occult. She sees the chance meeting as an opportunity to help her new friends see their future with a tarot reading. She is eager to show off her talents with any willing soul. It is challenging to dissuade her, even if it means only doing a single reading. Adela’s preferred reading consists of pulling a single card from the Major Arcana for each character.</p><p class=\"p7\">To perform a full reading that determines the powerful artifacts and boons to be discovered in <em>The Crooked Moon </em>adventure, see “Fated Tarot Reading” in chapter 9. Otherwise, roll on the Tarot Reading table below for each character who Adela performs a reading for to determine which card is pulled for them (each in the upright position), rerolling any number already rolled.

The painting is vividly lifelike, to the point that the waves seem to roll when one isn’t looking directly at the work. This painting is easily removed from the wall and can be used to free the Mariner haint in the Mail Car (area G5).</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Characters who examine the Lounge Car make a [[/check PRC DC 13]] or [[/check INV DC 13]] check for every 1 minute they search, finding an empty whiskey bottle behind the bar on a success.

Her tastes are jazzy and romantic, and she wishes she could give one last soulful performance.</p><p class=\"p7\">Bringing her the phonograph found in the Sleeper Car (area G2) and turning it on inspires her to sing the perfect final song.

              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap10 bottom-page\"><p class=\"h2\">The End of the Line</p><p>The characters find themselves in the middle of a forest. The woods are a dark and gloomy environment, with the following features:</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Woods.</strong> Old and gnarled oak trees rise from the forest floor, standing 60 to 80 feet from the ground.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Lighting.</strong> In the clear sky above, shining down through the canopy, an unmoving crescent moon glares down with a wicked grin, a shock for characters first visiting Druskenvald. The Crooked Moon (see “Night of the Crooked Moon” in chapter 1) sheds dim light throughout the area.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>The Wreckage</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The wreckage is immediately apparent, and the train cars are in disarray, scattered like dropped playing cards all throughout the trees. Deep parallel grooves can be plainly seen cutting through the soft earth, suggesting the turbulent path through the trees taken by the Ghostlight Locomotive.</p><p class=\"p7\">The engine itself finally came to rest at the edge of a small clearing within the forest. Upon approach, it becomes obvious that after the crash, twisted roots have perplexingly snaked and snarled their way through its train wheels, locking them into place.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Back on Track</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The calm, genial demeanor of the Vagrant has been replaced with rising panic. Though he is clearly doing his best to keep his wits about him on behalf of those he is charged to guide safely, this is clearly not a situation the Vagrant has had to deal with often. He knows that only a powerful malevolent force could interfere with the Ghostlight Locomotive’s transit.</p><p class=\"p7\">When everyone is outside and the Vagrant has had a moment to survey the damage, he beseeches the characters for their assistance. He does not engage Phillip immediately out of respect. The Vagrant explains his three goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">If the locomotive can be freed from the roots that are entangling its wheels, it would be able to reassemble the full <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, train cars and all.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The furnace is no longer burning. To revive the train, it needs fuel, and only the souls of the dead will suffice.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Find any trace of the Phantom Trainhopper’s sabotage, which has gone farther than originally anticipated.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Soul Cans. T</strong></em>he Vagrant carries three Soul Cans that had scattered nearby. These had been stored in his engineer's cab in case of emergencies, each one containing a single soul. However, three more Soul Cans are missing and flew much farther. He surmises he will need all six to get the Ghostlight Locomotive up and running again and asks the characters to help find them while he tinkers on the control panel. If the characters have any bottles that contain a haint (see “Haints” above), they can be used as Soul Cans.</p><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><p><span class=\"s9\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>What if the characters refuse to help or leave?</strong></span></span></p><p class=\"p29\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">If the characters refuse to even attempt to find the spectral fuel, Phillip and Adela will seek them out instead. If the characters decide to abandon the train, Phillip, Adela, and the Vagrant opt to stay behind. The characters will then be confronted by the freed Ghostlight Locomotive after 15 minutes of overland travel, forcing them to confront the monstrous Construct. Should they survive, the Vagrant and the Druskenvalds soon find them, confused and displeased.</span></p></aside><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:6px;bottom:6px;left:6px;right:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p></p><p></p></div><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>A Chance for Valor!</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Phillip and Adela were unscathed by the crash and join the characters. Once Phillip understands the nature of the problem, he springs into action. Raising his elegant cane, he first attempts to magically free the Ghostlight Locomotive from the ensnaring roots. He fails, exclaiming “Maybe that little tumble temporarily knocked out my lordly powers! No worries, I’ll roll up my sleeves and help however I can!” A successful [[/check INS DC 13]] check reveals that he is telling the truth. All attempts by Phillip, the Vagrant, or the characters to unloose the train from these roots also fail.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_GHOST_A_chance_for_valor_Finished.webp\" /></div>"

Characters who search the nearby area make a [[/check PRC DC 10]] check for every 10 minutes of exploration, finding an ejected Soul Can on a success. No matter what the characters do, they find no trace of the Phantom Trainhopper. This brief calm before the storm is an ideal opportunity for the characters to take a Short Rest.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Ghostlight Wreckage</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">If the characters spend time searching for fuel, when they return, they find the Vagrant inspecting the dulled firebox and preparing to get it roaring ablaze once more. The locomotive’s wheels are motionless, and its ghostly lamps flicker with a dim blue-green glow. Huge, gnarled roots are still taut around its black metal frame.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Lighting.</strong> The clearing is illuminated by the waning Crooked Moon in the sky, which somehow seems closer and now sheds bright light.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Terrain.</strong> The ground is soft and mossy. Oak trees and boulders surround the wide clearing, providing cover if the characters hide there.</p><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s11\">Once the collected Soul Cans are given to the Vagrant, he attempts to feed the firebox with the souls it needs to get the locomotive running again. However, a complication arises. Once the Vagrant empties three Soul Cans into the firebox, the Ghostlight Locomotive suddenly roars with ghastly power and breaks free, sending the remaining three Soul Cans flying. Roll initiative! Use map 10.9 for this combat.</span></p></div>"

A once-vibrant forest has fallen to a virulent blight that consumes trees, animals, and people alike—threatening to seed all life with rapidly spreading decay. Deep in the heart of the dying woodland, the Beast of Blight nurtures this rot, delivering death laced with the promise of rebirth. Those willing to endure the poisonous reaches of Hartsblight Forest must unearth and purge the source of the blight to put a stop to the spreading menace before it turns all to rot.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Hartsblight Forest was once a lush and verdant woodland at the edge of Wickermoor Hollow known as the Greenwood, home to a community of antlered, deerlike satyrs that cared for its flora and fauna. Now, it is a rotten place putrefied by Hartsblight, a fungal infection that brings decay to all living things.</p><p class=\"p7\">The first to surrender to the corruption of the blight was a young satyr named Farryn of the Greenwood, who followed the call of a dead primeval god to the origin of Hartsblight. Driven by the desperation of love, loss, and the hope for rebirth, she embraced the rot and forever changed into a monstrous embodiment of decay.</p><p class=\"p7\">Discarding the remaining shreds of who she once was, Farryn took the name of Gorthos, the Beast of Blight. This newly formed abomination spread rot through the forest, turning its plants, animals, and peoples to putrefaction. Now, Gorthos turns her attention to the lands beyond Hartsblight Forest, seeking to impart the blight upon all of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Infectious fungal spores drift from the tree line of Hartsblight Forest, rapidly spreading through Wickermoor Hollow. The only way to put an end to the advancing disease is to seek out and purge the source of the Hartsblight. Characters drawn to Hartsblight Forest by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have the following goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Follow the trail of fungal spores to Hartsblight Forest.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Find the source of the disease.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Gorthos, the Beast of Blight.</p></li></ul><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_ADV_HARTSBLIGHTFOREST_Gorthos.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the motives and history of Gorthos, the Beast of Blight, so that encounters between her and the characters are filled with tension. Understand the features of Hartsblight Forest and the effects of the blight to properly convey the oppressive nature of the diseased forest. Finally, a review of the climactic encounter, “Reign of Decay,” will ensure an intense and cathartic conclusion.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 8 characters.</p>",

A once-vibrant forest has fallen to a virulent blight that consumes trees, animals, and people alike—threatening to seed all life with rapidly spreading decay. Deep in the heart of the dying woodland, the Beast of Blight nurtures this rot, delivering death laced with the promise of rebirth. Those willing to endure the poisonous reaches of Hartsblight Forest must unearth and purge the source of the blight to put a stop to the spreading menace before it turns all to rot.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Hartsblight Forest was once a lush and verdant woodland at the edge of Wickermoor Hollow known as the Greenwood, home to a community of antlered, deerlike satyrs that cared for its flora and fauna. Now, it is a rotten place putrefied by Hartsblight, a fungal infection that brings decay to all living things.</p><p class=\"p7\">The first to surrender to the corruption of the blight was a young satyr named Farryn of the Greenwood, who followed the call of a dead primeval god to the origin of Hartsblight. Driven by the desperation of love, loss, and the hope for rebirth, she embraced the rot and forever changed into a monstrous embodiment of decay.</p><p class=\"p7\">Discarding the remaining shreds of who she once was, Farryn took the name of Gorthos, the Beast of Blight. This newly formed abomination spread rot through the forest, turning its plants, animals, and peoples to putrefaction. Now, Gorthos turns her attention to the lands beyond Hartsblight Forest, seeking to impart the blight upon all of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Infectious fungal spores drift from the tree line of Hartsblight Forest, rapidly spreading through Wickermoor Hollow. The only way to put an end to the advancing disease is to seek out and purge the source of the Hartsblight. Characters drawn to Hartsblight Forest by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have the following goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Follow the trail of fungal spores to Hartsblight Forest.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Find the source of the disease.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Gorthos, the Beast of Blight.</p></li></ul><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_ADV_HARTSBLIGHTFOREST_Gorthos.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the motives and history of Gorthos, the Beast of Blight, so that encounters between her and the characters are filled with tension. Understand the features of Hartsblight Forest and the effects of the blight to properly convey the oppressive nature of the diseased forest. Finally, a review of the climactic encounter, “Reign of Decay,” will ensure an intense and cathartic conclusion.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 8 characters.</p></div>"

              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap18\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Beast of Blight</p><p><span class=\"s7\">Gorthos was once a satyr devoted to the mystic rhythms of nature. As the Beast of Blight, she now spreads Hartsblight throughout Wickermoor Hollow. She believes that through death, decay, and the “Emerald Rebirth”—her distant dream where the world returns in its pure, green state—she can bring back her lost love, Gwenna. As the beast wallows in heartache in her den, decay creeps forth with the assistance of her zealous minions, every strained and sickly breath burdened by longing and the slow, relentless promise of entropy.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Farryn of the Greenwood</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Gorthos_and_Farryn.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Farryn was raised to follow the Old Ways. In the deep recesses of the Greenwood, her people—a circle of antlered satyr druids—revered the endless cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Knowing she would return to nature’s fold in time, Farryn was a devout student, tending to the old and new growth of the woods with boundless joy. She lived by the natural laws, her spirit bright and strong, and joined her kin in sacred songs and worship of the wild.</p><p class=\"p7\">The druids of the Greenwood believed that personal attachment was unnatural and would only lead tenders of the wild astray in their devotion to the endless cycle. Farryn shared this belief until she met a young human woman named Gwenna, who had traveled into the forest from Wickermoor Village. A worshiper of the Patient Lady, Gwenna held an innocent idealism that Farryn found infectious, believing that nature’s harmony could bring an end to the wicked witchcraft that hung over the neighboring Wytchwood.</p><p class=\"p7\">Although Farryn did not believe such a thing was possible, she offered Gwenna her help in exploring the Greenwood. The pair wove through the trees near the border of the Wytchwood, sharing stories, secrets, and a love that quickly blossomed. Farryn kept her new beloved hidden from her community, knowing that the druids would brand her as an oath breaker. But it mattered not; the young satyr had found a purpose more precious and beautiful than even the natural world.</p><p class=\"p7\">It was not long until Gwenna would pay for her naïve idealism. Less than a year after their first meeting, Farryn found her love on the forest floor, half eaten by a ravenous wolf monstrosity twisted by the malign power of the Crooked Queen. The druid drove off the beast, but it was too late. Gwenna had fed the creatures of the wood and would return to the earth, as decreed by the natural cycle. However, Farryn refused to accept Gwenna’s fate, overwhelmed with the agony of loss. In this moment of defiance and rejection of the natural cycle, she heard the call of Gorthos.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Gorthos, the Dead God</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">The voice of an ancient Fey god reached Farryn, calling her deep into the forgotten heart of the Greenwood with ragged, sickly whispers and the strained bleats of dying deer. She followed, carrying Gwenna’s body to a hidden cave overgrown with fungus. Within was the enormous corpse of an ancient stag. These putrid remains would not return to the earth, instead enduring decay without end.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">This colossal heap of rotting flesh, fur, and bone was all that remained of Gorthos—a dead Fey god of decay from the forgotten age of the Green Queen. He told Farryn of the lost eons, when Kehlenn was pure and untwisted. A time when her realm was green with renewal. Gorthos was captive in his den, just as the Crooked Queen was captive to her misguided desire for vengeance and unnatural, crooked corruption. But an Emerald Rebirth, he knew, could restore him and the queen as they were before. Gwenna would also be restored, and she and Farryn could spend an eternity together in a vibrant world of green.</p><p class=\"p7\">Farryn shared the dead god’s dream and understood what she must do. Over many weeks, she ate his rotting flesh, taking in his knowledge, his power, his purpose, and his name. As she feasted, she rotted, changed, and grew. Each bite of Gorthos’s decaying flesh was added to her own form until the stag was no more, and she had become a huge, putrid abomination.</p><p class=\"p7\">Farryn then carried Gwenna’s deeply decayed body to the Greenwood’s sacred wellspring that nourished all living things in the forest. She laid Gwenna in the waters, a final offering to the god she had consumed—the god she had become. As Gwenna’s body submerged, the pool spoiled, spewing forth an explosive bloom of spores that would seed all life in the wood with Hartsblight.</p><p class=\"p7\">As the rot spread, she retreated to her putrid den and became one with the blight, filled with bitter hope that the death and decay of all things, even the Crooked Queen herself, would restart the natural cycle in an Emerald Rebirth. Then and only then might she see Gwenna again.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Parley with the Beast</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Gorthos is bound to her den deep within Hartsblight Forest but can speak through creatures that have succumbed to the blight, her voice raspy and thin. She views the characters as potential new hosts of the Hartsblight that can leave the confines of the wood and spread the decay across Druskenvald. She shares her vision of the Emerald Rebirth with emotionless certainty, seeking the characters’ acceptance of the blight without threats or aggression. However, Gorthos is prepared to kill the characters and remake them in her image should they ultimately refuse.</p><p class=\"p7\">Throughout this chapter, there are multiple opportunities for the characters to parley with Gorthos through a dying creature—a rotting stag carcass (area F1), the slain Halden Wreath (area F4), and a blighted gloomwood (area F8). Additionally, Gorthos can project her image to any point in the forest and can approach the characters when they attempt to rest within Hartsblight Forest (see “The Shadowing Beast” later in this chapter).</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Druids of Rot</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The deerlike satyrs that once followed the Old Ways in the Greenwood now zealously worship Gorthos, serving as her chief agents in spreading her rot. These druids have been spared the slow and agonizing death and decay of the Hartsblight in exchange for the power to wield it and weave it through the woodland. They perform primeval rituals from eons past to quicken the spread of the sickness and deepen its effect, all united in the pursuit of the Emerald Rebirth.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">The Hartsblight</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Hartsblight is a rotting fungal disease that decays the body of any plant or creature it infects, spread by the will of Gorthos and her minions. It can also distort the minds of the infected, allowing the Beast of Blight to deliver vivid hallucinations that blur the line between what’s real and imagined.</p><p class=\"p7\">Exposure to the blight increases a creature’s Hartsblight level. There is no limit to the number of Hartsblight levels a creature can have, and all effects of the affliction are cumulative. A creature afflicted with Hartsblight suffers the following effects:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Consuming Rot. </strong>The creature subtracts its Hartsblight level from Constitution saving throws.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Feeble Flesh.</strong> Hartsblight reduces attack rolls by 1 for each level.</p><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s7\"><strong>Overwhelming Affliction.</strong> Each time a creature reaches a Hartsblight level of 6 or higher, its current and maximum hit points are halved (minimum of 1 hit point).</span></p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Spoiled Healing.</strong> When the creature regains hit points, it subtracts its Hartsblight level from the total (to a minimum of 0).</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Studying the Blight</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Characters who assess the Hartsblight to understand it or seek a cure can make a [[/check NAT DC 15]] or [[/check MED DC 15]] check after spending 10 minutes examining the body or corpse of any creature or a plant infected by the blight. On a success, they learn the following:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">An infected creature that finishes a Long Rest can make a [[/save CON DC 10]] saving throw, reducing its Hartsblight level by a number equal to its Constitution modifier on a successful save or half as much on a failed save (minimum of 1 for either result).</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Effects that remove the Poisoned condition, such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplProtection]{Protection from Poison}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplLesserRest]{Lesser Restoration}</em>, remove 1 Hartsblight level.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGreaterRes]{Greater Restoration}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplHeal000000]{Heal}</em>, or similarly powerful magic removes all Hartsblight levels.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Even creatures who have Immunity to the Poisoned condition or who don’t breathe are vulnerable to the spread of Hartsblight, as it seeps into flesh and bone as easily as it withers plants.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Hartsblight will continue to spread until the source of the blight is destroyed.</p></li></ul><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><h4><span class=\"s9\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Tracking Hartsblight</strong></span></span></h4><p class=\"p13\"><span class=\"s7\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">Whenever a character is affected by Hartsblight, the player should track their character’s Hartsblight level.</span></span></p></aside></div>"

When the characters arrive, there is concern that Sister Rain (see chapter 11) has not yet shown up to lead the group in the pre-meal prayer.</p><p class=\"p7\">These concerns are justified when Sister Rain (Neutral good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmPriest00000000]{Priest}</strong>) finally appears toward the end of the gathering, her face strained with deep concern. She has just returned from a visit to a commune north of Moonsong Lake that had been established by fellow members of the Fold of the Patient Lady, announcing that their crops have begun to fail and their livestock have fallen ill.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s10\">Sister Rain attempted to assist the commune, but the affliction was beyond her ability to heal. Even worse, while she was treating an ill member of the commune, she experienced a sudden vivid hallucination of sprawling forests with brilliant emerald trees, its boughs filled with countless watching faces. By the time the vision faded, she was already a full night’s travel back to Wickermoor Village.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">She asks the characters to do what they can to help the commune, as she fears the threat is beyond any of the Patient Lady’s faithful. She has no coin to offer but is willing to part with a precious bottle of <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.8BaL6y9oKIT7HunI]{Harvest Brew}</em><span class=\"s11\">*</span> for each character who answers her plea, which she hands over before they begin their journey. If the characters accept, she gives them directions to the commune and urges their swift departure.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Sporefall</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s12\">The following night, if the characters refused Sister Rain or linger in town, a strange phenomenon comes to Wickermoor Village. A light flurry of what initially appears to be snow begins to fall, but soon the town is coated in fine, powdery spores. This spore cloud persists for 8 hours, and any creature exposed to the spores for more than 10 minutes at a time must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw or gain 1 Hartsblight level.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Sickness spreads quickly to people, plants, and animals alike, and fear rises as yet another disease afflicts Wickermoor Village with the threat of famine. To prevent panic, Mayor Wendel Somerton offers the characters [[/award 300gp]] each if they help put an end to the blight as he prepares to lead rituals of the Old Ways (see chapter 11) to help combat the spreading disease.</p></div>"

The entire settlement is covered in a layer of spores, and decayed corpses are scattered across the commune.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\"><em><strong>Spore Layer.</strong></em> The commune is coated in spores of Hartsblight.

Dead chickens, ducks, goats, cows, and horses litter the livestock pen.

The keepers wave their arms in rhythmic motions as the rotweavers pound their drums and blow their horns.</p><p class=\"p7\">Rotting corpses and blighted plants tremble and burst apart as primal magic surges through them, advancing their decay and casting a huge cloud of spores into the air in a 200-foot-radius sphere centered on the commune.

The trees here have been entirely consumed by rot, the low fungal canopy forms a cavern-like space overwhelmed with large green spores, and the heart of the forest looks like an alien landscape.</span></p><p class=\"p5\">The characters must pass through the areas of all three stands to confront the Beast of Blight and put an end to the Hartsblight.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Fleeing the Forest</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters wish to leave Hartsblight Forest before the Beast of Blight is destroyed, they must pass through the forest’s locations in the reverse order that they encountered them, finally exiting the woodland after passing through the Altar of Rot (area F1).</p><p class=\"p7\">Once Gorthos is defeated and her control over the Hartsblight is eliminated, the characters can leave the forest without incident following a three-night trek.</p></div>"

Unless otherwise stated, the areas of Hartsblight Forest have the following general features:</span></p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Choking Spores.</strong> Spores of Hartsblight float through the air and seep into every surface and creature within the forest. Creatures that travel through the woods must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 10]] saving throw or gain 1 Hartsblight level every time they travel from one area to another. Tying cloth or some other barrier around a creature's face grants Advantage on the save.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Emerald Visions.</strong> The Hartsblight has hallucinatory properties and can be used by Gorthos to share visions. Each time a character gains Hartsblight levels, they can receive a vision at your discretion. These hallucinations might showcase the Emerald Rebirth or provide details of the Beast of Blight’s story (see “The Beast of Blight” earlier in this chapter).</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Lurking Beast.</strong> The projected image of Gorthos stalks the characters relentlessly, drawing near but always staying just out of view. When a creature fails a Wisdom (Perception) check, they see the subtle movement of a huge mass between the trees. It might be a glimpse of cracked antler, rotten flesh, blackened bone, or patchy fur.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Navigation.</strong> Moving from one area to the next takes [[/r 1d4]] hours of trekking through rough and fungus-choked terrain.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Rotting Undergrowth.</strong> The forest floor is overgrown with decomposing underbrush. The entire forest floor is Difficult Terrain and creatures can travel no faster than a Slow pace.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Spoiled Provisions.</strong> All forms of food and water not stored within an extradimensional space spoil within minutes. A creature that consumes rotten food or contaminated water within Hartsblight Forest gains 1 Hartsblight level. Creatures that forego eating and drinking risk dehydration and malnutrition.</p></div>"

This natural resting spot is shaded by a broad beech tree at its center, its branches covered in patches of greenish-white mold.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p16\"><em><strong>Slumped against the tree is the partially eaten corpse of a man. Shelf-like fungus grows over half of his shredded face and along what remains of his moldy chest. Carved into the tree above the corpse is a crude, jagged shape that resembles a skeletal stag.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">The corpse is that of Halden Wreath, a man who went missing from Wickermoor Village some time ago. Obsessed with tales of archfey, he ventured into Hartsblight Forest seeking the fabled Tall Man (see chapter 26), who had once danced through the Greenwood before it fell to blight. He met his end to a pair of rotting owlbears (see “Shrieking Death” earlier in this chapter) in an unwitting sacrifice to Gorthos.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Shrine to Gorthos.</strong></em> The tree has been marked by druids of the blight as a sacred site to Gorthos. It strengthens the Hartsblight that infects those suffering here and bends magic itself. Using magic to remove Hartsblight from its victims does the opposite: the target of the magic instead gains 1 Hartsblight level.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>The Corpse.</strong></em> A character who examines the corpse and succeeds on a [[/check NAT DC 15]] or [[/check MED DC 15]] check determines that the man was killed by large claws and beaks. The fungal growth that covers him seems far too advanced for how long the body has been dead. Shortly after a character investigates the corpse of Halden Wreath, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Suddenly, the fungus-covered corpse shudders as a crack rings out from the tree it is slumped against. His body is instantly covered in vibrant mold that blooms over his arms, neck, and chest as his torso is wrenched free from his lower half with a sickening pop and rises up the tree. His arms dangle limply, and his moldy lower jaw hangs open, unmoving. Yet, you hear a familiar raspy feminine voice speak from the corpse. “Do you not see the beauty in the decay?”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Parley with the Beast.</strong></em> Gorthos speaks with the characters once more. She uses this opportunity to position herself as a force against the Crooked Queen in the hopes that the characters will understand their inevitable deaths and rebirth. She is uncaring toward the death of Halden and does not respond to threats.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What do you want?</strong> “The land is poisoned with vengeance and trapped in unending death. Only an Emerald Rebirth can put an end to this misery.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What does the ‘Emerald Rebirth’ mean? </strong>“It is the natural conclusion. This realm shall rise anew in emerald light, but only when all has returned to the earth. It is the only way to prevent Kehlenn’s crooked rebirth.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What will you do after this ‘Emerald Rebirth’?</strong> “Live anew, reborn and beautiful with my dear Gwenna. We shall all live and flourish in the green together, and we will know peace.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>The blight shows us visions—what are they?</strong> “The blight gives us green dreams with those it readies for rebirth. The green awaits us all, and the visions show us what has been, what is, and what’s to come.”</p><p class=\"p5\">When the will of Gorthos departs, the severed torso of Halden comes free from the tree, hitting the ground with a sickening splat.</p></div>"

However, concluding the adventure following the events at the Crooked Tree provides for the most thematic experience that stays true to the spirit of folk horror. This epilogue is written with this in mind.</p><h2>What's Become of Wickermoor?</h2><p>After the defeat of the Horned King and the Crooked Queen, the characters leave the Wytchwood to find Wickermoor Hollow forever changed by their time in the valley. Although its people have grown accustomed to difficult lives filled with hardship and horror, the events in the recent weeks have deeply shaken even the hollow’s hardiest folk.</p><p>Of all the places in the valley, Wickermoor Village has suffered the most since the characters first arrived from beyond the Shroud. Following the chaos unleashed by the minions of the Crooked Queen, some people search for a scapegoat to blame and exact vengeance upon, while others hope to leverage the instability to gain power. Most of the townsfolk, however, simply want to get their old lives back and return to some form of normalcy.</p><p>How the specific NPCs have been affected is largely dependent on the connections and choices that the characters made and how you chose to incorporate them throughout the adventure, especially during the burning of the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise.</p><p>As the characters spend time in Wickermoor Village to wrap up their unfinished business, make sure to tie up plot lines and provide closure with the surviving NPCs that became important to the characters. The people of the various ideologies and groups of the village respond to the recent horrors in the following ways.</p><h3><strong>Followers of the Old Ways</strong></h3><p>With the cult of the Crooked Queen exposed and almost entirely wiped out, the followers of the Old Ways who revered the Green Queen and never fell to wickedness become more entrenched in their superstitions and beliefs, blaming the corruption of their kin on the influence of new and profane ideals brought to the valley over the years. They become more distrustful of nonbelievers and anyone outside of their community, even going so far as to drive off members of the other groups. Wickermoor Hollow and its settlements retreat into the comfort of the old ideals.</p><h3><strong>Fold of the Patient Lady</strong></h3><p>Many adherents of the Patient Lady see the apocalyptic inevitability of magic and strange supernatural power and conclude that they must escape this doom, trusting that the wilds will provide for them. They chase off their own members who have magical abilities, leave the settlements of Wickermoor Hollow, and relocate to the natural world they view as a paradise, even if they do not have the survival skills to withstand the harsh conditions that await them.</p><h3><strong>The Brightsingers</strong></h3><p>Unlike the Fold of the Patient Lady, the Brightsingers do not lose hope in their community, seeing the recent disasters as proof that the bizarre superstitions and grim rituals of the valley are heretical acts that nearly brought about the doom of Druskenvald. Energized with a zealous desire to convert the folk who hold outdated beliefs to their newer religion filled with light, love, and truth, they call more missionaries to the valley and begin to aggressively spread their faith.</p><h3><strong>The Newcomers</strong></h3><p>The death of Phillip Druskenvald represents the crumbling of everything he stood for. All his vision, forward thinking, progress, and enlightenment could not save him from the hate of the old things. The newcomers in the valley see that there is little left for them, and what little hope they had was foolishness. Most of these folk will leave Wickermoor Hollow behind and seek civilizations that share their ideals, perhaps even seeking passage aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> to discover new horizons beyond Druskenvald.</p><h2>Foxwillow</h2><p>While the once cheery and hardworking folk of Foxwillow had shared deep fellowship, the time spent trapped within the Fields of the Crow took a toll. The secrets unearthed and bared to all planted seeds of doubt, distrust, and shame amidst the efforts to rebuild. The Patient Lady is abandoned by the people, and strife slowly seeps back into the town. However, just when things look bleakest, a one-legged stranger from beyond the valley arrives to unite the community around a god of the four winds, and the fellowship of Foxwillow is restored once more, led by the vision of the man known only as Virgil.</p><h2>Dawn’s Gate</h2><p>If the fiendish identity of the Crimson Rose was not publicly revealed by the characters, the power vacuum and subsequent battles for control inevitably expose the truth of Viraxys, and the religion is abandoned after a violent falling-out. The former faithful and the townsfolk of Dawn’s Gate come together in their bitterness toward the faith that manipulated and terrorized them for so long. Worship of any kind is outlawed, and parties of riders regularly patrol to bring justice and vengeance to any missionaries or evangelists.</p><h2>Murkwater Bend</h2><p>With the threat of the shambling dead brought to an end, the people of Murkwater Bend were able to go back to their lives in peace, until the swamp trees of the Drowned Crossroads began blooming Snake Eye Magnolias, a flower with tremendous and versatile properties that are useful for healing, pleasure, spellcasting, and more. An enormous boom of prosperity comes to Murkwater Bend, and Vander Boone even contacts the Crescent Court with promises of their wildest dreams, including bringing their unruly folk to heel and a proposal to legitimize Wickermoor Hollow as an officially recognized province.</p></div>"

They may want to go home and put the horror of Druskenvald behind them, they might want to discover what awaits in the other provinces of the land of eternal night, or they could seek new horizons in other strange worlds within the Shroud. The possibilities are endless, but what matters is that their part in this story is over.</p><h2>There’s an Old Black Train A-Comin’</h2><p>During the Midnight Hour, when the characters are ready to depart Wickermoor Hollow, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The darkness of the Midnight Hour surrounds you as a heavy fog shrouds the valley in an eerie gloom. A faint, distant music sails through the air—a single fiddle. Then a shrill whistle that sounds of wailing souls pierces the quiet of night, heralding the rumbling, chugging, and scraping of a locomotive. A single circle of ghastly blue-green light grows larger in the fog as the engine of the Ghostlight Express thunders out of the gloom on rails of mist. It slows before screeching to a halt in front of you.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The darkened windows of the passenger car flank the single side door that opens with a creak. Out hops the Vagrant, a sprig of wheat in the corner of his mouth and his trusty fiddle in the back pocket of his patchy trousers. His sly smile is followed by a knowing wink. “Y’all didn’t think I forgot about ya, did ya? All aboard!”</strong></em></p></blockquote><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_EPILOGUE_Woodcut.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>The characters once again realize that they each have a one-way ticket for the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, but this time it says, “Destination: Unknown.” The Vagrant casually apologizes for how long it took him to fix up the locomotive, claiming that he ran into some complications that he will not elaborate on. He tells them that he owes them a ride and asks where they’re headed.</p><p>If Phillip and Adela are mentioned, he briefly removes his hat for a moment of silence before stating that he’s sorry to have heard what happened to them, but he shrugs and claims that death comes for everyone, even the deathless. He shares rumors that the power vacuum in the Crescent Court has led to a power struggle among the lords and ladies of the court, intensified by the recent increase of wicked activity from the Coven of the Midnight Moon.</p><p>When the characters give the Vagrant their tickets and tell him where they’d like to go, he agrees and welcomes them aboard the passenger car, which has no spectral passengers this trip. As the characters get settled, the frogman hops off to his cab to prepare to move on.</p><p>When the time has come to conclude the session, the adventure, and the campaign, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Following a single burst of the locomotive’s ghastly whistle, the Ghostlight Express lurches forward into the fog. Through the windows of the passenger car, you take one last glimpse of Wickermoor Hollow and see the Crooked Moon above, sneering down at the land below. It almost feels as if its hateful gaze is upon you specifically as it slowly disappears and all that can be seen is fog rushing by.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>You all sit together and consider the horror, heartbreak, and heroism that you have experienced on this journey when the voice of the Vagrant crackles through the passenger car.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>“We’re on our way, friends!

From the flames, she speaks. Her voice rings out, like the bell of our great cathedral, with truth, love, and beauty that only the divine can know. Cast by the flames, her shadow spreads and dances, as does her holy word. Under her shadow, we are but weeds in the garden of paradise. But through the flames, our ashes may sprout a brilliant, blood-red rose.\"</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\"><em><strong>- Father Renathyr, the Crimson Abbot -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p4\">Within the stone walls of the Crimson Monastery lies a beating and repulsive heart. Led by one of the Fallen, the blood-stained fallen knight Marius Renathyr <em>(MAIR-ee-iss REN-uh-theer)</em>, the zealous and self-righteous adherents of the Crimson Faith swarm across Wickermoor Hollow, claiming all outside their faith to be impure, and that only conversion to the worship of their esoteric goddess, the Crimson Rose, will set them on the path to purity. Those who do not convert are kidnapped and burned at the stake, and those who resist are slaughtered.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Crimson Monastery looms high above Wickermoor Hollow in the mountain range called the Howlers, leering down at the town of Dawn’s Gate, which now trembles whenever the charging riders and baying bat hounds of the Sanguine Hunt thunder down the mountainside in search of fresh blood to spill. Any infraction against Father Renathyr’s obsessive code of virtue and purification makes that person a target. The people of Dawn’s Gate yearn for freedom from fear.</p><p class=\"p7\">At the center of this twisted faith lies Viraxys <em>(vih-RAK-seez)</em>, a devil who calls herself the Crimson Rose. Renathyr, once a noble knight, was tainted by her, turning his piety into relentless zealotry. Should her corruption be exposed, the Crimson Faith would crumble into chaos.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Father Renathyr must die! Or so believe the people of Dawn’s Gate, who suffer most at the hands of his zealots. Characters who are drawn to the monastery by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Discover the whereabouts of Gareth Creed.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">Discover the truth of Viraxys, the Crimson Rose.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Slay Father Renathyr, the Crimson Abbot.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">Disband the Crimson Faithful.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">While investigating the order, characters may avoid combat through deception or stealth. However, the confrontation with Renathyr and the corrupting devil Viraxys inevitably ends in battle.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\">Before running this chapter, you should read about the NPCs of the monastery. Because the characters will be watched, knowing the clergy's methods of investigation and reactions to what they observe—whether the characters are hostile, deceptive, understanding, or stealthy—makes running the monastery more organic. Further, combing through the room descriptions of the Crimson Monastery will help you build tension and dread for your players, better equipping you to react to what the characters choose to do.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Finally, reading through the boss encounter “Bloody Tears” will help you run the final battle of this chapter in a dynamic and thrilling way.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 5 characters.</p>",

But through the flames, our ashes may sprout a brilliant, blood-red rose.\"</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>- Father Renathyr, the Crimson Abbot -</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Within the stone walls of the Crimson Monastery lies a beating and repulsive heart. Led by one of the Fallen, the blood-stained fallen knight Marius Renathyr <em>(MAIR-ee-iss REN-uh-theer)</em>, the zealous and self-righteous adherents of the Crimson Faith swarm across Wickermoor Hollow, claiming all outside their faith to be impure, and that only conversion to the worship of their esoteric goddess, the Crimson Rose, will set them on the path to purity. Those who do not convert are kidnapped and burned at the stake, and those who resist are slaughtered.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>The Crimson Monastery looms high above Wickermoor Hollow in the mountain range called the Howlers, leering down at the town of Dawn’s Gate, which now trembles whenever the charging riders and baying bat hounds of the Sanguine Hunt thunder down the mountainside in search of fresh blood to spill. Any infraction against Father Renathyr’s obsessive code of virtue and purification makes that person a target. The people of Dawn’s Gate yearn for freedom from fear.</p><p>At the center of this twisted faith lies Viraxys <em>(vih-RAK-seez)</em>, a devil who calls herself the Crimson Rose. Renathyr, once a noble knight, was tainted by her, turning his piety into relentless zealotry. Should her corruption be exposed, the Crimson Faith would crumble into chaos.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Father Renathyr must die! Or so believe the people of Dawn’s Gate, who suffer most at the hands of his zealots. Characters who are drawn to the monastery by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p>Discover the whereabouts of Gareth Creed.</p></li><li><p>Discover the truth of Viraxys, the Crimson Rose.</p></li><li><p>Slay Father Renathyr, the Crimson Abbot.</p></li><li><p>Disband the Crimson Faithful.</p></li></ul><p>While investigating the order, characters may avoid combat through deception or stealth. However, the confrontation with Renathyr and the corrupting devil Viraxys inevitably ends in battle.</p><p>Before running this chapter, you should read about the NPCs of the monastery. Because the characters will be watched, knowing the clergy's methods of investigation and reactions to what they observe—whether the characters are hostile, deceptive, understanding, or stealthy—makes running the monastery more organic. Further, combing through the room descriptions of the Crimson Monastery will help you build tension and dread for your players, better equipping you to react to what the characters choose to do.</p><p>Finally, reading through the boss encounter “Bloody Tears” will help you run the final battle of this chapter in a dynamic and thrilling way.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 5th level characters.</p><p> </p></div>"

              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap14 middle-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Crimson Abbot</p><p>Father Marius Renathyr is the leader and abbot of the Crimson Monastery. His name is whispered by the villagers of Dawn’s Gate and rapturously exulted by his flock. Though he was once a human knight of unimpeachable character, Father Renathyr is now a vampire sustained by the blood of his converts. His noble zeal was twisted into fear and cruelty by the devil that saved his life and granted him his vampiric immortality.</p><p>The tragedy of Marius Renathyr is inexorably tied to that of Lethica Nightborne, another of the Fallen (see chapter 17). This is the beginning of that tale.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin-left:10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Father_Renathyr.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><h2>The Knight’s Tale</h2><p>Sir Marius Renathyr was once a knight-errant of another world. His armor gleamed gold, his banner a lionhearted red. Cast into the fallen land of Druskenvald by means unknown, his conviction toward righteousness was undeterred. He gathered knights to his side to protect the innocent from monsters and wicked men.</p><p>One such innocent was a traveling priestess named Lethica Nightborne, a devotee to a goddess of sheltering night called the Nightmother. Accosted on the road by cruel men, Marius rescued her and delivered her safely to her cloister. Love blossomed between the knight of light and the priestess of darkness, but Marius remained chaste and returned to his questing.</p><p>Marius’s return to the cloister became frequent as their love burned, yet Marius’s sacred mission took its toll. Over the years, his kindness dulled, making way for zeal and wrath. It was this wrath that attracted a devil named Viraxys, who preyed upon men with wickedness; mortals acting upon their evil impulses by inflicting sorrow corrupted their souls, making them a delicious ambrosia on which she fed. Marius had slain his fair share of her puppets over the years, but now she saw her chance to make him into a puppet himself.</p><p>Seeking to ensnare him, Viraxys set a small army of bandits against Marius, leaving him near death. Whispering falsely as a goddess, she offered immortality in exchange for his blood and his service in her quests. Marius accepted and was made immortal—a vampire. His knightly sword transformed into a blood-soaked blade, a symbol that he was now her champion. Marius returned to his wife and revealed his affliction. Though Lethica loved him, his shame blinded him to her devotion.</p><p>Bloodthirst overtook him. In a moment of lost control, he nearly fed on his wife. Though regaining his senses in time, the guilt was too great, and Marius abandoned his love, wandering until he reached the town of Dawn’s Gate. There, Viraxys led him to a small monastery, where his knightly charm and renewed zeal for the Crimson Rose corrupted the monks into followers of his false goddess. Four years passed before Lethica found him again, now as Father Renathyr, fanatical leader of the Crimson Faith. Horrified, she fled to the Isle of Mourn.</p><p>Her story continues in chapter 17, but Renathyr’s must end here. He crusades now against all the sins of the world, real or imagined, and brings terror to Dawn’s Gate and beyond.</p><h2>Parley with the Abbot</h2><p>Father Renathyr spends his waking hours searching for those who will accept the teachings of his goddess, the Crimson Rose, or destroying those who reject his faith—either with fire or by feeding. In public, he masks his true form with <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.A3q2gTNqG6fvNGrv]{Disguise Self}</em>. He meets with the faithful, leading spirited services and offering devotion to his goddess in the Sanguine Cathedral (area M12), and he offers private guidance to those who seek it atop the bell tower (area M14). As abbot, he meets with each of his key clergy and initiates to ensure the piety of Dawn’s Gate, and that the townsfolk seek out nonbelievers.</p><p>In the late hours of night, Renathyr takes his own form of communion with his goddess, feeding in secret within a private sanctum beneath the monastery (area M16). Outwardly, he may appear compassionate and wise, the exemplar of a pious leader. Inwardly, he broods with growing bitterness, driven by the unquenchable need to deliver more souls to Viraxys.</p><p>If the characters meet Renathyr and speak with him, these are his answers to some common topics:</p><p><strong>Missing Persons.</strong> “We may take in those in need of our protection or atonement for wrongdoing, but we do not keep anyone prisoner. You are more than welcome to walk our halls if you do not trust my word.” This is a lie, and a successful [[/check INS DC 17]] check reveals it as such.</p><p><strong>The Pyre.</strong> “The pyre before you will only burn the wicked—those whose souls are tainted by impure, mortal blood. Those who accept the Crimson Rose into their hearts will be purified willingly, as part of our Crimson Faith. It saddens me that there are those whose pride is so great they refuse our goddess’s gift, for they leave me only one way of purifying them.”</p><p><strong>Your Crimson Goddess.</strong> “The Crimson Rose. I am her champion. In my darkest hour, she saved me from death and whispered to me the truth: that mortal blood is impure and the source of all suffering in this sorrowful land. It must be cleansed.”</p><p><strong>Entry to the Monastery.</strong> “By all means, my children. Think of it as home. We keep neither property nor secrets in this sacred community. All that is ours is yours.”</p><h2>Duchess</h2><p>Father Renathyr believes Duchess, the blade he keeps at his side, is sentient. The sword claims to be a divine tool bestowed by the Crimson Rose upon her champion so that he may cleanse the evil of this realm. Father Renathyr mutters to it constantly, both in response and unbidden, and has become addicted to heeding its commands.</p><p>In truth, it possesses no sentience of its own and is a conduit for Viraxys. She orchestrates Father Renathyr into committing acts of depraved cruelty to feed upon the tormented souls of those slaughtered by the Sanguine Hunt and burned alive by his Crimson Faithful. While she dines well upon the souls of the innocent, Renathyr remains her crowning achievement; it is no small joy for her to make someone fall, but to make someone as devoted as Renathyr fall is ecstasy.</p></div>"

              "name": "NPCs of the Monastery",
              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap14 middle-page\"><p class=\"h1 section horned\">NPCs of the Monastery</p><p>The Crimson Monastery is filled with zealous acolytes of the Crimson Rose. Many are cowards who chose to convert to this cruel cult to avoid being slain by the inquisitors of the Sanguine Hunt, but most are well-meaning people who were brainwashed by the order’s overwhelming false love and black-and-white morality.</p><h2>The Bloodless</h2><p>The most devoted inner circle of this faith are vampires, turned by Father Renathyr personally in a ceremony of ascension called the Rite of Bloodletting. They call themselves “The Bloodless,” and their pale skin is a blessed sign that they are devoid of the impure blood that sullies mortal souls. They stalk the halls of the monastery and menace the town of Dawn’s Gate as part of Renathyr’s crusade to spread his depraved faith. All the Bloodless besides Renathyr’s priors use the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.6syYfa3idD1RDhwX]{Crimson Clergy}</strong>* stat block.</p><p>These vampire supplicants are so brainwashed that they would follow this path even if they learned the truth: that their goddess was a devil in disguise. However, the general faithful would not accept this revelation and would turn against them if it were revealed.</p><h2>Renathyr’s Priors</h2><p>Father Renathyr has elected his three closest confidants as priors of the Crimson Monastery: Houndmaster Jaeger, Friar Olaf, and Inquisitor Cromwell. In this role, they act as Renathyr’s “lieutenants,” forming the leadership of the faith and overseeing their respective duties. They are, without a doubt, the most faithful of the Bloodless, and any one of them could succeed Renathyr and keep the Crimson Faith alive if he is slain.</p><p>In return for their service, Father Renathyr has granted them a grotesque gift. Through profane rituals and blood magic, Renathyr has transformed each of his priors into <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.gIM2KVjsPra8DzZd]{Night Creatures}</strong>*. The priors are gifted with a potent disguise to keep their nature hidden from the Crimson Faithful and only shift into their true forms when “killed” (see “Houndmaster Jaeger,” “Friar Olaf,” and “Inquisitor Cromwell” below).</p><p>If the characters arrive at the monastery during a Night of Flames (see “Investigating the Village” below), the priors are in the Courtyard of the Rose (area M4) to witness the burnings. Afterward, they retreat to their individual quarters. Each prior is described in further detail below.</p><h2>Houndmaster Jaeger</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin-right:10px;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Sigmund_Jaeger.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.4jTIWt88wLHjgo5P]{Sigmund Jaeger}</strong> served Father Renathyr as a squire during Renathyr’s time as a knight, raising hunting dogs to track down men and monsters alike.</p><p>When the knight founded the Crimson Faith, Jaeger was the first Renathyr sought and the first to convert. The houndmaster had a loving family once, but—like Renathyr—he abandoned them, tempted by the promises of the Crimson Rose. He took only his hounds with him, which he turned into batlike hybrids using blood magic. Now a prior of the Crimson Monastery, Jaeger rears and trains the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.D0fw0qKqrqj5078T]{Bat Hounds}</strong>* and <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.T1xZTDCGuvMBSq8d]{Warhorses}</strong> used to track down the faithless.</p><h3><strong>Meeting Jaeger</strong></h3><p>Jaeger resides within his cabin (area M3) and trains his bat hounds near their houses (area M2a) outside the monastery walls. He treats the characters as treasured guests, so long as they show interest in the Crimson Faith. The moment they refuse the faith, he attacks, siccing his bat hounds on them.</p><p>Jaeger is a neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY]{Bandit Captain}</strong>, but when he is reduced to 0 hit points, he takes on his true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.gIM2KVjsPra8DzZd]{Night Creature}</strong>* form with full hit points.</p><h2>Friar Olaf</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin-left:10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Friar_Olaf.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>As a young monk, Friar Olaf of the Silver Bells was the leader of the monastery before Renathyr took it over and became his second convert thereafter. In its early years, the cloister was called Silverbell Monastery, for it overlooks the Silverbell River in the valley below, and it was dedicated to the Patient Lady. There, Olaf and his monks tended to the infirm and to outcasts, but he longed in his heart for glory. He demanded payment from his charges and commissioned a great silver bell for the monastery inscribed with his name so that he would be remembered forever.</p><p>Renathyr’s arrival stoked Olaf’s hunger for reverence and immortality. It was simple to urge Olaf onward from stipends of coin to sacrifices of blood.</p><h3><strong>Meeting Friar Olaf</strong></h3><p>In his role as prior, Olaf is most often found leading sermons in the Sanguine Cathedral (area M12), though he may also be in his chambers (area M8). He is feared, not beloved, by the people of the Crimson Faith, making him the perfect foil to the adored Father Renathyr. He makes a show of kindness toward the characters as potential new converts but will gladly feed on anyone who questions him if he thinks they will not be missed.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.ObIeTdpjM6AfS21x]{Olaf}</strong> is a neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{Priest}</strong>, but when he is reduced to 0 hit points, he takes on his true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.gIM2KVjsPra8DzZd]{Night Creature}</strong>* form with full hit points.</p><h2>Inquisitor Cromwell</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin-right:10px;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Leona_Cromwell.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>Leona Cromwell was once a child of Dawn’s Gate, learning her letters and numbers under the shadow of Friar Olaf. Yet, over the years, her contempt for the pompous friar festered, driving her away from the monastery. She wandered to Wickermoor Village, picking up odd jobs and eventually working as a town guard. Her fate changed course when a group of highwaymen took her captive. Marius Renathyr came to her rescue and drove the bandits to the marshes south of Moonsong Lake. Rather than flee, she used her skills with a blade to slay their leader and demanded obedience from the weakened crew.</p><p>For years, she was known as Leona the Relentless, leading raids through Wickermoor Hollow. But the guilt of her deeds gnawed at her soul. She learned that the great Sir Marius who saved her life years prior had hung up his sword, and she traveled to his Crimson Monastery to repent. Father Renathyr, a twisted reflection of the knight he once was, spoke of the Crimson Rose, offering redemption for her tarnished soul. Stricken with guilt but unwilling to let go of the power she craved as a bandit queen, Leona accepted his gift.</p><p>Now, as prioress and head inquisitor of the Crimson Monastery, she leads the Sanguine Hunt with ruthless devotion; whenever their hooves echo through Wickermoor Hollow, it is Leona’s blade that cuts the path.</p><h3><strong>Meeting Inquisitor Cromwell</strong></h3><p>Cromwell is often away from the monastery, but the first time the characters visit Dawn’s Gate, she is present for the Night of Flames in the Courtyard of the Rose (area M4). After the pyre is cleared, she spends her time in her chambers (area M9) planning her next hunt. Cromwell is suspicious of the characters, for she knows all too well how people of great strength resist the call of the Crimson Rose. She resents their resolve and tries to kill them if goaded even mildly. If Renathyr is defeated while she is absent, she may return to revive his faith later—if you wish to create subsequent adventures in this region.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.uditOe4fAaZf66gc]{Cromwell}</strong> is a neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knight}</strong>, but when she is reduced to 0 hit points, she takes on her true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.gIM2KVjsPra8DzZd]{Night Creature}</strong>* form with full hit points.</p><h2>Crimson Faithful</h2><p>Most of the Crimson Faithful are simple people who have been taken in by Renathyr and his vampiric minions’ charisma. These initiates make up a majority of the congregation in the Crimson Monastery and are simple believers without rank or station. They revere the Bloodless as leaders of the faith, holding great respect for their closeness to Father Renathyr.</p><p>They are kept from thinking too deeply about the atrocities they commit, as their blood loss causes them to drift absentmindedly through their nights. They regularly sacrifice their impure blood in phony rituals of purification. They have a friendly attitude toward any newcomers until given a reason to think differently. Unless otherwise noted, Crimson Faithful are lawful evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners}</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Losing Favor</strong></h3><p>The characters are immediately welcomed in as prospective converts. However, if they commit three actions to upset the faithful, such as those listed below, all clergy members turn indifferent toward them within the hour. Being caught committing one more infraction turns them all hostile, and they attack on sight:</p><ul><li><p>Harm or threaten a member of the clergy.</p></li><li><p>Steal from a member of the clergy.</p></li><li><p>React negatively or disagree with the clergy’s torture, teachings, or bonfires.</p></li><li><p>Attempt to remove, kidnap, or free any creature from the monastery grounds without permission from Jaeger, Olaf, Cromwell, or Father Renathyr.</p></li><li><p>Trespass anywhere in the monastery.</p></li></ul><p>Anyone seen killing a member of the faithful instantly becomes an enemy of the faith. All the Crimson Faithful who witness or hear of the killing immediately become hostile.</p><h3><strong>Regaining Favor</strong></h3><p>Characters who have frustrated the Crimson Faithful enough to turn them indifferent can make them friendly again by committing three of the following actions and succeeding on a [[/check DEC DC 13]] check:</p><ul><li><p>Respond positively to torture or corporal punishment against the faithless.</p></li><li><p>Respond positively to or agree with the teachings of the Crimson Rose.</p></li><li><p>Respond positively to or agree with the bonfire killings the clergy commit.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Atonement</strong></h3><p>If the Crimson Faithful become hostile toward the characters, there’s only one way to win back their trust: repent. Characters attacked by hostile members of the Crimson Faithful aren’t killed but are instead captured and bound in the Dead Larder (area M11). They are held for up to three nights without food before they are mounted upon a pyre at the next Night of Flames, where they must recant their wickedness or burn.</p></div>"

They traveled together to the village of Dawn’s Gate after hearing tales of the beautiful bell of Silverbell Monastery, but they found that it had changed. The villagers praised someone called the “Crimson Abbot” with strained smiles, and when a stable hand took Gareth aside to tell him a secret about the village, neither the boy nor Gareth returned.</p><p>Melina fled the village and told Murdoch, hoping that he might know someone brave enough to find Gareth and solve the mystery of the Crimson Abbot. Murdoch describes Gareth Creed as a tall, dark-haired, short-bearded man with gray eyes.</p><p>Traveling to Dawn’s Gate requires crossing the Silverbell River by either bridge or boat and following its southern side for about 3 nights until the burnt copper glow of the village’s lights are visible.

Once a shining example of hope in the shadows of Druskenvald, the village had clung to the belief that the Patient Lady might one night deliver sunlight to Wickermoor Hollow. But that hope has long withered, buried alongside the optimism of the town’s founders.</p><p>Now, the village ekes out a living through hunting, farming, and mining silver and iron from the nearby mountains. Worship of the Crimson Rose is enforced with unwavering severity. Each night, the monastery’s bell calls the village to prayer at the Twilight and Evening hours. Any who worship another god, hide their sins, fail to kneel, or speak ill of the Crimson Faithful are swiftly taken to the monastery—and never seen again.</p><h2>A Cold Ale at Briar Public House</h2><p>Being a small community, there is little here for outsiders. Briar Public House was opened to provide a drinking spot for locals, but it also offers food and lodging for travelers and merchants who find their way into the small village. Briar Public House is owned and operated by Kristoff Gruber (neutral good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</strong>), a portly, gruff man whose sour disposition belies his caring nature.</p><h3><strong>Investigating the Village</strong></h3><p>The people of Dawn’s Gate never speak ill of the Crimson Faithful in public. In fact, a successful [[/check INS DC 10]] check reveals insincere smiles and furtive looks over their shoulders. They speak truly that Dawn’s Gate rarely suffers the monsters or brigands that plague other parts of Wickermoor Hollow, but it’s clear they fear something else.</p><p><em><strong>Missing Person?</strong></em> Those who ask around the village for clues about the missing pilgrim, Gareth from Wickermoor Village, are stonewalled by smiling villagers. They say that they saw someone of that description come through the town, but he asked too many questions. If they wait until the Evening Hour bell, they see a huge bonfire alight in the mountains, and the villagers become slightly more talkative (see below).</p><p><em><strong>The Night of Flames.</strong></em> Every three nights, the Sanguine Hunt thunders through town and up the mountainside, returning from their raids. That evening, a fire burns atop the hill, its light visible for miles around. During this time, the villagers of Dawn’s Gate speak more freely, since all the Crimson Faithful in the village have returned to the monastery. They whisper that they are being watched, and that those who are taken to the monastery for “purification” are never seen again. That includes a man who matches Gareth’s description.</p><h2>Impromptu Ambush</h2><p>The characters may decide that intercepting the Sanguine Hunt on their next outing is the best course of action. The Sanguine Hunt returns to the monastery during a Night of Flames, and when the Twilight Hour bell rings on the following night, their departure from the monastery back into Wickermoor Hollow echoes across the countryside.</p><p>This unit of the Sanguine Hunt is an inquisition force of three lawful evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knights}</strong> led by Head Inquisitor Cromwell (neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knight}</strong>) all on <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.T1xZTDCGuvMBSq8d]{Warhorses}</strong>.

A creature who attempts to break down the door from its spiked side takes [[/damage 1d4 piercing]]{2 (1d4)} piercing damage. All doors are unlocked unless stated otherwise.</p><p><em><strong>Locks.</strong></em> Some doors within the Crimson Monastery are locked and can only be opened with a skeleton key or picked using thieves’ tools with a successful [[/check DEX DC 15]] check using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.woWZ1sO5IUVGzo58]{thieves' tools}. Renathyr and his priors possess skeleton keys.</p><p><em><strong>Lighting.</strong></em> Unless otherwise stated, areas within are lit by candles and torches and are bright light.</p><p><em><strong>Bloodstone Structure.</strong></em> The material of the monastery prevents blood from drying on its surface, creating an easy trail for those who smell blood to follow. Creatures missing any hit points have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and creatures that are reduced to half their hit points or fewer automatically fail Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><p><em><strong>Blood-Red Windows.</strong></em> All the windows in this monastery are made of uniformly red stained glass arranged into mesmerizing, rose-petal patterns. Candlelight that spills out bathes the area around it in an eerie red hue.</p><p><em><strong>Eternal Night.</strong></em> The blessing of the Crimson Rose protects her Bloodless worshipers. Sunlight from spells or other magical effects doesn’t harm vampires within the walls and grounds of the monastery.</p><h2>Retreating From the Monastery</h2><p>If the characters become overwhelmed and need to retreat from the monastery, the situation changes by the time they return, based on the Crimson Faithful’s attitude toward them.</p><p><em><strong>Friendly.</strong></em> The characters are welcomed back as old friends and chided not to leave again unless commanded, lest they accidentally spread wickedness throughout the world.</p><p><em><strong>Indifferent.</strong></em> They are scolded for leaving and made to lead a Night of Flames to atone for their departure.</p><p><em><strong>Hostile.</strong></em> The gates are barred against the characters, and the Crimson Faithful attack on sight to drive them away.</p><p>Some adjustments to areas may be necessary depending on the actions of the characters. A character who offended or acted against a clergy member might discover someone they are close to has been taken and held within the Dead Larder (area M11), or Father Renathyr may greet the characters personally upon their return if they have made themselves beloved among the congregation.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/14-1_The_Crimson_Monastery.webp\" alt=\"\" /></div>"

The blade once called Duchess remains entombed in the altar.</p><p><em><strong>Level Up.</strong></em> The characters reach 6th level, if they are still 5th level, when they defeat Father Renathyr.</p><p><em><strong>Fated Tarot Reading.</strong></em> If <em>The Hierophant </em>was pulled during the “Fated Tarot Reading” in chapter 9 and a character did not accept the gift of Viraxys (see “Accepting Infernal Power” above), the <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.oqjEnz5tNOr6Tjsd]{Sword of the Crimson Abbot}</em>* can be pulled from the altar by a character, containing an echo of the devil’s power but lacking the overwhelming corruptive influence it once had.</p><p>If <em>The</em> <em>Hierophant</em> card was pulled during the “Fated Tarot Reading” in chapter 9 but a character accepted Viraxys’s gift (see “Accepting Infernal Power” above), the <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.oqjEnz5tNOr6Tjsd]{Sword of the Crimson Abbot}</em>* is removed as a possible Fabled Heirloom the characters can claim.</p><p>However, you can add another Fabled Heirloom to the adventure if you wish. Later in the adventure when appropriate, Adela Druskenvald can sense that fate has somehow changed. She will offer to perform another tarot reading in Druskenvald Manor for the character who had originally pulled <em>The</em> <em>Hierophant</em>.

Following the death of Father Renathyr, the surviving Bloodless scramble to position themselves as Renathyr’s successor, preaching piecemeal to nearby congregators. The fate of the Crimson Faithful hinges upon the characters’ next choices.</p><h2>Power Vacuum</h2><p>The death of Father Renathyr is only the beginning of the fell tale of the Crimson Monastery if the characters aren’t careful to eliminate the cult’s leadership. If more than one of Renathyr’s priors survive, a schism rages within the cult for a year, leading to many senseless deaths among the faithful until only one leader survives, in this priority:</p><ul><li><p>Friar Olaf (defeats both rivals due to his influence)</p></li><li><p>Inquisitor Cromwell (defeats only Jaeger with strength of arms)</p></li><li><p>Houndmaster Jaeger (not capable of defeating either rival)</p></li><li><p>Another member of the Bloodless (only if all three priors have been slain)</p></li></ul><p>If only one of the priors survived, they thank the characters for saving them from Renathyr’s evil, then swiftly consolidate power before any of the faithful learn that their goddess is, in fact, a devil.</p><h2>The Cult Dismantled</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/BES_Gargoyle%20Eagle%20copy.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>If the characters declare before the Crimson Faithful that their goddess, the Crimson Rose, is a devil and display proof (such as Father Renathyr’s monstrous, bat-like corpse or his journal found in area M16), the Crimson Faithful rebel against the Bloodless. This may happen in one final encounter immediately following the fight with Renathyr or in a longer guerilla battle following a retreat to Dawn’s Gate. Either way, the influence of the Crimson Faith is undone by this revelation. In addition, the Crimson Faithful disband if all Bloodless are slain (the number of total Bloodless is up to you).</p><h2 style=\"clear:both\">Back in Wickermoor Village</h2><p>If Gareth was rescued, the Brightsingers celebrate his return. If he was slain, they hold a funeral at the Abandoned Church (area V19), praising him as a martyr. Weston Murdoch even proposes sainthood for him.</p><p>If the Crimson Faith is disbanded, many former followers leave Dawn’s Gate for Wickermoor Village, eager to begin anew. All three religious groups view this as an ideal opportunity to convert new members.</p><p>Phillip Druskenvald is thrilled to hear about the good work that the characters are doing in helping the people of Wickermoor Hollow. He invites the characters to a lavish dinner at the Druskenvald Estate, promising the house won’t turn crooked this time.

Round rising rapture, hand in hand!<br />From pale decay and empty gloom, we’ll comfort you.</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\"><em><strong>May our light embrace you too, and pierce the edge of midnight soon.<br />Through wicker’s blaze and ashen plume, the Crooked Moon!”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\"><em><strong>- Invocation of the Old Ways -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p4\">The song of the Old Ways fills the air, carried high by enraptured voices and intertwined with embers that hiss and crack as they die. Their breath slows, drawn to a halt, until all that remains of the sacrificed is ash. Atop the highest hill in the gloomy moorland stands a titan made of wicker, casting its crooked shadow over a throng of devotees that sing praises to the Crooked Queen.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A prophecy (see chapter 8) has been whispered among the Followers of the Old Ways since Kehlenn first stirred within her prison in the Crooked Tree. Following the deaths of the Fallen, the bloody revelries brought forth by the Lord of Fools, and the preparations for sacrifice conducted by the Vermintoll Coven, the final piece of the prophecy is put into place with the capture of Adela Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p7\">Adela’s sacrifice is all that remains to free the Crooked Queen and unleash her twisted, vengeful power upon Phillip Druskenvald and the domain he dared to steal. No fewer than thirteen souls must be consumed by flames within an enormous wicker effigy shaped into the form of the humanity that Kehlenn loathes so much. Among those doomed to burn is the beloved bride of her eons-old foe.</p><p class=\"p7\">With the ritual set in motion and the ancient prophecy poised to come to fruition, the Followers of the Old Ways have erected a Wicker Man atop the highest hill in the moors north of Wickermoor Village. This sacred site, known as Rowan’s Rise, is where the Crooked Man makes his final play, drawing forth his ancient power.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Leaving the collapsed remains of the Crooked House behind, the characters follow the massive swarm of spirits—their ethereal cries now mingled with gleeful screams of dying victims—out into the moors toward Rowan’s Rise. Characters have these goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Journey across the moors, saving innocent townsfolk from the monsters of the Crooked Queen.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Disrupt the ritualistic magic at the standing stones atop Rowan’s Rise.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy the animated Wicker Man and annihilate the Crooked Man.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, review the NPCs of Wickermoor Village (see chapter 11) and decide who will be cultists and who will be captives based on the characters’ connections for the most dramatic climax. Read through the encounters across the moors so you can better improvise the innocents’ reactions to the horrors around them. Finally, familiarize yourself with the climactic battle, “Shadow of the Wicker Man,” so that you can deliver a satisfying ending to the Crooked Man’s story arc.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 12 characters.</p>",

Their breath slows, drawn to a halt, until all that remains of the sacrificed is ash. Atop the highest hill in the gloomy moorland stands a titan made of wicker, casting its crooked shadow over a throng of devotees that sing praises to the Crooked Queen.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A prophecy (see chapter 8) has been whispered among the Followers of the Old Ways since Kehlenn first stirred within her prison in the Crooked Tree. Following the deaths of the Fallen, the bloody revelries brought forth by the Lord of Fools, and the preparations for sacrifice conducted by the Vermintoll Coven, the final piece of the prophecy is put into place with the capture of Adela Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p7\">Adela’s sacrifice is all that remains to free the Crooked Queen and unleash her twisted, vengeful power upon Phillip Druskenvald and the domain he dared to steal. No fewer than thirteen souls must be consumed by flames within an enormous wicker effigy shaped into the form of the humanity that Kehlenn loathes so much. Among those doomed to burn is the beloved bride of her eons-old foe.</p><p class=\"p7\">With the ritual set in motion and the ancient prophecy poised to come to fruition, the Followers of the Old Ways have erected a Wicker Man atop the highest hill in the moors north of Wickermoor Village. This sacred site, known as Rowan’s Rise, is where the Crooked Man makes his final play, drawing forth his ancient power.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Leaving the collapsed remains of the Crooked House behind, the characters follow the massive swarm of spirits—their ethereal cries now mingled with gleeful screams of dying victims—out into the moors toward Rowan’s Rise. Characters have these goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Journey across the moors, saving innocent townsfolk from the monsters of the Crooked Queen.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Disrupt the ritualistic magic at the standing stones atop Rowan’s Rise.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy the animated Wicker Man and annihilate the Crooked Man.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, review the NPCs of Wickermoor Village (see chapter 11) and decide who will be cultists and who will be captives based on the characters’ connections for the most dramatic climax. Read through the encounters across the moors so you can better improvise the innocents’ reactions to the horrors around them. Finally, familiarize yourself with the climactic battle, “Shadow of the Wicker Man,” so that you can deliver a satisfying ending to the Crooked Man’s story arc.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 12 characters.</p></div>"

This sacred place draws the freed souls to it before they fly off in all directions and fade in an attempt to find rest. Now is the time to save the still-living souls.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">The Legend of Rowan</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Many years ago, a young woman named Rowan became enchanted by the moon that forever gazes upon Druskenvald, its gentle light a soft invitation from the heavens. She followed its beckoning glow from her bedroom in Wickermoor Village and disappeared into the moors. When she did not return home, a search party scoured the highlands all night before finding the last trace anyone would ever find of her. Her precious silver locket lay abandoned at the center of a ring of ancient standing stones, the portrait of her beloved sister within replaced by the image of an antlered hare.</p><p class=\"p7\">The story told for generations was that Rowan soared into the night sky, flying higher and higher until she could sit upon the Crooked Moon, watching over the people of Wickermoor Hollow forever more. From then on, that great crowned hill was known as Rowan’s Rise.</p><p class=\"p7\">Beneath the tale lies the truth… that Rowan became the first human sacrifice to Kehlenn when she first reawakened her power. And so, it is at this sacred site that the Followers of the Old Ways perform the final rites to release the Crooked Queen so that she can reclaim her usurped domain.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Sacrifices</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Each encounter in this section places innocent villagers in peril. Every villager that dies loses their soul to the ongoing sacrificial ritual and feeds the Wicker Man atop the hill. This is made obvious to the characters when, after each death of an innocent, a mote of blue-green light rises from the corpse and is whisked toward the Wicker Man. Keep track of how many villagers perish in the encounters, up to a maximum number noted in each encounter. The total determines how much stronger the Wicker Man becomes in the final confrontation.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Should the characters fare poorly while moving across the moors or falter in protecting the innocents, they may find themselves overwhelmed. If they retreat, dozens of townsfolk will be sacrificed, and the Wicker Man will achieve its full power, turning its wrath toward Wickermoor Village and the valley beyond until all has turned to ash.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">What’s at Stake</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Before parting ways with the Jenkin family at the ruins of the Crooked House, Dani tells the characters that she senses that both Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are on the moors. Adela is trapped in a prison of wicker surrounded by terrified innocents and animals. She can sense Phillip desperately searching the moors but does not know where he is.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Crooked Chaos</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">When the characters arrive at the moors, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The moors outside of Wickermoor Village are treacherous even in the best of times.

This trip through the mists of death leaves them stranded in the mysterious valley of Wickermoor Hollow, where isolated peoples are terrorized by restless dead, wicked hags, ravenous monsters, and many other creatures of the night that never ends.</p><p>From the very beginning, the characters’ fates are intertwined with that of Phillip Druskenvald, the lord of the land that he shaped and named after himself, as well as his clairvoyant wife, Adela. Despite their power, these well-meaning but naïve nobles are doomed to perish in the story’s climax from the machinations of a twisted fey goddess known as the Crooked Queen.</p><p>This primeval entity named Kehlenn is served by countless minions, including a secret cult of human worshippers, a coven of verminous crones, and a malevolent spirit called the Crooked Man—all of whom do her bidding throughout the valley to free her from her ancient prison deep within the dark wood.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/large-Holly_Bunyip.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>The means of this eventual return lies with a fledgling god born from sin itself. Known only as the Horned King, this fiendish black goat seeks to incarnate and be made flesh so he may free his Crooked Queen and sit at her right hand, annihilating the people of Druskenvald and disintegrating the land ahead of the domain’s twisted rebirth.</p><p>The whispers and promises of this lord of sin are alluring and have brought about the fall of six formerly heroic wayward souls who now terrorize all corners of Wickermoor Hollow. Known to the followers of the Crooked Queen as the Fallen, these six villains serve as sacrifices to be made and the seals to be broken to unleash the full power of the Horned King.</p><p>It is this complex web of evil with which the characters must contend if they hope to survive their time in the valley and save the lives of Druskenvald’s inhabitants. While victory is possible, the cost will be tremendous, and many souls cannot be saved no matter what the would-be heroes do.</p><p>And yet, while there is only a ghost of a chance that salvation can be achieved, it is a hope all the same. Only the characters who embark on this adventure can determine the fate of all who dwell beneath the Crooked Moon.</p></div>"

His dapper appearance and affable personality belie the immense power he holds. While he appears to be a tall, thin man with perfectly slicked back hair and a pencil-thin mustache as black as night, the truth is that he is a timeless lord of death with his origins lost deep within the Shroud itself . . . even to him.</p><p>Despite ruling in Druskenvald for many years, he was not always the realm’s master. Formerly, it had belonged to the fey goddess Kehlenn, who utilized the reincarnation magics of the domain to rebirth souls as flora and fauna in a natural world where life was brutal and short.</p><p>Phillip is another kind of deathless being who arrived from beyond the mist eons ago. He usurped the realm of rebirth, claiming its reincarnating powers for his own. He then reshaped the land into his own design, even renaming it after himself. In this new afterlife, Phillip provided souls the opportunity to be reborn as sapient mortal beings to enjoy a second chance at a “normal” life.</p><p>After the slow passage of millennia, Phillip forgot about his battle with Kehlenn or that there was ever a world before the one he forged himself. He now oversees the domain with his Crescent Court, composed of the thirteen lords and ladies of Druskenvald (see chapter 1). However, he finds governance tedious and prefers to enjoy the good life he brought to the afterlife, with all the messy and sinful comforts and indulgences that come with it.</p><p>While he maintains a general grasp of the current affairs of the thirteen major provinces of Druskenvald, Phillip is mostly ignorant of the happenings in Wickermoor Hollow, heightened by the crooked power of Kehlenn that shrouds it from his view. Even worse, while in the valley, Phillip has none of the supernatural powers that make him the most formidable being in the land.</p><p>He does not know, and will only learn too late, that in Wickermoor Hollow, Kehlenn has seized his power and weaves it toward her own aims in the creation of a newborn god of sin: the Horned King. While within the confines of the valley, Phillip is very nearly just a mortal man, which will lead to his inevitable destruction.</p><p>Phillip’s newfound impotence frustrates him, but he still decides to remain in the valley after being stranded there with the characters. His curiosity is stronger than his sense of preservation, and he cannot fathom a scenario where he could be in any real danger. He sees the presence of the characters as an opportunity to get to the bottom of what’s happening in Wickermoor Hollow while also helping the citizens he’s neglected for so long.</p><h2>Adela Druskenvald</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Adela_Druskenvald.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>Adela Druskenvald is the loving partner-in-crime of her husband Phillip. She rules Druskenvald alongside him, and while she similarly has a distaste for politics and bureaucracy, she often serves as a voice of reason and a reminder of the responsibility to help the people across the thirteen provinces.</p><p>While Phillip is an otherworldly entity from regions unknown, Adela was born a mortal woman and lived in the material world for the first three decades of her life. As a child, her paranormal experiences and prophetic visions led to her discovery of immense powers of divination and a strong connection to the spiritual world.</p><p>As a young woman, Adela’s curiosity and dauntlessness brought her face-to-face with Phillip aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, and the two fell in love at first sight. They were quickly married, and as a Druskenvald, Adela became immortal, enjoying her endless youth by seeking every new and exciting experience she could find.</p><p>While Adela has an exceptional gift of second sight, she doubts her own abilities, which often leads to her misinterpreting her visions. Despite this anxiety and her cheerful, almost ditzy demeanor, there is reason to believe that she is far more crafty, calculating, and deliberate than she lets on.</p><p>Even with her gift of prophecy, she is powerless to stop her fate as a sacrificial lamb in the ritual to free the Crooked Queen. Throughout the adventure, her visions become increasingly grave but also more difficult to interpret.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Kehlenn_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen</h2><p>Kehlenn is a primordial fey goddess who first created the plane of existence now known as Druskenvald. Before Phillip Druskenvald invaded her realm and made it his own, she was the Green Queen, who tended an afterlife of reincarnation into a realm of pure nature. Mortal souls would be reborn as plants and animals, and while the verdant world she ruled was natural, each life after rebirth was brutal and short.</p><p>When Phillip Druskenvald arrived in her green realm and supplanted her, he was unaware that a being of such power could never be completely destroyed, especially within the confines of the dimension she created. In her defeat, Kehlenn managed to slink into the darkest wood she could find and crawl beneath the roots of a single tree. Her physical form withered in the barrow, and her essence compressed into the trunk, bough, and branch of the tree that grew from it.</p><p>From this solitary spot, she slumbered in a near-deathlike stasis for eons, slowly reabsorbing the power of the land that surrounded her—a valley that would eventually come to be called Wickermoor Hollow. But what never slept was the hate she felt for Phillip Druskenvald and the mortal beings he brought with him to her once green domain. The bitterness and desire for vengeance twisted Kehlenn and the tree where she dwelled until all the Green withered and she took up the new title of the Crooked Queen.</p><p>Kehlenn has slowly been regaining strength century after century, eventually calling to minions that gathered around her like moths to a flame. The worship they paid her and the twisted rituals they conducted in her honor made her even stronger until all Wickermoor Hollow was her domain, despite still being entombed and imprisoned in the forest that had come to be called the Wytchwood.</p><p>With her servants enacting her heinous machinations, she readies herself for freedom and the revenge she so desperately seeks against Phillip and the people he rules over. Now she plots toward the disintegration of all sapient beings into nature and the annihilation and crooked rebirth of the world she had been robbed of.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Horned%20King_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>The Horned King</h2><p>Deep within the Wytchwood stalks a terrible beast that is the manifestation of sin itself. A fledging god of mortal desire that seeks to achieve incarnation to usher in the annihilation and crooked rebirth of Druskenvald, the Horned King is the fiendish servant of the Crooked Queen and her ultimate weapon in claiming vengeance against the man who usurped her.</p><p>Despite Kehlenn’s overall defeat, her eventual reawakening and growing power in Wickermoor Hollow has allowed her to achieve her greatest victory since she was cast down. Just as Phillip stole her domain in the forgotten past, she has claimed his inherent power within the confines of the valley, rending the usually-mighty lord of the land as little more than a mortal human.</p><p>What she found in the powerful and even eldritch energies spawned from the heart of Phillip Druskenvald was sin. The darkness and desire that lurk within humanity and nearly all sentient mortal beings are what the new lord of the land brought to her once-beautiful, green kingdom. And with it was the desperate, fear-driven desire to not just survive, but to thrive and live deliciously in comfort and abundance.</p><p>Kehlenn held onto this newfound fragment of Phillip’s soul, siphoning it to slowly regain her strength and weave a fledgling god of sin, desire, and wickedness into existence to serve as her consort and right hand. Taking the form of an enormous black goat with three blood-red eyes, the Horned King exists as an incorporeal fiendish spirit bound to the haunted Wytchwood where the Crooked Queen remains entombed and imprisoned (see chapter 24).</p><p>However, his sinful power spreads through Wickermoor Hollow, offering the mortals of his queen’s realm the chance to live the life they’ve always wanted at the cost of pledging and sacrificing their very soul. With each new covetous and terrified mortal who falls to sin and signs their name in the book of the Horned King, Kehlenn’s plan comes closer to fruition. And soon, with the inevitable downfall of Phillip Druskenvald, the beast that stalks the deepest woods and darkest hearts will be made flesh and ascend as an instrument of the Crooked Queen’s vengeance.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Crooked%20Man_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>The Crooked Man</h2><p>The essence of this ancient spirit has existed since the forgotten ages, a lingering remnant of the Crooked Queen's twisted power of rebirth. Despite this primeval origin, the Crooked Man has taken a myriad of forms over the millennia, always corrupting and killing a mortal host before being reborn with a new visage every century or so, favoring a brutalized human shape for as long as the species has dwelled in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>His current incarnation is the twisted shade of a man named Eustace Lockwood, who slaughtered his entire household in one bloody night after a slow descent into paranoia and malevolence through a malign witchcraft that plagued his dreams. His neck, torso, limbs, fingers, teeth, and even his top hat are bent at unnatural angles, truly living up to his name. While he can move about the whole valley, he primarily resides in the manor home built atop a remnant of Kehlenn’s power, aptly dubbed the Crooked House (see chapter 12).</p><p>Serving as the mouthpiece and instrument of the Crooked Queen while she remains trapped within the Wytchwood, he has orchestrated many of the horrors that have befallen the residents of Wickermoor Hollow. He also serves as a guiding force of the malevolent Cult of the Crooked Queen that has infiltrated the Followers of the Old Ways within the valley, constantly working in secret to bring about Kehlenn's return.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Vermintol%20Coven_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>The Vermintoll Coven</h2><p>The only minions of Kehlenn on par with the Crooked Man are the three vile hags that form the Vermintoll Coven. All three of the ancient crones are fey beings from the time before Phillip, now just as twisted and hateful as the queen they’ve served for eons. Each member of the coven obsessively favors a verminous creature and has taken on the physical traits of the foul animals they command.</p><p>The ultimate purpose of the coven is to toll the death knell of the living beings fated for sacrifice and prepare their mind, body, and soul for the sacrificial rituals conducted in honor of the Crooked Queen. While these three sisters are united in their malign purpose, they truly despise each other, all seeking a place at Kehlenn’s left hand.</p><p>The youngest sister is Vessla Browntooth, the weasel hag, who corrupts the soul through wicked witchcraft and twisted dreams from the attic of the Crooked House (see chapter 12). The middle sister is Stonoga Blackstinger, the centipede hag, who corrupts the body through disease, venom, and loathsome fleshcrafting from the depths of Skitterdeep Mine (see chapter 16). The eldest sister is Golub Graygullet, the pigeon hag, who corrupts the mind through manipulation of information as the disguised postmaster of Wickermoor Village from her Roving Rookery (see chapter 20).</p><p>This coven is a constant threat plaguing the people of Wickermoor Hollow and subtly assisting the Cult of the Crooked Queen from the shadows. And despite being unwittingly fated to die themselves, they are destined to serve Kehlenn even after their deaths at the hands of the characters, shattering reality and unleashing the ultimate nightmare upon the valley.</p><h2>The Fallen</h2><p>The greatest victory of the Horned King after his birth from the sinful soul of Phillip Druskenvald was the fall of six powerful and wayward souls that found themselves in Druskenvald from the material world. Each of these beings had once been heroic in their own way, but all had deep flaws and demons both within and without.</p><p>While these former heroes never once directly heard the seductive voice of the goat in the woods, the sin that dwelled in each of their hearts was plied by the Horned King until they brought about their own downfall one by one. With each turn to despair, hopelessness, and eventually wickedness, the Fallen, as they came to be known by the servants of the Crooked Queen, turned into the monsters they once fought against.</p><p>The increasing evil perpetuated by the Fallen has added to the Horned King’s power as he seeks to spread sin from his prison within the Wytchwood. Now, each of the Fallen must die so that their wicked essence may be consumed and used as the catalyst for the black goat’s inevitable incarnation.</p><p>However, none of the Fallen actively serve the forces of the Crooked Queen and purely seek to achieve their own aims. They have no alliances with each other or even the lord of sin, who is ultimately responsible for each of their falls. These villains intimidate and slaughter the people of Wickermoor Hollow on their own volition, each offering a unique threat and challenge for the characters to confront.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_FULLPAGE_6%20Fallen.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h3><strong>Raum, the Harvest Terror</strong></h3><p>The friendly and helpful scarecrow tunesmith named Ol’ Jericho Sticks was once a beloved member of the agrarian community of Foxwillow, but his construction contained a ravenous demon of secrets within. Eventually, the whispers corrupted him into a fiendish crow-like fiend that terrorizes the people he used to cherish. Feasting on his victims’ flesh, souls, and secrets, Raum strikes from a demonic dimension of infinite cornstalks and replaces the bodies of his prey with grotesque pumpkin-headed effigies (see chapter 13).</p><h3><strong>Father Renathyr, the Crimson Abbot</strong></h3><p>Sir Marius Renathyr was once a gallant knight who served a god of morning and protected the innocent. However, he was tricked by a succubus duchess of hell into sacrificing everything he once stood for, transforming him into a bloodthirsty vampire. Now, Father Renathyr leads a rigid faith from the Crimson Monastery sworn to destroy wickedness at every turn, commanding legions of zealous followers to kidnap innocents so they may burn at the stake or be drained of blood to feed his undying hunger (see chapter 14).</p><h3><strong>Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner</strong></h3><p>Once a pirate of fearsome renown, Captain Briggsy “The Kutlass” Kratch practiced hexing magic granted to him by a powerful death spirit he had bargained with. Driven by the desire for more wealth and power, he tricked and imprisoned his patron, harnessing the magic of jinxcraft for himself to become a master of misfortune. He now lurks in the swamps of the Drowned Crossroads, offering the truly desperate their hearts’ desire in a bargain that always ends in misery. After each deal turns bad, Mister Crossroads rips the spirits from his associates’ bodies and binds their shambling corpses to his will (see chapter 15).</p><h3><strong>Matron Lethica, the Weeping Widow</strong></h3><p>Lethica Nightborne was once a high priestess of a night goddess and committed to healing the sick and injured with blessings of the divine. However, following the painful loss of her husband, she turned to vile science fueled by the alien biology of a cosmic horror which she called forth into Druskenvald. Now, Matron Lethica oversees the gloomy sanatorium called Memory’s Rest, wiping the minds of her patients with an eldritch serum and performing grotesque experiments on their bodies (see chapter 17).</p><h3><strong>Gorthos, the Beast of Blight</strong></h3><p>A young antlered satyr named Farryn once devoted her life to tending a lush forest called the Greenwood until she became heartbroken following the death of her only love. In an attempt to bring this lover back, she followed the call of a dead god and transformed into a vile rotting husk of an abomination and blighted the entire woodland with her newfound power. Now, Gorthos lurks within Hartsblight Forest, spreading rot and decay with the help of a circle of twisted druids who revere and serve her (see chapter 18).</p><h3><strong>Yorgrim, the Chained Reaper</strong></h3><p>The orc gravedigger known as Yorgrim is the last to fall. Once a shaman who inadvertently led to the death of his entire clan, he spent a lifetime performing a penance before dying himself. However, he found no rest in death and his spirit became bound to Maidenmist Cemetery, where he tends to the spirits of the dead and serves as a jailer of the ravening souls from the Shroud within. Now, he is doomed to become a harbinger of death called the Chained Reaper following the incessant corruption of the gibbering spirits he guards (see chapter 19).</p></div>"

The prophecy that has been whispered by the cult of the Old Ways and the servants of the Crooked Queen demands the slaughter of all six of the Fallen, a sacrificial fool called Chuckles, and both Phillip and Adela Druskenvald. And only Kehlenn herself knows that even the Vermintoll Coven and the Crooked Man must be destroyed for the ritual of her glorious rebirth to achieve its full power.</p><p>Throughout the adventure, the characters will inadvertently advance the will of the Crooked Queen through their good deeds. Although they are viewed as pawns by Kehlenn, it’s through their actions that she might ultimately be defeated and sealed away within the Crooked Moon in the climax of the story.</p><p>This means that all the NPCs mentioned above are doomed. If the characters survive to the end of the adventure, Phillip and Adela, the Fallen, the Vermintoll Coven, and even many innocent residents of Wickermoor Hollow will all be dead. The events that take place will save the lives of Druskenvald as a whole, but it will come at great cost, perhaps even requiring the sacrifice of the characters themselves (see chapter 24).</p><h3><strong>Redemption and Salvation?</strong></h3><p>In Folk Horror, there is scarce redemption for the wicked, and the protagonists rarely survive unless they pay a terrible cost. <em>The Crooked Moon</em> adventure is written with this in mind. The villains are meant to be destroyed, and the Druskenvalds are doomed to perish, as is required by the ritual to unleash the Crooked Queen.</p><p>However, your players may sympathize with some of the villains and wish to spare them or find it unconscionable that major NPCs cannot be saved from a terrible fate. While the campaign is designed and written so that all of the Fallen, the Vermintoll Coven, and the Druskenvalds are dead by the end of the story, you may decide to allow the possibility to spare them.</p><p>The simplest way to achieve this is to remove the prophecy and rituals that require the sacrifice of the major figures in the campaign. Kehlenn can simply draw more power as wicked deeds spread through Wickermoor Hollow, eventually allowing for her attempted ascension in the climax of the story.</p><p>Alternatively, you can interpret the requirement for sacrifice in ways that do not lead to death. For instance:</p><ul><li><p>The Fallen must have the Horned King’s sin driven from their souls, causing the death of their wicked identity. For example, sparing and redeeming Lethica Nightborne still “kills” her Fallen identity of the Weeping Widow.</p></li><li><p>The Vermintoll Coven must be driven from their lairs so that they lose their source of power without being slain.</p></li><li><p>Phillip and Adela Druskenvald must lose their hope and their pride, with the act of falling so low being enough for Kehlenn to achieve her goals.</p></li><li><p>Any surviving and redeemed villains leave Wickermoor Hollow forever and don’t aid the characters in their quest.</p></li></ul><p>It is up to you how you approach the adventure and account for the changes and potential “butterfly effects” that result from choosing to spare these figures.</p></div>"

              "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap08 bottom-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">Wickermoor Hollow</p><p>The entirety of <em>The Crooked Moon</em> adventure takes place within the valley known as Wickermoor Hollow. This minor province of Druskenvald is isolated from the rule and watchful eye of the Crescent Court and especially Phillip Druskenvald, thanks to the rising power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen.</p><h2>Locations and Landscapes</h2><p>In Folk Horror, the landscapes where the stories take place are just as important as the vile antagonists and doomed protagonists that drive the action forward. The wide variety of rural locations and natural settings throughout this adventure are intended to increase the feeling of isolation among the characters.</p><p>Review the details of each location within Wickermoor Hollow so you can incorporate them into the adventure and leverage evocative descriptions to best achieve an atmospheric tone perfect for Folk Horror.</p><h3><strong>Wickermoor Village</strong></h3><p>At the heart of Wickermoor Hollow lies the town that shares its name. The oldest and largest settlement in the valley, it is still a relatively small and isolated village that does not get many visitors. Its people have built a community that lives in harmony with each other and with nature to survive the incredible dangers and lurking horrors that dominate the valley.</p><p>However, beneath the surface operates a sinister cult that serves the Crooked Queen and seeks to bring about her return, even in the face of their own annihilation. Even the friendliest, smiling face can belie a wicked worshipper of Kehlenn who intends to sacrifice their neighbor when the time is right.</p><p>Wickermoor Village sits on the banks of the Silverbell River that cuts through the valley from the Drowned Crossroads to Moonsong Lake. Nestled within the gloomy moors that rise near the center of the hollow, it serves as the hub of trade and commerce between the primarily human residents that call this place home (see chapter 11).</p><h3><strong>The Foxwillow Farmland</strong></h3><p>To the east of Wickermoor Village stretches miles of fertile farmland that has been turned into fields that grow all manner of crop. Many small farming settlements dot the landscape, but at the center of the farmers who work the soil is the community of Foxwillow. These nearly picturesque fields and hills serve as the breadbasket for the rest of Wickermoor Hollow (see chapter 13).</p><h3><strong>The Howlers</strong></h3><p>The western border of the valley is walled in by a towering mountain range with snow-capped peaks. The Howlers, named for the wind that rips through the towering summits, stand as the impassable barrier to much of the rest of Druskenvald. The town of Dawn’s Gate sits in the foothills, surviving on the hunting and mining that the mountains provide (see chapter 14).</p><h3><strong>The Drowned Crossroads</strong></h3><p>At the lowest point of the valley is the teeming swamp called the Drowned Crossroads. This treacherous bayou is known for its miles of still, black water, choking overgrowth, and lurking predators that threaten to swallow even the most experienced swampfolk. Its largest town, Murkwater Bend, is a lawless haven for anyone hoping to escape the societal rule of the other settlements across the valley (see chapter 15).</p><h3><strong>Moonsong Lake</strong></h3><p>The Silverbell River empties into the vast Moonsong Lake at the western edge of the valley, which is prone to bouts of rain that can last for weeks. At the center of the lake rests the Isle of Mourn, which once served as a place of healing despite the near-constant gloomy weather. However, its seemingly placid waters are teeming with wriggling parasites (see chapter 17).</p><h3><strong>Hartsblight Forest</strong></h3><p>The wood in the northwest corner of the valley has been overrun by a terrible blight that afflicts all plants, animals, and people that enter Hartsblight Forest. Thousands of varieties of fungus thrive in the alien-looking woodland as the dominant life form, and even the air between the trees is choked with virulent spores (see chapter 18).</p><h3><strong>Maidenmist Cemetery</strong></h3><p>The sprawling hills south of Wickermoor Village roll all the way to the southern border of the valley, covered in tombstones and crypts. Serving as the final resting place of the dead of Wickermoor Hollow, the vast Maidenmist Cemetery is a region of its own, and it’s even said that the iron gates inch further outward every passing night (see chapter 19).</p><h3><strong>The Wytchwood</strong></h3><p>The oldest and wildest part of Wickermoor Hollow is the forbidden forest called the Wytchwood. All those who venture past its shrouded tree line never return, and the eerie howls, roars, snarls, and bellows of the strange creatures within can be heard from miles away. People across the valley feel drawn to the wood, called by the beast that stalks between its primeval trees (see chapter 24).</p><h2>Ideologies and Power Groups</h2><p>While various beliefs are spread throughout Wickermoor Hollow, four primary ideologies have taken hold among most of the common folk of the valley. These factions are most prevalent among the residents of Wickermoor Village but can be found in other settlements as well. While some of these groups might have more members that are good or evil, membership in any of the ideologies doesn’t guarantee how any of its adherents will act.</p><p>Additionally, these groups are not factions in the traditional sense with official membership and processes for joining. Instead, people might be associated with a group based on their beliefs or actions but are not necessarily zealots or advocates for any particular worldview.</p><h3><strong>The Followers of the Old Ways</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Followers%20of%20the%20Old%20Ways-%20good%20and%20back%20combined.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>The Followers of the Old Ways kneel to the natural and supernatural world that surrounds them. This faith is the standard belief system of the people of Wickermoor Village, and its members believe that adhering to the Old Ways has allowed for their settlement to have survived for centuries and grow to a level of relative prosperity in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>Highly superstitious, those who revere the Old Ways bow to and seek to appease the protective and destructive sides of nature and its spirit world counterpart. The personification of the Old Ways is a primordial fey entity called the Green Queen who embodies both nature and magic. However, most worshipers do not know that the true identity of their goddess is Kehlenn, who has turned crooked after millennia of hateful imprisonment.</p><p>The Followers of the Old Ways believe that survival in a world such as Druskenvald is a privilege and a miracle—and never guaranteed. They accept with open arms nature’s blessings as well as the utter destruction and death it can cause.</p><p>To them, individual life is a tiny insignificance in the scope of the community; they are happy and willing to sacrifice themselves or others if it means honoring and appeasing the Old Ways and guaranteeing a greater existence and prosperity for the collective whole in the years to come. Most practitioners of the Old Ways perform numerous rituals in their nightly lives and always strive to listen to the elders and the wisest among them.</p><p>The majority are not evil or actively attempting to serve the Crooked Queen. Only the most devout and enlightened have formed a secretive cult of the Old Ways that practices malign and forbidden magic to serve Kehlenn, the Crooked Man, and the Vermintoll Coven.</p><p>This sect manipulates the unaware and more benevolent adherents of the Green Queen to bring about the ascension of the Crooked Queen and the eventual disintegration of all sapient life. These cultists know that they too will die but are seeking a glorious rebirth in the new crooked order of things. As soon as Phillip and Adela Druskenvald arrive in Wickermoor Hollow, they begin to advance their plans toward this end.</p><p>On the surface, the benevolent symbol utilized by the general members of the Followers of the Old Ways is a feminine face made from green leaves. However, the more malign cultists who seek to unleash the Crooked Queen recognize each other by wearing or displaying the symbol of an antlered hare. This might be a tattoo, a piece of jewelry, or an actual hare foot kept somewhere on them for “good luck.”</p><h3><strong>The Fold of the Patient Lady</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Fold%20of%20the%20Patient%20Lady.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>The members of the Fold of the Patient Lady believe in harmony between sapient life and the forces of nature. They reject that nature is brutal, destructive, and uncaring and instead believe that it provides everything that sapient life needs to thrive without need for archaic and barbaric sacrifice and appeasement.</p><p>This newer reinterpretation of the Old Ways is a more palatable and perhaps naïve view of nature that has been quite appealing to the folk of the valley, and it has gained in popularity outside of Wickermoor Village. There are adherents in many of the larger communities, but most of the practitioners live in remote communes in the wilds.</p><p>The faithful of this sect are genuinely grateful to survive in such a dour and dangerous world and believe that the goddess known as the Patient Lady is to thank, giving her the credit for the ability to survive and grow food in a realm with no daytime and no seasonal cycle. They also eschew any dabbling in the spirit world or supernatural realms, considering such a thing a foolish and dangerous invitation for malevolent forces to corrupt the wilds.</p><p>Its adherents still perform rituals and rites in honor of the Patient Lady, but they keep them incredibly simple and tied to the natural world around them. This can even take the form of basic meditation outdoors, a walk through the woods and fields with fellow faithful, or the utterance of a song or prayer at harvest time.</p><p>The members of the Fold of the Patient Lady wear symbols that represent the beauty and bounty of nature. Flowers such as daisies and primroses and fruit such as apples and pumpkins are frequent symbols of these folk.</p><h3><strong>The Brightsingers</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Brightsingers.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>Only a small handful of people in Wickermoor Hollow are among the faithful that call themselves the Brightsingers. This new monotheistic sect believes in one true divine power that brings light to the land of darkness. They hold that their omnipresent and omniscient god, the Brightsinger, is the only path to goodness and prosperity, holding that the realms of nature and spirit in Druskenvald are inherently wicked and corrupted.</p><p>They attempt to spread their belief through pilgrimage and missionary work, advocating for their beliefs through relentless kindness and benevolence, never scolding or criticizing members of other faiths. However, there is a supreme pride among them because they believe they themselves to be as godly as their deity. The Brightsinger is all, so each member of the faithful is a Brightsinger themselves.</p><p>They see his presence in the songbirds that still sing brightly in the land of eternal night. They alone preach unconditional love and light in the hollow, but it is often a self-righteous and self-aggrandizing love that holds little sway over the population who have seen too much suffering to believe in a love on that scale.</p><p>The Brightsingers wear brightly colored clothes and jewelry, particularly fashioned from valuable materials and displaying fine craftsmanship. This attire often depicts images of suns, torches, lanterns, or brilliantly colored songbirds.</p><h3><strong>The Newcomers</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Newcomers.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>The group known as the Newcomers embraces reason, modernity, progress, and civilization. Often having traveled to Wickermoor Hollow from other provinces of Druskenvald or even from cities in the material world, they reject the beliefs and practices of the superstitious ideologies prominent in the valley.</p><p>Instead, they focus on what can be achieved and explained through knowledge, science, and technology. Phillip Druskenvald shares similar tenets with the Newcomers and easily makes friends with members of this scarce group throughout Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>These folks are not an organized group, and they share no symbols or rites. They are identified as Newcomers by the other folk in the area rather than self-identifying as a cohesive group.</p></div>"

Though slain one by one, the Vermintoll Coven has returned, reborn with the malignant power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen. Despite their hatred for one another, the three vile hags have been fused together as one horrific abomination. They now twist the potent dreams of the clairvoyant Adela Druskenvald to fulfill her foretold fate. The house cannot be cleansed and must be destroyed along with the coven to bring the terrors to an end.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">With the destruction of the Fallen and the sacrifice of the Lord of Fools, the next step of the prophesized ritual to turn the Horned King to flesh and free the Crooked Queen from her prison is the sacrifice of Adela Druskenvald. However, her inevitable burning in the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise can only occur once her body, mind, and soul have been prepared.</p><p class=\"p7\">These preparations were the wicked purpose of the Vermintoll Coven before they were slaughtered. However, their malefic spirits lingered, and Kehlenn returned them to abominable life to utilize their twisted magic one last time. Now, they have pulled Adela Druskenvald’s prophetic dreams into the Crooked House, weaving them with Kehlenn’s primeval power deep in the earth below to turn the entire home into a waking nightmare that has shattered reality itself.</p><p class=\"p7\">After watching the characters throughout their trials and tribulations in Wickermoor Hollow, the Crooked Man waits for them inside his old home in hopes of adding more sacrifices to the pyre.

I saw this shining, beautiful world we’ve built turned to ash and smoke. I’ve had so many nightmares lately. It’s this awful house. I just know it!”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>- Adela Druskenvald -</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Nightmares stir anew in the Crooked House. Though slain one by one, the Vermintoll Coven has returned, reborn with the malignant power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen. Despite their hatred for one another, the three vile hags have been fused together as one horrific abomination. They now twist the potent dreams of the clairvoyant Adela Druskenvald to fulfill her foretold fate. The house cannot be cleansed and must be destroyed along with the coven to bring the terrors to an end.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>With the destruction of the Fallen and the sacrifice of the Lord of Fools, the next step of the prophesized ritual to turn the Horned King to flesh and free the Crooked Queen from her prison is the sacrifice of Adela Druskenvald. However, her inevitable burning in the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise can only occur once her body, mind, and soul have been prepared.</p><p>These preparations were the wicked purpose of the Vermintoll Coven before they were slaughtered. However, their malefic spirits lingered, and Kehlenn returned them to abominable life to utilize their twisted magic one last time. Now, they have pulled Adela Druskenvald’s prophetic dreams into the Crooked House, weaving them with Kehlenn’s primeval power deep in the earth below to turn the entire home into a waking nightmare that has shattered reality itself.</p><p>After watching the characters throughout their trials and tribulations in Wickermoor Hollow, the Crooked Man waits for them inside his old home in hopes of adding more sacrifices to the pyre. He knows he will be given a new body just like his Horned King. The night has come for him to incarnate as the Wicker Man, and he only need delay the would-be heroes a little longer.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>The Crooked House has reawakened with the rebirth of the Vermintoll Coven in their new amalgamative form. The Crooked Man has trapped the Druskenvalds—once again—and the Jenkins within the house. Characters who enter the nightmare have these goals:</p><ul><li><p>Approach Druskenvald Manor and ensure the safety of Dani Jenkin.</p></li><li><p>Enter the Crooked House, confront the Crooked Man, and witness it shatter into the Crooked Nightmare.</p></li><li><p>Venture through the horrific dreamscapes, rescuing Walter Jenkin, Gilly Jenkin, and Phillip Druskenvald along the way.</p></li><li><p>Confront the hags of the Vermintoll Coven in the attic of the Crooked House and destroy the Coven Abomination.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, refresh yourself on the major NPCs, all of which the characters have previously encountered: the Druskenvalds, the Jenkin family, the Vermintoll Coven, and the Crooked Man. Read through the locations and dreamscapes of the Crooked Nightmare to better improvise each encounter.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 11th level characters.</p></div>"

The transformed creature you know as Wisp grins at you with razor-sharp teeth.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>On the shelf with you is a massive glass decanter. Walter Jenkin is trapped within, terrified. He pounds on the glass and screams voicelessly while standing in waist-deep liquor. Shrieking, bitter voices fill the air, spewing vitriolic hate toward Walter. The chorus is joined by Golub Graygullet, who perches atop the glass stopper of the decanter dressed in an absurd parody of a schoolteacher’s outfit. She cackles as she calls out in a mocking tone.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>“Poor Walter was such a ‘good man.’ The most loyal human I’ve had the displeasure of knowing! But all it takes is a few well-placed lies to make someone forget themselves and become a prisoner of their own making!

She gloats that Adela never learned how to control the powerful mind that she didn’t deserve, and it has led to her doom. The hag disappears if she takes any damage. Even if the characters don’t attack Golub, roll initiative!</p><p><em><strong>Decanter.</strong></em> The glass decanter has immunity to all damage and can’t be moved. Its stopper can’t be removed by any means from outside, but it can easily be pressed up from within if Walter chooses to escape. However, the mental torture that he is suffering makes him unaware of this solution and unable to do anything but impotently bang on the glass in agonized desperation.</p><p><em><strong>Wisp.</strong></em> Even if the characters previously killed the malicious ketgrinn during the events of the Crooked House (see chapter 12), this nightmare version of Wisp has stolen Walter’s voice once more. Now colossal, Wisp grins and speaks with not just the voice of Walter, but also Gilly, Dani, Mayor Somerton, and other townsfolk as you see fit. He spews vicious words to keep the man paralyzed in self-loathing.</p><p>Wisp looks into the bookshelf with only his head and paws visible, attacking the characters as he wraps Walter in despair. He uses the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.6wbasdWWqtXeIAyD]{Gynosphinx}</strong> stat block with the following changes: his alignment is chaotic evil, his size is Gargantuan, his creature type is Fey, and his Claw attacks deal psychic damage. Wisp vanishes with a yowl if reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p><em><strong>Saving Walter.</strong></em> The liquor level continually rises in the great decanter imprisoning Walter. He is terrified and clutches his head in agony. On initiative count 0 (losing initiative ties) on the 10th round, Walter drowns in the liquor.</p><p>Only Walter can save himself, but he can’t do it alone. He can be snapped out of his nightmare-induced powerlessness by appealing to the most defining aspect of his personality: his sense of loyalty. This can be accomplished through encouragement or by him seeing those he cares about in grave danger. He starts with loyalty 0, and he gains loyalty when any of the following occur:</p><p><strong>Rally (Gain 1 Loyalty).</strong> An attack made against Wisp scores a Critical hit.</p><p><strong>Resolve (Gain 1 Loyalty).</strong> An attack against a character scores a critical hit, or a character fails a saving throw Wisp forced.</p><p><strong>Victory (Gain 3 Loyalty).</strong> Wisp is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p><strong>Encourage (Gain 1 Loyalty).</strong> As an action, a character succeeds on a DC 20 ability check using one of these approaches, or any other that you deem appropriate:</p><ul><li><p>[[/check DEC DC 20]]{Charisma (Deception)} to distract Wisp from unleashing more mental torture.</p></li><li><p>[[/check PER DC 20]]{Charisma (Persuasion)} or [[/check INT DC 20]]{Charisma (Intimidation)} to inspire him to block out the verbal abuse or to pull himself together.</p></li><li><p>[[/check HIS DC 20]]{Intelligence (History)} or [[/check NAT DC 20]]{ Intelligence(Nature)} to use logic to help Walter realize that the nightmare is full of lies.</p></li></ul><p>When his loyalty reaches 6, Walter snaps himself out of his tortured inaction. He pushes the glass stopper out of the decanter and climbs out, horrifically shaken and scarred but alive. He reacts as if hearing a voice only he can hear and calls out to his daughter Dani, who pulls him from the nightmare in a burst of blue mist.</p><p><em><strong>Crooked Door.</strong></em> After Walter Jenkin escapes or dies, a crooked door appears in an image of Wisp’s enormous grin of sharp teeth.
