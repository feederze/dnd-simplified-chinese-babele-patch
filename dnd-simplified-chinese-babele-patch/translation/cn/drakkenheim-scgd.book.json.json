I just want you to know that this time it is not entirely my fault. My name is Sebastian Crowe, you probably know me as the greatest sorcerer on the continent. If the stories you heard involve a rat problem in Drakkenheim, that was the other Sebastian Crowe. So here is the deal: my friends and I have been working diligently to contain the horrible contamination within Drakkenheim, and have been doing an exceptional job. Now before you congratulate me, I should have you know that some other, not-so-great people thought it would be fun to trade delerium all over the continent. The Haze is spreading, people are dying, and everyone keeps yelling at me to make decisions and it all sounds really important and I'm just not well equipped to deal with such drastic decision making alone! Furthermore, the monsters are getting really, really bad, and I have almost died. Many times. Despite my vast magical powers, I can usually only manage to be in a few places at once, not everywhere. The Academy Directorate seems upset. The Hooded Lanterns seem upset. At this point, I think it's safe to assume that everyone is upset.</p>\n  <p>So, I'm begging you! Whether you are one of those brute warriors from the Isles of Skye or Netherwind, or a great commander from the civil war. Maybe a fancy bard from Caspia, or a lizard-riding ranger from Terene, just come to Drakkenheim, please. We need you! I know you apothecaries are all hiding in your labs mixing poisons, but we have enough issues going on and we need your brains on this matter post-haste.</p>\n  <p>So come to Drakkenheim! The air is toxic, the water is contaminated, and you can't sleep within a few miles of the city, but as the smartest man I ever knew once said “What's the worst that could happen?”</p>\n  <p>Kindly</p>\n  <p><cite>S.C.</cite></p>\n</blockquote>",

Struck by an eldritch storm of falling stars upon that woeful eve, the once-majestic capital is now a monster-haunted ruin contaminated by otherworldly magic. The political order of the wider world lies in shambles, torn apart by religious schism and looming military conflict. Meanwhile, insidious horrors creep out of the shadow of Drakkenheim into a world unprepared for such nightmares.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Using This Book</h1>\n<p><em>Sebastian Crowe's Guide to Drakkenheim</em> is a sourcebook for creating player characters and adventures in the world of Drakkenheim. Written for players and Game Masters alike, this book offers options for characters and adventures compatible with any Fifth Edition game, whether you're running the<em> Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> campaign, another fantasy setting, or are adapting this material to your own world.</p>\n<p>You'll need a copy of the Core Rules for Fifth Edition to properly use this book. When reading this book, text in<strong> bold</strong> usually references a creature or nonplayer character stat block, while text in<em> italics</em> often indicates spells or magic items. Many new monsters, items, and spells are described in sections of this book, otherwise, consult the Fifth Edition core rules. Where a spell name has an asterisk (*) preceding it, this indicates that the spell is original to this book and can be found in the Magic of Drakkenheim chapter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">What You'll Find Within</h2>\n<p><strong>Continental Gazetteer</strong>. This section of the book explores the wider world around Drakkenheim. It expands on the lore, people, history, characters, and locations found in Westemär, Caspia, and Elyria — a continent gripped by political intrigue and conflict between mages, nobility, and priests.</p>\n<p><strong>Drakkenheim Characters.</strong> This chapter features a complete guide to creating player characters ready to embark on adventures in the world of Drakkenheim. It features new subclasses for each core class presented in the Core Rules, special feats which allow characters to wield tools in expanded ways, and introduces the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.j7p6byucC2ywpAJx], an all-new playable class possessing medical expertise and occult magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic of Drakkenheim.</strong> New spells for Apothecaries and core classes, as well as a selection of dangerous and deadly Contaminated Spells, which characters may cast at their peril! In addition, the chapter presents a collection of powerful artifacts central to the setting's story.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Themes of Drakkenheim</h1>\n<p>In the world of Drakkenheim, the personal stories of the player characters are cast against a dark fantasy world of political intrigue and eldritch terror. These core concepts underpin the world of Drakkenheim:</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Delerium</h2>\n<p>The meteor which struck Drakkenheim left behind massive deposits of<strong> delerium</strong>. These iridescent crystals of vast magical potential are found throughout the ruins, but radiate contaminated energies that can induce madness and monstrous transformations. Despite these dangers, delerium is ideally suited to crafting magic items and fueling mighty new spells. Highly sought after by arcanists of all kinds for its otherworldly power, delerium commands a high price within occult circles and underground markets alike. Many prospectors risk everything collecting a few fragments, but the true origins of the strange mineral remain unknown.</p>\n<p>The irradiating energies of vast quantities of delerium produce a magical effect known as the Haze. Characterized by a prismatic fog, the Haze prevents characters from benefiting from a long rest in any area where it manifests, and gradually contaminates any who remain within its environs for longer than a day or so.</p>\n<p><strong>Appendix D: Delerium</strong> covers the crystals in detail.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Content warning</h2>\n      <p>Drakkenheim is a dark fantasy world. We recommend players and Game Masters have an open conversation at the start of the campaign to discuss their lines and veils. In support of this conversation, please note references to the following are common in this setting:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Violence, murder, blood, gore, cannibalism, and body horror</li>\n        <li>Degenerative mutations which cause physical disfigurement and madness/insanity</li>\n        <li>Rats, spiders, insects, demons, undead, ghosts, and other monsters</li>\n        <li>Natural disasters, large-scale loss of life, civil war, displaced persons, refugees</li>\n        <li>Moral ambiguity, social/ political manipulation, religious zealotry, military nationalism</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Explicit sexuality, sexual assault, racial prejudice, systemic racism, homophobia, or transphobia are not topics we want to explore in this world. Any inferences of such are wholly unintentional.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<h3>Horrors Beyond Drakkenheim</h3>\n<p>Since the meteor fell, most foolishly believed the madness and mayhem of the accursed city was confined to the ruins. They were gravely wrong. Delerium crystals are slowly making their way out of Drakkenheim into neighboring towns and distant nations. Whether smuggled in lead-lined chests by successful prospectors, carried downstream by the waters of the Drann River, or absconded from the ruins by a fugitive monster, not every fragment ends up in the hands of those who would use them wisely. Even the smallest shard can cause chaos in a sleepy hamlet. Few commonfolk understand the threat posed by the eldritch crystals, let alone possess the means or skill to combat the ensuing terror.</p>\n<p>While tales of these horrors spread across the continent, rival factions vehemently disagree over whether the crystals should be destroyed, harnessed, or worshiped. These growing divisions threaten outright war.</p>\n<h3>Eldritch Contamination</h3>\n<p>Characters in the world of Drakkenheim will encounter Eldritch Contamination caused by chaotic magic, otherworldly creatures, and the corrupting presence of delerium. Abilities, equipment, and spells that protect against diseases, magic, and poison do not work against contamination. It doesn't heal naturally and can't be removed with low-level spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV].</p>\n<p><strong>Appendix C: Contamination</strong> explains the rules for Eldritch Contamination and the horrific mutations it can cause.</p>\n<p>Many of the new player character options introduced in @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.book.JournalEntry.drakscgd03chapte], as well as spells included in @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.book.JournalEntry.drakscgd04chapte] offer characters tools to defend and overcome contamination – or wield it against their foes.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Contaminated Player Options</h2>\n      <p>Contamination is meant to impose a long-term problem for player characters that affects their choices between long rests, adventures, and during their downtime. The player character options in this book have been designed and balanced with this in mind. They reward characters with great power<em> now</em>, if they are willing to assume the deadly risk of Contamination in the future. Characters must consider carefully whether gaining a Contamination level willingly to cast a Contaminated spell is worth the risk as they might face a monster with powerful contamination abilities of their own.</p>\n      <p>The new Contaminated Spells and the Malfeasant wizard, Circle of Contamination druid, Haze Rager barbarian, and the Delerium Soul sorcerer may be too powerful when used in one-shot adventures, short-term campaigns, or adventures set outside the world of Drakkenheim where characters will not themselves face the threat of contamination on a regular basis. In such cases, we recommend Game Masters consider carefully the balance of their campaigns before permitting player characters to utilize these options.</p>\n      <p>In addition, if you're running the Dungeons of Drakkenheim campaign, Game Masters may require player characters adopt these subclasses only after completing a personal quest or in response to a dramatic discovery. In such cases, the character must advance first using a different subclass, then retrain their subclass to one of these contaminated options after an appropriate moment in the campaign.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Realms in Conflict</h2>\n<p>The destruction of Drakkenheim fifteen years ago has thrown the world into chaos, but the seeds of conflict have long been sown.</p>\n<p>The people who inhabit the world of Drakkenheim are filled with foibles and flaws. The squabbling nobility of the continent ceaselessly scheme to increase their power, wealth, and influence. Many aim to position themselves to take the throne of their nations, and their monarchs have imperial ambitions of their own. The tools of their political maneuvering include alliances sealed with marriages, threats of military power, economic superiority, defamation, slander, subtlety, and assassination.</p>\n<p>As a result, the political order of the continent rests upon a bed of unstable alliances, festering feuds, bitter rivalries, and old grudges. Peace endures for brief periods only because of clumsily negotiated treaties backed up by the threat of armed retaliation, or because the belligerents need time to lick their wounds, rebuild their armies, and refill their coffers.</p>\n<p>People don't always act in logical ways, and several historical disasters have been caused by bad choices. Those in power are rarely able to set aside their differences and work together, even in the face of a mutual threat. Many have fundamental differences in their moral outlooks and competing visions for the way the world ought to be. However, in most cases, they simply do not want to share power with others. In the desperate situations where these groups must work together to survive, they jockey to come out on top over their rivals after the threat has passed, or find a way to create a lasting advantage from the crisis.</p>\n<h3>Westemär</h3>\n<p>Westemär is at the forefront of the current conflicts, as Drakkenheim was its imperial capital. When the city was destroyed, King Ulrich IV and his immediate heirs were lost. They are presumed dead, but their ultimate fate is unknown. Festering divisions between the king's two surviving siblings plunged the nation into a ten-year-long civil war. In a cruel twist of fate, the war led to the deaths of both the king's siblings and their heirs. Today, the political order of Westemär lies in tatters. Lacking any clear claimant to the throne, nobles ruling its duchies and cities are quickly posturing to form their own petty kingdoms — or make a bid for the throne themselves.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the city of Drakkenheim is a desolate urban ruin, haunted by all manner of eldritch abominations, undead monstrosities, and otherworldly demons.</p>\n<h3>Elyria</h3>\n<p>Nourished by the fertile valleys along the Vita River, the Elyrian peninsula was the cradle of human civilization on the continent. During antiquity, the tyrannical sorcerer-kings ruled the blood-soaked Arcane Empire from these lands, and dominated the other people and nations of the continent with their magical supremacy. The fires of a new religion inspired the population to throw off the yoke of their oppressive rulers, marking the beginning of the modern era, which saw the land's redemption and resurrection as the nation of Elyria.</p>\n<p>Today, Elyria is the heartland to the Faith of the Sacred Flame. After its monarchy dissolved a century ago, it is now under the de facto authority of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5], the leader of the faith. As the religion itself holds influence throughout the continent, today Elyria projects power far beyond its borders, influencing other nations both through the military might of its knightly orders and through the counsel and urging of many Flamekeepers.</p>\n<h3>Caspia</h3>\n<p>The proud nation of Caspia is made up of six rival houses all descending from the great founder Rex Caspian. They host the most impressive warriors and monster slayers in the continent and have constant contests and rivalries over which of the houses is the strongest. They are a nation built on wars, victories, and blood; Caspians care more about battles and trophies than they do magic or religion.</p>\n<p>Despite being a bickering nation of bitter rivalries, and petty wars amongst themselves, they have a reputation for coming together when greater threats linger on their borders, and no nation has ever successfully invaded or defeated the Caspians.</p>\n<p>Caspia elects its High King based on a contest and vote every ten years. Known as the Kingsmoot, this contest sees each of the six great houses put forward their greatest triumphs, victories, and trophies in hopes of winning their seat as the ruler of Caspia for the next decade.<strong> Venus Joplin II</strong> has held this position for the last three decades and has positioned herself as the longest running High King the nation has ever seen.</p>\n<h3>Edicts of Lumen</h3>\n<p>The nations of the continent are party to the Edicts of Lumen, a landmark treaty signed after decades of bloody conflict. The agreement establishes the balance of power between noble rulers, the clergy of the Sacred Flame, and the arcane spellcasters of the Amethyst Academy. Under the Edicts of Lumen, arcane spellcasters are barred from holding noble titles. The Edicts of Lumen do not outlaw magic, but do restrict who can teach magic and provide magical services.</p>\n<p>The Edicts of Lumen maintain peace and stability in the continent by reflecting the shared political will of all those party to it, but the voluminous document has many flaws, oversights, and loopholes. Many try to work around or flout its restrictions without triggering another catastrophic war. Recent disasters have tested the Edicts of Lumen, however, and they may not hold conflict at bay much longer.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Factions of Drakkenheim</h2>\n      <p>Five factions clash over the ruins of Drakkenheim, each vying for control over the ruins and the delerium found there. Their agents are regularly encountered in the world at large seeking to recruit new heroes to join their cause and additional resources to aid their embattled forces in the fallen capital.</p>\n      <h3>Hooded Lanterns</h3>\n      <p>Formally known as the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, the Hooded Lanterns are an irregular military drawn up from veterans of the Civil War and remnants of the old Drakkenheim City Watch. Led by the dour<strong> Lord Commander Elias Drexel</strong>, they wage a guerrilla war against the monsters, bandits, and scavengers who have taken root in their nation's capital. Each has pledged their swords, hearts, and lives to restore their home and rebuild the Realm of Westemär.</p>\n      <h3>Queen's Men</h3>\n      <p>The Queen's Men are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands, outlaws, and scoundrels, all who swear fealty to the enigmatic<strong> Queen of Thieves</strong>. These reprobates prey upon the pilgrims, prospectors, and explorers drawn to the city, extort and rob adventurers, smuggle delerium to disreputable clients in distant lands, and plunder the fantastic treasures and incredible wealth left behind in the city. The Queen of Thieves dreams of building an influential and powerful criminal empire forged in the anarchy and lawlessness of the ruins, and sabotages the other factions at every turn.</p>\n      <h3>Silver Order</h3>\n      <p>The Knights of the Silver Order are a regiment of paladins and righteous knights oath-bound to combat supernatural evil, dark magic, and otherworldly incursions. Founded in the nation of Elyria, the order adheres to the traditional religion of the Sacred Flame, but operates throughout the world in small bands of questing knights dispatched on holy missions. However, the order has recently assembled en-masse, deploying an entire company of warriors to the ruins of Drakkenheim. They are tasked with destroying the unholy magic that has taken root there.</p>\n      <h3>Followers of the Falling Fire</h3>\n      <p>The Followers of the Falling Fire are a breakaway sect of the Sacred Flame who believe the meteor signaled a celestial prophecy. They believe delerium are sacred stones that will prepare the faithful to meet a greater darkness yet to come. The prescient augur<strong> Lucretia Mathias</strong> has inspired masses of devout common-folk to embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to the crater's edge in Drakkenheim, where they might take their place in a divine plan. Although their faith is based in the teachings of the Sacred Flame, they have been branded mad heretics by the mainstream clergy for their blasphemous worship of delerium.</p>\n      <h3>Amethyst Academy</h3>\n      <p>The Amethyst Academy is a magical school for sorcerers and wizards. The Academy's students learn magic in remote castles and secluded universities, directed by a shadowy cabal of powerful archmages. The Academy also operates an enterprising mage guild that controls the manufacture of magical wares and orchestrates an influential arcane syndicate that provides occult counsel to the nobility of the continent.</p>\n      <p>By law, the Amethyst Academy takes guardianship over any children born on the continent who display magical ability, whether they are a royal heir or commoner. They instruct these young magelings in magic, and through disciplined education most become wizards. A child who bristles against Academy training — or who by chance was not taken in by the Academy and develops their own magic without scholarly instruction — typically becomes a sorcerer.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Mysterious Magic</h2>\n<p>Chaotic otherworldly forces underpin the cosmos in the World of Drakkenheim. The true nature of magic is only dimly understood by its mortal inhabitants, and spellcasters among them are exceptionally rare. Barely one in every thousand people can cast spells, and of these, the majority only master cantrips and first-level spells in their entire lifetimes.</p>\n<p>Everyday people aren't used to monsters, and they don't understand magic. Monsters exist, but the common folk tremble at their sight. Planar cosmology is mysterious and unknowable, but sages have still developed many conflicting (and wildly incorrect) theories.</p>\n<h3>Mageborn</h3>\n<p>The arcane magic of sorcerers and wizards draws upon otherworldly planar energies. The ability to tap into these forces is reliant on a recessive genetic trait in mortals; these individuals are called mageborn. Mageborn parents often pass their magical gift on to their offspring, but not always. The genes can lie dormant for generations, or emerge unexpectedly in a family with no magical history. Signs a person is mageborn typically begin in early childhood as random displays of wild magic, and spellcasting ability manifests fully during puberty. There are several recorded cases where the trait did not develop until adulthood, but such individuals are rare curiosities indeed.</p>\n<p>In the world of Drakkenheim, the primary difference between a sorcerer and a wizard comes from their education and training; the origin of their powers is the same. Mortals who lack the mageborn gene cannot become sorcerers or wizards under any circumstances.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Other Magic Users</h2>\n      <p>Warlocks gain their magic from a pact with an otherworldly patron, but fickle fey, diabolical fiends, and tyrannical dragons do not dole out their power to just anyone. Nevertheless, this is one of the only ways a non-mageborn person can wield powerful arcane magic. Although warlocks are not necessarily mageborn themselves, a warlock will always sire mageborn children. Taking up an eldritch pact infuses their body with a subtle arcane taint which manifests in their descendants, occasionally resulting in children visibly marked by extraplanar influences, such as tieflings. On the other hand, sometimes sorcerers and wizards do not pass their magical gift to their own offspring. In such cases, their progeny may seek an eldritch pact to reclaim their magical birthright.</p>\n      <p>No one quite knows by what means bards work their musical magic. Amongst arcane spellcasters, their magic is the rarest and most mysterious.<br />Apothecaries blend scientific and occult knowledge to create magical effects, and need not themselves be mageborn</p>\n      <p>There are many other magical techniques, some of which allow characters to cast a small smattering of cantrips and spells, represented by rangers, or subclasses and feats that grant spellcasting features. These characters are not usually mageborn, because their magic relies on using material components and know-how to activate latent magic already present in the environment around them, rather than drawing on a connection to extraplanar energy. Mages typically view such individuals as dabblers.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Distant Gods</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/150-pg10-rosarie-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/150-pg10-rosarie-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>In the world of Drakkenheim, the gods are silent and distant. Gods do not manifest physically nor speak with worshipers, and do not interfere in earthly matters. Rather than follow a pantheon of gods who communicate clearly with their worshipers, prophets and priests have established the world's religions based on interpretations of divine forces, signs, and omens. Alignment, cosmology, and religion are nebulous concepts, and in Drakkenheim, prophecies fail as often as they are fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Divine spellcasting powers are not granted by gods directly. Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins learn to cast spells by channeling the supernatural forces of light and shadow which underscore the cosmos. In theory, divine spellcasting is attainable by anyone, but in practice only exceptionally gifted individuals master even the lowest-level divine spells. Many view divine spellcasting as a disciplined and sacred technique attainable only by those with sufficient will and devotion, and only after years of meditation and training. Its practitioners are not considered mageborn.</p>\n<p>Violating one's religious tenets does not cause a cleric, druid, or paladin to lose their powers. However, a personal crisis of faith brought on by some discordant change in behavior and morality could cause an individual to lose their divine spellcasting powers. More often, a cleric, druid, or paladin who commits grave transgressions against their gods is shunned, excommunicated, and made to face retribution from other members of their faith.</p>\n<h3>Faith of the Sacred Flame</h3>\n<p>Across the continent, a single faith has emerged as the dominant religion: the Faith of the Sacred Flame. The tenets of the religion speak a message of truth and justice inspired by the righteous sacrifice of a noble paladin. The leader of the Faith is the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5], who keeps Saint Tarna's Cathedral in the Holy City of Lumen.</p>\n<h3>Old Gods and Primal Magic</h3>\n<p>The magic of druids is sometimes referred to as primal magic due to its connection to nature, earth, life, and death. However, the gods of the Old Faiths are said to represent such forces, and many druids are worshipers of these ancient deities. Thus, primal magic can be considered a form of divine magic. Even certain warlocks might consider their magic primal depending on their otherworldly patrons.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/0023-book-dungeonsofdrakkenheimlogo-wip-mb-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n      <p>This book expands the world originally presented in our adventure<em> Dungeons of Drakkenheim.</em> If you own a copy of that book and are planning to run the campaign, you'll find a wealth of information herein to broaden the scope of the campaign, taking the conflict beyond the walls of Drakkenheim.</p>\n      <p><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> is confined to the city of Drakkenheim itself, and covers the factions, conflicts, and locations within that city in detail.

Once dominated by the Arcane Empire, these lands are now made up of several independent nations. Joined by shared history, faith, trade, and treaty, these realms can be staunch allies, but are just as often bitter foes.</p>\n<p>The world of Drakkenheim does not have a name: its inhabitants simply call it “the world” or “the earth”. In turn, the continent itself does not have a name, and is simply known as “the continent.” In everyday conversation, most people talk about the continent as a divided place of different realms.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History of the Continent</h1>\n<p>The pre-history of this world is lost, and even the early days of history are more myth and legend than matters of fact. Mortals don't really know where they originated, and various cultures and religions have wildly different stories explaining the creation of the world. The Faith of the Sacred Flame teaches the world arose from the separation of light and shadow, and the destiny of all mortals is to be the light in a world of darkness. The ancient beliefs of the Old Faith tell tales of a feuding family of primeval deities who shaped the world and sowed the seeds of life. Esoteric mages who study the cosmos speculate the world is the product of chaotic clockwork, illusions made real, or other strange theories.</p>\n<p>The events recorded here should be regarded as the predominant narrative amongst historians within the setting, and not necessarily the full and complete truth. While many may speak with personal certainty about past events, such tales are always told differently depending on the speaker's point of view. Details may be omitted intentionally or by accident, or even just lost to time. Even ancient and immortal creatures such as dragons and fiends respond evasively when asked about mortal origins, offering capricious conjecture and vague explanations at best.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, these great events have defined the politics, conflicts, and culture of the continent today.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Origins of Magic</h2>\n<p>Since the earliest days remembered to history, a few rare individuals have been born with the power to work arcane magic. Legends say that magic came to mortals through a primordial pact with eldritch entities now forgotten in a time long before the great civilizations of the world. The ancient warlocks were tainted by their arcane covenants; their offspring were exceptionally likely to manifest sorcerous talents. They too in turn passed their magical powers down to their children. However, such inborn magic did not come with the pact-sealed control of the original warlocks. When the inscrutable beings that whispered the first secrets of magic fell mysteriously silent, magic became a wild and untamable force as successive generations of sorcerers were born with otherworldly and chaotic powers. Most struggled to control their abilities, causing magic to be met with fear, superstition, and awe.</p>\n<p>Over time, a few determined sorcerers sought novel ways to stabilize their magic. Fearing themselves a danger to their own communities, these spellcasters exiled themselves into the wilderness. Some traveled high into the mountains, others deep into the forests, and a few wandered the deserts and tundras. These early sorcerers forged a deep bond with nature</p>\n<p>by tapping into the energies of faerie realms and elemental planes, and by seeking the wisdom of the Old Gods. As they eschewed their arcane magic, they came to understand the first secrets of druidic magic. To this day, however, the druids guard their secrets carefully. The first practitioners of druidic magic discovered that even those without the inborn gifts of magic could harness the elements, although mastering them demands a formidable spiritual will nurtured through years of training.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Rise of the Sorcerer-Kings</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, other mageborn observed that not only were their sorcerous abilities passed down to their children, the spells they could cast were as well. These resourceful mageborn families craved greater power, and so sought out advantageous pairings. Great dynasties emerged with scions who could cast spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.7u2obDvuvtZBkTfq], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0], and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.X3DrXgxjwI2dvkD6], while another emerged with powers such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.IyikgTEOTv701jgQ], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ew6GA8dJy2spQmFW], and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.QbTxN5dWIbYZ4jLU]. Nevertheless, this was an imperfect process, and most sorcerers were still vexed by their wild magic.</p>\n<p>Centuries later, in the southern shadow of the Drakeclaw Mountains, the leaders of eight sorcerous families found the perfect means to harness the chaotic magic plaguing their households. By joining their lineages with dragons, they learned they could bolster and refine the magic coursing through their blood. While it took several successive generations of careful matchmaking, eventually the inborn arcane power of their offspring was utterly unmatched. Children were born bristling with crackling energy and magical flames, and by puberty could weave spells that their great-grandparents could barely muster after a lifetime of experience. Some could compel a legion of soldiers to obey their will with a mere whisper, while others could render armies into ashes in an instant.</p>\n<p>These impudent and rash youths saw no reason for patience or discipline when their ancestry had bestowed them with such innate mastery, and seized the reins of power from their forebears. The foremost among these mighty spellcasters set about conquering the continent with destructive magical wars which scarred the land. Since arcane magical abilities are an inheritable genetic trait, these new mage-lords and their favored thralls passed down both political and magical power to their heirs. The Arcane Empire was born.</p>\n<p>While history calls the masters of the Arcane Empire the sorcerer-kings, during their own time, they called themselves gods and ruled over their people accordingly. Fearing that others could rise with powers to rival their own, the sorcerer-kings suppressed the faith of the Old Gods, jealously hoarded arcane lore, and demanded other spellcasters submit to them as vassals. They treated those without arcane power as little more than serfs and chattel. In time, they turned to darker pacts with fiendish beings to maintain their grip on power. Many powerful magical artifacts in the world were forged and great monuments rose as terrible tyrants built their wicked empire with blood and magic.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Fall of the Sorcerer-Kings</h2>\n<p>During the darkest days of the Arcane Empire, a warlord in service to the sorcerer-kings turned against their wicked ways. Called to righteousness by heavenly angels, Saint Tarna became the First Paladin. She slew Sorcerer-King Ulban V and warred for twelve years against his heir, Xandor XIII. She ultimately gave her life to defeat his demonic army. Although Xandor's successor, Calstryx VII, tortured and executed many of Saint Tarna's followers, they could not suppress her holy teachings. The clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame spread a new religion of hope and light to long-oppressed people crying out for freedom and justice.</p>\n<p>While the reign of the sorcerer-kings did not immediately end with Saint Tarna's campaign, her deeds ushered in the decline of the Arcane Empire. Indeed, the sorcerer-kings had become decadent and indulgent despots after centuries of magic-fueled inbreeding. Over three hundred years of rebellion, unrest, and conflict, territories once held firmly in the sorcerer-kings' grip seceded from their empire and won their hard-fought independence. The Nightmare City of Nox fell to the Faith of the Sacred Flame and was reborn as the Holy City of Lumen, and the last of the sorcerer-kings fled the continent for distant lands.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Mage Hunts</h2>\n<p>When the iron rule of the sorcerer-kings ended, those born with arcane magical ability faced intense discrimination from the now-widespread Faith of the Sacred Flame. Even today, arcane magic is often viewed as a capricious menace, and many common folk consider a mageborn child a terrible curse. Still, several noble houses maintained the legacy of their estates and bloodlines from the time of the sorcerer-kings. These noble houses used their magic to advance themselves politically, economically, and socially, much to the ire of their religious subjects.</p>\n<p>During the late fourth century, Divine Matriarch Mercy I endorsed a series of brutal pogroms against mageborn, proclaiming that such measures were necessary to ensure the Arcane Empire would never return. Noble and common families alike were driven out of their homes, their properties and lands seized, and parents even murdered their own children upon discovering their offspring's magical abilities.</p>\n<p>In response, an underground organization of sorcerers formed to rescue young mageborn from their hostile communities. Precursors to the modern Amethyst Academy, these mages worked from hidden strongholds and secret schools to safeguard other mageborn and protect the knowledge of arcane magic.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Edicts of Lumen</h2>\n<p>Over time, the Amethyst Academy secured allies amongst the nobility by providing them clandestine magical services and occult counsel, crafting enchanted heirlooms, protecting their castles with arcane wards, and teaching their heirs magic. When the Faith of the Sacred Flame discovered these schemes, a renewed series of vicious inquisitions and vengeful witch-hunts began. Divine Matriarch Justice VII anointed the Knights of the Silver Order specifically to hunt down the Amethyst Academy and their leaders. What had been a shadow conflict between paladins and sorcerers for centuries spilled into outright war between noble houses who championed the Faith, and those which supported the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<p>Four decades of bloody conflict ended with the Edicts of Lumen. Enacted three hundred years ago, this landmark treaty stopped the murderous suppression of arcane magic by the religious ministry. The agreement established the new balance of power between mages, the Faith, and the nobility throughout the continent which remains to this day.</p>\n<section class=\"sidebar-table-wrapper roll-table-wrapper\" style=\"padding:25px\">\n  <h2>Historical Timeline</h2>\n  <table class=\"timeline\" data-title=\"Historical Timeline\">\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Circa - 10,000</td>\n        <td><p class=\"chart\">A great winter grips the world.

Myths and legends passed down from distant eons past tell such tales, but such events have not occurred in recorded history. Instead, the inspired words of prophets, oracles, mystics, and heroes laid the foundations for the world's many religions. Today, those faiths form the foundation for the culture and customs found throughout the continent.</p>\n<p>Powerful extraplanar entities such as archangels, demon lords, and outsiders do exist, but only occasionally interact with mortals. They meddle in earthly matters by making magical pacts, sharing arcane knowledge, and offering dark counsel, but rarely reveal their true motives or origins. Some even claim to be gods. When asked questions regarding the true nature of the cosmos or divinity, however, angels and demons alike speak in cryptic riddles.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Faith of the Sacred Flame</h1>\n<p>“The Faith” is the dominant religion throughout the continent. Most humans are adherents to the Faith or were raised within its influence, though how strongly they hold their convictions varies greatly. Also known as the Divine Light, its teachings and beliefs are tightly woven into the social and political fabric of Caspia, Elyria, Westemär, and their neighboring domains.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Background</h2>\n<p>Myths about the Sacred Flame have ancient roots, but the contemporary religion began a thousand years ago with the valiant Saint Tarna. Today, the story of Saint Tarna is told and retold through religious texts, poetry, songs, and depicted in statues and paintings. Everyone living in the continent has heard some version of the tale.</p>\n<p>During the twilight of the Arcane Empire, a wicked woman known as Tarna the Terror served Sorcerer-King Ulban V. Although most of her life she was a vicious warlord and dark champion who led brutal wars and indulged in wanton vices, a glimmer of light flickered within her dark heart. She slew Ulban rather than carry out his genocidal will though she knew it would mean her own life. Ulban's heir, Xandor XIII, banished her to the pits of the Dungeons of Nox to fight and die against his monstrous pets for his entertainment. Though grievously wounded several times over, none of Xandor's monstrosities could slay Tarna, and she escaped his dungeon.</p>\n<p>Tarna fled south, seeking refuge in the Witherbleach Desert. There she believed the hidden ancient druids of the Old Gods might tend her injuries. She searched for days and nights for them to no avail. Finally, as she lay dying upon the cracked and dry earth, Tarna saw a golden comet streaking through the night sky. Emboldened by faith, she pressed on in spite of her wounds. She followed the comet to a sacred place deep in the Pale Tooth Mountains. There, she met the archangels Gabriella and Michael, who healed her body and shared with her many sacred truths. The Angels told her that she had been chosen, and that despite the darkness she had spread through the world, she would be reborn as an instrument of the Sacred Flame. In her, all mortals would know that light may still shine through the darkest night, and that no one is beyond redemption. Swearing a sacred oath to tear down darkness and injustice before the angels, she was imbued with the Divine Light of the Sacred Flame. That night, she became the First Paladin.</p>\n<p>Taking up the mantle of warlord once more, but this time for the cause of righteousness, Tarna fought for twelve years against Sorcerer-King Xandor XIII. She taught others to wield the Divine Light, and they became paladins and clerics in turn. Eventually, Tarna gave her life to defeat an arch-demon summoned by Xandor XIII. Her catastrophic sacrifice set forth a burst of holy power which banished the demon and the Spire of Nox along with it.</p>\n<p>After Tarna's death, one of her esoteric followers known only to history as the Mystic Theurge penned the<em> Song of Fire,</em> the first holy text of a new religion. Meanwhile, the sorcerer-kings tried to suppress the burgeoning faith the First Paladin inspired, but met their match in the divine might of the new clerics, monks, and paladins of the Sacred Flame. Preaching a message of hope, redemption, and justice for the oppressed, the Sacred Flame set alight a wave of rebellions and revolutions which dispelled the darkness of the Arcane Empire.</p>\n<p>The faith spread like wildfire to all corners of the continent. As the empire fractured into disparate realms around the third century, the burgeoning faith began to organize into a formal religion. The first Divine Matriarch was chosen to lead the Flamekeepers. These women would be the custodians of Tarna's legacy, charged with leading the faithful for generations to come. The clergy laid its roots in the City of Nox, transforming the wretched metropolis into Lumen, City of Light, the holy capital of the Sacred Flame. Today, faith in the Sacred Flame unites the great nations of the continent.</p>\n<h3>Beliefs and Tenets</h3>\n<p>Faithful of the Sacred Flame do not worship a god; devotees pray for guidance from a transcendent divine force which they believe is the source of all light and goodness. Symbolized as the Sacred Flame, this brilliant beacon inspires mortals to act with benevolence, honor, and righteousness. The religion brings a message of dutiful hope: even the smallest flame may light the way through the darkest night. The core tenets of the religion are conceptualized as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The Hearth</strong> spreads compassion. One must nourish the hungry, offer shelter from the cold, and give succor to those who suffer. Spiritual warmth glows brightly when the community is gathered together before the Flame as neighbors.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Lantern</strong> illuminates the way of truth. The light reveals what is hidden by darkness, and shows the way to understanding. One should not silence truth, nor speak falsehoods.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Torch</strong> displays the duty of all faithful to uphold the cause of justice. One cannot abide when evil stirs, nor stand idle when corruption spreads: callousness and indifference permit selfishness, greed, and hate to multiply.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Candle</strong> symbolizes hope and redemption. Show those who are in darkness the light. Offer mercy to the guilty; no shadow is absolute so long as a flickering flame remains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Followers of the Sacred Flame believe that the universe emerged through the separation of light and shadow in equal measure, out of which came the elements which formed the world. They teach that mortals struggle to be righteous because they are incomplete beings of light and shadow. When mortals die, their souls pass into the Shadowlands and wander until their spirits become whole — either light or shadow. The religion claims the Sacred Flame guides the soul to the place where dawn breaks over the Shadowlands. There, their spirits join the Divine Light. This congregation of brilliant souls is a beacon of hope and compassion for all mortals. Manifest in the sun and stars, the Divine Light drives back the chaos and darkness of the cosmos and allows future life to flourish.</p>\n<p>However, spirits heavy with sin, guilt, regret, and hate do not follow the light. These souls are drawn into the most terrible place in the Shadowlands, the Abyss. There, they become demons who spread darkness. As so many mortals have failed to follow the Divine Light, gradually shadows and demons have darkened this world. After all, a roaring flame shines through the night only so long as it has fuel to burn. Nothing is needed for the shadows to reign save the absence of light. The light must be sustained lest the universe fall to shadow unending.</p>\n<p>The faith does not have an open-minded view toward other religions, and teaches that the Old Gods are not divine. Instead, the official doctrine of the faith describes these beings as primeval demons, pointing to the web of associations between these so-called gods, fiendish creatures, and wicked fey. Followers of the Sacred Flame typically believe people who keep the Old Gods are misguided at best, and dangerous cultists at worst.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light sayings-of-the-faith\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Common Sayings of the Faith</h2>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“Flame be with you.”</strong></em>\n        <br />Wishing another a fond farewell and good luck.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“Your flame casts too long a shadow.”</strong></em>\n        <br />Indicates that someone is acting in a self-righteous manner which could hurt others.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“Fire burn it.”</strong></em><br />\n        Vain exclamation expressing anger, surprise, or frustration (used in the same manner as the modern phrase “damn it”)\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“The smallest light burns brightly in the deepest darkness.”</strong></em>\n        <br />A reminder to the faithful that no matter how hopeless the situation has become, small actions and faith can change the world.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“Do not confuse the glimmer of gold for the spark of the Sacred Flame.”</strong></em>\n        <br />A warning to followers of the Sacred Flame to shy away from greed.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light passages song-of-fire\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Passages from the Song of Fire</h2>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">“And so Saint Tarna spoke, raising her blade before the throng ‘Let evil flee before righteousness; let the innocent live in peace. Let the day come when none need fear or live in ignorance. For that day, I give my life gladly.'”</p>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">“We may ignore, but we can nowhere evade, the presence of the Sacred Flame. The world is lighted by it.

She is often shown in battle against demons, sorcerers, and witches, sometimes astride her griffon, Aarak.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Chapels and Holy Sites</h2>\n<p>In Caspia, Elyria, Westemär, and the Eastern Vales, most towns have at least one chapel devoted to the Sacred Flame. Often at the heart of their communities, these domed sanctuaries are built around a hallowed brazier set alight with a golden @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f]. It is considered a grave omen if a chapel's flame goes out.</p>\n<p>Major cathedrals to the Sacred Flame are found in large cities, and many are brilliant architectural wonders in their own right, decorated with painted murals, stained-glass windows, and statues depicting the saints and martyrs. Such buildings house impressive altars with stone basins and use magical oils to fuel their impressive central flames which endlessly burn day and night. In addition to this major cathedral, bigger towns and cities usually have one chapel for every five hundred people who reside there.</p>\n<p>The small shrines in most villages are usually simple bonfire pits decorated with stone slabs. Such shrines are the largest worship buildings found dedicated to the Sacred Flame in the Isles of Skye, Terene, and Netherwind.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Rites and Worship</h2>\n<p>During rites of worship the Faith's believers join hands in a circle around a roaring fire and sing hymns. Flamekeepers and their acolytes lead these gatherings, calling or reciting passages from scripture, and the faithful respond as a chorus. Larger congregations will stand to form several concentric rings around massive bonfires or the great braziers which burn in the chapels and cathedrals of the Sacred Flame. Many rituals are held at sunset, so the sight of a burning fire as the sun sets against the night can remind worshipers of how the Sacred Flame holds darkness at bay. These nightly rituals conclude with worshipers lighting candles or small lanterns from the central brazier as they depart home, which symbolize the hope all must carry within themselves.</p>\n<p>Most worshipers plan a pilgrimage to the Holy City of Lumen at least once in their lives.</p>\n<p>It is custom to cremate the dead. Rather than cemeteries, which are typically rare, the faithful create a crematory garden with scattering plots near most chapels, usually watched over by statues of Saint Tarna and other martyrs. Ashes and bone fragments are gathered and kept in an ossuary beneath a church or cathedral. Skulls are typically preserved so that Flamekeepers may commune with the dead when needed. However, followers of the Sacred Flame believe that the bodies of clerics and paladins should be preserved after their deaths, should the spirits of these noble warriors need their earthly bodies again. As such, many cathedrals and chapels lie atop large catacombs where the remains of these holy figures are kept.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religious Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>The clergy of the Faith of the Sacred Flame is tightly organized:</p>\n<h3>Flamekeepers</h3>\n<p>Ordained priests of the Sacred Flame are known as @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers}. These clerics of the Sacred Flame are predominantly women; they wear flowing vestments of white, yellow, and gold. Flamekeepers take vows of poverty, eschewing all personal possessions and living on the commonwealth of the faith. Most chapels of the Sacred Flame are ministered by a Flamekeeper.</p>\n<p>In the past century, some Flamekeepers have started accepting tithes of coin in exchange for their divine spellcasting services. Ostensibly, the funds are used to support their communities and provide a modest lifestyle for the clergy. However, this matter has become increasingly controversial since Saint Tarna gave her divine blessings freely to any who sought her out in earnest need. Detractors argue the practice makes the ministry no different from the mercantile mages of the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:row\">\n  <div><img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/121-pg19-high-flamekeeper-irma-cmyk.webp\" title=\"High Flamekeeper Irma\" /></div>\n  <div><img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/122-pg19-flamekeeper-cmyk.webp\" title=\"Flamekeeper\" /></div>\n  <div><img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/123-pg19-acolyte-cmyk.webp\" title=\"Acolyte\" /></div>\n</div>\n<h3>High Flamekeeper</h3>\n<p>A High Flamekeeper is appointed to lead congregations in major cities, or train new Flamekeepers in monasteries. Others are assigned to knightly orders, noble houses, and other holy missions of great importance. This rank is only bestowed to devout clerics of the Sacred Flame who can cast spells of 5th level or higher, and who have served as Flamekeepers for at least ten years.</p>\n<p>At any given time, one third of the High Flamekeepers remain in Lumen, forming a group known as the Inner Flame. The Inner Flame is responsible for managing the administrative functions of the church as a whole, and appoints both High Flamekeepers and Flamekeepers to their positions. The positions are constantly shifting in response to the different callings of individual clerics.</p>\n<h3>Acolytes</h3>\n<p>Those with aptitude to cast divine spells may join the clergy a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolytes}. Many gather in remote monasteries to practice and meditate on their divine spellcasting abilities. Once they can master cantrips and 1st-level divine spells, they are sent to assist other Flamekeepers in chapels and cathedrals. Once they demonstrate the ability to cast the spells @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8dzaICjGy6mTUaUr] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f], an acolyte must complete a special test involving a pilgrimage to Lumen and weeks of fasting. Then they rise into the rank of Flamekeeper.</p>\n<h3>Pyre Priests</h3>\n<p>While most Flamekeepers are women, anyone capable of casting divine spells can join the clergy as a Pyre Priest. These ministers may have great influence and renown within the clergy, but can never be nominated to higher office. They serve many important functions as dignitaries, guardians, scribes, and aiding religious rites.</p>\n<h3>Lay Ministry</h3>\n<p>Smaller villages rely on lay ministers to keep their shrines, lead rites and prayers, and teach the faith, but these individuals rarely have actual divine spellcasting powers.</p>\n<h3>Divine Matriarch</h3>\n<p>The highest authority amongst the priesthood of the Sacred Flame is the<strong> Divine Matriarch</strong>, who tends Saint Tarna's Cathedral located within the holy city of<strong> Lumen</strong>.</p>\n<p>The current Divine Matriarch is Mercy V. She has held the position for two decades since the assassination of her predecessor, Courage IX. She is described in detail in the gazetteer entry for Elyria.</p>\n<p>The Divine Matriarch is chosen by the Circle of Flame, a synod consisting of 139 High Flamekeepers drawn from every major city on the continent. Once confirmed by the synod, the Divine Matriarch serves their term for life, and takes up a new name representing one of the virtues of Saint Tarna, such as Justice, Humility, Truth, Charity, or Faith.</p>\n<h3>Clerics of the Sacred Flame</h3>\n<p>Through deep spiritual discipline and steadfast devotion, some faithful may become living vessels for the Sacred Flame. These rare individuals hold the power to channel its light in the earthly realm to work divine magic. As clerics of the Sacred Flame, they become enlightened healers, custodians of truth and knowledge, or fiery beacons of light. However, not every cleric of the Sacred Flame becomes a Flamekeeper or participates in the organization and politics of the religion.</p>\n<h3>Monks of the Sacred Flame</h3>\n<p>Many monasteries have been erected throughout the continent, often close to holy sites, or places of religious importance. Monks who tend to these shrines and monasteries have meditated on the Sacred Flame, acquiring the ability to channel limited divine powers through their body and mind. Although not outright divine spellcasters, the traditions of monks of the Sacred Flame date back to the Arcane Empire, when devoted worshipers who channeled the Flame through martial practice fought against the sorcerer-kings.</p>\n<h3>Paladins of the Sacred Flame</h3>\n<p>Legend claims Saint Tarna was the First Paladin. These warriors hold deep reverence amongst the faithful, as only truly virtuous souls can wield the Sacred Flame as she once did. Paladins of the Sacred Flame swear sacred oaths of devotion, redemption, and vigilance. Inspired by Saint Tarna's example, many join knightly orders ordained for righteous purposes and relinquish any noble titles or land claims. Such companies of holy warriors and their martial retainers embark on quests and crusades to destroy supernatural forces of evil and root out creatures of otherworldly darkness. The most well-known and decorated amongst these militant fellowships are the Knights of the Silver Order.</p>\n<h3>Other Spellcasters and the Faith</h3>\n<p>One of Saint Tarna's foremost disciples was mageborn. Known as the Mystic Theurge, she learned to channel the Divine Light of the Sacred Flame through her arcane magic. The Mystic Theurge wrote the<em> Song of Fire</em>, the holy text of the Sacred Flame which chronicles Tarna's life and deeds. The fact that the Mystic Theurge was mageborn is greatly suppressed within the faith.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Shadow Cults</h2>\n<p>Throughout the ages, various so-called “shadow faiths” and heretical sects have emerged surrounding the Sacred Flame, some of which embrace an opposing force, alternatively called the Darkness or Shadow. These cults develop their own mysteries and esoteric practices. They sometimes devote themselves to worshiping enigmatic god-like beings such as the Phantom Queen, the Night Serpent, the Lord of the Undead, and powerful entities who inhabit the Shadowlands or the Abyss.</p>\n<p>Some of these chthonic entities seek to devour the light and plunge the world into darkness unending. However, not all of these faiths are evil, with practitioners who view shadow and light as part of a necessary balance. Regardless, followers of the Sacred Flame condemn these beliefs, banishing their rites and practices. In the same manner that deep faith and contemplation leads followers of the Sacred Flame to become clerics and paladins, one may also channel the Shadow itself. Clerics are heralds of twilight, trickery, magic, and death, and paladins often invoke dark oaths to vengeful causes or ambitious conquest. Followers of the Shadow Faith may even become warlocks, embracing dark and fiendish patrons.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Falling Fire</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/124-pg20-falling-fire-trinket-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/124-pg20-falling-fire-trinket-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>The Followers of the Falling Fire are a religious sect of the Sacred Flame who believe the meteor that struck Drakkenheim signaled a heavenly prophecy, and consider Delerium a holy sacrament. Called to pilgrimage by the prescient testament of their leader,<strong> Lucretia Mathias</strong>, zealous masses of devout commonfolk now journey to the crater's edge to take their place in a divine plan.</p>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias was once a prominent High Flamekeeper who read omens in the night sky, and was regarded as one of the most learned and wise amongst the clergy. She channeled immense divine power, and invoked miracles which have not been witnessed in a generation. A decade before the meteor destroyed Drakkenheim, she beheld a vision of a falling star which would arrive on earth and signal a great upheaval for the faithful. Despite her reputation, her visions were dismissed as an apocalyptic fantasy and largely suppressed at the time.</p>\n<p>Following the assassination of Divine Matriarch Courage IX twenty years ago, many considered Lucretia Mathias to be her most likely replacement. Already one of the most senior High Flamekeepers at the age of seventy, her appointment seemed inevitable when she was nominated alongside the relatively unknown and much younger Esmeralda Poe. However, Lucretia Mathias lacked any connection to the Elyrian nobility, and her open proclamations and criticisms of them had rendered her extremely unpopular. In an unexpected upset, the Circle of Flame elected Esmeralda Poe, who became @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5], the youngest Flamekeeper to assume the position.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Lucretia Mathias retreated from public life to contemplate the cosmos and await the falling star. Her visions proved true; right down to the hour. However, even Lucretia did not expect the actual destruction the meteor would cause, nor did she anticipate it would strike her birthplace, Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>She spent several years after the meteor struck contemplating the heavens and several strange stones recovered from the city. Her conclusion was dire indeed: the world stands on the precipice of darkness unending. Yet, within delerium, she saw the spark of salvation. Though the stones are the stuff of chaos, black charcoal and midnight oil may fuel a great flame. Perhaps if taken up by righteous souls, the crystals might become an earthly vessel for the Sacred Flame itself. Rather than fall to all-consuming shadows, she prophesied a New Age of Heroes which could meet the coming night. Lucretia spoke widely about her beliefs and discoveries, and her fiery sermons galvanized a throng of loyal supporters who proselytized her new creed across Elyria, Westemär, and Caspia. As her support grew, she resolved to make a pilgrimage to the crater itself to confirm her revelations.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/060-pg20-delerium-trinket-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/060-pg20-delerium-trinket-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Meanwhile, the mainstream clergy reacted to delerium with disgust and horror. When Lucretia returned from her pilgrimage bearing a delerium crystal embedded in her body, Mercy V declared her a heretic. Lucretia was defrocked and excommunicated. However, she refused to be silenced. Escaping Elyria, she expanded her original writings and published them as the<em> Testament of the Falling Fire</em>. This religious essay proclaimed a radical new doctrine for the faith, and called upon all devout believers to make pilgrimage to the Crater in Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>Only a handful of devoted acolytes made the difficult journey at first. The numbers have grown recently, and in the last year, hundreds have traveled to Drakkenheim to heed Lucretia Mathias's call. Those who finish their pilgrimage partake in a controversial rite known as the Sacrament of the Falling Fire. They take refuge in Saint Selina's Abbey, guiding new arrivals to the crater. Meanwhile, they collect delerium. They do so not for greed or power, but a supposed holy purpose, for they regard the strange stones as “sacred charcoal” from which the light of the Sacred Flame may take earthly spark.</p>\n<p>Most Followers of the Falling Fire are devout commoners who have given up their homes and former livelihoods to make pilgrimage to Drakkenheim. Others are former clergy who have broken from the mainstream faith. Lucretia Mathias's proclamations are dramatic, but underscoring her writing is a scathing criticism of the religious ministry itself which promises a return to the core values of the religion. Even before the meteor struck, many faithful in Westemär were developing suspicions and contempt for the Elyrian-dominated priesthood, which they increasingly saw as decadent and dimmed by political ambition.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light passages\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Passages from the Testament of the Falling Fire</h2>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em>“One day soon, we will near the end of our world<br />— an age where great heroes will be needed.

These worshipers' beliefs and practices vary widely based on the tenets of their patron god, but myths often surround the elements, seasons, land, and ancestor worship. Many such beliefs originated with the ancient peoples of the Continent, such as the dwarves. Others are closely connected to mysterious entities who inhabit extraplanar worlds such as Dreamland or the Faerie Otherworlds, and are often kept by the elves.</p>\n<p>The pantheon of the Old Gods forms an interrelated family, yet the stories and myths of the Old Gods make varying claims as to how exactly the gods relate to one another. At least half of the Old Gods claim to be the ones who made the world and all life upon it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Background</h2>\n<p>Legends, myths, and devotion to the Old Gods transcend recorded history. Ancient stories tell of them walking the world, drawing mortals into their schemes and conflicts. The worship of the Old Gods rose to prominence alongside sorcery, as the first druids sought the wisdom of the gods to harness magic.</p>\n<p>However, during the rise of the Arcane Empire, the sorcerer-kings positioned themselves as gods, above the old pantheon. They drove the druids deeper into the wilderness, and expelled temples and shrines to the Old Gods from any city they ruled. During the darkest days under the sorcerer-kings, many commonfolk came to believe the Old Gods had abandoned them for some unknown trespass. Since then, the organized religion of the Sacred Flame has swept the settled lands and cities of the continent. However, there are still a few who remember the old ways.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Beliefs and Tenets</h2>\n<p>Amongst those who keep the Old Faiths, the exact nature of their beliefs and tenets vary based on the gods they follow. Indeed, the notion of the “Old Faith” is a moniker given by the Faith of the Sacred Flame, and those who worship the Old Gods do not see themselves as part of a singular religion. Indeed, even two communities worshiping the same Old God might have extremely different rites, practices, and beliefs.</p>\n<p>Regardless, several practices are common among those who keep the Old Gods. Shrines and temples are often built in remote and wild places, among cairn stones, faerie rings, ancient trees, and other natural landmarks. Worshipers often make offerings to the Old Gods, such as a bowl of herbs, bones, or blood. Animal and even human sacrifices are not unheard of, as well as rituals where worshipers mark or scar their bodies. Many times, rituals are performed in accordance with the seasons or celestial movements, such as during an equinox or full moon.</p>\n<p>Followers of the Old Gods do not necessarily believe there is balance in nature, or seek any notion of harmony. Their rites and rituals are appeasements to their gods to spare them from nature's uncaring brutality, and a grim reminder of the animal in every human heart.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religious Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>The Old Gods do not form a tightly organized religion — there is no central authority. Conclaves and communes in remote areas spring up around the worship of one of the Old Gods.</p>\n<p>Tapping into the fundamental forces of the cosmos to work divine powers is a path which requires tremendous will, dedication, and faith, but also knowledge of ancient rites, prayers, and rituals. The followers of the Old Gods take passing down these rites very seriously, and often a cleric, druid, or paladin of the Old Gods has a mentor or instructor. Later in life, such individuals bear the burden of passing on their traditions, and many seek out a young acolyte or apprentice to instruct in their ways.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>“I hear Druids live in the desert. Sounds<br />incredibly uncomfortable.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Clerics and Druids</h3>\n<p>Druids were the foremost amongst the priests of the Old Gods. Today, druids are most often associated with Arwyn, Danu, Kromac, Nodens, and occasionally Morrigan. Clerics can be found dedicated to all of the Old Gods.</p>\n<h3>Monks</h3>\n<p>Secret shrines and communes devoted to the Old Gods can be found throughout the continent where people come to dedicate their lives to the god. These devoted monks can be found representing just about any of the Old Gods, but the most notable monasteries are ones to Danu, Dian Cheht, Lugh, and Ogham.</p>\n<h3>Paladins</h3>\n<p>Paladins devoted to the Old Gods are exceptionally rare; a paladin devoted to an Old God may know of only one other person who keeps the same oath and traditions as them, likely the person who taught them. Alternatively, a circle of druids may choose a new initiate or warrior to become a paladin to defend their grove as champion.</p>\n<p>Paladins who keep the Old Faiths tend to follow Lugh or Nuada, but paladins dedicated to Dian Cheht and Gaibhne are not unheard of.</p>\n<h3>Warlocks</h3>\n<p>Warlocks are known to take the Old Gods as their otherworldly patrons, especially Arwyn, Morrigan, Ogham, Phantasia, and Shegorach.</p>\n<section class=\"sidebar-table-wrapper roll-table-wrapper\" style=\"padding:25px\">\n  <h2>Old Gods</h2>\n  <table data-title=\"Old Gods\">\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th>Deity</th>\n        <th>Typical Alignments</th>\n        <th>Associated Animals</th>\n        <th>Symbols</th>\n        <th>Weaponry</th>\n        <th>Portfolio</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Arwyn the Moon Hunter</td>\n        <td>CG, CN</td>\n        <td>Stag, deer, faun, elk, moose</td>\n        <td>Crescent moon, stars</td>\n        <td>Spear, longbow</td>\n        <td>Hunting, rangers</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Danu, Mother Earth</td>\n        <td>NG, LN</td>\n        <td>Elephants, cattle, butterflies, doves, bears</td>\n        <td>Cornucopia, bushel of grain, fruits</td>\n        <td>Sickle</td>\n        <td>Natural life, fertility, animals</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Dian Cheht the Healer</td>\n        <td>LG, LN</td>\n        <td>Snakes</td>\n        <td>A rod with a coiled snake</td>\n        <td>Dart, dagger</td>\n        <td>Medicine, healing, poison</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Gaibhne the Smith</td>\n        <td>LN</td>\n        <td>Moles, groundhogs, beavers, gophers</td>\n        <td>Anvils, hammers, volcanoes</td>\n        <td>Warhammer</td>\n        <td>Craft, masonry, stone, earth, forges and smithing</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Kromac the Ravager</td>\n        <td>CN, CE</td>\n        <td>Wolves, lions, boars</td>\n        <td>Fangs, claws, teeth, fur</td>\n        <td>Battleaxe</td>\n        <td>Slaughter, feasting, beasts, monsters</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Lugh the Sun</td>\n        <td>NG, N</td>\n        <td>Eagles</td>\n        <td>The sun, a bonfire</td>\n        <td>Morningstar</td>\n        <td>Agriculture, fields, harvest, community, leadership, fire</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Morrigan the Witch</td>\n        <td>N, LE, NE, CE</td>\n        <td>Ravens, spiders</td>\n        <td>Skulls, spellbooks, pentagrams</td>\n        <td>Flail, whip</td>\n        <td>Fate, death, sorcerous magic, warlocks</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Nodens the Tempest</td>\n        <td>CN, CE</td>\n        <td>Krakens, sharks, dragon turtles</td>\n        <td>Crashing waves, a shipwreck, coral, lightning bolts</td>\n        <td>Trident, spear</td>\n        <td>Storms, sea, water, monsters of the deep</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Nuada the Silver Handed</td>\n        <td>LG, NG, LN</td>\n        <td>Horses, hounds</td>\n        <td>A silver hand, sword, a banner</td>\n        <td>Shortsword, longsword, lance</td>\n        <td>War, justice</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Ogham the Sage</td>\n        <td>LG, LN, LE</td>\n        <td>Owls, foxes</td>\n        <td>Eyes, octagrams, stone tablets</td>\n        <td>Quarterstaff</td>\n        <td>Arcane magic, wizardry, knowledge, science</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Phantasia the Dreamer</td>\n        <td>CG, CN, CE</td>\n        <td>Cats, fireflies, swans, and songbirds</td>\n        <td>Clouds, paintbrushes, harps, bells</td>\n        <td>Shortbow</td>\n        <td>Sleep, dreams, nightmares, imagination, creativity, music, art</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Shegorach the Trickster</td>\n        <td>CG, CN, CE</td>\n        <td>Racoons, rats, and rabbits</td>\n        <td>Dice, bones, masks, diamonds</td>\n        <td>Mace (a jester's stick)</td>\n        <td>Mischief, luck, deception, mockery, laughter, revelry, wine</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</section>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Arwyn the Moon Hunter</h2>\n<p>Arwyn stalks the fey realms and edges of dreams, hunting monsters and nightmares. She is the sister of Phantasia, the daughter of Danu, and fierce enemy of Kromac. She is often depicted as a woman carrying a longbow with legs like a faun and silvery antlers. In most artwork she is surrounded by stars and the moon. Her eyes appear as starry pools of night and her bow is said to fire pure starlight. They sometimes call the moon the Eye of Arwyn.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Many who worship Arwyn adorn their heads with crowns of antlers and paint their faces with deer's blood. Places of worship tend to be found in wooded groves and are often seeded with plants that attract deer and stags. Oftentimes carvings of moons and stars can be found upon shrines to Arwyn, and worshipers attend midnight gatherings on nights lit by the full moon.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>A common ritual for Arwyn's faithful is to slay a deer on the eve of the spring solstice. Practitioners will feast on the meat of the deer, create garments from its pelt, and splash its blood upon a holy site. This is meant to bring good hunts and safe travels for hunters through the remainder of the year. A superstition is that no hunter should attempt to hunt under the new moon, as Arwyn slumbers during this time, and it is bad luck to hunt without her watchful eye.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Danu, Mother Earth</h2>\n<p>Adherents of the Old Gods believe that all life sprang from her creation, though varying myths attribute Gaibhne, Lugh, Nodens, and Kromac as both her consorts and children. Danu is sometimes depicted as a being with the face of an elephant, four arms, each clutching one of the elements, and large butterfly-like wings. Some depictions differ and instead show this god as having a face similar to a cow or even depicted as a motherly bear. Many believe the planet is Danu in her true form, and that the center of the earth is her glowing heart that warms all things.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>The worship of Danu often surrounds harvests, birthdays, marriages, and family gatherings. Shrines to Danu are often found in places with flourishing edible plant life, such as fruits, grains, corn, nuts, and legumes. Other shrines boast impressive gardens filled with all manner of fragrant flowers to attract the butterflies sacred to Danu. Even hardworking farmers who follow the Sacred Flame might have a small token or keepsake of Danu as a good luck charm.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>At the changing of the season, worshipers of Danu conduct a seance in the fields of their community. They bring flowers which represent the season and pray for prosperity. Often communities will gather on the edge of their farms and gardens, and hold the changing of seasons as a collective event. It is common for midwives to recite poems and chants to Danu during childbirth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Dian Cheht the Healer</h2>\n<p>Dian Cheht is usually depicted as a serpent-headed figure. Other appearances depict more human elements with only an ophidian nose and eyes. A few show a full snake-like head upon a human body. Some simply represent the god as a serpent formed in a circle eating its own tail which represents the endless cycle of life and death.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>A few notable apothecaries on the continent pay tribute to Dian Cheht for guidance in their practices. Dian Cheht's druids often practice healing magic, and have been well known to help those in need. A druid of Dian Cheht is easily identifiable; more often than not they keep snakes as pets, often coiled around them everywhere they go.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>Rituals invoking Dian Cheht often involve invocations performed when healing another. However, the rituals of Dian Cheht are no mere superstitions, but rather sound practices couched in mysticism.</p>\n<p>The ritual most commonly associated with Dian Cheht occurs when a family member or close friend has fallen ill. Loved ones of the sick or wounded fast for two days, then drink an ounce of snake blood to tap into the wisdom of the Old God.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Gaibhne the Smith</h2>\n<p>Many dwarven legends claim the dwarves were fashioned in the forge of the deep earth by Gaibhne in the primordial days of the earth itself. Aided by the dwarves and giants he meticulously crafted, Gaibhne is also the mason who laid the very foundations of the earth itself. His followers say it was a wedding gift to Danu, so she might pour her heart into it and fill it with life. Myths surrounding the two gods often position them as mother and father to all life.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Effigies to Gaibhne hang in many blacksmiths' workshops. Even ones who do not worship the Old Gods often have a motif of a beaver or gopher somewhere in their shops. Many smiths believe it is good luck to keep these animals in your view when you are smithing. More devout worshipers have been known to keep beaver tails or gopher pelts on their belts while they work.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>Dwarves have often paid tribute to Gaibhne whenever they enter a mine to offer them safe passage and a prosperous haul. They will sprinkle crushed iron dust on themselves and burn the tip of their left ring finger, showing their devotion to the forge and flame. You can always tell a dwarven worshiper of Gaibhne by the blackened finger on their left hand.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Kromac the Ravager</h2>\n<p>Kromac is the Beastfather and Ravager. He brought monsters into the world; lycanthropes are his chosen children. He is fierce enemies with Arwyn, as he wishes to take the moon for himself. He is depicted as a giant wolf or sometimes a hybrid wolf-man. In art he is usually depicted bathed in blood, lighted by a silvery full moon. It is believed that each full moon is an offering from the cosmos to Kromac, who slowly devours the moon bite by bite until a new one is formed.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Those who worship Kromac often adorn themselves with animal furs and paint blood on their face whenever heading into battle or setting off on a dangerous task. The animal blood and hides bring them closer to their god. The more animalistic one can be, the closer they are to Kromac.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>Many worshipers hold a seance on the eve of a brutal battle. Warriors who worship the Beastfather often howl at moons or sit around fires growling and imitating beasts while druids splash them with boar or bear blood. The warriors drink blood from the head of the beast or from the skulls of rivals they have slain.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lugh the Sun</h2>\n<p>The light of the world stems from Lugh. Embodied as the sun itself, Lugh and Danu are the sustainers of all life. Some organizations of the old pantheon place Lugh as the head of the gods. He is depicted as either simply the sun itself, or sometimes an otherworldly being of light with six feathered wings and one hundred eyes.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Lugh's faithful often keep shrines atop open hilltops where the sun can easily shine down upon it. Many keep stringed together eagle feathers in their homes and keep symbols of a blazing red sun upon their mantles.</p>\n<p>Worship of Lugh is considered especially blasphemous amongst the Faith of the Sacred Flame, who view the Old God as a perverse personification of light and fire.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>Every year on the longest day, worshipers will dance around their shrines and drink honeyed mead and eat fresh fruits in a joyous celebration of the sun and all it offers. Often, they infuse their drinks with herbs and wild mushrooms and strip themselves of all clothes and belongings and bask in the sun to be one with Lugh.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\"><p>“Magic is similar to worship and rituals in a lot of ways, only ours actually has specific purposes and outcomes, this is all just hearsay and random acts for no reason at all.”</p></blockquote>\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/001-pg-25-12-gods-symbols-cmyk.webp\" class=\"text-center\" />\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Morrigan the Witch</h2>\n<p>Morrigan pulls the strands of fate and measures the length of each mortal life. She is the Crone-Goddess and the Mother-Witch. Sister to Danu, Morrigan wove magic into the fabric of the world itself. She is depicted as a woman with a mane of feathers, raven-like wings sprouting from her back, and her hands are formed into clawed talons. She is often accompanied by ravens. Alternatively, Morrigan is occasionally portrayed as a half-woman, half-spider with many red eyes upon her head and long spindly limbs. The Mother-Witch is sometimes conflated with various demonic and shadowy entities.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Those who worship Morrigan often do so in hopes of prolonging their life, learning occult secrets, and appeasing her desires in exchange for her blessing. Worshipers are superstitious about killing spiders, and instead will welcome the presence of a spider in their home as a protector and guardian. They tend to keep ravens and will wear raven feathers in their hair or on their caps.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>When someone is fearful they have reached the end of their life, or that fate is playing a cruel hand for them, they often cut their palms and spill their blood into a boiling pot filled with raven feathers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Nodens the Tempest</h2>\n<p>Nodens claims all water as his domain. His worshipers insist that it is by his doing that all life came to be, and that Danu is his rightful bride. Nodens controls the seas and weather, and is often depicted as an ancient tentacle-bearded king wearing an eyepatch. He carries a spear or trident and rides upon a fearsome and foul-tempered giant seahorse. Two great gulls perch on his shoulders, one whispering the knowledge of the deep, the other the fate of every sailor.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/031-pg26-shells-for-tempest-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/031-pg26-shells-for-tempest-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Sailors still utter prayers to Nodens lest he send storms to take their ships during their voyages. Sea captains, pirates, sailors, and fishermen often wear a shark's tooth around their neck whenever they set out to sea. They believe the tooth disguises them as a sea-dwelling creature and helps them avoid Nodens' wrath.</p>\n<p>More devout worshipers believe it must be the tooth of a shark you yourself have caught and slain, otherwise Nodens will see through your disguise and sink your ship into the sea. These seafaring folk commonly tattoo krakens or tentacles upon their body in honor of Nodens. Their homes often have seashells or dried starfish as decorations.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>The night before a sailor sets out to the sea, they bathe naked in the waters they plan to sail, allowing the ocean to gain their scent and know them. The sailor will adorn their bedchamber with seashells and other aquatic treasures. Dinner is a small cup of water from the sea and fresh fish, often raw.</p>\n<p>When they arrive safely after a voyage, the sailor must soak their clothes in vinegar for a day to rid it of the sea, and not take any of Nodens' domain with them onto land.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Nuada the Silver-Handed</h2>\n<p>Nuada is a valiant warrior-goddess. She is depicted as a golden-haired figure with large, feathered wings wearing shimmering silver armor. She brandishes a flashing blue blade, and carries a feather-emblazoned shield. She rides a pegasus and leads a host of valkyries into battle against giants, demons, and trolls. Her followers identify angels as members of her warhost.</p>\n<p>Scholars have pointed out the striking similarities between Nuada and Saint Tarna. Indeed, there are heretical claims which suggest Saint Tarna is an entirely mythological figure inspired by tales of Nuada, or even propose the blasphemous idea that the entire Faith of the Sacred Flame is a greatly distorted cult of Nuada.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Many paladins and warriors devoted to the Old Gods worship Nuada and strive to be courageous and ruthless like her. Knights devoted to Nuada often incorporate a pegasus into their heraldry. Often these warriors have a horse or war hound they keep as a pet; the companion is treated as a sacred blessing. Sometimes worshipers have been known to feed their hounds better than they themselves eat, as each of these creatures represents a part of Nuada, and to treat these animals with respect ensures your survival in your battles.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>When one of Nuada's faithful dies in battle, they are placed in a boat with pegasus wings painted on the sides. Their horse or hound, if they survived their companion, is humanely slain in a somber ceremony and placed in the boat alongside them, and their blood used to cover the body of the deceased. They are then sent out towards the setting sun, which is a gate to the Shadowlands. It is believed that there Nuada appears and carries her warrior and their trusted animal into the next life.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Ogham the Sage</h2>\n<p>Some speculate the first warlock pacts were made to Ogham, who granted them otherworldly powers of the cosmos. As the keeper of all secrets and god of knowledge, Ogham is depicted as a wizened man with a third eye on his forehead and an endless beard, woven with clay braids counting every event that has ever occurred. Alternatively, he is thought to be a floating eye soaring through space with swirling motes of energy surrounding his alien form, observing all of existence, time, and space at once. Ogham is also sometimes depicted as a hybrid human-owl creature carrying a stack of stone tablets said to contain the ultimate truth of all things.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Ogham's followers believe owls to be good omens; to hear an owl at night is a sign of good luck in the day ahead. Foxes are also a sign of good fortune. It is said that if you ever find a fox in the wild you must follow it, as they are the guides of destiny and knowledge, and where they go is the correct path of your destiny.</p>\n<p>Amongst the mages of the Amethyst Academy, there are a handful who are faithful to Ogham. Wizards devoted to Ogham will often keep owl familiars.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>The most important sacrifice a worshiper of Ogham can make is to put out one of their own eyes. Every priest and druid of Ogham performs this rite, and it is customary for elders to eventually blind themselves so they may see the spiritual world of knowledge more fully.</p>\n<p>Ogham's most zealous followers despise books, viewing them as impermanent and soft repositories of knowledge — they are inappropriate vessels for writing. Instead, they etch records on stone tablets, and raise great stone monoliths to record their learning and legends.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Phantasia the Dreamer</h2>\n<p>Phantasia dreams of all the things that never were. It is said that she knows the desires of every mortal. Rather than knowing all that has happened, Phantasia knows all that could have been, but was not. Phantasia sees all the possibilities laid before each person like an eternal web of choices and consequences.</p>\n<p>She sends dreams to sleepers to fulfill their needs, spur their creativity, or teach them lessons and guide them, but she also sends nightmares to taunt and torment those who have been led astray. She is the ultimate muse, inspiring painters, poets, and musicians to create masterpieces, and bringing invention and innovation to mages, smiths, and apothecaries. It is believed that all major innovations are because of her will and design.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Dreamcatchers are often placed in the windows of worshipers of Phantasia to help draw in good dreams and protect sleepers from nightmares. Sprigs of lavender are placed on windowsills, as the scent is believed to aid the sleeper's spirit in transcending to Dreamland, and also ensures their soul is not lost there during the night. Cats are often kept as pets by worshipers of Phantasia, and worshipers must allow them to sleep upon the bed to ward off nightmares and evil spirits.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>If a worshiper is suffering from nightmares, they must capture a firefly in a jar and place it next to their bed, chew on lavender root, and place the chewed root under their pillow as they sleep. This will ensure the nightmares are warded off by the firefly and absorbed into the root instead. In the morning, after bad dreams have gone, the root is to be planted in the forest or a garden where the bad dreams become new lavender plants.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Shegorach the Trickster</h2>\n<p>Shegorach's worshipers claim that he created life as the greatest joke of all, so that he could be endlessly entertained by mortal suffering and struggles. He is also a god of luck, revelry, and wine. Depictions of this god change depending on where you go and whom you talk to. Some have represented him as a large fat beast with rat-like features, others have depicted him as a grim jester laughing, or a masked entity with many limbs. Shegorach is often equated with He Who Laughs Last, a demonic figure.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/025-pg27-strange-mask-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/025-pg27-strange-mask-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>People who worship Shegorach see signs and omens in the presence of raccoons or rabbits. Whenever one of these creatures crosses the path of a worshiper, they believe Shegorach has brought them good luck. However, having rats in your home is a sign that Shegorach is upset with your deeds and you must appease him by placing coins, some fresh bones, or delectable treats on an altar outside your door.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>A common practice among the Trickster's worshipers is to adorn themselves with strange masks on the eve of autumn's harvest. Some devout have even been known to try to trick others by releasing rats into their homes, and then stealing the coins or food placed out to appease the god.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\"><p>“Okay, you got me. Phantasia seems interesting. But just because I have a firefly in a jar next to my bed, you shouldn't read too much into it.”</p></blockquote>",

While its outward purpose is to instruct young sorcerers and wizards in magic, the Academy is much more than a secluded boarding school for witchcraft and wizardry. The Amethyst Academy operates an enterprising mage guild which controls the manufacture of magical wares, develops new magical practices with cutting-edge experimentation, and orchestrates an influential arcane syndicate. The exclusive syndicate provides magical counsel to the nobility of the continent.</p>\n<p>Every member of the Amethyst Academy is an arcane spellcaster. Considered aloof by the common folk, the mages are extremely influential and tremendously wealthy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Hidden Beginnings</h2>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy began around the 5th century as an underground network to locate children born with magical abilities and protect them from persecution endorsed by the Faith of the Sacred Flame. The mages used divination magic to find children who manifested magical talents, rescued them from their fearful and paranoid communities, and educated them in hidden strongholds and far-away castles so they might wield their abilities with trained and refined control.</p>\n<p>The school gradually grew into a secret society in its own right. Sequestered in unseen universities to hide from the mage-slaying Knights of the Silver Order, the mages pooled their knowledge. They conducted research into arcane and cosmological phenomena, developing what would become the modern practice of wizardry.</p>\n<p>Many founding members of the Amethyst Academy were descended from former vassals of the sorcerer-kings. They preserved the vast magical lore once sequestered for the mighty rulers alone. The sorcerer-kings had been raw talents, who had suppressed the study of magic for fear others would rise against them, preferring to keep power solely in their bloodlines. This knowledge could now be developed and studied within the Amethyst Academy. Other founding members were the elves, who brought their ancient and hitherto unknown arts. Thus, the Amethyst Academy would be the cradle in which the arcane practice of wizardry was born.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Bound by Edict</h2>\n<p>After clandestinely operating for centuries, the Amethyst Academy was formally recognized with the signing of the Edicts of Lumen. The Edicts of Lumen bestow extensive protections, full autonomy, and economic advantages to the Amethyst Academy, but also require the Academy to observe strict standards of mercantile neutrality and political non-intervention.</p>\n<p>Since the Edicts, Academy mages may work magic without fear of oppression from church or state, though the organization remains withdrawn as it increasingly turns its attention to global affairs and extraplanar happenings. While the Amethyst Academy outwardly upholds the Edicts of Lumen, in recent years some have claimed the mages furtively skirt its restrictions and disregard the terms which forbid dark magical practices. Others suspect the mages are weaving an arcane conspiracy to control commerce and influence politics while shielding themselves from the wrath of the Faith of the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magical Education</h2>\n<p>When the Academy determines a child is mageborn, they dispatch their purple-robed emissaries to collect the youth around the age of six. The children become both students and wards of the Academy, whether they are royal heirs or commoners. Typically, the Academy leaves a dowry or grant as compensation to their family. For those of common station, an invitation to join the Amethyst Academy means being brought out of an unremarkable rural life of modest means and stepping into a world of magic, wealth, and prestige. The young sorcerers and wizards are raised within Academy dormitories, trained in magic, and inducted into the Mage Guild once they come of age. They receive a wondrous education unlike anywhere else in the world, learning art, history, mathematics, languages, sciences, and philosophy.</p>\n<p>Until the age of ten, students undergo mental and physical conditioning to help them control and focus their magical abilities. Once they have tamed the wild sorcery that is their birthright, they are schooled in wizardry. The young mages are held to high standards by exacting instructors over the course of a ten-year curriculum.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, some depart after their studies to pursue their own interests, but many more find a place within the Amethyst Academy's hierarchy. Those who navigate the byzantine and competitive organization live a lavish lifestyle surrounded by magical wonders.</p>\n<p>While they may overlook a rustic old hedge-mage teaching their nephew a few cantrips in a remote backwater, the Amethyst Academy goes to great lengths to control magical education. The Academy zealously hoards a vast collection of spellbooks and sequesters arcane magical lore within hidden libraries restricted to only their members. Academy leaders believe others would use magic in a reckless and irresponsible manner given the chance. Though their core mission in the world — the education of young mages — helps ensure new spellcasters develop their skills, it also predisposes students to follow the Academy's ideological principles.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Arcane Enterprise</h2>\n<p>Wealthy nobles and well-connected warlords commission the mages to craft enchanted armaments for their soldiers and arcane wards for their estates. Furthermore, the Academy provides counsel on magical matters. By custom and by treaty, the Amethyst Academy assigns a Master Wizard to serve as court mage to ruling monarchs and high-ranking vassals. The court mages assist the nobility using their magic, while also acting as informants and lobbyists for the Academy's interests.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Covert Actions</h2>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy conducts business with utmost secrecy, especially when dealing with outsiders. They often correspond via magically conveyed messages (using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD] spells) or arrange clandestine meetings (often using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ePhRKHXRE7l1sEoQ] spells). A secret network of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{Teleportation Circles} connect their remote strongholds, each protected by powerful arcane wards. This extensive use of magical teleportation and communication enables the Amethyst Academy to operate in a far-reaching manner unmatched by any other organization, despite the mages' relatively small numbers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Discoveries with Delerium</h2>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy wizards were the first to discover delerium's vast magical potential. Their continued research aims to fully catalog delerium's supernatural qualities and unknown dangers, and further develop methods for crafting magical weapons and arcane machines using the crystals.</p>\n<p>They procure enormous quantities to fuel their esoteric experiments and eldritch industries. Rather than risk their own members' lives in the ruins of Drakkenheim, the Academy usually obtains delerium through various grey market sources. The mages hire mercenaries to carry out specific recovery operations, and only dispatch their own small survey teams to Drakkenheim on rare occasions.</p>\n<p>The trade of delerium is so widespread largely because the crystals are so valuable to the Academy, making delerium crystals a de facto currency.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Secluded Schools</h2>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy is not a singular place. The Academy claims to operate eight magical schools, each a fortress in its own right. A few are well-known places, and their respective entries are found in the following sections of the Gazetteer.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Paradox Castle in the Eastern Vales</li>\n  <li>Enigma Ziggurat in Liberio</li>\n  <li>Starspire Observatory in the Isles of Skye</li>\n  <li>The now-lost Inscrutable Tower of Drakkenheim in Westemär</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each has well-protected @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{Teleportation Circles}, but the sigil sequences are known only to Academy mages who can cast 5th-level spells.</p>\n<p>The location of the other strongholds is a closely-guarded secret. Rumors claim one is buried underneath a mountain of ice near the North Pole, and another lies at the bottom of the Middle Sea in a great glass dome. One is built upon the moon. The last is apparently a moving fortress with no fixed location. Accounts vary about its nature: one story says it is a magical village built on the back of a colossal flying whale, while others say it is a mist-shrouded mansion which walks upon giant birdlike legs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Academy Ranks</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/022-pg29-delerium-artefact-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Delerium Scepter\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/022-pg29-delerium-artefact-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Most Academy mages are wizards. However, bards, sorcerers, and warlocks are often found within their numbers. Members wear purple robes with gold and silver detail. Many carry all manner of arcane implements: staves, wands, and spellbooks. They wear the symbol of the Academy prominently.</p>\n<p><strong>Academy Rings.</strong> Members of the Amethyst Academy each wear a set of rings made from exotic arcane metals. The number of rings worn corresponds to the highest-level spell they can cast. Known as<em> academy rings</em>, these are magic items which identify the spellcaster as an Academy graduate, and often permit access to Academy strongholds. A set of five or more functions as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.9cIlRtKDtDXQtElf]. Each additional ring allows an additional level of spells to be stored, and some sets allow control over a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.z85EsGS2GVWj46qE]. However, each set is made for a specific individual, and only that person may attune to that set of rings.</p>\n<h3>Wards</h3>\n<p>Children taken in by the Academy who have not yet started their apprenticeship.</p>\n<h3>Apprentices</h3>\n<p>Apprentices are mages-in-training who are learning 1st- and 2nd-level arcane spells. Once they master 2nd-level spells, they begin their journeyman year where they work as an assistant to a Master Mage. After completion, the apprentices graduate and are invited to become full members of the Amethyst Academy. The typical apprenticeship takes eight to ten years.</p>\n<h3>Guild Mages</h3>\n<p>These rank-and-file Academy mages are capable of casting at least 3rd-level spells, though some new members can only cast 2nd-level spells. Most guild mages work as researchers and craftspeople for the Amethyst Academy. Few Academy members attain any rank higher than guild mage.</p>\n<h3>Master Mages</h3>\n<p>An Academy member in good standing is declared a Master Mage when they demonstrate the power to cast 5th-level spells. While some truly exceptional individuals can attain this rank at a young age, for most reaching this point represents a lifetime of achievement and dedicated study. As such, Master Mages are responsible for instructing apprentices, leading arcane research and manufacturing projects, and acting as emissaries for the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<h3>Grandmasters</h3>\n<p>These are powerful sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards who have the ability to cast 9th-level spells. They lead the Amethyst Academy's most important projects, and can access almost every spell and resource available to the institution. There are only a handful of Grandmasters in the entire world: beyond the eight members of the Academy Directorate, there are no more than twenty Grandmasters alive today.</p>\n<p>In the rare event of a vacancy amongst the Directorate, the Master Wizards may nominate three Grandmasters for the remaining Directorate's consideration. Since the Directorate must unanimously choose one of the three nominees to join them, the open position can take decades to fill.</p>\n<p>Amongst the notable Grandmaster Wizards is Eldrick Runeweaver. The foremost master of abjuration magic alive, Eldrick Runeweaver (a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]) is one of the three current nominees to the Directorate. Alongside his foremost pupil River (a tiefling @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]), he is currently leading the Academy's expedition to the ruins of Drakkenheim, hoping his success there will secure his position amongst the Academy's leadership.</p>\n<h3>The Directorate</h3>\n<p>The Academy Directorate consists of eight exceptionally powerful archmages. Sequestered away in secret strongholds of their own design, these highly reclusive figures rarely involve themselves in the day-to-day affairs of the Academy. Many Academy mages do not know their names, and only a few high-ranking members ever meet them in person.</p>\n<p>The Directorate seldom even encounter one another physically, either. Whispers tell they gather at a stone circle on the moon via @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ePhRKHXRE7l1sEoQ] spells whenever they must confer as one body. At all other times, they communicate via @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.kSPRpeIx3w3nihrF], and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uAwtVZkiSTyP6ORB] spells.</p>\n<p>The Directorate are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Adrianna Modera, Archmage of Drakkenheim (believed missing or dead following the destruction of the city, her position has remained unfilled for the past 15 years.)</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.C7yUf1r825NkN7TO]{Alabaster}, Archmage of Liberio</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.yH95IKEHmI023u7g], Archmage of the Moon</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.z2dBmn3c6S9Sg11X]{Lasaia Nightbreeze}, Archmage of the Eastern Vales</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.rJ05Zzvm3G17rQjX], Archmage of Caspia</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ggBl9pLVIGPL49rz]{Penumbra}, Archmage of Terene</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.edFqywMzmWglHpE1], Archmage of Elyria</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ZUhQYvVymk4PgNu6], Archmage of Skye</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most Academy members believe few, if any, members of the Academy Directorate are human, or even mortal beings as several Directors have held their positions since the founding of the Amethyst Academy hundreds of years ago, including Xel'vohca, Zodiac, and Amaranthyst. However, how these directors have extended their lifespans are the subject of wild rumors and speculation amongst the mages, ranging from repeated use of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.h830iyqParFleNqR] spell, demonic pacts, to blasphemous undead transformations. Indeed, there may be some truth to these claims. The individual members of the Directorate are described in the Continental Gazetteer.</p>\n<p>These Archmages are colleagues but also fierce rivals. There is no single leader amongst the Directorate. Instead, their byzantine rules grant each archmage full executive powers over the entire Amethyst Academy, but also the ability to veto the</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\"><p>“I only got to see the inside of the great Inscrutable Tower after its destruction. Shame.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>resolutions of any other member of the Directorate. In practice, this means the Directorate must have unanimous agreement on most major decisions. Imagine standing in a room with seven other wizards: you can cast any spell you want, but any other one could counterspell your magic, whilst a third responds with destructive magic to annihilate you both. Meanwhile, a fourth intercedes with their own abjurations and so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>The Directorate is often excruciatingly slow to reach any consensus. Meanwhile, individual members use what personal authority and resources they can to increase their personal influence and their own magical might over the other archmages. The archmages constantly plot and scheme against each other more than anyone else. Each knows that if any one of them were to wrest control of the Amethyst Academy, they would possess power akin to the sorcerer-kings of old.</p>\n<h3>Court Mages</h3>\n<p>The powerful noble houses that rule the continent are served by court mages appointed by the Amethyst Academy. Under the agreements of the Edicts of Lumen, every noble who holds a rank above a count is guaranteed the services of a permanent court mage, but any lesser nobles who can afford their salary may also procure the services of a court mage.</p>\n<p>Amongst many noble families, a mageborn child is often regarded as a tremendous boon. Although their children cannot inherit the family rank and title, the lowliest baron to the most influential duchesses readily dispatch their mageborn children to the Amethyst Academy for arcane schooling. Once these young mages complete their training, most take up an assignment as the court mage of their own household. In this way, the Amethyst Academy and the nobility have built close ties. The noble household gains the services of a loyal spellcaster to serve as arcane counsel and a close confidant, and the Amethyst Academy gains an intimate connection to the political machinations of the nobility. Although mageborn scions can live a life where they enjoy both the trappings of nobility and the freedom to practice their magic, many help advance the goals of their relatives as adventurers.</p>\n<p>However, this practice has come under criticism from members of the Faith of the Sacred Flame, who claim that such familial connections allow the Amethyst Academy to foster an undue influence over the nobility by exploiting the bonds of blood. They suspect that the Amethyst Academy has become quite adept at positioning itself as an elite finishing school for noble children. Suspicious Flamekeepers say that most court mages return to their families thoroughly indoctrinated, willing to use their magic to influence their parents, siblings, and cousins, pushing the Academy's own political agenda.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Mages Beyond the Academy</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/112-pg31-malfeasant-mage-deidrick-mors-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Malfeasant wizard Deidrick Mors\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/112-pg31-malfeasant-mage-deidrick-mors-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>While the purple-robed wizards would have it otherwise, several groups of mages exist outside of the Academy's hierarchy.</p>\n<h3>Hedge-mages</h3>\n<p>This term is used to describe arcane magic-users who develop their spellcasting abilities outside Academy institutions. Nevertheless, such individuals are exceptionally rare. They are most often warlocks or sorcerers, as few outside the Amethyst Academy possess the knowledge and resources to instruct others in wizardry.</p>\n<h3>Malfeasant Mages</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.N3EN4LBizqZknF1e] mages are spellcasters who have used magic to commit crimes (such as murder or robbery), perform blasphemous magic (as defined by the Articles of Malediction in the Edicts of Lumen), or betrayed the Amethyst Academy (such as exposing their secrets, stealing magic items, or conspiring against the Directorate). They are outcast from the Academy and carry a death sentence in any nation bound by the Edicts of Lumen.</p>\n<p>The Academy typically only dispatches its own agents to dispose of malfeasant wizards who might be in possession of Academy property or valuable research; most are hunted down by the Silver Order or hired mercenaries. Historically, apprehending fugitive malfeasant mages is one of the few instances in which the Academy and the Silver Order cooperate.</p>",

Signed three centuries ago in the year 743 by Divine Matriarch Truth II, the six Great Houses of Caspia, Queen Hildegarde I von Drakken of Westemär, King Laertes Ava I of Elyria, and the Amethyst Academy Directorate, this agreement put an end to brutal wars fought over the use of arcane magic by separating the political and economic powers of clergy, mages, and nobles.</p>\n<p>The full text is an utterly byzantine and cumbersome document thousands of pages long. The original signed treaty has long been preserved in Saint Tarna's Cathedral, but many copies have been made since. Nevertheless, the Edicts of Lumen comprise six main articles:</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Articles of Inheritance</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote edict-of-lumen\">\n  “...within the Nations party to this Agreement, all Mageborn are hereby stripped of their noble titles, barred from any rank, and must relinquish any land ownership claims.”\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>These articles form the key stipulation of the Edicts of Lumen. They are designed to avoid the coalescing of power that lead to the sorcerer kings of old - a legitimate concern in light of how the concentration of both political and magical power amongst ruling houses often results in tyranny and injustice.</li>\n  <li>The Amethyst Academy closely monitors noble houses for signs their scions may be mageborn. If a ruling noble has hidden their mageborn ancestry, the grave situation triggers Clause Five of the Articles of Umbrage (described below).</li>\n  <li>The terms extend to royalty as well. Indeed, royal successors in particular face much greater scrutiny at the hands of the Academy to ensure no mageborn sits upon the throne of any nation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Articles of Neutrality</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote edict-of-lumen\">\n  “The Nations of this agreement recognize the Amethyst Academy, so long as the Mages remain neutral and impartial with regards to the political affairs of the Nations. The Mages are hereby granted certain Protections under the Law, are held Exempt from Taxation, retain the Right to Practice Magic, and may freely travel between any Lands under this Agreement.”\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>These articles ensure that mages do not face persecution when traveling the continent.</li>\n  <li>Mages and mageborn often still serve as court mages and on the royal council of most nations, but their role here is meant to be that of an advisor rarely given the final decision in any matter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Articles of Guardianship</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote edict-of-lumen\">\n  “The Nations hereby grant the Mages of the Amethyst Academy the Right of Guardianship over all Mageborn Children. These Magelings shall be entrusted as Wards of the Amethyst Academy, who are charged with boarding, protecting, and instructing these Magelings in Magic until they come of age. No exceptions are given to Mageborn children of any Station, not a single noble House, nor any Royal family.”\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>After their instruction, adult mageborn are free to depart the Amethyst Academy if they wish. Most, however, opt however, opt to remain part of the organization to some degree.</li>\n  <li>Those who manifest magical abilities as adults aren't compelled to join the Amethyst Academy by these articles but are invited and welcomed into its ranks should they choose to do so. Otherwise, the Academy generally leaves such hedge-mages to their own devices, so long as these independent spellcasters abide the Edicts of Lumen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Articles of Enterprise</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote edict-of-lumen\">\n  “The Nations recognize the right of the Amethyst Academy to conduct its own affairs and govern itself within the stipulations of this Agreement. Within the Nations party to this Agreement, the Amethyst Academy shall have sole authority over any Guild practicing Arcane Magic, any School for Instruction in Arcane Magic, and all Manufacture for Sale of Arcane Artifacts, so long as such Services are available to All at a Fair and Equal Cost.”\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>Arcane spellcasters who wish to craft magic items for sale or offer their magical services for hire are required to pay a portion of their profits to the Academy. Furthermore, they are required to use the prices set forward by the Guild, and can't give discounts or cheaper prices to anyone.</li>\n  <li>The Academy takes enforcement of the Articles of Enterprise extremely seriously, and dispatches enforcers to shake down hedge mages behind on their payments.</li>\n  <li>There is a notable loophole in the Articles of Enterprise: the secondary market. A merchant who buys and then resells magical items may do so without paying Academy dues, so long as they aren't crafting any magical items themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Articles of Malediction</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote edict-of-lumen\">\n  “...the Nations forbid the Academy from teaching any Students magical practices such as Summoning Demons and creating Undead Creatures. Mages working any Arcane Magic to influence, control, or harm members of the Nobility or Clergy shall be Put to Death.”\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>The provisions against necromancy and demonology pertain specifically to the teaching of such magic, not studying or using it — the Academy argued that banning such magic entirely would impair their ability to understand and contain it.</li>\n  <li>Enforcement of these articles has been a vexing challenge. Those who conduct such magic in secret can often evade notice for years or decades.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Articles of Umbrage</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote edict-of-lumen\">\n  “... and if by any means a Noble Estate comes under the Rule of a Mageborn, the Nations and Households party to this Agreement shall immediately Muster Arms against them.”\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>Most of the Articles of Umbrage concern the means to deal with minor infractions and petty violations of the Edicts in a peaceful manner.</li>\n  <li>Clause Five of the Articles of Umbragecalls upon all noble houses to take up arms against any noble household ruled by a mageborn. Vassals sworn to serve a higher lord — such as a duke ruling under a royal monarch — may disavow their fealty to a mageborn lord. Under the agreement, a vassal cannot be compelled to give any aid, including taxes and levies, to a mageborn.</li>\n  <li>Invoking the article calls the accused to trial before representatives of the nobility, the Faith of the Sacred Flame, and the Amethyst Academy. The Faith is given the role of mediator and judge, and the Academy the role of investigator and cross-examiner. The objective of the trial is to determine if the accused is indeed mageborn, and how much their household should be held to account.</li>\n  <li>These trials are often an utter debacle. If the accused refuses to appear before the court, the only recourse is armed conflict.</li>\n  <li>The Articles of Umbrage close by stating that should the Academy Directorate be found to be in gross violation of the Edicts of Lumen, they will be purged by a combined force of the nobility and priesthood.</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h1 class=\"sidebar-light\">Enforcing the Edicts</h1>\n      <p>The Edicts of Lumen are a signed contract which establish a set of shared conventions and laws for all participating nations and people, not a magical pact. While magic is often used to investigate violations of the agreement, resolve disputes, and enforce penalties and punishments, no arcane spell or divine invocation renders its terms supernaturally binding. The mutual agreement and cooperation of the signatories enforce the Edicts of Lumen, backed up by the threat of another catastrophic continental war.</p>\n      <h1 class=\"sidebar-light\">Other Spellcasters and the Edicts</h1>\n      <p>Although apothecaries, bards, druids, and warlocks are not necessarily mageborn, the Edicts of Lumen do not acknowledge or distinguish them, only discussing the magic of “mages” and “mageborn.” As a result, the Edicts of Lumen do not allow for nuanced interpretations of what constitutes “arcane magic”. Amongst Edict scholars, some believe this is a major flaw in the manner the treaty was originally written. In practice, the noble houses rarely test the letter of the law against the spirit of the law. As a result, no ruler has dared bestow their estates and titles upon an heir with any sort of magical ability since the Edicts were signed. Few are willing to stake their lives and lineages to argue a technicality before a court of their peers.</p>\n      <p>During the drafting of the Edicts, it was raised whether or not the Edicts should impose restrictions on clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame. However, it was argued — quite loudly by the Faith — that such restrictions were unnecessary. Divine spellcasting cannot be passed down to one's progeny: each individual must take up the mantle themselves, a task that requires considerable devotion and faith. Further - more, the Faith noted that their oaths and dogma already ask the clergy to forswear their noble claims, pledging their allegiance and service to their faith ahead of their household. However, there have been a handful of instances where a paladin or cleric took up regency or acted as the custodian of their family title. In such cases, the title was passed on immediatel y when another suitable scion came to prominence.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\"><p>“Rangers have access to nature magic, but skirt under the Edicts of Lumen as “Dabblers”. Must be nice.”</p></blockquote>",

Nevertheless, there are several common languages:</p>\n<p><strong>Median:</strong> Common language used by the nations of the continent, including Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär. The language arose as the Old Tongue evolved into regional dialects, but most folk of the continent can communicate well enough regardless of where they were born.</p>\n<p><strong>Old Median:</strong> Ancient language spoken during the reign of the sorcerer-kings. Rarely spoken today, but often found in old tomes and records.</p>\n<p><strong>Jordic:</strong> Language common in northern regions of Netherwind, often used by dwarves, giants, and mountainfolk.</p>\n<p><strong>Sidhe:</strong> The language used by ancient elves.</p>\n<p><strong>Tylwyth:</strong> Spoken by gnomes, goblins, and fey creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic:</strong> Ancient tongue of dragonkind. While occasionally used in arcane writings, true dragons find mortal pronunciations of this language clumsy and offensive.<br />Mortals be warned: far from flattering a true dragon, these creatures are known to devour non-dragons who attempt speaking draconic in their presence.</p>\n<p>Celestial, elemental, and fiendish beings have their own languages, but these are not used by the people of the continent except in the most esoteric contexts. Sages, scholars, and acolytes occasionally use these languages for arcane or religious tomes, but the magical nature of these languages makes it difficult for mortal tongues to form them properly.</p>\n<p>Otherworldly beings from eldritch places communicate in utterly incomprehensible ways, which mortals can perceive only through maddening whispers, vivid hallucinations, and other spasmodic sensations. Though some of these beings do have their own disturbing speech and writing, no mortal living in the world can understand or speak these languages without magical aid.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Calendar</h2>\n<p>The common calendar in use today was developed by the Faith of the Sacred Flame in the mid-3rd century. It has 365 days, twelve months of about thirty days each, and a seven-day week. The years count from the Martyrdom of Saint Tarna, and the meteor struck Drakkenheim on 16 Autumntide, Year 1,111. By default, campaigns set in the world of Drakkenheim begin roughly fifteen years later on 4 Springtide, Year 1,126.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3 class=\"sidebar-light\">Months</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table003\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Threshold</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">January</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Thawing</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">February</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Springtide</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">March — Vernal Equinox</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Hearthstone</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">April</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Sowing</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">May</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Highsummer</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">June — Summer Solstice</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Midyear</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">July</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Sunbreak</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">August</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Autumntide</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">September — Autumnal Equinox</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Reaping</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">October</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Rimewind</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">November</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">Midwinter</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">December — Winter Solstice</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <div style=\"text-align:center\">\n        <h3>Days of the Week</h3>\n        <p><strong>Moonday</strong></p>\n        <p><strong>Tidesday</strong></p>\n        <p><strong>Windsday</strong></p>\n        <p><strong>Earthsday</strong></p>\n        <p><strong>Fireday</strong></p>\n        <p><strong>Starsday</strong></p>\n        <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Naming the Days and Months</h2>\n      <p>For clarity and simplicity during play, the world of Drakkenheim uses the real-world calendar. While using fantasy names for the days and the months feels fun and immersive, you might consider using the modern names for the months and days when tracking time in-game. In our experience, using familiar names helps communicate the passage of time more clearly to many players.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<h3>Holidays and Holy Days</h3>\n<p><strong>All Hallow's Eve</strong>. Held on the last day of Reaping.</p>\n<p><strong>Angelmeet.</strong> Held on the first day of Midyear to mark Saint Tarna's meeting with the angels. It is traditionally accompanied by feasting and the giving of gifts.</p>\n<p><strong>Tarna's Wake.</strong> This holiday is celebrated during the first and last week of each year, resulting in a fortnight of ceremonies, religious gatherings, and holy rituals held to commemorate Saint Tarna's martyrdom.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Stars and Seasons</h2>\n<p>The seasons across the continent correspond to the seasons of the northern hemisphere in the real-world Earth, though the climate becomes more tropical in the southernmost reaches of the continent.</p>\n<p>The people of the continent know they live on a round planet which orbits a fiery sun, and that their world has several planetary siblings. A single blue-white moon hovers above during the night, passing through phases from full to new moon each month. Legends say that once or twice a few great mages of the Amethyst Academy have traveled to these places, but what they found there are the subject of wild stories and speculation, and seldom fact.</p>\n<p>The tyrannical sorcerer-kings named many planets and stars after themselves during antiquity, and saw their own deeds in the constellations. In ages since, local traditions have given new names to some stars. Perhaps the most well-known celestial object is Tarna's Comet, which appears every 433 years as a golden streak in the night sky.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trade and Currency</h2>\n<p>If there's one thing that flows between the nations of the continent more often than blood, it's gold. Throughout the cities and towns of the continent, great guilds have formed around all areas of industrial and economic production, from bakers, blacksmiths, and cobblers to tailors, tanners, and wainwrights. Merchants travel by caravan on land and caravel by sea to exchange all manner of spices, silks, and luxury goods.</p>\n<p>The nations of the continent mint their own coins in gold, silver, and copper. Trade flourishes through the continent, especially via water around the Middle Sea. The Gazetteer notes the major imports and exports that flow between each region.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Education</h2>\n<p>Common folk school their own children, sometimes organizing informal community groups. Typically, people grow up learning the trade and profession of their parents — which for the vast majority of people in rural communities is agriculture. Children raised in urban areas with guilds and trade organizations can become an apprentice around the age of ten. From then on, their education is focused entirely on their craft.</p>\n<p>Nobles arrange private tutors for their children. Elyrian lords often ask a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] to teach their children history and religion. Westemär's dukes and duchesses ask their court mages to arrange lessons on geography, philosophy, science, mathematics, and languages, while the master-of-arms schools them in the arts of war. Caspian princes in particular are known to pay exorbitant sums to have their heirs trained by famous adventurers.</p>\n<p>There exist a few secular institutions for higher learning, such as Altbruke University in Westemär and the Leto College in Caspia, but most advanced education occurs within monasteries of the Sacred Flame or the arcane schools of the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Spellcasting Nonplayer Characters</h2>\n      <p>High-level NPCs and spellcasters are exceptionally rare in the world of Drakkenheim. Most are reclusive hermits or members of secret societies and cloistered priesthoods. However, others occupy prominent positions of power in churches, holy orders, mage guilds, and courts. Despite their few numbers, such people still have a profound impact on society.</p>\n      <p>Player characters seeking out spellcasting allies may readily find someone capable of casting 3rd- or 4th-level spells in most large towns and cities. This is usually a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] tending a Chapel of the Sacred Flame, or mage from the Amethyst Academy on a local assignment.</p>\n      <p>Establishing contact with someone capable of casting 5th- or 6th-level spells is only possible in the largest cities. Such individuals are often High Flamekeepers who head the Cathedrals of the Sacred Flame. The Amethyst Academy also appoints wizards and sorcerers to serve as Court Mage to powerful dukes, duchesses, and petty royalty.</p>\n      <p>Nonplayer characters capable of casting 7th- or 8th-level spells are only encountered as major figures in the world, occupied with great affairs and undertakings of dramatic import. Such NPCs may only be sought out with considerable effort by player characters with well-established reputations.</p>\n      <p>Only a handful of living mortals can cast ninth-level spells. Many are legendary figures, such as the eight Directors of the Amethyst Academy, the Divine Matriarch of the Sacred Flame, and the prophetic Lucretia Mathias. Others are secretive recluses, who turn their attention away from earthly squabbles to contemplate the cosmic order, fighting unseen battles against supernatural foes whose very nature threatens to tear the world asunder. A handful are diabolical villains, plotting the means to use their unfathomable abilities to seize power for themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/098-pg36-spell-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/098-pg36-spell-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Magic is common currency for nobility, clergy, wealthy merchants, and adventurers, but not regularly encountered by most other people on the continent. Everyone is aware that magic is real and will experience magical effects a few times throughout their lives, though incredibly few understand its mysterious workings. Common folk know that if a child shows signs of magical abilities, it is only a matter of time until the purple-robed mages of the Amethyst Academy arrive to take them as a ward.</p>\n<p>There was a time when arcane magic users faced extreme persecution from the Faith of the Sacred Flame, and echoes of those prejudices remain. Superstitions and misconceptions are common. People who are not extensively schooled in magical lore don't know how to distinguish between the different types of spellcasters — they are collectively referred to as ”mages.”</p>\n<p>When everyday folk encounter a spellcaster who is not visibly a priest or paladin of the Sacred Flame, they assume that individual is a mageborn sorcerer performing arcane magic. If the mage isn't wearing the purple robes of the Amethyst Academy, they are often mistrusted. However, apothecaries or witches sometimes dwell near rural communities or backwater towns brewing potions, telling fortunes, and treating illnesses and ailments. These caretakers have the hard-won trust of their communities thanks to the vital services they provide to others.</p>\n<p>More astute individuals can detect the signs of obvious enchantment or bewitchment especially tavern owners, merchants, and the nobility, who interact with mages and magic more often. Folk in the cities of Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär are no more (or less) intimidated by a brandished spell than they are by a brandished sword.</p>\n<p>People believe (correctly) that witches, trolls, and faeries live in the deep forests; dragons, giants, and manticores dwell in the far mountains, and that there are unseen worlds where demons and evil spirits dwell. They know stories about blood-drinking vampires, evil warlocks, and the righteous paladins who battle against them. Just as common folk don't know the difference between different types of spellcasters, few can distinguish between different types of extraplanar and monstrous creatures. In conversation, it is common to refer to almost any otherworldly monster as a “demon,” whether the creature is in fact an aberration, monstrosity, or a devil.</p>\n<p>While the myths and legends shared amongst common folk describe otherworlds and faerie realms, the workings of other planes and dimensions is a topic dimly understood. Only educated sages and acolytes can identify and distinguish between such places. Journeys to these realms are the stuff of heroes and legends.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Crime and Punishment</h2>\n<p>Throughout the continent, justice exists to serve the interests of the powerful and protect the wealthy, rather than meting out what is right and fair. Common folk accused of a crime can expect swift judgment without much opportunity to plead their case; criminal trials are the privilege of well-connected and affluent merchants and nobles. Indeed, many judges, barristers, and magistrates spend their time arbitrating civil or business disputes over contracts, small land disputes, and property rather than criminal actions. Guards and militias exist to keep the peace in cities, not to investigate crimes. When a dangerous fugitive remains at large, ruthless brigands stalk the highways, malfeasant wizards work dark magic, or a rogue monster threatens a community, local authorities must rely on bounty hunters, adventurers, or knightly orders.</p>\n<p>Common criminals are beaten, flogged, and locked in a pillory for a few days. Amputation of the hands or tongue is a typical punishment for thieves and charlatans, while murderers and worse are executed. Jails are used solely to detain prisoners awaiting trial or execution, or for political prisoners held as hostages. While many castles hold gaols and dungeons, the nations of the continent do not build dedicated prisons for the mass incarceration of common folk.</p>\n<p>Nobles are rarely punished for committing crimes of any sort against common folk, perhaps paying a small fine or restitution at most — even for murder. A noble who commits a crime against another noble will likely face trial, where severe offenses can see them stripped of their station or exiled, but rarely executed. However, many avoid punishment through bribes and political influence.</p>\n<h3>Magic and the Law</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/111-pg36-pillory-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/111-pg36-pillory-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Beyond the stipulations of the Edicts of Lumen, casting spells and using magic items isn't illegal in any nation on the continent. On the other hand, those who use magic to commit other crimes such as robbery, theft, or murder are burned at the stake or hanged, regardless of the severity of their offense. Depending on the individual's status within their respective organizations, their allies may take extensive steps to cover up their crimes or find ways to exonerate them.</p>\n<p>In high-profile trials between powerful nobles, it isn't unheard of for spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ppWAAEul0QHtm4er], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4], or even more powerful divination magic to be invoked. However, in such cases, law and custom decree that two spellcasters are present to ensure impartial use of these magics — one a mage of the Amethyst Academy, and the other a Flamekeeper of the Sacred Fire.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Dueling Styles of the Continent</h2>\n      <p>The prominent nations of the continent have each developed distinctive styles and customs for duels. The most accomplished duelists are trained in each of the three dominant dueling forms.</p>\n      <p><strong>Westemär Duel:</strong> The Westemär duel is the most straightforward of the three. Each of the participants chooses their preferred weapon and style, either with sword, spell, or whatever means suits them. The duel is performed one on one without outside interference.</p>\n      <p><strong>Elyrian Duel:</strong> An Elyrian Duel is a testament of might and combat expertise. Each participant must choose a melee weapon of their choice. Arcane magic and outside interference are illegal. Many have noted that this specific dueling style is entirely designed to force a mage to fight on the terms of a Silver Order knight. It is also significant that while arcane magic is not allowed, the Elyrian style makes no mention of divine magic.</p>\n      <p><strong>Caspian Duel:</strong> A Caspian Duel is the least aggressive of the dueling styles. While this seems contrary to their typical traditions, Caspians enjoy dueling so much that they developed a means to reduce the amount of dead Caspian knights by making their duels a form of contest. The most common options are either that both participants must quest on a monster hunt and return with the head (or similar trophy) of their kill, or that both participants must face a similar monster, such as a troll, and see which knight defeats their foe the fastest. The former is often chosen between dueling houses and involve entire hunting parties, while the latter is the option presented when two Caspian knights are trying to prove which is the more capable warrior.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Typical Settlements</h2>\n<p>Across the continent, the vast majority of people live a rural life in small villages and farming communities of no more than five hundred people. Most consist of ten to twenty multigenerational families. These families work fields, orchards, pastures, ranches, and stables. Along the major roads between cities, a traveler on foot will pass through a village like this roughly every hour, and on a full day of travel one might move through one or two larger towns of a thousand people or more. Travel between the great cities usually takes a few weeks on foot.</p>\n<h3>Government</h3>\n<p>Most villages in Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär are led by a burgomaster or reeve who collects taxes and reports to the local baron. Communities commonly have a small town council who manage local matters and settle disputes between the common folk.</p>\n<h3>Religion</h3>\n<p>Towns with a population of a thousand or more people will have a Chapel of the Sacred Flame, led by a human @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] and a handful of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolytes}. The larger towns might have two or three. Outside Elyria, many towns may have a shrine or two to the old gods, usually tended by a hermit @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classes.Item.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N] or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]. Minor chapels, isolated monasteries, and shrines dot the countryside.</p>\n<h3>Magic</h3>\n<p>Amateur apothecaries, hedge-wizards, or witches may dwell in some remote towns, offering their services as a herbalist, alchemist, or sage. Typically, such individuals finished their studies at the Amethyst Academy without distinction, and returned to their communities to practice magic undisturbed.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/116-pg37-shield-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/116-pg37-shield-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<h3>Militia</h3>\n<p>Villages will at best have a few lookouts to keep watch: a handful of human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS]{Guards} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.O3ABqI55Ir1du1Xa]{Scouts}, led by a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.J8xjoG4Dxb8WkHtV] acting as sheriff. Beyond this, most villages will have to muster up a militia of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners}.</p>\n<h3>Goods and Services</h3>\n<p>Most villages will have a tavern or public house, but only larger towns can support inns and hostels. Nevertheless, along the major highways folk in most villages are willing to board a few travelers in exchange for a few coins and bits of gossip.</p>\n<p>Each town has a trading post, a blacksmith, and a mill, and a few other businesses, typically a brewer, butcher, carpenter, shoemaker, and a tanner or furrier.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“Pluto promised me we would go see his home town someday.

These include bizarre concepts such as the “great wheel,” the “world axis,” the “conjunction of the spheres,” and “planar orbits” to explain magical phenomena and catastrophes. There is no consensus; every theorist is quick to point out the glaring flaws and logical inconsistencies in competing theories.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Planar Travel</h2>\n<p>Most mortal knowledge of the planes comes from contact with extraplanar creatures via summoning magic or divination spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.dSTu1MaPhBqPITwM]. While there are countless ley lines and thin places where the unwary might slip between worlds, deliberate planar travel by mortals is the stuff of legends.</p>\n<p>The knowledge and material components for the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz] spell are jealously guarded by the highest-ranking members of the Amethyst Academy and the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Unfortunately, the means to create the tuning forks needed for the spell were lost during the fall of the Arcane Empire. Since then, powerful mortal spellcasters have devoted their lives to discovering a new method for creating tuning forks without successes. A potential breakthrough may come from promising experiments with delirium recovered from Drakkenheim. The form these tuning forks take is described in the entry for each plane below.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Mortal World</h2>\n<p>The mortal world is a sphere of rock orbiting a fiery sun. Several other moons and planets join this cosmic dance, all suspended in an endless Astral Void. Far away, the sparkling stars are other suns.</p>\n<p>Only a single tuning fork attuned to the Mortal Plane is known to exist, and today it is lost in the Inscrutable Tower of Drakkenheim. As such, while it is possible to use the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz] spell to travel to other planes, the spell is rarely used to return to the mortal world. For those who wander into other worlds, the journey home is an adventure in itself.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Siderealms</h2>\n<p>These worlds are metaphysically close to the Mortal World, such that some creatures can pass through the Ethereal Plane into the Mortal World, and rarely vice-versa. These Siderealms imperfectly reflect the geography of the Mortal World, but altered in ways appropriate to that plane. A castle in the Mortal World might be an overgrown faerie palace in the Otherworld, a haunted ruin in the Shadowlands, filled with whimsical fantasies in Dreamland, and composed of fire or ice in the Elemental Planes.</p>\n<h3>Ethereal Plane</h3>\n<p>A truly liminal space, the Ethereal Plane lies on the metaphysical “borderland” of the Siderealms.</p>\n<h3>Dreamland</h3>\n<p>This strange realm is the mortal unconscious made manifest. It is a world of thoughts, dreams, and nightmares, inhabited by nightmarish creatures. Dreamland is effectively the Astral Plane of the world of Drakkenheim; spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.TIoadMIsUKD4edXi] allow characters to travel here.</p>\n<p>Mortals who physically enter Dreamland find the experience not unlike a lucid dream, and they can exert a subconscious influence on the plane itself. Often, this causes apparitions, visions, and imagined creatures or places to appear or disappear. Upon returning to the waking world, mortal travelers recall their experiences in Dreamland in the same manner as they do dreams, thus their memories of such experiences quickly become hazy and difficult to remember.</p>\n<p>There are several copies of a children's book called<em> Carol's Adven</em><em>tures in Dreamland</em> which work as tuning forks for Dreamland.</p>\n<h3>Faerie Otherworlds</h3>\n<p>The realm of fey is sometimes called by other names, such as Tír na nÓg, the Feywild, Wonderland, Avalon, and the Elusive Realm. It is uncertain whether or not these names refer to regions within the realm or are in fact distinct worlds entirely.</p>\n<p>Of all the planes, there are more tuning forks which lead to the Otherworld than any other plane, and more Thin Places which allow travel between the mortal world and faery realms. They often take the form of trinkets and keepsakes. As such, mortal travelers have visited these planes more frequently, and even occasionally returned with their lives and sanity intact.</p>\n<h3>Shadowlands</h3>\n<p>A dark reflection of the mortal world held in perpetual gloom. The souls of the departed pass into the Shadowlands on their way to the afterworlds, but some spirits wander here eternally.</p>\n<p>A tuning fork connected to the Shadowlands takes the form of a heavy midnight-black blindfold. However, venturing into the Shadowlands is considered exceptionally risky and even downright foolish: mortals age and decay rapidly here. Myths tell of travelers who avoided this curse by performing a funeral rite upon themselves, then journeying in the shadowlands wearing a burial shroud and keeping tokens typically given to the dead, such as coins upon their eyes or within their mouths.</p>\n<h3>Elemental Plane</h3>\n<p>A primordial place of raw energy and unbridled potential, the individual planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water are found within the churning storms and burning seas of the Elemental Plane.</p>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy possesses a tuning fork for each of the known elemental planes. However, it is possible there are many more lost in ancient dungeons and temples to elemental entities. Each is made of the associated element. Travel to these places, however, is almost always fatal for mortals without powerful protective magic. Otherwise, a planar traveler would be be burned alive in the planes of fire, crushed or drowned in the planes of earth and water, or fall forever within the plane of air.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Space Between Worlds</h2>\n<p>The Space Between Worlds is a roiling non-place of unbridled magical potential. The churning landscape is filled with strange crystalline obelisks with corners that meet at impossible angles. The sun is a square circle which sets beneath an impossible horizon that never meets the psychedelic octarine sky. Logic and reason have no meaning here; in the Space Between Worlds, all which would be absurd, contradictory, or paradoxical occurs. Chaos is order, and order chaos.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/097-pg39-mobius-strip-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/097-pg39-mobius-strip-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>The Space Between Worlds is thought to be the source of all arcane magic, and metaphysically connected to every other dimension, plane, timeline, and reality. The raw magic is so intense in this plane that it manifests as unrestrained eldritch contamination which transforms matter and energy into everything beyond imagination.</p>\n<p>The sights of the Space Between Worlds are so bizarre and incomprehensible that few mortal minds can withstand beholding them. Those who physically enter the Space Between Worlds via portals, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz], or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV] must save as if targeted by a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.hYCrN82dMJFuJODB] spell (DC 20 Intelligence save).</p>\n<p>The inscrutable inhabitants of the plane include sphinxes, gemstone dragons, and all manner of aberrations, but there is no meaningful concept of time in the Space Between Worlds beyond the perception of mortal creatures. Traveling through this place is a journey of aeons which can unfold in mere minutes within the Mortal World.</p>\n<p>There are only three known tuning forks which allow one to venture into the Space Between Worlds via @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]. One is a tesseract, another a mobius strip, and the last is a melting pocket watch.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Thin Places</h2>\n<p>These are spots where the borders between worlds are especially weak. In particular, Thin Places often mark the places where creatures from Dreamland, the Shadowlands, and the worlds beyond step into the mortal world. Powerful planar magic can be harnessed here; Thin Places are characterized by a subtle influence of the corresponding plane.</p>\n<p>Thin Places can wax and wane over time. An object such as a doorway, arch, stone circle, bridge, wardrobe, or looking-glass can act as a fulcrum for a thin place, and even spontaneously form a planar portal. Animal burrows, lakes, and even trees can act in the same manner, becoming places where mortals and extraplanar creatures can slip between worlds.</p>\n<p>When Thin Places wane, it can leave planar travelers trapped in another dimension, unable to return home. Academy scholars claim this is how gnomes, goblins, and many anthropomorphic peoples came to the Mortal World, as well as monsters such as lycanthropes, trolls, and worse.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Afterworlds</h2>\n<p>Eternity is the sacred celestial afterworld where angels dwell. Followers of the Old Gods sometimes refer to this place as Valhalla, and know the angels there as Nuada's valkyries.</p>\n<p>Interchangeably referred to as Hell or the Abyss, the fiendish afterworld is home to both demons and devils. When they are not waging endless war on each other, demons and devils plot mayhem and conspiracy against mortals.</p>\n<p>There are no known tuning forks for the Afterworlds, nor any Thin Places associated with them. The only means by which mortals can enter these realms is through a long and dangerous journey through the Shadowlands, or via the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV] spell.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Worlds Beyond</h2>\n<p>Beyond these fundamental planes, countless other worlds are known to exist. Whether these are actual planes or planets is a matter of debate.</p>",

Temperatures are well below freezing most of the year, and the barren landscape has little foliage except the southern edges near Ironhelm Ridge.</p>\n<p>Still, the lands are home to a few rugged towns and communities. The people here fight a bitter battle to eke out their lives against the harsh frozen wilderness.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Netherwind was named during the age of the Arcane Empire, but was seen as an inhospitable land with few resources. Many giants lived in the region, and so the sorcerer-kings deemed it not worth the efforts conquering. Netherwind became home to people fleeing the wicked empire, choosing to face the unrelenting cold and the furious giants there over the tyranny of the sorcerer-kings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">War of Giants</h2>\n<p>When Netherwind's first villages were built during the reign of the sorcerer-kings, it raised the ire of the giants in the Giantfrost Mountains. They descended from their city of Stonerest high in the mountains to confront the human settlers. While some giants accepted the humans as refugees and even helped build their communities, teaching them to survive the harsh environments of the north, others giants saw the settlers as intruders stealing their resources and taking their lands. So began the War of Giants.</p>\n<p>The conflict was less a proper war and more a never-ending feud characterized by brutal skirmishes. Most of the conflict was fought between the giant clans whilst the humans themselves sought simply their own survival. In the end, the giants who sided with the humans were outcast from their own communities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Only a few thousand people dwell in Netherwind. Since humans and giants have long tried to live in peace, there is a notable amount of half-giants amongst the population.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>The main city in Netherwind is Bleakborough.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“There are people living up there? Seems regretable. I hear it snows constantly and is full of really angry giants.”</blockquote>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Netherwind Reavers</h2>\n<p>The Reavers are a group of nomadic northern warriors who protect Netherwind's settlements and small villages. These hulking warriors adorn themselves with animal furs and thick clothes, and fight like the giants they often war against. They charge into battle ruthlessly, using their rage to push them through grievous wounds and frostbite. Many among their ranks are half-giants, displaying incredible strength and endurance.</p>\n<h3>Warchief Jarma Polaris</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/048-pg113-jarma-polaris-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Warchief Jarma Polaris\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/048-pg113-jarma-polaris-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Jarma leads the Netherwind @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.n6tx6Y2nEgr1LnIA], leading them into battle against giants, dragons, and even the occasional battle with the Ironhelm Dwarves over the rich mountain resources to the south. They are a 9-foot-tall half-giant and wield a colossal greatsword carved with Jordic runes. They have a flowing mane of white hair and bushy white eyebrows that frame their pale gray skin and sunken piercing blue eyes. They wear the pelt of a mammoth across their back.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I do not speak often to outsiders if I can avoid it. I know that I can intimidate just about any so-called champion from the south, and my silence is often my greatest weapon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> To fight is to live, and to live for a Reaver, is to fight.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I love the north, and want to make my mother proud. She was a great warrior herself, and so I strive to be as good as she was.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I enjoy mead and ale a little too much, and rarely say no to a good fire, some fresh brews, and stories of battle.\n</p>\n<p>Jarma is torn between two worlds. The giants of Stonerest abandoned the half-giants years ago, and claimed they are not welcome in Stonerest any longer. Since then, Jarma's kind have found acceptance among the human settlements of Netherwind. Jarma looks up to their mother, Berna Icewyrm, a giant who once led great battles against dragons. Jarma wants to make her proud more than anything, but was deeply saddened when she did not leave Stonerest with them when they were banished. Jarma is happy to defend their new home, but they still hope to one day end the war of the giants and be with their mother again.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Barren Expanse</h2>\n<p>The stretch of land between the eastern and western edges of the nation is the coldest area in the whole nation. It has little to offer except constant blizzards, freezing temperatures, and very little wildlife. To pass the Barren Expanse one must be prepared to test themselves against the harshest environments of the north. Many who have ventured in never make it to the other side. The safest route through these lands is to skirt along the south where Netherwind meets the Ironhelm Mountains.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Giantfrost Mountains</h2>\n<p>These steep rocky mountains make up the western edges of Netherwind and have a distinct valley in the middle that sees several small lakes and slightly more tolerable temperatures. These mountains are some of the tallest in the continent and traversing through them is a dangerous road for non-giants. The infamous Gallows Pass is one of the only notable passages through the mountains to Stonerest, and the giants like to hang the skeletons of those who have intruded on their lands along its dangerous cliffs to remind travelers that they are not welcome.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Blizzard Peak</h2>\n<p>Glasyadriel, also known by the moniker “Blizzard” is a vicious white dragon<strong></strong> who resides in the Giantfrost Mountains and hunts the westernmost end of the Barren Expanse. The giants fear the beast and often leave offerings at the base of its mountain. However, folks traveling through Netherwind and those seeking council with the giants are often prime hunting for the dragon, who has also been known to terrorize the few human settlements and the great dwarven city along the Ironhelm Ridge.</p>\n<h3>Glasyadriel, the Blizzard</h3>\n<p>Glasyadriel is the youngest of the known dragons. This @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.3uIursokd3KdZrW3] resides in the tall peaks of the Giantfrost Mountains. The dragon had a rather unfortunate run-in with Jarma Polaris and his Reavers where both parents of the dragon were slain, and Glasyadriel lost her right claw. When the dragon discovered giant ruins high up in the mountain, still filled with the riches of an ancient giant warlord, the ferocious dragon claimed the treasures for themselves. Glasyadriel is the most visibly active of the dragons and can often be seen circling the Giantfrost Mountains, occasionally tormenting giants and travelers alike, stealing any precious belongings.</p>\n<p>Glasyadriel has developed a strong hatred of both humans and giants, both of whom have attempted to kill them on multiple occasions. Recently, a host of giants from Stonerest ascended the great mountains to kill Glasyadriel. Their bodies are now known as the Forest of Giants, as the entire hunting crew now stand frozen in place along the mountainside. Glasyadriel keeps them there as a warning to anyone bold enough to approach their lair.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Bleakborough</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 2,500 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Mayor Persilla Ruben</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Ice Fishing, Dog Sledding</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Bleaksborough stretches across two glacial cliffs, spanning a river that carves its way through the icy tundra. Rows of small wooden houses encircling a massive bonfire is the sign of home for northern travelers. Lanterns illuminate throughout the small village, and chimneys spew out woodfire smoke. The many snow-topped roofs and howling winds hide the town from view to those who do not know where to look for it. Entering the village, you are greeted with the warmth of the flame in the center of town, a great relief from the biting cold of the Northroad.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>Bleakborough is the largest human settlement in Netherwind. Nestled on the fork in the Daggerflow River, this city is the only notable location in the north that has established a unified community. While the surrounding areas in the eastern end of Netherwind have several smaller settlements of anywhere from a dozen to a hundred people, they all stand as feeder towns to Bleakborough, and are all within a day's travel of the city. The city itself is located in an icy burrow between two large glacial shelves. This helps block the settlement from the harsh winds and intense snowfalls of Netherwind and grants them shelter and warmth to some degree.</p>\n<p>The town's single-story houses, made from imported lumber from Dregden's Ferry in the Eastern Vales, often have iron plating on the western side to help protect from an almost constant eastward wind. Large tanks around the city collect snowfall and melt and filter it into fresh drinking water. Due to the lack of resources to use as fuel, a magical bonfire in the center of the city acts as a central hub for the town. The fire is always lit and maintained by a local Amethyst Academy mage who resides in the small community.</p>\n<p>The community is known for its great hunters, who go out into the harsh elements of the Barren Expanse and bring back food for the community. These hunters, known as the Netherwind Reavers, are also Bleakborough's guard force. Many of them are half-giants, though the city also has a few other folk more accustomed to colder climates.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Stonerest</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 300 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Buxe6dDK5Mw7kxe6]{Frost Giants}</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Berna Icewyrm</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Giant-scale city in the frozen mountains</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>The great stone city is built into the side of the Giantfrost Mountains within a great valley. The giants have lived amongst the mountains and valleys of this northern tip of the continent for far longer than humans have roamed the lands. The city is of massive scale with daunting high doors, outer walls that stretch upwards for hundreds of feet. Towers as large as a human city extend into the sky to dizzying heights, and huge keeps made of bricks as big as houses rise from the mountain slopes. Not many humans get the chance to see Stonerest, but those who do have told tales of its grandeur and majesty.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>Stonerest is a giant city built into the side of the Giantfrost Mountains, resting in the valley between the two distinct lines of mountains. A few hundred giants dwell in Stonerest and the city is to scale for their kind, meaning that humans who have laid eyes on it are often intimidated by the sheer size and grandeur of the walls, doors, high ceilings and large statues that decorate the halls. The giants have, long ago, allowed humans who venture to their kingdom to enter. Since the Giant War they have been far less accommodating to travelers. The giants of Stonerest keep largely to themselves, but have been known to venture down into Westemär, the Ironhelm Ridge, and Netherwind, causing problems for the humans, dwarves, and other folk who reside there.</p>\n<p>Today, there is very little communication or trade with the giants of Stonerest. Their leaders, beliefs, and community are now only myths and legends. Travelers fear so travelers fear the Giantfrost Mountains, and tell cautious tales of armies of giants and great dragons who roam the mountains.<br /></p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Adventures in Netherwind</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Plot Hooks</h2>\n<p>Below are some specific adventures that might occur around Netherwind.

The folk of Bleakborough would like the party to take care of the dragon for good and end their destructive hunger.</p>\n<h3>Three Days of Night</h3>\n<p>Every year as winter comes to Bleakborough, the city has a stretch of three days where the sun doesn't shine. A strange man has wandered into town the day prior and warned the town of his master and friends coming to feast. The town is on edge, worried that a family of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.DDO9lDCDtNHkfShP]{Vampires} will descend on their village.</p>\n<h3>Delirious Giants</h3>\n<p>The giants of the Giantfrost Mountains have uncovered a delerium crystal in the snow and brought it back to their keep.

After a mysterious meteor devastated the capital city of Drakkenheim fifteen years ago, the nation descended into a decade of bloody civil war. The surviving siblings of King Ulrich IV fought bitterly for the throne, but the brutal matter cost both their lives. The Civil War ended with no real victor, and no clear inheritor to the royal titles of House von Kessel.</p>\n<p>Ravaged by conflict, the once-great nation is now fracturing into disparate smaller realms. Worse, the otherworldly contamination left behind by the falling star is slowly spreading into the surrounding lands, bringing madness and monsters to the unprepared towns and villages of Westemär. As curious mages and profit-seeking smugglers ferry delerium from the ruins of Drakkenheim to distant lands, grim veterans of the Civil War fight to retake the capital and rebuild the realm. Meanwhile, a grave religious schism has broken out amongst the common folk driven by the apocalyptic proclamations of Lucretia Mathias. No nation on the continent is in greater need for heroes, and now Westemär has become the stage upon which greater conflicts affecting the entire continent are taking shape.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Encompassing the northwestern quarter of the continent, Westemär is a rugged land of deep forests and slow, wide rivers broken up by small areas of rolling pasture and farmland. It has a moderate climate with snowy winters and warm summers, and it rains constantly in the spring and fall. The region is rich in natural resources: logging and lumber are the backbone of many villages and towns, but others lie along vast deposits of iron, copper, and coal which feed the industry of Westemär's cities. The Crystal Coast takes its name from the rich salt mines along its rocky northern shores, and fine quarries throughout Westemär built the nation's many castles and fortresses. Veins of gold and silver are found within the mountainous regions to the south, though the dwarven communities in the Glimmer Mountains have long asserted their independence and make claim to the richest veins.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Approximately 8 million people dwell in Westemär. Most of the population inhabit rural villages, and only about 600,000 people live in cities and large towns.</p>\n<p>Most people living in Westemär are humans who value hard work and pragmatism. Many simply want to put the turmoil of the last ten years behind them, and are exhausted from the conflicts gripping their lands. Young people either bitterly resent the prosperity their parents enjoyed during the unrestrictive rule of the late Ulrich IV, or fight furiously to restore a glorious kingdom they've only ever known through stories told to them by their grandparents. Tieflings form several noble houses and are commonly encountered in larger cities, and see opportunity in the hard times of the nation. There are several halfling communities in the eastern areas of Westemär who have suffered greatly from the civil war and eldritch contamination placing great strain upon their harvests. The dwarven holds of the Glimmer Mountains and Ironhelm Ridge traditionally consider themselves self-governing city states, but look to prospecting delerium in Drakkenheim as a new avenue for industry as their old mines run dry.</p>\n<p>Small enclaves of elves once inhabited the southwestern regions, but these communities were annihilated during the conquests of Vladimir von Drakken. Most of the surviving elves fled to the Isles of Skye; only a handful of elves remain in Westemär today.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>Drakkenheim was the capital of Westemär until it was destroyed fifteen years ago. Today, the nation has no true capital.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Government</h2>\n<p>Before the meteor struck, Westemär was a feudal monarchy in which rule typically passed to the firstborn child. The most recent ruler, Ulrich IV of House von Kessel, inherited a period of relative political stability. He was able to pursue leisurely interests in architecture, education, and carnal affairs instead of politics and warfare. He married a Caspian princess of House Jones, Lenore, and had three children: Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza. Ulrich IV was ten years into his reign when the meteor struck Drakkenheim. Nothing has been seen or heard of the royal couple or their children since.</p>\n<p>In Westemär, the ruling monarch holds the title of king or queen and rules for life. Dukes ruling each province swear oaths of fealty to their monarch, and in turn hold lesser lords as their vassals. Generations of nobles have formed a web of familial connections and political alliances, and so dynastic rule has shifted several times. The monarch would mediate the many inevitable grievances which emerged between dukedoms, and from time-to-time petty wars and skirmishes have broken out between two noble houses over land ownership or other disputes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, succession in Westemär has seldom been a clean matter as each monarch reinvents the rules. While traditionally they would pass the crown to their designated heir — most often their eldest living offspring, regardless of gender — more than half the time the crown has not passed directly from parent to child. Illegitimate children, remarriage, children from multiple marriages, sibling rivalry, and the interconnected relationships between other noble houses mean that following the death of a monarch, there are usually several potential claimants who emerge. A stark light was cast upon these long-simmering issues when the royal family was lost in Drakkenheim. Though the fate of his direct heirs is unknown, Ulrich IV was survived by his younger siblings Mannfred and Cecilia, neither of whom were in Drakkenheim on that fateful day. The two initially cooperated to determine their brother's fate and attempted retaking the city of Drakkenheim through military force. When these efforts failed, a feud broke out between the two over who should claim the throne. The Civil War would be the downfall of House von Kessel: neither Mannfred, Cecilia, nor their own children survived the conflict.</p>\n<p>Lacking any clear and credible claimant to support, the nobles who sided with the divided branches of House von Kessel eventually laid down their arms and returned to their domains to lick their wounds.</p>\n<p>Today, the realm is disintegrating, and the ruling nobles now largely operate their provinces as independent domains. They owe no fealty to any monarch. Most are simply trying to hold onto their own wealth and power, a far more feasible goal for the time being than trying to conquer their rivals or unite the nation again.</p>\n<h3>Noble Ranks</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>King or Queen.</em></strong> The monarch of Westemär.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Duke or Duchess.</em></strong> Vassals only to the monarch, each rule one of Westemär's provinces, and usually from one of the provincial capitals.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Count or Countess.</em></strong> A middle noble rank who holds a county as their domain. Most are direct vassals to a duke, but may lord over lesser nobles.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Baron or Baroness.</em></strong> Rulers of smaller fiefdoms who serve higher nobles.\n  </li>\n  <li>Landed knights and other petty nobles may have their own manors or estates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Common Ranks</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Lord Mayor.</em></strong> Elected mayors of cities\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Burgomaster.</em></strong> Elected mayors of towns\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Reeve.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq] appointed by a noble to manage an estate or village within their lands\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Royal Council</h3>\n<p>Traditionally most of these figures were appointed by the monarch to manage the affairs of state, military, and diplomacy:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Lord Commander.</em></strong> Chief military advisor to the monarch, who commands Westemär's combined military forces during times of war.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Archmage.</em></strong> This position is typically appointed by the Amethyst Academy, and is traditionally filled by a member of the Academy Directorate to counsel the monarch on arcane matters.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>High Flamekeeper.</em></strong> The Divine Matriarch of the Sacred Flame chooses the High Flamekeeper, and this person is traditionally a prominent cleric of the religion to offer spiritual guidance and spur righteous action.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Spymaster.</em></strong> Responsible for intelligence and law enforcement, often working closely with the Lord Commander and the Chancellor.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Steward.</em></strong> Chief administrative official who manages the royal household, and oversees civil matters from construction to taxation.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Chancellor.</em></strong> Manages diplomatic and international relations.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most members of the Royal Council went missing or died when Drakkenheim was destroyed, except Lord Commander Elias Drexel.</p>\n<p>The dukes and counts of Westemär appoint their own household staff in the model of the Royal Council. Thus, most dukes are served by a court mage and appoint their own steward to manage their affairs.</p>\n<h3>Seals of Westemär</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/153-house-von-kesel-heraldry-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/153-house-von-kesel-heraldry-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Each of the members of the Royal Council bear one of the<em> Seals of Westemär</em> as their badge of office. These powerful magic items aid each official in running the affairs of state. While Lord Commander Elias Drexel still holds his badge, the remaining seals are lost in the ruins of Drakkenheim, alongside the<em> Crown of Westemär.</em></p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>It has been several centuries since the Faith of the Sacred Flame spread to all corners of Westemär. Every major city in the nation has a large and impressive cathedral devoted to the faith, tended by a high-ranking @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] and throng of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolytes} All throughout the countryside are monasteries for the clergy to live and worship, and smaller chapels are the heart of rural communities. Even the tiniest villages in Westemär keep small shrines and bonfire pits ministered by a devout member of the community.</p>\n<p>However, the folk of Westemär are more modest and moderate in their faith compared to their neighbors in Elyria. Still, many nobles seek council from Flamekeepers. Furthermore, Flamekeepers are highly influential amongst the common folk, acting as important community leaders and elders.</p>\n<p>Although most people in Westemär follow the Sacred Flame, amongst the three great nations of the continent, Westemär has the largest number of people who still keep the Old Faith. The laws and people of Westemär are mostly tolerant towards these ancient beliefs, and major shrines to the Old Gods are openly displayed outside several large cities, including one to Nodens near Drannsmund, another to Morrigan outside Drakkenheim, and several great cairns near Heilig.</p>\n<p>Recently, however, Westemär has become the hotbed for a budding religious schism in the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Renegade preachers and zealous faithful heed the teachings of Lucretia Mathias and the Followers of the Falling Fire. Many prominent High Flamekeepers in major cities in Westemär have turned their backs on the Divine Matriarch, urging their flocks to take up the cause of the Falling Fire.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Military</h2>\n<p>Westemär has a feudal military structure. During wartime, a noble lord calls upon their vassals to muster an army. These vassals respond by assembling a mixed force drawn from their household guard, knights sworn to their services, and levies drawn up from either volunteer or conscripted commonfolk who dwell in their domains.</p>\n<p>The Civil War saw the formation of numerous mercenary companies as the noble houses exhausted their own local armies. Though the war has ended, the dukes and duchesses of Westemär keep mercenary regiments such as the Steelfang Company and the Achtungwald Irregulars on retainer to bolster the security of their domains.</p>\n<p>The most well-known military outfit in Westemär, and the only thing resembling any sort of national armed force, is the 4th Provisional Regiment to Reclaim the Capital, also known as the Hooded Lanterns.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<p>The nobility of Westemär has a long and favorable association with the Amethyst Academy. Prior to the Edicts of Lumen, House von Drakken staunchly protected mages and mageborn. Many noble houses in Westemär have mageborn lineages, and so there was considerable resistance to the idea of disinheriting their scions when the Edicts were drawn up.</p>\n<p>Agents from the Amethyst Academy operate small compounds in Drannsmund, Altbruke, and Geldstadt; mage towers throughout the land serve as important outposts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trade</h2>\n<p>Thanks to its rich natural resources, Westemär is a hub for craftspeople and industry. Guilds devoted to every major skill and trade flourish in its cities. Merchants come to Westemär to purchase fine manufactured goods in exchange for Elyrian textiles and Caspian spices.</p>\n<p>Trade by land usually proceeds from Leuchten to Elyria, Caspia, and the Free City, or from Drakkenheim towards the Eastern Vale. Naval shipping flows from Drannsmund to the Isles of Skye and other distant ports in far continents.</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Exports</strong>: Salt, silver, iron, copper, coal, furs, manufactured goods, honey, mead, maple syrup.</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Imports</strong>: Silk, textiles, spices, wine.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History</h1>\n<p>Westemär takes its name from a bastardization of its former name. Under the sorcerer-kings, the land was referred to as the Western Marches, opposite the Eastern Vales. As the old tongue of the Arcane Empire faded and regional dialects took hold, the term degenerated into the name it is known by today.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Conquest of Vladimir von Drakken</h2>\n<p>After the fall of the sorcerer-kings' empire, the lands which eventually became Westemär became a collection of small domains and kingdoms. Indeed, the original borders between these old realms roughly correspond to the provinces which currently make up the nation. Each submitted or capitulated to Vladimir von Drakken, the founder of the nation, during his conquests in the 7th century.</p>\n<p>Vladimir von Drakken's violent campaign did not hesitate to put every advantage on the table. Ruler of an ancient noble house with roots stretching back to the sorcerer-kings, House von Drakken had a mageborn lineage mingled with draconic ancestry. Vladimir von Drakken himself was no mage, but was known as a ruthless, unrivaled swordsman. During his lifetime, rumors persisted that the man drank and bathed in the blood of his slain foes. Striking a bargain between several dragons and his own mageborn siblings, Vladimir von Drakken commanded a devastating combination of conventional military supported by arcane might and dragonfire.</p>\n<p>After three decades of warfare, Vladimir von Drakken's burgeoning kingdom was shaping up to become a despotic empire in its own right as he prepared invasions into Caspia and Elyria. That was until his own estranged daughter, Carmen von Drakken, returned from years of exile alongside a band of plucky adventurers. Carmen challenged her father's might and put an end to the nascent tyrant in a climactic battle above the spires of Castle Drakken.</p>\n<p>Taking up her father's crown, Carmen von Drakken appointed her adventuring companions to the highest offices and noble houses of the nation, thus cementing her own fifty-year rule. During this time, Carmen tended the growing pains of the young nation, and is remembered as a healer and uniter who tore down the merciless ways of her father. Though she rejected Vladimir's original dream of a new continent-spanning empire, Carmen laid her father to rest with the full honors as the founder of the nation, and few histories today record the full scope of the bloody atrocities Vladimir von Drakken committed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Dynastic Upheaval</h2>\n<p>Generations later, the legacy of Vladimir von Drakken was reignited when Carmen's great-great-grandson, Albrecht von Drakken, launched an invasion of Caspia. He used the power of the<em> Crown of Westemär</em> to bind dragons to his service like his ancestors did. However, he was unprepared to face the skillful Caspian dragonslayers, and Albrecht was beheaded on the battlefield. Having disposed of his own siblings in a bid for the throne, House von Drakken was left greatly weakened and shortly collapsed. This set off a series of succession crises in which rule passed rapidly between several short-lived dynasties. Multiple families and rulers seized the throne during this period, but only two houses from this tumultuous time held the throne for more than a decade and are recognized as legitimate rulers in the eyes of history. The others are regarded as pretenders.</p>\n<p>House von Kessel ultimately secured the throne through a combination of careful diplomacy, key military victories over their rival houses, and claiming a spurious connection to House von Drakken through a distant cousin of a cadet branch. The first monarch of this new dynasty was Helena I, who brought many progressive reforms into Westemär during her long rule and steered the nation through a devastating plague. House von Kessel ruled Westemär from the capital of Drakkenheim for 150 years, until that woeful eve when an eldritch star fell upon the city.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Destruction of Drakkenheim</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/126-pg44-cecilia-and-manfred-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Cecilia and Mannfred von Kessel\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/126-pg44-cecilia-and-manfred-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Fifteen years ago, an otherworldly meteor shower destroyed the capital city of Drakkenheim. King Ulrich IV, as well as his son and principal heir, were presumed killed in the disaster, leaving the nation without a ruler or clear successor.</p>\n<p>However, many members of the royal household were not in Drakkenheim when the meteor struck, including the king's younger siblings, Mannfred and Cecilia von Kessel. The two spent vast sums commissioning the clergy of the Sacred Flame and the mages of the Amethyst Academy to use divination magic to discern what happened, but to no avail. They nearly bankrupted themselves by launching multiple large-scale military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of which failed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Westemär Civil War</h2>\n<p>Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further efforts to retake Drakkenheim were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown and relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim, arguing there was no conclusive evidence which confirmed their brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided over the issue, and a civil war ensued which raged for nearly a decade.</p>\n<p>As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal. Cecilia von Kessel herself died unexpectedly only a few days later, leaving behind no heirs of her own. Lacking a clear successor, the Civil War ended with a whimper.</p>\n<p>Now, only a dim hope remains that the realm can be rebuilt and the nation restored. Gathering what little support he could muster amongst the nobility, Lord Commander Elias Drexel has launched a foray into Drakkenheim in a desperate final bid to retake the capital.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<p>Here are but a few of the powerful organizations and groups operating in Westemär.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Hooded Lanterns</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/127-hooded-lantern-ranger-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Hooded Lantern Ranger\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/127-hooded-lantern-ranger-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns are an irregular military regiment formed to reclaim the ruins of Drakkenheim. Their guerilla forces are drawn up from remnants of the Westemär military, veterans of the bloody Civil War, and brave volunteers who wish to restore the nation. The Hooded Lanterns' primary objective is to drive out the monsters that now inhabit Drakkenheim, hoping to rebuild the city. In the process, they search for any evidence, documents, or records left behind in the vaults of the city which might reveal a possible heir to the throne of Westemär.</p>\n<p>While the bulk of the Hooded Lanterns' forces are operating in Drakkenheim, soldiers from the regiment can be found throughout Westemär on important support, logistics, and recruitment missions. The contamination around Drakkenheim means the regiment relies entirely on food and water stores shipped to their strongholds, and they constantly need fresh recruits to replace their fallen. It's common to find several patriotic Hooded Lanterns in the taverns and market squares throughout the nation, trying to stoke national pride from able-bodied people to join their cause in Drakkenheim.</p>\n<h3>Lord Commander Elias Drexel</h3>\n<p>The leader of the Hooded Lanterns is<strong> Lord Commander Elias Drexel</strong>. He is a large, gruff man in his early fifties. He is well-built and imposing, with a grim frown on his wide, angular face. His harsh features are framed with a thick mustache, side chops, and a mane of long braided brown hair. He is often garbed in chainmail with heavy leather gloves and boots, worn under a fur-lined dark green cloak and iron pauldrons, upon which is firmly clasped the<em> Lord Commander's Badge.</em></p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I seldom take time for niceties and pleasantries. I prefer people to be direct and to the point.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I am loyal to my soldiers and expect the same in return. I do not often trust outsiders, but if they show their worth, I will treat them like my own.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My past is wrought with bloodshed and loss; and I feel intense guilt for every warrior who has died under my command. I seek redemption by staying true to what the Hooded Lanterns represent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I avoid talking about my past failures, and if it comes up I am quick to anger.\n</p>\n<p>Elias Drexel leads the Hooded Lanterns' mission to reclaim Drakkenheim and uncover a worthy successor to the throne of Westemär. He would love to have the financial support of House von Baden, but has a complicated relationship with Ludwig von Fritz, as the two were bitter foes during the Civil War. The Lord Commander receives moderate support from House Kleinkessel and the rulers of Geldstadt and Altbruke in his mission.</p>\n<p>The Lord Commander orchestrated the original failed incursions into Drakkenheim before the Civil War broke out, and during the war itself, he fought for Mannfred von Kessel. However, when Mannfred made it clear he no longer intended to retake Drakkenheim after the war, Elias Drexel secretly seethed over the lives lost there in vain. The Lord Commander joined the plot to assassinate Mannfred and his heirs, but did not expect Cecilia von Kessel to die soon after. Now, Drexel believes strongly it is his duty to make amends for the mistakes he caused. At the time he believed he was doing the right thing, but since the apparent end of the von Kessel line, he was left with nothing to fight for. The Hooded Lanterns represent a new purpose for Drexel, and a way to right the wrongs of his past.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Followers of the Falling Fire</h2>\n<p>The annihilation of Drakkenheim set off a serious religious schism within the faith of the Sacred Flame. A new sect has emerged known as the Followers of the Falling Fire, led by the charismatic words of Lucretia Mathias. The beliefs and practices of the Followers of the Falling Fire are described in the Gods and Religion section above.</p>\n<p>Most of the Followers of the Falling Fire are devout commonfolk distraught by the state of the world, fearful of the magic and monsters haunting their lands, and disillusioned by what they perceive as gross hypocrisies within the mainstream clergy of the Sacred Flame. Others are pilgrims from distant lands whose hearts have been stirred by the writings of Lucretia Mathias. Many among them see the Divine Matriarch not as the spiritual figurehead of their shared faith, but a foreign ruler trying to seize control of their nation by manipulating the tenets of the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias's hopeful and resolute message has given them a sacred purpose: Through humble actions and unwavering faith, one can find redemption and even change the world. It is a message that speaks to the despair and uncertainty of their times; that the smallest light burns brightly against the deepest darkness. Now, they travel the roads of Westemär towards Drakkenheim to take part in the Sacrament of the Falling Fire.</p>\n<p>Several prominent Flamekeepers in Westemär have joined the cause as well, and argue convincingly about the finer theological matters proposed by Lucretia Mathias with their congregations and fellow clergy. A few minor nobles have relinquished their domains to take the pilgrimage, but most higher-ranking nobles have avoided taking sides on the issue thus far.</p>\n<p>Demonstrations led by the Followers of the Falling Fire are held in city squares and outside chapels, and have led to violent altercations with mainline devotees of the Sacred Flame. The Followers of the Falling Fire often come into outright conflict with traveling Knights of the Silver Order dispatched from Elyria. Nevertheless, the Followers of the Falling Fire are determined, and their numbers are quickly swelling. Many more devout faithful will need to discover their fate in Drakkenheim to meet the coming darkness.</p>\n<h3>Lucretia Mathias</h3>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias is a powerful cleric of the Sacred Flame. Ever since she prophesied the meteor which destroyed Drakkenheim, her words and writing have galvanized the Followers of the Falling Fire. As she has been branded a fugitive and heretic by the Faith of the Sacred Flame, she currently takes refuge in the ruins of Drakkenheim with her most true-hearted and unswerving followers.</p>\n<p>Lucretia is a thin and aged woman in her early nineties. She has piercing eyes and pursed lips. She has long graying black hair often kept in a coiled bun beneath a linen shawl. She wears simple gray robes, and clutches a heavy leather-bound tome that contains the writings of her faiths and beliefs. A glowing golden crystal dangles from a silver chain around her neck. A soft glow in her chest can be seen through her robes from the delerium shard she has embedded into her heart. She is a mighty cleric of the Sacred Flame, and is among the few mortals alive in the world who can cast spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY]. She regards her divine spellcasting as a gift granted for sacred purposes, and only invokes such powerful magic to advance the cause of the Falling Fire.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I offer kindness and guidance to all who seek it, encouraging them towards the path of the Falling Fire. All who are lost simply need the guidance of the light to find their way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Faith is the highest calling. Through faith, the Sacred Flame shall light our glowing hearts as one, and carry us through the night into a new age.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I have seen the end of all things, but also the righteous path that we must follow to become the light when the darkness comes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> Others are not ready to know the full truths revealed to me. It can only be known fully by taking the Sacrament, otherwise they will never understand.\n</p>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias fervently works to convert others to believe the message and practices of the Falling Fire. She urges her followers to abandon their worldly lives and possessions, and make a devout pilgrimage to the ruins of Drakkenheim. Many die making the dangerous trek. However, those who reach the Crater's Edge partake in a controversial ritual known as the<em> Sacrament of the Falling Fire.</em> At the culmination of the ritual, believers impale a delerium crystal into their hearts. Those who survive are spiritually transformed and physically empowered, rendered immune to eldritch contamination and able to survive in the corrupted ruins of Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias has prophesied that hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of devoted followers will need to complete the pilgrimage to fulfill her prophecy. Once they do, the Sacred Flame will set alight every righteous mortal heart.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Queen's Men</h2>\n<p>The Queen's Men are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands, outlaws, and scoundrels, all owing fealty to the enigmatic Queen of Thieves. As Westemär now lacks any sort of a unified legal authority, criminal activities are able to operate with near-impunity and plunder the wealth of the nation. These rogues stalk the highways near Drakkenheim, robbing and extorting supply caravans, pilgrims, prospectors, and adventurers drawn to the city. The Queen's Men operate an extensive smuggling network who traffic delerium from the ruins of Drakkenheim through ports such as Drannsmund to disreputable clients in distant lands.</p>\n<h3>The Queen of Thieves</h3>\n<p>The Queen of Thieves is a scheming mastermind. She exerts control over a burgeoning criminal empire through manipulation, blackmail, and bribery, weaving a tangled conspiracy of sabotage and subterfuge against her enemies. So long as anarchy and lawlessness reign in Westemär, so shall the Queen of Thieves.</p>\n<p>The true identity of the Queen of Thieves is a mystery, for she wears many faces. She is known for her legendary ability to change her appearance at-will. Nevertheless, her most infamous persona is a masked swashbuckler dressed in a red and black leather coat, matching pants and cape, with a wide-brimmed red hat.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong><em></em> Information is my favorite form of currency. I speak with sly confidence, and like to flaunt my wealth in conversation by revealing the secrets I've stolen about others.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Payday comes from preparation, and I'm always two steps ahead. The truth can be more deadly than any blade, but it's all the more effective when you throw in a little twist.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I keep my friends close, and my enemies closer. If I can turn my foes to profitable purpose before I dispose of them, so much the better.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I trust no one, not even my closest allies… and anyone who would trust me is a fool. I'm a turncoat by nature, and I'm ready to meet any backstabbers with a betrayal of my own.\n</p>\n<p>None know where the diabolical schemes of the Queen of Thieves will lead, nor her true aim or agenda. Most believe she is little more than a ruthless criminal overlord who wants to seize power in wake of the devastation across Westemär, and style herself as the ruler of a bandit kingdom. Other rumors whisper she is a long-lost mageborn heir to the throne of Westemär, attempting to regain control of her broken kingdom. There are even stories that tell that she is not human at all, and in fact a creature from another plane musing at the folly of man and toying with mortal minds. Some suggest that there is no Queen of Thieves at all, but rather a fairytale brewed up by several canny outlaw bosses to foster fearful unity amongst their ranks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House von Baden</h2>\n<p>House von Baden rules Drannsmund, a position their family has held for generations. As such, their domains include the shores of Ash Bay and stretch halfway up the Crystal Coast. The foremost figures of the noble house are the Duke of Drannsmund himself, and his daughter, Verona von Baden.</p>\n<h3>Duke Valentin von Baden</h3>\n<p>A finely-dressed male human @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.OcJoakgBoM6FdYTj], Duke von Baden is a stately man in his mid-forties. After spending his youth adventuring among pirates in the Middle Sea, Valentin took up the mantle of the Duke of Drannsmund when his father and elder brother were slain in the early attempts to reclaim Drakkenheim. Now a shrewd admiral and diplomat, Duke von Baden chose discretion during the Civil War, remaining neutral throughout the conflict despite repeated entreaties from both sides of House von Kessel.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong><em></em> I conduct myself with professional savvy and charm, addressing others with their formal titles and proper names. I pepper my speech with nautical references and naval terminology.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><em></em> A good business sense, fair exchange, and mutual profit set the sails for a good relationship, whether in life, love, or politics.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><em></em> I must be a safe harbor to my city, its ships, and its people. Under my leadership, I will shelter them from the storm facing our times.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><em></em> Just as one must sail carefully on uncharted waters, one should regard new allies and situations carefully. It is better to remain distant and impartial, keeping along shallow waters, lest you become caught up in an unseen tempest far from shore.\n</p>\n<p>Duke von Baden now wrestles heavily on whether or not he should forbid the trade and export of delerium within his city. However, that could compromise his ambitions. Since he remained staunchly neutral during the Civil War, he has cold relationships with the other dukes and nobles. Valentin increasingly believes Drannsmund is best positioned as an independent city-state: a northern rival to the independent Liberio.</p>\n<h3>Lady Verona von Baden</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/064-pg47-verona-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Lady Verona von Baden\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/064-pg47-verona-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>The presumptive heir to House von Baden, Verona von Baden is a cunning human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.13K3XK2A3wwxVKLD] with many connections spread throughout Westemär. She is an athletic woman in her early twenties with wide brown eyes, tightly curled black hair, and soft features. She is known as having a good eye for money and is well-versed in politics and trade. She is responsible for many of the diplomatic arrangements, political discussions, and negotiations with other cities and rulers. Verona von Baden is often dressed in a white button up with a brown leather vest, dark trousers, and swashbuckling boots. She carries a shimmering rapier with an ornate golden hilt with an engraving of her family crest upon it. Like her father, she is an avid sailor and ship captain. Her own caravel is known as the<em> Rose of Thorns</em>, a ship built from rosewood with an ornate carved bouquet as its figurehead, white sails, and armed with canons. She has been at the helm of many sea battles, and her swift ship is known and feared by many.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong><em></em> I am a careful listener and observer, knowing what to say to make people around me feel at ease, and get what I need out of them. Kindness is a master manipulator.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Money can't buy you happiness, but the more of it you have, the less you need to worry. Having strong allies and good cash flow is the recipe for a happy life.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I am the best negotiator and smartest leader this city has ever had, and will prove myself invaluable to the people and my father.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> My overconfidence and desire to do things myself has seen me in over my head on multiple occasions, whether it be with a pirate's sword to my throat, a political debate, or captured by otherworldly monsters.\n</p>\n<p>Verona Von Baden has positioned herself as an incredible leader, both in naval expeditions and battles, but also in political debates and trade. She hopes to not only claim the duchy of Drannsmund after her father steps down, but prove to the people of the city her value as their leader. In doing so, she believes that if no successor is found to rule Westemär, her connections and alliances will ensure she will be the most obvious choice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House von Fritz</h2>\n<p>House von Fritz rules Todesfeld, and claims the lands around the Elfmire, the Achtungwald, and the Drann River as their domain. The family have been longtime rivals to House von Baden.</p>\n<h3>Duke Ludwig von Fritz</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/047-pg48-ludwig-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Duke Ludwig von Fritz\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/047-pg48-ludwig-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>The current head of the household is @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.VTx18xWVIM8oKeor], a cantankerous and covetous<strong> noble</strong> miser. The decrepit man is suffering from long-term delerium contamination, made worse by his reliance on an utter quack of a doctor who uses the duke to test his own tinctures.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I don't care for pleasantries and care even less for appearances, even my own. I speak openly about my thoughts, and can't resist the opportunity to belittle others' deeds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><em></em> I am tremendously pleased that the Civil War ultimately destroyed House von Kessel. Now, I can carve out the Marshlands as a petty kingdom of my own.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond</em></strong><em>.</em> I seethe over the destruction wrought upon Todesfeld as a result of the Civil War — not because of what has happened to the people of the city, mind you, but what it has done to my fortune ever since.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw</em></strong><em>.</em> There is nothing anyone can do to earn my respect or admiration other than money and power.\n</p>\n<p>Duke von Fritz's wife died several years ago of delerium contamination after the Todesfeld Dam broke. His eight children run their own estates, preferring to have as little contact as possible with their father. He eagerly took arms against Mannfred von Kessel during the Civil War. He eyes the port of Drannsmund and the city of Leuchten, and has begun eagerly purchasing weapons and armor from the Amethyst Academy hoping to increase his military prowess.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Kleinkessel</h2>\n<p>House Kleinkessel is a cadet branch of House von Kessel. The household formed shortly after Helena I took the throne to separate the royal household from their extended family in matters of succession. Nevertheless, the Kleinkessels have perhaps one of the stronger claims to the throne of Westemär since they can trace their ancestry back to Helena I. In fact, when the main House von Kessel line ended during the Civil War, they took up the royal family's ancestral castle in Kesselholm.</p>\n<h3>Constance Kleinkessel</h3>\n<p>Today, the ruler of House Kleinkessel is Countess @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.t23Lo6cg9BwL9yOU].

She has gleaming emerald eyes, crimson red lips, a flushed round face, and a small pointed nose. Her jet-black hair is tied up into braids and woven into an intricate headpiece set with pearls. She wears a scarlet gown and is dripping with jewelry. Her painted fingernails are sharpened into points. She often meets guests for dinner, where she licks her lips and runs her fingers on the edge of a cup of red wine.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I could eat you up.

Originally known as Camilla von Kessel, she has passed through a series of identities to hide her vampiric nature. Every few decades, she marries a hapless nobleman, slowly draining his life force so that he appears to expire from old age. Shortly thereafter, her so-called daughter inherits the estate and the cycle continues.</p>\n<p>During the Civil War, Constance Kleinkessel used her vampiric abilities to manipulate and scheme alongside Cecilia von Kessel and Lord Commander Elias Drexel to plot the murder of Mannfred von Kessel. She had planned to follow through and murder her co-conspirators, but the subsequent death of Cecilia von Kessel was an unexpected development: she had been planning to target Cecelia's future children with her replacement scheme to seize the throne of Westemär.</p>\n<p>Since undead creatures are not immune to the effects of delerium contamination, Constance Kleinkessel has also worked closely with her doctor, the malfeasant wizard Deidrick Mors, to experiment with new ways delerium can create augmented vampires.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“If there was a secret organization of vampires working in the shadows, the Academy and I would have uncovered it by now.

Around this time, several sought alternative means by which they could hide from the Academy, the Faith, and other nobles. Some willfully became vampires and formed the Night Court.</p>\n        <p>While occasionally rooted out by bold adventurers or knights of the Silver Order, the vampiric aristocracy has remained mostly hidden and intact for generations. They manipulate politics from the shadows, and rule over backwater domains from distant lonely castles.

The vampires secretly scheme to seize control of Westemär so they might dominate the living, keeping mortals like cattle for feeding.</p>\n        <p>However, few among them know the ultimate mastermind coordinating the efforts of the Night Court. Perhaps it is none other than Vladimir von Drakken himself, whose broken and cursed body has lain buried in a secret tomb for centuries since his daughter's betrayal, waiting for the day his undead form is fully restored.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</article>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Achtungwald</h2>\n<p>The largest forest in Westemär engulfs the heartland of the realm. Its edges begin on the Crystal Coast and stretch eastward towards Drakkenheim. The Drann River flows through its western side, bordering the northern reaches of the forest. This deep black forest is known for its towering trees of cedar, fir, and pines, with pockets of oak, maple, and other deciduous trees. The grasslands around Geldstadt and the Glimmerwash River separate it from the Kesselwald and the Brachenwald. A forest road connects Altbruke and Geldstadt, and allows travel south to Todesfeld and Leuchten. Although this highway passes through the peaceful forest town of Tierhaven, most travelers avoid this route, preferring to take the longer roads which circle the heart of the forest along the Drann River.</p>\n<p>In ancient days, druids conducted blood-rites beneath the full moon in the Achtungwald, and the forest is still a place where shapeshifters, fey, and otherworldly tricksters dwell. In the remote thickets of the darkest wood, one may even find ley lines and faery crossings into other realms.</p>\n<h3>Trethysia, the Forest Serpent</h3>\n<p>This @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GP8JMSDugRxuLOD2] dwelling in the Achtungwald is an elusive creature who has occupied the deepest and darkest center of the woods for hundreds of years. Trethysia narrowly avoided being drawn into the wars of House von Drakken, and has skillfully escaped countless Caspian dragonslayers. The dragon is a capable illusionist and can tap into the primal energies of the forest, and uses these powers to deceive and trick their foes and hunters. Now, they are quite content to live in solitude. There is an ancient ruined elven village in the heart of the forest that is said to be the dragon's home now, but from time to time the dragon is seen flying over the forests on raids, snatching livestock from the smaller farmsteads. However, Trethysia generally avoids direct confrontation with humans.</p>\n<p>Still, many a campfire story tells of the great elven treasures the dragon hoards inside those ancient ruins, and there are still those who remember Trethysia's treachery on the outskirts of Schaffburg, or the damage they did to the walls of Altbruke.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Elvenmire Wetlands</h2>\n<p>This great marsh formed at the drainage basin of the Drakeclaw Mountains, where hundreds of small streams collect into a sluggish wetland. Tall reeds, weeping trees, and rocky outcroppings jut out from shallow lakes and deep muddy fens.</p>\n<p>The wetland takes its name from the numerous ruins found throughout the marsh, many attributed to the ancient elves. There are slender towers which extend deep into the earth and are flooded by the marsh waters. Travelers wonder whether or not the elves originally constructed these ruins underground or if they are larger structures which sank into the bog. Many ruins consist of a plinth poking above the surface with a hatch which opens into a great chimney or shaft heading downward. However, the elves live here no longer; only their vengeful ghosts remain. Keening wails can be heard on nights of the new moon.</p>\n<p>The Elvenmire is also home to many wild creatures and beasts who haunt the misty wetlands. Rumors of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.OBujQLLPSmlJiZnL]{ghouls}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ZHAFrnCwCz17dmLc]{trolls}, and many other foul creatures have given the swamp a reputation for being a dangerous place to travel through.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Drakeclaw Mountains</h2>\n<p>The sharp-edged and blackened Drakeclaw Mountains are a volcanically active range. The ruthless and brutal environment has little vegetation, steep and dangerous slopes, and constant rockfalls, earth tremors, and magma flows. There are few roads and passes through the mountain, and most travelers make their way to Elyria from Westemär in the wide valley between the Drakeclaw and Glimmer Mountains instead.</p>\n<p>The greatest peak of the Drakeclaw Mountains is the terrible Dragon's Maw, a colossal volcano. Its destructive eruptions have caused devastation throughout Elyria and Westemär throughout history, sending cinder, smoke, and ash out into the lands for hundreds of miles. Thankfully, such catastrophic events have only occurred twice in the past thousand years.</p>\n<p>In ancient days, the mountains were populated by countless red dragons, including the very ones which made the first blood-pacts with the sorcerer-kings of old. Today, the Caspian Scalebreaker Legion have driven out many of the old dragons, but some still slumber here.</p>\n<h3>Vulmungoth, Doom of the Mountain</h3>\n<p>This @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.vFeFRlF2FOgf2HIL] resides in the caldera of the Dragon's Maw. The dragon has lived here since before recorded history, and spends decades at a time slumbering.</p>\n<p>Vulmungoth rarely stirs in their lair. The caldera is so inhospitable, most would-be dragon slayers die scaling the volcano. Still, they emerge every century or so to slake their vast appetite, flying down into Elyria to consume mortals and their livestock. Their waking always follows great eruptions from the Dragon's Maw, and many towns and villages are destroyed. Thus, the locals living south of the Drakeclaws grow up with well-made plans for their evacuation and escape should the dragon return. During their last rampage, the dragon descended upon Holy Lumen in a horrible encounter that almost saw Saint Tarna's Cathedral destroyed.</p>\n<p>Vulmungoth is the last surviving dragon who was a part of the ancient Blood Pact, where the sorcerer-kings melded their bloodlines with draconic magic. Today many sorcerers and dragonborn can trace their distant ancestry to Vulmungoth.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the fall of the sorcerer-kings, a group of monks of the Sacred Flame attempted to ascend the Dragon's Maw and destroy Vulmungoth for their ties to the Arcane Empire. The dragon devoured most of them. Only a small handful of monks made it off the mountains. The resounding defeat ended the organized attempts by Elyria to defeat the Doom of the Mountain.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Glimmer Mountains</h2>\n<p>The Glimmer Mountains rest along the south east of Westemär, separating the nation from Caspia. This large stretch of great snow-capped mountains is home to the tallest summits on the continent. On a sunny day, the icy peaks shine and gleam in the light, which may be why they have their name, but a more likely reason is the large deposits of silver, gold, coal, and gemstones. When the dwarves first returned to the surface, they built some of their first citadels along the peaks. While few remain occupied today, many dwarven communities remain in the foothills.</p>\n<h3>Ruins of Glitter Peak</h3>\n<p>The most glorious and famous dwarven keep was built on Glitter Peak — a massive stone-carved city protruding from the pinnacle of what was once the tallest mountain in the world. If the dwarves ever had anything resembling a true empire, Glitter Peak was certainly its capital. The city was home to thousands, and was said to descend deep through the mountain and miles into the earth below. Brilliant dwarven engineering constructed a vast network of pipelines, levers, and tunnels that established wondrous water-based lifts stretching down the mountain, which allowed the dwarves to easily haul mined ores from dizzying heights. Dwarven greybeards tell how the entire side of the mountain was carved out to house foundries, workshops, and homes. Even the lower valley was part of this great dwarven realm, which fought bitterly to maintain its independence against the Arcane Empire.</p>\n<p>Today, however, the great dwarven city lies in ruin. Glitter Peak collapsed in a massive landslide which destroyed the city over a thousand years ago. Accounts differ on what exactly caused the disaster. Many claim dwarves grew greedy, and hollowed out the mountainside to a point where it could not sustain its own weight. Others believe the city was destroyed by a magical earthquake conjured by a vengeful sorcerer-king. Either way, since the city's destruction, the dwarves no longer live high in the mountain, and instead keep to the lower valley and foothills. Others moved to communities spread throughout the continent and adopted more traditional lifestyles as smiths or masons. The ruins of Glitter Peak now stand as a grim reminder to the dwarven people of their lost glory. Who can say what untold treasures and wonders of dwarven engineering lie buried beneath the mountain?</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Drann River</h2>\n<p>The Drann River has been essential to trade, travel, and agriculture in Westemär. This long wide river meanders through the heartland of the nation. Its headwaters begin at Lake Dray, and it collects from a network of tributaries that cross Westemär. In many places, the river is hundreds of feet wide, large enough for small ships to travel along it usually carrying goods downstream from the inner regions of Westemär towards Ash Bay.</p>\n<p>Now, however, for all of its length from Drakkenheim to Drannsmund, the river is contaminated with delerium. The farms and villages that rely on the river for irrigation are slowly dying, as their populations are stricken with sickness and corruption they cannot understand, let alone cure. Fresh water still flows into the river from many smaller tributaries, preventing a complete collapse of agriculture in the heartland of Westemär, for now. Still, it is only a matter of time before the spreading corruption from Drakkenheim makes everyday life in Westemär a desperate struggle for survival.</p>\n<p>Strange stories and rumors emerge weekly of odd occurrences along the farms and small communities along the Drann River. Misshapen monsters, mutated wildlife, trees moving in odd and unusual ways, grass becoming pale and brittle, farm animals dying of old age only a few years into their life, and strange motes of unnatural colors and hues drifting over the land are common sightings. Wealthy families have moved further inland from the river, but most have nowhere else to go. Beholden to their family plots, these poor folk are increasingly falling ill and losing their minds dwelling along the contaminated river.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Ash Bay</h2>\n<p>Ash Bay forms where the Drann River empties into the ocean. As such, a well-known saying in Westemär claims that “all that is Westemär flows to Ash Bay”. Indeed, the bay is the nation's epicenter for fishing and ocean trade. Ash Bay houses the port city of Drannsmund and the fishing village of Ashshaffen, along with countless smaller villages and fishing ports.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to anyone is the fact that Ash Bay now harbors the largest concentration of delerium anywhere on the continent outside of Drakkenheim. Deep beneath the bay around the wreck of the<em> Empress Geraldine</em>, an otherworldly octarine reef formed by delerium crystals is slowly growing. Indeed, the contaminated Drann River has been constantly carrying fragments and small chunks of delerium downstream.</p>\n<p>As the saying goes, so too has the contamination, haze, and madness of Drakkenheim seeped into the waters of Ash Bay. This corrupted reef has begun to warp and change much of the sea life in the area. Below the surface of the waters, something sinister is gaining sentience and plotting its domination over the people of Ash Bay.</p>\n<h3>The Duchess</h3>\n<p>This horrific monstrosity is larger than a whale. It has a long, serpentine body bristling with sleek fins, undulating barbed tentacles, and rubbery purple-black flesh. It writhes through the waves with unearthly grace despite its bulk, and seeping from the flaps and vents within its skin come secretions of a thick, oozing oil which shimmers with prismatic hues. The monstrosity has a gigantic fanged maw which it holds agape. Seaweed, fish entrails, and slime dribble from between its sharp teeth, and its bulbous eyes glow with octarine light. It has adorned its brow with fishing nets, coral, sea debris, and delerium crystals, as if wearing a coronet and jewelry. As you look upon its form, you feel a slight headache, a buzzing in your ear, and a pressing in your chest; as if the psychic presence of this otherworldly creature has conjured up the crushing pressure of the abyssal depths.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ewmEdvGsruhwPxSQ] is a contaminated sea monster that haunts the shores of Ash Bay (see @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.book.JournalEntry.drakscgd05append] for its game statistics and those of its minions). The creature originally made its home in the sewer cisterns of Drakkenheim. However, as @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ewmEdvGsruhwPxSQ] matured and grew larger, it departed the cursed city via the Drann River in search of more plentiful prey and fresh thralls, bringing a new wave of contamination to Ash Bay. It deliberately destroyed the<em> Empress Geraldine</em> just off the coast of Drannsmund; the merchant vessel was transporting a vast hoard of delerium to the far continent. The Duchess has slowly tended the new reef of delerium coral flourishing around the shipwreck, transforming it into a personal underwater palace.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> “What horrific condition afflicts the land-dwellers! How awful must it be that you cannot live and languish in the wonderful sea… such a terrible curse which keeps you bound to the land…”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> “My magic will weaken the curse which holds you to the land, so you might swim through the waves of my court, and be welcomed as one of my loyal subjects! Perhaps you will be worthy enough to become one of my valiant Knights!”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><em></em> “Come see the wondrous treasures of my Grotto! Gaze upon the opalescent, prismatic beauty of my prized coral… you may hold it in your hands, for a while, if you wish…”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> “I abhor the land, and will never set scale or fin upon it.”\n</p>\n<p>The Duchess has powerful and otherworldly psychic powers. They can communicate telepathically, read the thoughts of mortals, and turn mortals into its contaminated thralls. It makes deceptive offers that appeal to characters' deepest desires, manipulating them into embracing contamination. Those under its control slowly mutate, taking on horrific aquatic features.</p>\n<p>The Duchess has seized control over the population of Ashshaffen, where it summons its worshipers at the Salt Cove Shrine, an underground cavern beneath the ruined chapel in town. The monster is now slowly spreading its tendrils of influence over Drannsmund.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the creature has dispatched one of its more capable thralls to the Starwatch Lighthouse. There, the Duchess hopes to open a dimensional rift so she can conjure other beings like itself, styling itself no longer as a duchess — but an empress.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Starwatch Lighthouse</h2>\n<p>A few hundred meters from the cliffs of the Crystal Coast along Ash Bay rests an ancient and mysterious lighthouse made from shimmering greenish-blue stone. The locals call it “the lighthouse,” but there is no shining beacon at its pinnacle. It consists of two soaring towers which rise from a central dome, built upon a massive pillar of rock which juts out from the ocean. A small bridge joins the two spires at the very top, where the pillars end in rounded rooftops. Though worn by time and the elements, the outer facade is entirely smooth. Not a single window is found along the height of the building, and there is no apparent entrance from the ground floor. None know who keeps it, though legend claims it is an elven ruin. Today, nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out. Perhaps the entire construction is solid rock, a great edifice built by forgotten elves for an unknown purpose.</p>\n<p>This lighthouse has been the subject of many local legends and superstitions, attributing it both to ancient and forgotten worshipers of Nodens or Phantasia. In truth, the Ash Bay lighthouse is an elven ruin, built in bygone times before the elves lost their memories. It magically anchors the energies of several convergent ley lines and thin places in the region. Inside the great dome at the base of the tower is one of the fabled Elfgates where the elven nomads arrived in this world.</p>\n<p>The elf-tower is a colossal structure. The rocky island off the coast itself is about one hundred feet tall, and the building rises to a height of three hundred feet above it. There is no obvious entrance from the ground floor outside: the only way in is via the small stone doors found on either end of the bridge connecting the two towers.</p>\n<p>The massive towers are full of strange and hidden chambers. Some have a recognizable purpose: stone plinths used for elven meditative trances, common rooms, and magical fonts that conjure fresh water and a nutritious thin broth. Other chambers are strange workshops, ritual rooms, and scrying chambers where erratic arcane runes glimmer through the air in an unknown elven script, but whose meaning hints at dire warnings. Another chamber is a great archive, where every book is a blank slate of glass and strange metal. Runes glimmer upon the surface before the reader, but whatever knowledge or messages that were here are now lost. The runes only display gibberish.</p>\n<p>At the base of the lighthouse rests the Elfgate itself, a huge circular pool of alien liquid, powered by stone arches that channel arcane energy from embedded delerium crystals. These stones did not come from Drakkenheim: the elves brought them here from their unknown home. Unfortunately, those who knew the techniques used to activate the Elfgate are long gone and unremembered. However, there is indeed a lone occupant here:</p>\n<h3>Valtar Banemoon</h3>\n<p>Floating gemstones orbit about the head of this ancient and wispy elf @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]; their magic has sustained him for thousands of years. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.X1Uzv8VQYvPIKjLd] is the hermetic lighthouse keeper, and has not left the lighthouse in millennia. He knows little of the world beyond, and even less about how he got here.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I haven't spoken to anyone in… well, ever. If I got the chance, I would love to know everything about them and their world.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><em></em> I remember a time when many elves were here, and have dim visions of them passing through a faery-gate, anguished and tired, refugees from an unknown cataclysm which destroyed our world. I know not what has happened to them, but I hope beyond hope they are safe and thriving.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I was charged to protect and guard this place, but why I cannot recall…. What was lost, that wondrous place… Acadia. The name is the only thing I can remember, and I hold on to that memory dearly.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><em></em> The pang of missing memory is palpable. I struggle to remember anything.\n</p>\n<p>Valtar Banemoon has never had any visitors, and is uneasy about leaving his post. He knows that he was born on another world and traveled to this earth, but remembers nothing else of that time. If convinced to leave the lighthouse and enter the world, though, perhaps it may be possible to unlock his memory and learn the great mystery of the elven people.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Crystal Coast</h2>\n<p>The Crystal Coast takes its name for the many salt deposits along its shores, which have been an important industry for Westemär. Stretching from Ashshaffen to Heilig, this coast is made of rocky beaches, cold ocean air, and consistent storms and rain. It is known to be one of the colder stretches of land in Westemär, and a rather dreary place to live. Still, the coast is dotted with small fishing communities and settlements. Many of Nodens's faithful gather at stone circles built along the stormy seaside to pay tribute to the god of storms and sea.</p>\n<p>Recently, many fishing boats and sailors have been vanishing after setting out from the Crystal Coast. Storms of oddly-colored lightning and booming thunder have been reported, and rumors of ghost ships and strange monstrosities lurking in the depths have begun to spread throughout the coast. Some believe Nodens is upset with the people of Westemär for one reason or another, and people are growing wary of sending their loved ones out to sea when the skies aren't perfectly clear.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Drannsmund</h2>\n\n<img class=\"float-right region-symbol\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/147-pg53-von-badenbrooch-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/147-pg53-von-badenbrooch-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the Bay Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 43,000</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duke Valentin von Baden</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance</strong>: Neutral</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Harbor District, Shipyards,<br />Major Commercial Hub, International Trade,<br />Crabs, Pearls</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Built where the wide mouth of the Drann River opens into Ash Bay, the bustling harbor of Drannsmund is filled with countless ships, galleons, and trade caravels.

Sailors, merchants, and all manner of travelers from far and wide bargain around elegant shopping arcades and share in a lively cultural life.

Even before the fall of Drakkenheim, the city was an important economic hub. Drannsmund has benefited considerably despite the hardships facing the nation as a whole thanks to its geographic position, powerful fleet, and the shrewd, level-headed rule of House von Baden. The people of Drannsmund are beginning to think of their city as a potential new capital for Westemär, or perhaps even the heart of an independent nation of their own.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the city is not without its problems. After running through the corrupted ruins of Drakkenheim for fifteen years, the waters of the Drann River have become thoroughly contaminated, and the once-prosperous fishing around Ash Bay is starting to fail. Ocean-bound trade still thrives largely in part because Drannsmund is now the ideal place for smugglers and prospectors to bring delerium harvested from Drakkenheim. The strange stones move through Drannsmund to markets in distant lands and far continents, where it may fetch prices even beyond those offered by the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<p>While House von Baden has profited greatly from taxing this trade, smugglers and malfeasant mages making black market deals for delerium have spurred increased crime and violence in the streets. Meanwhile, monsters and other horrors are beginning to take root beneath the harbor and sewers of Drannsmund, and a thick mist swirling with prismatic motes now looms over Ash Bay. If it one day rolls in upon the port city, Drannsmund may face the same fate as Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Baden Castle.</em></strong> Perched upon a rocky cliff overlooking the city and the bay, this estate of House von Baden is less a fortification and more a palatial manor. Here, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.D9e4W6lbpJ7qzIqP] holds court. The estate looms over Ash Bay with massive balconies decorated with stone carved statues and gargoyles. The brick building with its bright blue roof and white trim surrounding the windows and doors can be seen from anywhere in Drannsmund.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Harbor and Shipyards.</em></strong> Harbormaster Dogberry oversees the daily operations of the port, keeping meticulous records of every ship and its cargo. Though he feels himself a man of great importance to House von Baden, he has never personally met the duke.\n</p>\n<p>The shipyard is often filled with large sailing ships, travelers from the Isles of Skye, trade boats from Elyria, and even some from across the ocean. There is never a quiet moment amongst the sprawling docks and harbor.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Saint Jordana's Cathedral.</em></strong> High Flamekeeper Marselle recently converted to the Falling Fire and is now at odds with the other Flamekeepers who manage the smaller chapels throughout Drannsmund. With her conversion, a number of her congregation have begun to set out on pilgrimages of their own, and slowly the Followers of the Falling Fire are becoming much more commonplace in Drannsmund than previously suspected.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Shrine of Nodens.</em></strong> On the edge of the cliff overlooking Ash Bay is a small shrine to Nodens. The statue of the god is adorned with seashells and starfish. Fish guts are placed daily upon the shoulders of the statue to attract gulls to perch and feast. Bogdan Strangewayes, an old hermit and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.K15Yl8JmB5iPircc]{druid} of the Old Faith lives in a small shack nearby.

The double doors at the entrance have carvings of a large @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.kVg37NlPcACAzjCT] upon them, with two of its tentacles protruding as handles. The lobby has a great painted ceiling showing two krakens embracing one another. The lounge features paintings of nautical themes, ship battles, and stormy ocean waters decorating the walls and a grand staircase leading to the suites splits like waves upon a massive statue of a kraken carved out of marble.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Todesfeld</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the Marshlands Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 38,000</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duke Ludwig von Fritz</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Cecilia von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Todesfeld Dam, Major Industrial Hub, Workshops, Factories, Coal Mines</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Across the flat marshlands you spot the great and monstrous thing which is the City of Todesfeld. The partially-flooded city is built where the Drann River meets the Elfmire. A huge array of watermills surrounds the ramshackle city of workshops, collieries, blast furnaces, rolling mills. The high chimneys pour out thick, black soot which shape the skyline.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>All manner of mills, workshops, and water pumps fill the city of Todesfeld with the constant thrum of industry. Here, rich coals extracted from mud-slick mine shafts fuel dozens of smelters, foundries, and forges constructing steel weapons and equipment, and their spindly chimneys spew black smoke across the city.</p>\n<p>Todesfeld is a grimy and grim city decaying from within from pollution and ravages brought on during the Civil War. The humid heat and smog make it hard to breathe, the noise is constant, dirt and filth coat the city, and the wafting smells of industry, sweat, rotting wood, and moss-covered concrete fill the air. Most people living in Todesfeld walk the streets carrying lanterns to see through the thick industrial fog, and wear large coats pulled up around their mouths and noses.</p>\n<p>Todesfeld was once the site of a great stone dam built across the Drann River, which powered water mills used by the industries of the city. However, during the Civil War, an irregular mercenary company was dispatched to blast apart the dam and sabotage the city's production. Hundreds were killed in the aftermath, and the city has not fully recovered. Waters still fill the streets in the low parts of the city and streets have wooden boardwalks so residents do not get stuck in the mud. Many houses lie in ruin, and newer homes are built on stilts to avoid the knee-deep water that fills a large portion of the city, while older buildings have been reinforced with concrete foundations. Locals know not to drink the water of the Drann since it flows directly down river from Drakkenheim. Most attempt to avoid touching it at all costs. Contamination and eldritch creatures lurk in the backstreets and slums of Todesfeld.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ruins of Todesfeld Dam.</em></strong> The crumbling dam is now mostly submerged in the waters of the Drann River, as are the lower river banks of the city, and over a dozen riverside homes. The stone and concrete structure was once the pride of Todesfeld, and much of the residential district was along the riverbanks. The city still hasn't fully recovered from the tragic destruction to some degree. The dam was never rebuilt and the crumbling stone wall now sits as a monument to the catastrophic outcome of the Civil War of Westemär and the impact it had on the cities it touched.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Coal Mines.</em></strong> Duke Ludwig has ordered the continued operation of his many coal mines just outside Todesfeld proper. The flooding of the city caused many mine shafts to fill with contaminated water, and those that are still open are damp caverns filled with thick mud, contaminated fumes, and are prone to collapse. Despite this, the coal has kept flowing and the duke seems uncaring for the many miners who lose their lives trapped in the mines. Workers are forced to run water pumps around the clock to drain the mines so operations can continue. Still, the normally hazardous mines have become even more dangerous since the flooding, but many rely on them to make their livings and feed their families, and so work continues all the same.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Saint Rosalind's Cathedral.</em></strong> On a hill surrounded by flood waters on Smoke Street sits an austere cathedral to the Sacred Flame. The cathedral is tended by High Flamekeeper Irma, an elderly woman who has served as Todesfeld's High Flamekeeper for fifty years. She was thankful when the flood waters did not take the cathedral, and she was able to keep the brazier burning for those seeking aid and guidance during those dreary times. However, the cathedral did not go completely unscathed, for the lower crypts underneath are now flooded with contaminated water. Delerium has seeped into the dead that rest there, reanimating them as undead horrors. No longer fit to battle them herself, and unwilling to risk the lives of her acolytes, Irma sealed the doors to the lower crypts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Taverns.</em></strong> Several well-known taverns are frequent stops for travelers and locals alike in the city, but few stay more than a night in Todesfeld. The Gavel and Gauntlet on Chisel Street is free of most of the muck and decay of the low town, and is a well-appointed tap house frequented by many travelers and locals of higher class. The Drowning Cat and Smoke Street Flophouse in Low Town are just above the water level and are popular stops for workers after a long day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Castle Sodden</em></strong><em>.</em> The manor of House von Fritz, this dilapidated castle clings to the only bit of solid rock in the muck and mud surrounding it. According to legend, the castle has sunk into the swamp at least three times. The entire building leans noticeably to the left as one approaches and the entire interior is slightly skewed, with chandeliers, book cases, drapes, and tablecloths all tilting mildly to one direction. Walking the halls gives one a sense of unease due to the uneven floors. The tallest tower of the castle is off-limits due to it being completely collapsed within.\n</p>\n<p>The area surrounding the castle is filled with tufts of tall reeds protruding occasionally from the swampy mud, and is filled with flies and mosquitoes. A wooden boardwalk leads to the castle from Todesfeld. One step off the crude and warped boardwalk will find travelers knee deep in sticky, suctioning mud. A single lantern hangs outside the massive doors to the castle so one can find their way through the mist.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Leuchten</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right region-symbol\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/128-pg54-von-kessel-heraldry-final-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/128-pg54-von-kessel-heraldry-final-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the Gap</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately 10,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Baron Boris the Bold, a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Cecilia von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Impressive Fortifications, Siege Workshops</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>A great fortress-city rises up in the flat valley flanked by the Drakeclaw Mountains to the west and the Glimmer Mountains to the east.

Despite its impressive defenses, it has fallen twice — though never to a direct assault. When Albrecht von Drakken died in battle amidst his failed invasion of Caspia, the Scalebreakers broke against the walls and guns of Leuchten in their retaliatory attack. During the Mage Wars, the city was briefly captured thanks to a forged document, and fell again thanks to adventurous mercenaries during a minor conflict between Westemär and Liberio.</p>\n<p>Given the strategic importance of Leuchten, the city does not have an ancestral noble house as its traditional ruler. Rather, the monarchs of Westemär have typically assigned title and authority to one of their top military figures, or, as is more often the case, a problematic royal sibling who needs a distant but seemingly important assignment far away from the politics of the capital. It was previously under the rule of Cecilia von Kessel, but since her death the city is now controlled by her former general, Baron Boris the Bold.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Geldstadt</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of Achtungwald Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 20,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duchess Ursula von Syndow</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Mannfred von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Gold Mines, Orchards, Opera House, Cultural Hub</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Throughout the city of Geldstadt, twinkling orange-red street lamps line the cobblestone roads as they weave between townhomes adorned with plush purple curtains.

The walled city is well-known for its elegant urban architecture, and home to many exotic specialist craftspeople catering to affluent tastes, such as artists, sculptors, jewelers, toymakers, and tinkers. Most notably, the city is home to several galleries, hotels, theaters, and an opera house, giving it a vibrant cultural life.</p>\n<p>During the early days of this thriving town, all of the gold, jewels, and other wealth flowing from the mines in Glitter Peak first passed through Geldstadt. Due to the rich deposits within the mountains, the Glitterwash River made for excellent gold panning as well.</p>\n<p>However, Geldstadt is not without its issues. Its rulers have struggled to maintain their desired standard of perfection within the nearby towns and villages along the forest, especially when collecting taxes and levies. Since the fall of Drakkenheim, Duchess Ursula von Syndow has been hesitant to admit that her coffers are running low. Trade has dwindled considerably as few goods travel through the city towards Drakkenheim anymore. The city is starting to show its cracks to those who look closely enough, and the dangers and horrors of Drakkenheim are creeping ever closer to their doorstep.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Altbruke</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the River Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 18,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duke Malcador Engelhart</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Mannfred von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Altbruke University, Printing Presses, Coffee Houses</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Straddling a wide expanse of the Drann River is a great curved causeway of stone.

As a result, it is a hotbed for new philosophies and political ideas. Most recently, the topic of “alternative systems of governance,” a strange notion known as “democracy,” and “representation of the people” have become popular topics amongst the student body, much to the consternation of Duke Malcador Engelhart.</p>\n<p>The city was captured during the Civil War of Westemär, during which the university was heavily damaged and the famous bridge nearly collapsed. Duke Malcador was able to maintain control and suffered minor losses, and has spent the years since repairing and modernizing the northern side of the city.

Arcane instruction is expressly forbidden; under the Edicts of Lumen only the Amethyst Academy may operate a mage school. Representatives from the Amethyst Academy regularly audit the collections and curriculum of the university to ensure no tome of magical lore has fallen into its stacks. Nevertheless, many apothecaries attend Altbruke University to study medicine and anatomy, while secretly pursuing occult research on their own.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Heilig</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the North Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 17,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duchess Sophia von Schneesturm</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Mannfred von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Copper, Gemstones, Rugged Land, Temples to the Old Faith</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Heilig looms dauntingly along the northern coast of Westemär.

Lately, no one has been leaving their homes at night. Reports of wolf attacks, large bats, and a strange glow coming from the lower windows of the castle have been the source of much of the gossip in the town.

Home to the Holy City of Lumen, the spark of the Sacred Flame was lit here. Indeed, the people of Elyria claim civilization itself was born in the fertile river valley between the fiery Drakeclaw Mountains and the Witherbleach Desert. There, along the lush banks of the Vita River, humanity laid the first foundations of its cities. For many, the story of Elyria is the story of humanity itself, for in these lands human beings have performed their greatest deeds and their most enduring cruelties. In ancient days, the lands of modern-day Elyria made up the core of the mighty Arcane Empire. Lumen was once called Nox, where its despotic rulers dominated the people of the continent.</p>\n<p>However, today Elyrians have purged the blood-soaked legacy of the Arcane Empire with the fire of faith. They do not claim to be the successors of that horrific regime. Instead, Elyrians regard themselves as the descendants of righteous revolutionaries who threw off the shackles of tyranny, brought justice to the oppressed, and seized control of their own destiny.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Elyria occupies a wide peninsula; the east coast meets the Middle Sea, and the western coast lies along the ocean. The heartland of Elyria stretches along the Vita River, where fertile flood plains and grassy prairies are broken up by arid hills and a mountainous coast. Nestled within are pockets of pinewood forests and orchards of olive trees. It has a diverse temperate climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. As such, agriculture thrives in Elyria. Beyond bountiful harvests of grain and maize, orchards, vineyards, pastures, and ranches form the core industries in most communities. The coasts are rich with a wide range of marine fishing. Furthermore, Elyrians often cultivate large crops used for textiles, such as cotton, and several communities keep colonies of silkworms. The land becomes a dry rocky desert towards the southern end of the peninsula, where the Pale Tooth mountains mark a firm border around the Southern Reaches.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Elyria is the most populous nation on the Continent, home to nearly 14 million people. The nation boasts many of the largest cities in the known world, but the vast majority of its people live in rural villages along the coasts and the Vita River.</p>\n<p>Humans make up most of the population in Elyria. As the Faith of the Sacred Flame took root here, many people with arcane ancestries, such as elves and tieflings, opted to leave Elyria for other lands more welcoming to them.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>Lumen, formerly called Nox, is the capital city of Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Government</h2>\n<p>Elyria is a theocracy in all regards but name. For generations, the Faith of the Sacred Flame has influenced almost every aspect of culture, society, and law throughout the nation. However, Elyria itself was born out of a league of city-states, emerging as a feudal monarchy with absolute primogeniture. The Divine Matriarch would traditionally crown the monarch of Elyria and offer the ruler close counsel, and so the faith and government have always been closely entwined. As leader of the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the Divine Matriarch has traditionally been regarded as a pillar of wisdom, truth, and justice, and historically is often called upon to mediate difficult political matters.</p>\n<p>Yet any remaining semblance of separation between church and state began to rapidly dissolve over a century ago, when the royal line of Elyria went extinct following the death of the last true Elyrian monarch, King Marcus Zachary II. In its place, a parliament was assembled from the ninety-nine most powerful and influential Elyrian lords, and the Divine Matriarch would choose one amongst their number to act as Lord Regent every six years. Together, the noble parliament and the Lord Regent would serve as a ruling body for the nation. The Lord Regent would act in place of a hereditary monarch, but only wear the<em> Crown of Elyria</em> when it was deemed necessary by the consensus of the Parliament of Lords.</p>\n<p>Today, while the current @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5] is not officially the head of the state, few decisions are made without her blessing and direct counsel. Many predecessors to Mercy V have used their power to select a line of caretaker regents who defer to the Faith on virtually all matters of state. While members of the clergy take vows of poverty that preclude them from holding actual political station, the parliament is now mostly made up of fundamentalist nobles staunchly loyal to the religion, and the Lord Regent is almost always a close relative of a prominent High Flamekeeper or the Divine Matriarch. Indeed, the current Lord Regent, Polonius Reed is no exception. As a result, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5] wields de facto political authority in Elyria.</p>\n<h3>Noble Ranks</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Lord Regent.</strong> As Elyria no longer has a true monarchy, the Lord Regent holds the highest office in their stead. Technically, the Lord Regent is selected from amongst the most powerful dukes and duchesses of Elyria.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Duke or Duchess.</em></strong> The dukes and duchesses of Elyria are often descended from the rulers of the original city-states of the Elyrian League.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Earls.</em></strong> Vassals of Elyrian dukes with holdings over country manors and estates in smaller towns and settlements.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Gentry.</em></strong><em></em> Elyria has a large number of urban nobles who are quite wealthy, but who do not have large land claims of their own.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Elyrian Cabinet</h3>\n<p>The Elyrian Royal Council was reorganized into the Cabinet after the establishment of the Parliament of Lords. It consists of the following individuals:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5]</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.r3vkm5QcTHpVp87P]</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.vpjLiSZqbJ1sIA5S]</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.edFqywMzmWglHpE1]{Archmage Xel'vohca the Ancient}</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.gPHQ4Uk24kPluaAf]</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.aoWNtpr7Zfrw2UMk]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the past, the Divine Matriarch would appoint a High Flamekeeper to sit on this council as the representative of the Faith, but since the assassination of her predecessor, Mercy V has been directly on the Cabinet. Similarly, the role of Master Commander was filled by the High Paladin of the Silver Order.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>The Faith of the Sacred Flame began in Elyria, and its capital, Lumen, is the holy city of the religion. As a result, the Faith's most deeply orthodox adherents are found in Elyria. Even the few Elyrians who do not follow the Sacred Flame are very familiar with its beliefs, tenets, and myths.</p>\n<p>Professing faith openly is a major facet of Elyrian culture. People speak prayers and give thanks to the Sacred Flame throughout their day, and offer blessings to their friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Children grow up hearing the tales of Saint Tarna's deeds, and Flamekeepers teach youths to read and write using passages from the<em> Song of Fire.</em> Elyrian residences place emphasis on having a roaring hearth, bonfire pit, or fireplace which acts as a household altar to the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<p>The annual calendar is planned around the high holy days of the religion, and devout Elyrians attend services and hymns at their chapels regularly. Important civic events and gatherings, such as weddings, funerals, and other celebrations are often held within chapels and ministered by a local @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT] or @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]. People hold clamorous outdoor receptions in the evenings with wine and roasts, where they sing and dance before sparkling flames.</p>\n<p>Small settlements which might only feature a modest shrine to the Sacred Flame in another nation frequently have splendid chapels in Elyria, and cathedral domes define city skylines. Monasteries where the clergy dwell are spread throughout the countryside, and the diligent, masterful craftwork often taken up by the monks and priests form an important part of the Elyrian economy.</p>\n<p>In Elyria, having a family member amongst the clergy is both highly regarded and extremely prestigious — an important political and social asset. Daughters of Elyrian nobility often grow up with intense pressure from their families to foster their devotion and study scripture in the hopes they might be able to channel the divine powers of the Sacred Flame. The few who do are encouraged to take up a position as a Flamekeeper in the clergy, even though the vows of poverty associated with the religious hierarchy means disavowing their noble inheritance and lifestyle.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“Do you like the Sacred Flame? You're going to love Elyria! Do you not like the Sacred Flame? Best pretend you do. Flame be with you... and so forth.”</blockquote>\n<h3>Other Faiths</h3>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the worship of the Old Gods has been almost entirely expelled from the heartlands of Elyria, with barely a stone left upon their ancient shrines. Many who live in Lumen and other large cities are not tolerant of other religious beliefs at all. Most mistakenly think those who follow the old gods are dangerous cultists who traffic with capricious fey and evil fiends.</p>\n<p>The few stalwart worshipers of the Old Gods who dwell in Elyrian cities generally keep their beliefs secret, because they know they risk violence from their superstitious neighbors for having a different religion. While the laws of Elyria do not expressly prohibit people from having their own private beliefs and maintaining personal altars in their own homes, they also do not protect those who hold such beliefs from discrimination, harassment, and assault, especially when in public. Indeed, temples to the Old Gods are not permitted within Elyrian towns and cities, and the public display of holy symbols and religious rituals of the Old Gods are also banned. Offenders can be fined, flogged, have their property seized, and ultimately be banished or executed for flouting the blasphemy law common in most Elyrian cities. However, the reach of such laws diminishes towards the southern coast and deserts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Military</h2>\n<p>Although the Divine Matriarch has great power, commanding the conventional military forces of Elyria is not within her direct authority. Elyria still retains a largely feudal military structure — lords and other nobles form their own armies drawn from local levies. The Divine Matriarch relies on the loyalty of these lords when they require a large army.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/115-pg62-silver-order-paladin-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Silver Order paladin\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/115-pg62-silver-order-paladin-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<h3>Knightly Orders</h3>\n<p>The Faith of the Sacred Flame sponsors several anointed knightly orders. Perhaps the most famous is the Silver Order. These knightly orders are the militant arm of the Faith, and not formally a part of the Elyrian military forces.</p>\n<h3>Navy</h3>\n<p>Elyria boasts the mightiest navy of any power on the continent. These ships, known as the Sapphire Fleet, allowed Elyria to dominate trade and travel within the Middle Sea and surrounding waters for many years. Indeed, their merchant fleets were the first to trade with distant lands in far continents. While Westemär and Caspia have since established their own ocean trade routes and naval fleets, neither come close to rivaling the Sapphire Fleet of Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is not common in Elyria. The Amethyst Academy maintains few outposts here, and the nobility rarely seek court mages. Instead, it is customary for each household to sponsor their own @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] as close counsel in a similar role to a court mage.</p>\n<p>The Archmage of Elyria is @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.edFqywMzmWglHpE1]. A member of the Academy Directorate, the ancient mage spends most of his time seculded within his secret sanctum deep below Lumen, and uses their intermediaries at the Violet Embassy in Lumen when dialog between the Faith and the Academy is necessary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trade</h2>\n<p>Elyria is a fertile land, but must focus on less perishable goods for international trade. As such, its textile industry dominates commerce with other nations, especially cotton and silk. Elyrian wine competes against Caspian wine for the finest in the continent.</p>\n<p>Trade by land usually proceeds from Michael's Gate to Liberio, and from there into either Westemär or Caspia. The bulk of Elyrian trade happens via water through the Middle Sea, giving the nation direct access to most Caspian ports, while many other merchant ships sail through the straits of the Middle Sea to trade with cities in Terene and Orleone.</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Exports</strong>: Wine, oils, silk, cotton, textiles, pottery</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Imports</strong>: Salt, iron, coal, spices</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History</h1>\n<p>Elyria was once the heart of the sorcerer-kings' Arcane Empire, which they ruled from the Nightmare City of Nox. The imposing obsidian obelisk known as the Spire of Nox loomed over the wretched metropolis, built by Sorcerer-Queen Nahmar when she sealed the Blood Pact with diabolical fiends.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Fires of Liberty</h2>\n<p>After centuries under the yoke of the sorcerer-kings, hope for salvation was sparked when Saint Tarna renounced her wicked ways and became the First Paladin. She took up arms against the sorcerer-kings, and through her deeds the Spire of Nox was torn down. Saint Tarna's sacrifice inspired the dispossessed common folk toiling under the tyranny of the sorcerer-kings to throw off their bonds and rise up in rebellion. However, the rule of the sorcerer-kings did not immediately come to an end during Saint Tarna's lifetime.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, her disciples spread her message of justice, but more importantly, they taught others to invoke the divine magic of the Sacred Flame. Though individuals with the will and devotion needed to master this power are rare, these new clerics and paladins provided the divine strength needed to meet the arcane might of the sorcerer-kings head-on. After three centuries of rebellion and resistance, and through the blood of countless martyrs, the vast Arcane Empire crumbled.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">League of City-States</h2>\n<p>The collapse of the Arcane Empire was a period marred by war and conflict. The rebellion that had joined together to overthrow the sorcerer-kings collapsed into political posturing amongst rival factions and city-states. The vassals, cities, and people ruled by the sorcerer-kings had too long been lorded over by a distant supreme power, and were loath to hand over control of their newly-found freedom to anyone else. The lands of modern-day Elyria were amongst the last to be free of the sorcerer-kings, and in the immediate aftermath became a loose coalition of city-states along the Vita River and the coast of the Middle Sea.</p>\n<p>While each city-state was independently governed, the leaders of these cities would meet every few years at a summit to discuss their shared interests, alliances, and trade. Acknowledging the sibling-like bonds between their cities, they called themselves Elyria's League, named after the slain daughter of Saint Tarna. The League would later be known as simply the Elyrian League, and its people Elyrians.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Unification Under House Ava</h2>\n<p>During the middle of the fifth century, House Ava, one of Elyria's many noble houses, rose to prominence amongst the League. Lady Bernadette Ava conceived a scheme to unite the city-states of the Elyrian League not through conquest and bloodshed, but by the bonds of blood and family. Using carefully arranged marriages between her children and the nobles of the other Elyrian city-states, Lady Bernadette positioned her grandchildren as the inheritors of vast swaths of land and titles. However, each would still owe fealty to the head of the family.</p>\n<p>Though Lady Bernadette did not live to see her plan come full circle, House Ava cemented itself as the political power in the peninsula, and city-states of Elyria emerged as a united nation. What was once the Elyrian League was now simply Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Extinction of House Ava</h2>\n<p>Over the centuries, House Ava's intermarriages transformed the royal family into several cadet branches. Although the name “House Ava” gradually went extinct, the rule has passed mostly peacefully through 26 different households since the time of Lady Bernadette Ava. House Zachary was the last to claim any clearly discernible connection to House Ava. Unfortunately, the family tree had grown so tangled amongst the various lines that when King Marcus Zachary II died in the year 1001 without a direct heir, there was no clear successor to the throne.</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch attempt to avoid a civil war, the Elyrian nobility turned to the Faith of the Sacred Flame and consulted Divine Matriarch Humility III for guidance. After days of meditation and contemplation upon the Flame, Humility III decreed that an oligarchic Parliament of Lords would lead the affairs of the state, forming the governmental order which persists to this day.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Rising Theocracy</h2>\n<p>With the offices of the Divine Matriarch and the Lord Regent now intrinsically linked, a new political order settled into place across Elyria. Noble houses all sought increased influence and more profound connections to the Faith of the Sacred Flame — if a noble house could hold the Regency, and have a family member as the Divine Matriarch, it meant that their family had ultimate control in all decisions of faith and state. The first household to achieve this level of political control was House Eden, who managed to place a member of their household in both positions twice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Assassination of<br />Divine Matriarch Courage IX</h2>\n<p>Dissatisfied and disillusioned with the growing influence of the Sacred Flame over their government, several noble houses formed their own underground organization that conspired to overthrow the power of the Divine Matriarch. After years of planning, during a celebration in Saint Tarna's Cathedral, Divine Matriarch Courage IX was publicly assassinated to send a message to separate the Faith and the nobles once more. Unfortunately, the plot backfired. The commonfolk of Elyria were enraged, and the conspirators were outed and brought to trial before the nobility loyal to the Faith. The purported mastermind of the conspiracy, Lady Desmonda of House Windsor, and her allies in House Kellogg and House Sawyer were found guilty by a jury of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers}. After they were publicly executed, their surviving family members were stripped of their lands and titles and banished from Elyria.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath, the position of the Divine Matriarch remained vacant for four years, until finally the synod was reconvened and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5] elected to the position.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/129-pg64-sacred-flame-crest-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Crest of the Sacred Flame\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/129-pg64-sacred-flame-crest-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Faith of the Sacred Flame</h2>\n<p>As explained throughout this section, the organized clergy of the Faith of the Sacred Flame is the most influential political and social faction in Elyria. Consult the Gods and Religion section for more details on the religion itself.</p>\n<h3>Divine Matriarch Mercy V</h3>\n<p>No one living in the world today has shaped the political destiny of the continent through their words and actions more than @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5]. The responsibility and gravity of these decisions weighs heavily upon her. Now twenty years into her tenure, she was the youngest ever to assume the office. Nevertheless, she wields incredible divine power.</p>\n<p>Before taking up the position as the head of the Sacred Flame, Mercy V was named Esmeralda Poe. As youngest scion of House Poe, she was groomed from a young age to take up the mantle of a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] by her father, Lord Balthazar Poe. Remarkably gifted with the Divine Light, she could channel the holy magic of the Sacred Flame from the age of ten. Nevertheless, her election to the office over the experienced miracle-worker Lucretia Mathias was a shocking upset.</p>\n<p>Mercy V speaks with warm wisdom and fiery conviction, and holds each syllable of every hymn, prayer, or text of the Sacred Flame in her memory. A tall and slender woman in her late forties, Mercy V has long, wavy black hair and a striking gaze. Her garb consists of ornate flowing white robes with golden trim and embroidered with golden filigree. The symbol of the Sacred Flame is emblazoned prominently upon the robes. She carries a long scepter of white-gold, and wears a large frilled collar that looks like golden flames flickering around her head.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> Though I know every word of our holy texts, I do not use them in my speech except when I am conducting prayers or rituals. To speak them otherwise is to use these words in vain. If others cite the<em> Song of Fire</em> against me, I remind them devils can quote scripture too.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> The Sacred Flame is the guiding light of the world, which will lead us to truth and righteousness. It is my role to help others follow its holy beacon, a narrow path we must all walk together. The more good we put into the world, the brighter the road ahead becomes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My office comes with great responsibility, and the power I hold is a burden, not a privilege. I understand now that sometimes one must step through shadows in their quest towards the light, but I shall bring justice to those consumed by darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> The ancient words of the saints and martyrs are absolute and incontrovertible. I have disdain for those who try to reinterpret ancient truths which have stood the test of time with new ideas.\n</p>\n<p>The cosmic disaster, civil war, and religious schism raging in Westemär have been pressing challenges for the Divine Matriarch. It was Mercy V who declared delerium an unholy blight and dispatched the Silver Order to Drakkenheim, and she who decided to expel Lucretia Mathias for blasphemy. She knows full well that her proclamations are slowly leading the continent down the path of outright war. Others in the Faith might be eager to make war against the Amethyst Academy, or transform Elyria into a holy empire by conquering Westemär, but Mercy V takes no joy from either prospect. For her, these decisions were made from necessity. The righteous path runs narrow, and she stands resolute to do what must be done to protect the faithful and the world.</p>\n<p>Mercy V was more surprised than anyone when she won the position of Divine Matriarch over Lucretia Mathias, as she had been a longtime admirer of the prophetic cleric. When the meteor fell upon Drakkenheim, Mercy V earnestly believed in Lucretia Mathias's vision. It was not until the stories of the unspeakable horrors from that place first emerged, and Lucretia Mathias returned with an eldritch stone embedded within her, that the Divine Matriarch grasped the darkness which had taken root in the world.</p>\n<p>Mercy V is horrified by how far Lucretia has taken the Falling Fire, and is convinced it must be the work of demonic possession or some kind of otherworldly malevolence controlling her. The Divine Matriarch would like to see Lucretia Mathias captured so she can have her repent and renounce the Falling Fire. Theologically, however, she does find the prophecies and arguments of Lucretia Mathias compelling. She often questions how, if their positions had been swapped, things may have gone differently. However, she knows in her heart that no good can come from the delerium.</p>\n<p>As for the Amethyst Academy, the Divine Matriarch has no trust for the Directorate. She believes they are merely waiting for their best opportunity to convince the nobility to dissolve the Edicts of Lumen. She fears that too many power-hungry nobles will be easily swayed by the prospect of delerium-forged weapons, and that the terrible arcane might of such blasphemous magic will overpower those who stand against it.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Divine Matriarch weeps for the fate of Westemär. If none can rise to the task of ruling it with truth and righteousness, she sees saving that nation as another burden she must bear for the good of all.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Silver Order</h2>\n<p>The Silver Order is an elite church-sanctioned regiment of paladins and ordained knights oath-sworn to combat supernatural evils, otherworldly incursions, and dark magic, founded several centuries ago as a militant arm of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. These knights and paladins act by the decree of the Divine Matriarch to defend the faithful from demons and monsters, and are called up as witch-hunters when wayward mages dabble in forbidden arcana. Their holy missions transcend sovereign borders, but the order is headquartered in Michael's Gate. The chronicle of the Silver Order records countless heroic missions which have prevented a dire threat from growing into a far greater crisis.</p>\n<p>Though they usually operate as individual questing knights or in small warrior-companies, occasionally they are deployed as a regiment. Members of the Silver Order have been traditionally drawn from all peoples and all levels of society. Nobles and commoners alike are found within the order, and one's station in life does not reflect one's position in the Silver Order.</p>\n<p>Elyrians laud the esteemed members of the order as heroes. However, in their role as witch-hunters and mage-slayers, the Silver Order was complicit in the persecution and oppression of arcane spellcasters. To this day, the issue remains a deep stain on the order's honor, as many observed that the injustices and persecution visited upon spellcasters stand in stark contrast against the tenets of the faith of the Sacred Flame, a faith which calls out for justice for the oppressed. Nevertheless, nobles and common folk in Elyria are staunch supporters of the Silver Order, and many argue that the knights' deeds were indeed justified. After all, decisive action is necessary to defend the innocent and the faithful from wicked sorcerers who sought to dominate others with magical might, or cut down foul warlocks who spread wickedness through demonology and necromancy.</p>\n<p>However, as Elyria slides deeper into theocratic rule, these knights are increasingly entangled in state affairs. Paladins of the Silver Order have been deployed on inquisitional crusades against heretics, heathens, and other political enemies of the Sacred Flame. Unfortunately, the distinction between an enemy of the Sacred Flame and an enemy of the state is not entirely clear anymore.</p>\n<p>These concerns have been thrown into sharp focus ever since the Divine Matriarch dispatched a regiment of Silver Order @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{knights} and their retainers to the ruins of Drakkenheim to root out and destroy delerium at its source. Though led by the righteous paladin Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal, the nobles of Westemär and Caspia alike worry the Order's presence in Drakkenheim is an invasive ploy by Elyria to wrest control of Westemär, rather than a valiant expedition to purify the city of eldritch contamination.</p>\n<h3>Knightly Ranks</h3>\n<p>The Silver Order has several ranks:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>High Paladin.</em></strong> The commander-in-chief of the entire Silver Order is always a paladin.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Knight-Captain.</em></strong> These paladins of the Sacred Flame are amongst the greatest heroes in the world today. There are ten in the order, but each commands a company between thirty and one hundred<strong> Silver Order Knights</strong> and the retainers serving under them.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Silver Order Knight.</em></strong> Not every warrior in the Silver Order is a paladin, but each strives to emulate Saint Tarna's valiant example. Nevertheless, many knights of the Silver Order take up a sacred oath. Paladins are revered figures in the Faith of the Sacred Flame, as the founder of the faith was herself a paladin.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Soldier-at-Arms</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> Each Silver Order Knight leads a small squad of ten rank-and-file warriors. This forms the basic unit of the Silver Order, and typically these groups travel the world on righteous quests and holy missions. Assisting them are a large collection of squires, grooms, and retainers.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>High Paladin Uriel Radley</h3>\n<p><strong>Uriel Radley</strong> is a lanky but incredibly fit man. He has wispy, unkempt, dirty-blonde hair that falls down just past his shoulders, and he keeps a blonde trimmed beard and mustache. The man has a prominent chin and dark sunken eyes of piercing sky blue. His angular jaw and thick brow give him a stern and brooding appearance. He is often found wearing his shimmering full plate armor with a large waving blue and white cape, and a matching large tower shield both emblazoned with the symbol of the Sacred Flame. His left pauldron is in the shape of a large griffon head; highlights of gold and white decorate the armor.</p>\n<p>His warhammer, aptly named The Judge, is renowned for its many battles, and passed down amongst the High Paladins. It is a massive silver warhammer with a white hilt filigreed with gold with a head shaped like a griffon.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I do not suffer those who turn their backs on the faith or seek evil ends. I speak sternly and directly, often quoting scripture to guide my words.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I am judgment, I am the flame, and those who spend their days writhing in the shadows should fear the light I bring. I am staunchly loyal to my people, I will defend innocence with my life, and I will vanquish evil and deliver swift judgment to the fiends and monsters of this world.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My role as the leader of the Silver Order is something I take very seriously. Elyria needs me, and I will stop at nothing to do right by the Sacred Flame, the Divine Matriarch, and the legacy of Saint Tarna.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I see the world in absolute terms. You are either on the side of righteousness and good, or you are on a path to evil. If I cannot alter that path, then you receive my final judgment.\n</p>\n<p>Uriel Radley is a stoic commander known to be brutal in battle, but fiercely loyal to his people. He very much wants to be remembered like the great saints of legend. Not for fame or glory, but for upholding his oath to the Sacred Flame above all else and protecting Elyria and the continent from the evils seeping out of the shadows. The tales of spreading corruption and otherworldly horror has planted the idea in his head that it is his duty to see these problems solved, with him and his soldiers at the heart of that resolution.</p>\n<p>Uriel sent his best friend and protégé , Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal to Drakkenheim. He imagines that the skilled captain might one day take his place as High Paladin once he retires from the role.</p>\n<p>Uriel despises arcane magic and sees mageborn as problematic at best. Though he is a righteous man, and upholds the values of the Edicts of Lumen to the letter, Uriel dreams of the day he can unleash the Judge upon the members of the Directorate of the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<h3>Knight-Captain Gloria Hackfield</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/078-pg66-gloria-hackfield-edit-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Knight-Captain Gloria Hackfield\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/078-pg66-gloria-hackfield-edit-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Gloria is a young @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.JxXafxg0qnMZSHZH] who made the rank of Knight-Captain early in her career, and has been a strong leader since. She has long blonde hair often worn in a tight ponytail and narrowed green eyes. Her round face and pleasant demeanor give her an air of kindness that can be disarming to many at first, but the kind exterior hides her cunning and strength that comes out any time she speaks.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I do my best to be welcoming and kind to those I speak with, but I speak loud and firmly to hold the attention of those around me and I know how to command a room.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> It is our duty as knights of the Silver Order to uphold the tenets of our faith and help those in need. We go where we must and do everything we can to spark the Sacred Flame in the hearts of those we aid.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> The world can be a dark place, and I joined the Silver Order to help bring a little more light into it. It is my sworn duty to provide a light to those wandering the darkness, and help them find their way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I assume the best in everyone, and believe that everyone has good in them.\n</p>\n<p>Gloria is extremely proud of her position as Knight-Captain and wants very much to give the Silver Order a good reputation amongst those devout to the Sacred Flame, but even more importantly, those who are not. She sees good deeds, acts of kindness, and helping those in need as an important job for the Silver Order as every person they help is more likely to look to the Silver Order with kind regards, and in turn, become more open to the ideals of the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Amethyst Academy</h2>\n<p>Mageborn are born to Elyrian families no less than any other nation. However, the fears and superstitions surrounding arcane spellcasters run deep throughout Elyria, especially in rural and fundamentalist communities. As such, the Amethyst Academy takes its role as guardian of mageborn children extremely seriously in Elyria.</p>\n<p>When its emissaries travel the towns and villages of Elyria to collect mageborn children from their families, they often visit the nearby chapel to speak with the local @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] to ensure safe passage and peaceful dealings in the process. These wards are always taken to Paradox Castle in the Eastern Vales for their studies, as the Amethyst Academy does not maintain a major stronghold in Elyria proper. Instead, Academy leaders and representatives conduct their business from the Violet Embassy in Lumen.</p>\n<h3>Xel'vohca the Ancient</h3>\n<p>Xel'vohca the Ancient is one of the eight Amethyst Academy Directors, and the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6] of Elyria. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf]{Academy Director Lich} has held his position since the Amethyst Academy was founded, and was among the principal architects of the Edicts of Lumen. Indeed, since the time the Edicts were being drafted, the Divine Matriarchs have known about his undead nature, though they must tolerate this uncomfortable truth under the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Even still, Xel'vocha's undead nature is not immediately apparent; aside from the High Paladin and the Divine Matriarch, the other members of the Elyrian Cabinet are not aware Xel'vohca is a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.bfh29vIEoGzI240e]. Upon first meeting he appears as an old man in an ornate wheelchair of strange metal, attended by his personal @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.sSs3hSzkKBMNBgTs]. He has drooping jowls, sallow skin, sunken octarine eyes, wispy white hair, and an expression of deep sadness upon his face. He wears a simple purple robe and carries a glass-encased delerium orb. Except to incant his magic, Xel'vohca no longer speaks and relies on telepathy to communicate.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Personality Trait.</strong><strong><em></em></strong> I communicate telepathically in strained and long-winded streams of consciousness, my mind constantly burdened with centuries of thoughts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Magic can do great things. Terrible things, but great things indeed. We must wield it with responsibility, but wield it we must.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong> I was there when the first warlocks made their ancient pacts. The burden of the original sin of magic rests upon me, and I will steward the inheritors of the arcane until the last sun goes out at the end of eternity. I think of all mages as my children, and the sorcerer-kings were my wayward sons and daughters. I cannot repeat those mistakes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><em></em> Though my undead heart no longer beats, it pains me to feed my phylactery and sustain myself. The memories of these stolen souls haunts me, so I only do so rarely. As a result, my body has greatly atrophied, and now I fear my mind is slipping into madness as well.\n</p>\n<p>Xel'vohca was both the first warlock and the first @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.bfh29vIEoGzI240e]. Far from an evil creature, Xel'vohca has spent thousands of years facing the consequences of the choices he made in life. He is older than recorded history, and was vizier to many of the sorcerer-kings, though he was unable to stop their tyranny. His existence has often been spent trying to make amends for the failures of his past, but this task grows ever harder as new conflicts arise. The destruction of Drakkenheim and the spread of delerium have posed a major challenge to Xel'vohca. Amongst the Directorate, Xel'vohca alone harbors grave doubts about whether using delerium is a good idea, but is the first to admit that he himself is deeply tempted by its power.</p>\n<p>Today, Xel'vohca keeps his tomb deep within a section of the Dungeons of Nox. This personal mausoleum has been his lair for thousands of years, and he is loath to give up the comforts of his long-established home. Many of the traps and monsters roaming the dungeons are Xel'vocha's designs to keep intrepid heroes out of his business — and far away from the more dangerous artifacts and creations of the sorcerer-kings, which Xel'vohca safeguards from the world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Reed</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/148-pg67-house-reed-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/148-pg67-house-reed-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>House Reed's ancestral home is the city of Gabriella's<br />Landing, the anchorage for the Sapphire Fleet. The house rose to prominence through shipbuilding, and while its warships and admirals are well known, the Reeds' true power are their mercantile fleet. After funding trading vessels which sail the Middle Sea for generations, House Reed has emerged as one of the wealthiest noble houses in the nation. However, that has not always translated into political influence — until recently.</p>\n<p>Delerium taken from Drakkenheim has increasingly found its way to many ports, and the forward-thinking Divine Matriarch has considered the possibility of the stones traveling far abroad through ocean trade. When Mercy V named Polonius Reed as Lord Regent, the head of the noble house quickly authorized Elyrian ships to engage in privateering. In particular, he encouraged Elyrian captains to target pirates and merchant vessels known to be dealing in delerium, and the coffers of the Faith help pay the bounties.</p>\n<h3>Lord Regent Polonius Reed</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.r3vkm5QcTHpVp87P] is the most prominent figure amongst the Elyrian nobility, and sits at the head of the Parliament of Lords. Though a distant second to the authority and influence of the Divine Matriarch, he nonetheless holds much sway over the military and economic decisions of the nation.</p>\n<p>Polonius is a burly man in his early sixties. The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc]{noble} has a round, full face with a thick beard and short black hair combed over his balding head. His shaggy eyebrows highlight his deep-set, dark brown eyes. He dresses in exquisite silk Elyrian jackets, complete with a frilled ruff, puffed sleeves, and gold filigree. He is a clever and persistent man who carries himself with an air of importance.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I relish in a good heated discussion. I find the skills of diplomacy and debate are best honed with an old-fashioned argument.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I can argue any point convincingly, regardless of its truth. Feelings are more powerful than facts when it comes to politics.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> Elyria needs strong leaders — such as myself — if it is to remain the greatest power in the continent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I am bull-headed when someone refuses to see my point, and refuse to admit I'm wrong. I must always have the last word in any argument.\n</p>\n<p>House Reed has strived for years to pave a clear path for one of their daughters to possibly become the next Divine Matriarch. Now, they have a promising prospect in the Lord Regent's daughter, High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed. Ophelia is currently attached to the Silver Order's deployment in Drakkenheim, and the Lord Regent hopes that should his daughter successfully aid in the purging of the city and bringing Lucretia Mathias to account, House Reed will be well positioned to take both the regency and the Divine Matriarchy in the years to come.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Eden</h2>\n<p>House Eden was once regarded as the most powerful family in Elyria. Over the past century, three separate Divine Matriarchs have been members of House Eden, at least a dozen High Flamekeepers, and two Lords Regents. If any has come close to establishing a new monarchical line in Elyria, it has been House Eden. However, their fortunes fell considerably after the assassination of Divine Matriarch Courage IX, who had been a scion of their household.</p>\n<p>Outwardly, the house holds deeply fundamentalist views regarding the Faith, and is zealous to the extreme. They believe their righteousness begets prosperity, and have used their position to funnel vast amounts of coin collected by the Faith into their family vaults. Their methods have never crossed the line of theft, however: instead, previous High Flamekeepers and Divine Matriarchs have openly gifted indulgences and land to the family as “blessings upon their faithful service” and other such contrivances. They use these funds to build lavish, castle-like cathedrals on their estates, filled with expensive art, sculpture, and gold decorations.</p>\n<h3>Claudia Eden</h3>\n<p>Claudia is a delicate @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] woman in her mid-fifties. She has sunken features and a small, narrow face framed by flowing silver hair. She often wears a wide-brimmed brightly-colored hat and matching dress. She adorns herself with pearls, rings, jewels, and other finery. She speaks with a soothing, honeyed voice and often carries an air of elegance and false kindness.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I present myself as a woman of importance, and speak from a position of power. One must know how to sound like a queen if one is to be treated as such.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> The House of Eden deserves to be the most powerful house in Elyria and so I represent it at all times as if it always has been, and always will be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I must see the House of Eden rise to power again, and reclaim itself as the leading family of Elyria.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I am quick to denounce the sins of others, but will never examine my own actions.\n</p>\n<p>Claudia is desperately working on rebuilding her house's connections in Elyria. She would eventually like to see one of her daughters become Divine Matriarch, but none have mustered up the dedication and faith to become clerics of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.n9pJzTDsAwQxJVRl]. In moments of fragile faith, she contemplates other magical means to get back the power she craves. In the meantime, she is working diligently to manipulate her way back on to the Cabinet. She talks sweetly to everyone she meets, but is just as likely to scheme against them if it means putting her family's name in a position of greater power in Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Poe</h2>\n<p>When Esmeralda Poe became Mercy V, the youngest ever Divine Matriarch, it elevated House Poe to a position with recognition they had never believed possible. The father of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5], Balthazar Poe, had only just won a seat for his household on the Parliament of Lords, and had nearly bankrupt the house in the effort by impressing the Faith of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.n9pJzTDsAwQxJVRl] with great tithes and donations.</p>\n<p>After Balthazar Poe passed away four years ago, his eldest daughter, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.CWoozRR4mouoAsIR], took up his title and position.</p>\n<h3>Gwenavere Poe</h3>\n<p>Gwenavere is the older sister of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5]. She is a wispy @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] woman in her early fifties who often wears colorful gowns and opulent headdresses. She carries many symbols of the Sacred Flame at all times to present herself as a devout worshiper of the faith, though she could never muster up the patience and will to cast divine spells as a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]. She is exceptionally proud to have her sister as the Divine Matriarch, and everyone in Elyria knows it. She holds the title of her kin over everyone's head and uses it as a justification for her to be treated as though she were royalty.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I take every opportunity to mention my sister, her importance to the nation of Elyria, and in turn express my own importance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Position, wealth, and power are all that matter in this world. If you can have your grip on all three there is nothing stopping you from achieving anything you want.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> It's wonderful that my sister is the Divine Matriarch, but it means that our family will need to fight all the harder to hold on to everything we've gained.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> Though I was raised to follow the Sacred Flame from a young age, I don't care for the religion. I find the whole matter boring and tedious.\n</p>\n<p>Gwenavere desires nothing more than to help maintain her family's newfound power, and grow her own importance within Elyria. She is a cunning and manipulative woman who will take any and every opportunity to undermine and deface anyone who speaks ill of the Divine Matriarch, and will use her public image to ruin anyone who attempts to get in the way of her family and their name.</p>\n<p>For all this, Mercy V does not get along well with her sister. The Divine Matriarch finds the way her sister flaunts her status arrogant and unpleasant, and Gwenavere herself finds her sister's great faith tiresome and overbearing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Elyrian Cabinet</h2>\n<p>These two lords occupy high office in the Parliament of Lords:</p>\n<h3>Secretary General Orlando Timmins</h3>\n<p>Earl Orlando Timmins is a slight @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq] man with gold-yellow skin, well-dressed in a black-and-white silk tunic. He wears a heavy leather satchel overflowing with paper records and ledgers, and carries the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.items.Item.ZfeLZHUilhXsVhYH].</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I am soft-spoken, polite, and analytical, so others often ignore me. I keep my records with meticulous detail; nothing is unaccounted.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><em></em> I believe the Sacred Flame can lead us to progressive enlightenment, so long as our rulers do not keep us wallowing in the dark. We cannot forget how the Faith compels us to act with integrity and compassion in all things.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> There are few moderate and open-minded leaders amongst our nobility today. We need such people to reverse Elyria's slow slide into theocracy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I hesitate to speak my mind or tell others uncomfortable truths, as I fear their anger, scorn, or retribution. My fears often cloud my reason.\n</p>\n<p>The Secretary General is privy to all manner of sensitive information, so often the role is filled by a trustworthy and capable scion who lacks greater political ambitions. House Timmins is an Elyrian noble family known mostly for moneylending, but who have seldom been power-players in Elyria. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.r3vkm5QcTHpVp87P] choose Orlando Timmins for this reason, but is quickly growing tired of the Earl's honest work.</p>\n<h3>Grand Ambassador Beatrice Atwood</h3>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Ruler of Michael's Gate</em></p>\n<p>Duchess Beatrice Atwood is a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] in her late twenties. She has dark brown hair done up in a bun at the back of her head. Her face is sharp and angular with a thin nose, pointed chin, pursed lips and narrow eyes. She often wears a long gray skirt, a white blouse, and a black overcoat. She is a stern negotiator and exceptionally clever. She often dresses for her role as grand Ambassador, opting for neutral tones and smart fashion rather than anything overbearing or ostentatious.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I am a forceful conversationalist and hardline negotiator. In an argument, I never let others get a word in edgewise. Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Elyria is the greatest nation in the world. Our foes are envious of our mighty nation, and often hypocrites who seek one-sided concessions from us at every turn.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I have two young children. Recently, I have noticed strange occurrences and happenings around my estates, and I'm greatly concerned they might be mageborn.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><em></em> The other people of the world should think and act more like Elyrians, and we have little to learn from their faithless ways.\n</p>\n<p>Beatrice has ruled Michael's Gate for the past six years. Previously she was in training to become a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.JxXafxg0qnMZSHZH], and showed potential as both a cunning warrior, and clever diplomat. Now, with two young children to take care of, and the responsibility of ruling Michael's Gate, she has set aside her warrior days.</p>\n<p>Her new life of politics and leadership are no less fraught with conflict, however.</p>\n<p>Recently her two children have begun to cause strange sights and sounds around her home with no reasonable explanation. Beatrice is concerned they may be developing mageborn qualities. Terrified of facing this possibility, she has greatly ignored the signs and kept her concerns a secret. Unbeknownst to Duchess Atwood, the mages of the Amethyst Academy have already determined her toddlers are mageborn. Once they reach the age of six, the purple-robed mages will come to take them off to Paradox Castle.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/019-pg69-elyrian-cabinet-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Lord Regent Polonius Reed and Secretary General Orlando Timmins\" />\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Gold Coast</h2>\n<p>The Gold Coast rests along the eastern side of Elyria facing the Middle Sea, taking its name from the golden sands and beautiful sunrise that shines upon the waters in the early morning. It is regarded as the most hospitable area heading south towards the Witherbleach Desert. Several small cities and communities are spread along this coast, and many farming communities and spice mines occupy the rather arid landscape.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Crimson Coast</h2>\n<p>The Crimson Coast occupies the long western end of Elyria. The stunning red sunsets paint the waters in beautiful hues of pinks, oranges, and purples, and the entire coastline glows with red light that illuminates the hills and farmland like a wildfire.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Vita River</h2>\n<p>The Vita is the longest river in Elyria, which runs from Michael's Gate, through Lumen, and into the ocean. The river is the lifeblood of the otherwise arid lands in the shadow of the Drakeclaw Mountains. Most of the population of Elyria dwells within a few miles of its banks, which also functions as a prominent route for trade and travel from the east to the west of the nation. The river is one of the widest and longest in the whole continent, rivaled only by the Torvista river in Terene, the Woodrun River in the Eastern Vales, and the Drann River in Westemär. The rich blue water and freshwater fish are common traits of the large river. Several smaller streams feed the Vita from the runoff of the Drakeclaw Mountains and hydrate the land, allowing the lush fields and great farming communities that make up the heart of Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Hearthland Valley</h2>\n<p>The Hearthland is characterized by its fertile golden fields of grain and corn, which stretch along either side of the great Vita River. The Faith of the Sacred Flame speaks of these lands as the cradle of all civilization, as many believe the valley was the first settled land on the continent, and that all life sprang from the great river.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Southern Reach</h2>\n<p>The Southern Reaches encompass the furthest latitudes of the Elyrian peninsula, stretching along the southwestern edge of the continent. The Pale Tooth Mountains collect rainstorms blowing in from the ocean, and shield these lands from the harsh dry heat of the Witherbleach Desert, creating a lush tropical coastline. These idyllic lands have yellow sandy beaches, flowing rivers, humid forests, and large stretches of grassland. The many small towns speckled along the coast are known for having incredibly beautiful ocean-facing villas, enchanting beaches, and warm weather year-round.</p>\n<p>About a million people live in the Southern Reach — almost all are human with small amounts of dwarves, elves, arcane ancestries, and smallfolk.</p>\n<p>The Southern Reaches are the frontier of Elyria. Ostensibly, Elyria makes claim to the whole region as part of the Elyrian nation; but in fact, the Southern Reaches are wholly independent of Elyria. Separated by the desert and mountains, Elyrian forces face the same geographical problems controlling this region as the sorcerer-kings of old. While a great deal of trade and travel does occur, the people here owe no fealty or obligation to Elyria.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the people of the Southern Reaches have close cultural ties to their neighbors, and many try to ingratiate themselves with Elyrian politics and society. However, the region has deep traditions associated with the worship of the Old Gods Lugh, Nuada, Danu, and Gaibhne — deities with overlapping portfolios and occasionally similar rites to the Faith of the Sacred Flame. As such, when the Faith of the Sacred Flame spread into this region, several hybrid faiths emerged which combined the teachings of Saint Tarna, the ideals of the Sacred Flame, and the myths and legends of the Old Gods.</p>\n<p>The strange mix of beliefs in the Southern Reaches has often raised the concern and ire of the Divine Matriarchs of the Sacred Flame, as these practices and theologies are considered deeply heretical to the mainstream clergy. Some have even branded the priests and monks of the Temple of the Sun as cultists worshiping forbidden gods and plotting against the Faith.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Witherbleach Desert</h2>\n<p>The Witherbleach Desert spans south of the Hearthland all the way to the Pale Tooth Mountains and makes up a majority of the landscape of Elyria.</p>\n<p>The rocky desert is largely flat, and is made up of white cracked earth for miles in all directions. Small plants and occasional trees grow from the ground, but they are all pale and bleach white, like frail bony hands jutting out of the earth. Even more consistent are the sun-bleached bones of various animals, and occasionally people, who have not survived the harsh desert landscape. Vents of sulfur spew out from the cracked earth in some places, and oil pools occasionally form on the surface. The fumes from the oil and sulfur cause the entire desert to have an acrid, unsettling smell. Occasional clusters of rocky white chalk hills offer some shelter, and sometimes house small cave systems with underground aquifers. Many of these are inhabited by strange and dangerous desert creatures.</p>\n<p>There are no Elyrian cities within the desert itself, and is deemed by most to be inhospitable. This is not so, however. Generations of nomads have thrived in the dry desert, carving out their own way of life. Among them is a circle of Druids of Lugh, but no one is exactly sure where specifically they call home.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, devout worshipers of the Sacred Flame will make a pilgrimage across the desert. They follow the footsteps of Saint Tarna by heading towards the Pale Tooth Mountains. Few return from these pilgrimages.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Pale Tooth Mountains</h2>\n<p>The Pale Tooth are a long ridge of tall, steep, white mountains, filled with abundant chalky limestone deposits, which paint the mountainsides a pale hue. Many of them are so steep that it is nearly a sheer cliff to reach the summit, where many mountains end in flat plateaus. From a distance, the mountains appear to many as a row of crooked white teeth jutting out of the sands of the desert.</p>\n<p>Deep within mountains is said to be the place where Saint Tarna met the archangels Michael and Gabriella. There, the great warrior swore a sacred oath and became the First Paladin. However, none since Saint Tarna herself have found this sacred place.</p>\n<p>Today, the range of mountains is home to several dragons, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SOin81NWijHRvXFK]{stone giants}, and several independent communities based around the worship of Danu, Gaibhne, Nuada, Shegorach, and many of the other Old Gods.</p>\n<h3>Opularis the Wise</h3>\n<p>Greatest among the dragons of the Pale Tooth Mountains is @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.2tQ3PzGOgtptN4Ze], an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SNT0JNVSngUTsj4m]. The scholarly dragon keeps a great library within the ruins of an ancient monastery. They are said to be the most welcoming of all the known dragons of the continent. Several grandmaster wizards of the Amethyst Academy meet Opularis for games of chess and afternoon tea, and once every century, the dragon takes on a mortal apprentice.</p>\n<p>However, Academy professors are quick to warn headstrong pupils about seeking the dragon's mentorship: Opularis does not teach amateurs, beginners, or raw talents. The dragon has been known to slay any would-be student who cannot impress them by casting three different spells of 6th level or higher.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/061-pg70-opularis-the-wise-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Opularis the Wise\" />\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lumen</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of Elyria</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 250,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Divine Matriarch Mercy V</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Holy City of the Faith of the Sacred Flame</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>The shining metropolis of Lumen stands like a beacon in the night. Travelers from miles away can see the glimmering light of Lumen like a flaming beacon on the horizon. The glow ignites the faith in the hearts of travelers. The central cathedral of Saint Tarna stands above the smaller chapels and shrines which spring from amongst the tightly-packed streets. Incense and woodsmoke waft through the stone streets while the constant melody of hymns and chanting echoes throughout the city.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>Lumen is the capital of Elyria, and the holy city for the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Drinking deep from the waters of the Vita River, the teeming city is one of the largest cities on the continent. All throughout the bustling streets of sandstone buildings the smell of incense and woodsmoke drifts through the air. Chants, hymns, and bells fill the city at all hours of the day and night as throngs of devoted worshipers of the Sacred Flame fill the countless chapels and cathedrals, carrying out acts of prayer and worship. The sacred chapel fires remain alight continuously and every street is generously illuminated by lampposts. The city glows like a beacon in the darkness.</p>\n<p>The people of Lumen have grown accustomed to the brightness, and many work from dusk to dawn. There are many superstitions surrounding putting out the lights in Lumen; every room of every building is constantly lit through the night.</p>\n<p>As the holy city for the Faith of the Sacred Flame, Lumen is the greatest destination for pilgrimage in the known world. Many devout worshipers of the Sacred Flame plan on making at least one journey to the holy city during their lifetimes. As a result, the city is bursting with foreign travelers from around the globe, all united by their faith in the light. There are countless inns and hostels in the city, catering to pilgrims both princely and penniless.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Saint Tarna's Cathedral.</em></strong> Lumen has countless chapels to the Sacred Flame, but all are dwarfed by the majesty and splendor of Saint Tarna's Cathedral. The massive spired golden dome rises on a high bluff over the city, and features an immaculate decorated facade with marble statuary. Inside, it is painted floor-to-ceiling with frescoes and tall arch windows set with stained glass murals depicting Tarna's life and deeds. Thousands of worshipers can gather in the colossal building, all standing around the great altar whereupon is set a tremendous everburning bonfire. The impressive catacombs and reliquary house many of the great relics of Saint Tarna herself, though not a single one of her bones.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Matriarchal Palace.</em></strong> Off the same plaza as Saint Tarna's Cathedral is a sprawling monastery complex where hundreds of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolytes}s, and other clergy dwell and carry out the administrative work of the Faith. The most important resident is the Divine Matriarch herself, so powerful wards protect the palace and an elite detachment of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.JxXafxg0qnMZSHZH]{Silver Order Paladins} patrol the grounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Violet Embassy.</em></strong> This small manor near the Matriarchal Palace is one of the few strongholds of the Amethyst Academy. Officially, the property is leased to the Academy by the Faith. Here, a few liaisons from the Amethyst Academy Directorate are posted to confer with Elyrian diplomats and provide arcane magical services.\n</p>\n<p>Both the Directorate and the Divine Matriarch protect themselves with such potent magical wards that it often impairs their ability to contact one another via magic. While the mages here think their role quite important, the truth is the opposite. The Directorate and the Divine Matriarch try to avoid talking to each other unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Dungeons of Nox.</em></strong> The lasting legacy of the sorcerer-kings runs deep into the earth. Once, Lumen was known by another name: Nox, City of Night, the ancient capital of the Arcane Empire. Indeed, the Matriarchal Palace is built upon the foundations of the grand palace of Sorcerer-Queen Nahmar, and Saint Tarna's Cathedral stands atop the place where the Spire of Nox once stood.\n</p>\n<p>Beneath the catacombs and sewers of Lumen, the holy city is built upon the dungeon of the sorcerer-kings. All manner of blasphemous chambers filled with dark magics remain buried within to this day, for the sorcerer-kings had many secrets.</p>\n<p>From time to time, one of these forgotten tombs bursts open, allowing a horror from a bygone age to creep up into the streets of Lumen. This is why the streets are always lit: to give such monsters no place to hide. Even the smallest shadow, a tiny blot of inky darkness is enough place for such demons to dwell.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Gabriella's Landing</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 48,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Lord Polonius Reed</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Great Shipyard of the Elyrian Navy</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Gabriella's Landing stretches far into the Middle Sea on wooden docks and stilts along the bays.

The bustling city is made up of flat-roofed sandstone houses with open balconies and windows. The dusty streets below are filled with constant movement.</p>\n<p>The steep coastline north of the great sprawling docks and watermills is made up of several noble houses.

An ingenious system of interconnected canals forms an assembly line to build new vessels in stages by specialized shipbuilders: nearly a hundred ships are being constructed, overhauled, or repaired at any given time. The operation is overseen by House Reed, who brag the Sapphire Shipyard launches more new ships to sea in a month than Liberio's harbor can build in a year. The shipyard employs nearly a quarter of the adults living in Gabriella's Landing. However, Lord Polonius Reed goes to great lengths to downplay the fact that the harbor was designed by commissioning the mages of the Amethyst Academy, and must regularly purchase replacement components for the main assembly line machinery from them.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lucant's Vigil</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 20,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Claudia Eden</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Monuments to Saint Tarna, Farming, Ocean Trade</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>A colossal granite statue of Saint Tarna stands where the Vita River empties into a cliff-ringed bay at the ocean's edge.

Just outside the city proper are sprawling farmlands where hundreds of farms bring in produce and meats.</p>\n<p>The city is known for a great 200-foot-tall statue of Saint Tarna clutching her shimmering blade high in the air. Commissioned by House Eden at a massive expense during a time when they held the Divine Matriarchy, it stands on a small island just off the coast. The statue acts as a lighthouse: the flaming sword guides boats into harbor during the night or through storms.

The secretive guests at this place are usually red-robed figures sporting lavish jewelry and bearing arcane implements. Their faces are painted with vibrant markings, and they have bizarre hairstyles such as mohawks, spikes, and top-knots.

The lands of Elyria are filled with dangerous deserts, political intrigue, and interesting locations to be explored by adventurers. A campaign in Elyria might explore themes such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Aiding the Divine Matriarch in acts of faith or holy quests.</li>\n  <li>Defending Michael's Gate from foreign invasion.</li>\n  <li>Traversing the Witherbleach Desert to follow the path of Saint Tarna.</li>\n  <li>Protecting trade ships from Gabriella's Landing from pirates of the Middle Sea.</li>\n  <li>Meeting the great dragon Opularis the Wise.</li>\n  <li>Exploring the Dungeons of Nox beneath Lumen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Adventure Hooks</h2>\n<p>Below are some specific adventures that might occur around Elyria to use as small quests, or expand into entire campaigns.</p>\n<h3>Lights Out</h3>\n<p>Recently, an irreverent wizard of the Amethyst Academy, visiting the city of Lumen as an envoy, was trying to get a good night's sleep amidst the city's endless bright lights. The wizard foolishly shrouded the windows of their room using a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.S7VbUetIfVT7B6Eq] spell, blocking out the light of Lumen. Unfortunately, their chambers harbored secret tunnels to the Dungeons of Nox. In the dark of night, a demonic spirit has possessed the wizard. Now the contaminated mage is plunging deep in the dungeons below Lumen, releasing more horrors into the holy city. Who knows what horrific creations of the sorcerer-kings they have unleashed?</p>\n<h3>Tarna's Footsteps</h3>\n<p>Hoping to heal the schism between the Falling Fire and the Sacred Flame, a devoted @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] wants to make a pilgrimage to the Pale Tooth Mountains in search of the place where Saint Tarna met the legendary Archangels. Many have attempted this throughout history, but none have been successful. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] has received a vision that they think will guide them. The Flamekeeper could be an NPC or a player themselves.</p>\n<h3>Quench the Flame</h3>\n<p>The political situation on the continent has reached a boiling point. Unable to negotiate with the self-righteous Divine Matriarch Mercy V, the player characters are drawn into a grand conspiracy to assassinate her. Their co-conspirators could include the Amethyst Academy, who seek to use the opportunity to weaken the Edicts of Lumen; members of the Elyrian nobility, who hope to free their nation from the clutches of theocracy; or even the Followers of the Falling Fire, who believe the death of the Divine Matriarch will be the shock which spurs others to take up their faith instead. However, to avoid causing a continent-spanning war in the aftermath, they'll need to pin the blame on a rival faction in the process… and make sure they have positioned an appropriate candidate to occupy the office afterwards!</p>\n<h3>Mage Hunt</h3>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy approaches the player characters with information that they have divined the location of several mageborn children in Elyria. With the recent turmoil coming out of Drakkenheim, mageborn are facing greater suspicion in Elyria, and Academy mages are unwelcome in many parts of Elyria. The Amethyst Academy needs the player characters to locate these mageborn children and bring them back to the Academy under the right of guardianship of the Edicts of Lumen.</p>\n<p>During the adventure, one of the families will be heartbroken by the news, and will do everything they can to keep their child. Another family will be horrified, and will do everything they can to murder their child.</p>\n<h3>Class in Session</h3>\n<p>The great blue dragon Opularis is taking on new mageborn students. Seeking to be those pupils, the player characters travel to the lair of Opularis hidden somewhere in the Pale Tooth Mountains. Though they might not be able to impress the dragon with their magic, the dragon decides not to slay them. Opularis instead offers them three tasks to prove themselves worthy of their teachings — but if they fail, the dragon will devour them. The tasks often include slaying one of Opularis's great enemies, finding a unique magic item worthy of his horde from the Isles of Skye, and obtaining a lost spellbook the dragon loaned to a member of the Academy Directorate.</p>\n<h3>Congregation of Conspiracy</h3>\n<p>The player characters are swept up in the convergence of faith and politics that define Elyria. They might be members of the clergy, knights of the Silver Order, or the vassals of Elyrian nobility. Regardless, their goal is to secure the offices of both the Divine Matriarch and the Lord Regent, so they can decide the destiny of Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Rumors</h2>\n<p>These rumors might help spur creative quests and goals for your party to explore.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The druids of the Witherbleach Desert know of a secret dwarven treasure vault buried in the Pale Tooth Mountains.</li>\n  <li>They say on some nights angels visit the statue of Saint Tarna in Lucant's Vigil.</li>\n  <li>Gabriella's Landing is actually completely run by pirates.</li>\n  <li>Lucant's Vigil has been dealing with delerium from Drannsmund and people are starting to fall ill.</li>\n  <li>There is an entrance to the Dungeons of Nox from one of the taverns in Lumen, and many of the patrons are members of a cult of Nox.</li>\n  <li>The scavengers in the eastern end of the desert were once clerics of the Sacred Flame who were banished when they discovered a blasphemous truth.</li>\n  <li>Visitors to the city of Lumen are warned that it is bad luck to try to block out the Light of Lumen — even if you're trying to get a good night's sleep!</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/03-dd-dcgd-lumen-city-map-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Lumen Map\" />",

Their culture and politics drive their prideful scions to seek adventure throughout the world, and meddle endlessly in the affairs of other nations. Every nation on the continent has warred against Caspia at least once in their history, and every Caspian house had gone to war with each other countless times. However, since becoming a united realm, Caspia has never fallen to foreign invasion, and in spite of these numerous conflicts, the realm has remained remarkably stable over the years thanks to its unique succession rules.</p>\n<p>Every decade, the six Great Houses elect a reigning monarch via a contest known as the Kingsmoot. This important tradition decides the High King of Caspia. Over the past thirty years, the prominent House Joplin has consistently won the Kingsmoot, and High King Venus Joplin has enjoyed a long rule. Yet, as the next Kingsmoot nears, the other Great Houses scheme and plan to unseat House Joplin and establish their own family as the ruling dynasty.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Extending along the eastern coast of the Middle Sea, Caspia is a subtropical land where wild grass and foliage cling to wide red rocky knolls. The dry plains are speckled with column-like rock formations and bordered by large spanning mountain ranges in the north. The climate of Caspia ranges from arid to humid. The northern cusp of Caspia is home to decent farmland for ranches and vineyards, and the semitropical coastal regions to the south are a rich source of fine spices such as cloves, pepper, and saffron. There are only a few large forests, which include pine and spruce in the north but more tropical species emerge in the south. Many Caspian towns tend vast orchards of either fruit or citrus depending on their latitudes. During antiquity, Caspia was a rich source of tin and home to many bronzeworkers. Today, Caspia must import most of its iron and steel.</p>\n<p>The most populated cities are sprawling places filled with single-story limestone abodes. Caspia is frequently rocked by tremors and earthquakes, so only the castles and keeps of the most prominent houses reach a second or third story. Traveling south, the center of Caspia leads to more barren landscapes and rocky badlands, and the famous Caspian Canyon until making its way to the tropical jungles to the south.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Amongst the three great powers of the continent, Caspia is the most sparsely populated, with only 5 million people living within its borders. Most dwell in the coastal regions along the Middle Sea or towards the northwestern regions which border Elyria and Westemär.</p>\n<p>Caspia is comprised mostly of humans, who make up all of the six Great Houses of its nobility. However, several halfling communities exist along the northern area between the Glimmer Mountains and the Rust Edge Mountains. Dwarves from the Glimmer Mountains commonly travel through Caspia, and half-elves and tieflings make their homes in most port cities. Uncommon folk with anthropomorphic lineages dwell mostly towards the southern borders with Terene and Orleone.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>Caspia does not have a true capital city — the seat of power lies at the Tower of Swords. There, the High King of Caspia holds court, and the Kingsmoot meets here to choose the next ruler.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Government</h2>\n<p>Six Great Houses rule Caspia. The head of each household holds the title of Prince-Elector, and all their heirs style themselves as princes or princesses. Each household has complete authority over the laws and jurisdiction of their individual lands. These six houses are in fact each distantly related, for all descend from the six children of Rex Caspian, founder of the nation. As fitting for a nation ruled by headstrong siblings, these factious nobles have long struggled to form a united government, and often make war against each other for frivolous reasons. A tradition known as the Kingsmoot was established as a means to end the petty warring between the six major houses of Caspia by choosing a High King to mediate disputes between the houses, make the final decision on any matter affecting the nation as a whole, and wear the<em> Crown of Caspia</em>.</p>\n<p>The Kingsmoot is both an election and a competition. By custom and law, it is held no later than ten years to the day after the coronation of the most recent High King, or should the High King die in office, immediately after their funeral. One candidate for the throne is put forward by each of the six Great Houses, and the reigning High King must abdicate the throne to the winner of the contest. However, the current High King can retain the throne if they are both chosen to represent their own house again and their House wins the Kingsmoot</p>\n<p>Each of the six Great Houses may submit two votes in the Kingsmoot. One vote is discretionary, but the households cannot vote for their own candidate. The other vote is decided by each household making a bet or challenge placed at the conclusion of the previous Kingsmoot. These challenges represent a goal each house can strive towards over the next decade, although most commonly, the houses will issue a challenge they might have the upper hand accomplishing to secure a guaranteed vote for themselves. Traditional challenges include assembling the largest military force, procuring the most treasure, securing the strongest foreign alliances through marriage, building the greatest castle, wielding the finest magical weapons, having the most impressive muscles, and slaying the most dragons or other notable monsters.</p>\n<p>A household must win a plurality of votes to win the Kingsmoot. While smaller houses of notable renown within Caspia may compete, they are not permitted to vote. As such, the Kingsmoot has always been won by a Great House. Given that only twelve votes are cast, two-way and three-way ties are extremely common. In this case, a Caspian duel decides the next High King. Under the terms of the duel, each candidate chooses four retainers to accompany them on a quest. Each candidate has one week to seek out and slay the largest and most terrible monster they can find, and return with a trophy. The other houses then decide which candidate has made the most impressive kill, and declare them High King.</p>\n<p>House Joplin are great dragonslayers, and they most often use this skill to win tiebreakers. This tactic has made them the winner of 17 of the 34 Kingsmoots.</p>\n<p>The current High King of Caspia is Venus Joplin II, who has been the reigning monarch for the last three decades.</p>\n<h3>Noble Ranks</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>High King.</em></strong> The monarch of Caspia. This title is used regardless of gender.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Prince-Elector or Princess-Elector.</em></strong> The elder of a Great House, given the right to cast a vote or issue a challenge during the Kingsmoot.

All are vassals of one of the six Great Houses.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Royal Council</h3>\n<p>Once the Kingsmoot is over, the High King must receive five envoys from each of the noble houses to act on their council to help manage the realm, but can then appoint as many other nobles to their council as they wish. The High King can invent any office or title for these councilors as suits their whims. While many High Kings establish a Master of War or an Admiral of Ships, other administrative functions are assigned more haphazardly to niche roles, such as the Potions Inspector General or the Lord Commander of Field Sports. As a result, the High Kings of Caspia are known to assemble massive entourages, making the court a rowdy place of nobles gathered from across the nation.</p>\n<p>The Kingsmoot is administered and overseen by representatives of the Amethyst Academy and the Faith of the Sacred Flame to ensure legitimacy, fair dealing, and sportsmanlike conduct in the proceedings. The gnomish @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6] @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.rJ05Zzvm3G17rQjX] and the human @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.SKQBy61pf7d1N7ww] are the current Kingsmoot administrators.</p>\n<p>Each representative also joins the Caspian Royal Council. As a member of the Amethyst Academy Directorate, Marigold has held her current position since the Kingsmoot was established, and the event is one of the few times the otherwise elusive figure makes a public appearance. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.SKQBy61pf7d1N7ww] has been recently elected from House Jones of Caspia after spending twelve years abroad in Elyria training under the Divine Matriarch.</p>\n<h3>Seals of Caspia</h3>\n<p>The Edicts of Lumen prompted the Caspian Houses to organize the Kingsmoot to decide who would wear the<em> Crown of Caspia</em> gifted to them. As such, the Seals of Caspia are six swords and a crown. Each of the Great Houses holds one of the swords, which are unsheathed in the coronation ritual of the High King. The High King usually wields both the sword of their house, and wears the<em> Crown of Caspia</em>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“My dear partner Pluto once compared the Drakkenheim crater to the Caspian Canyon saying it wasn't as impressive. Sounds like a typical Caspian answer to basically anything if you ask me.”</blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>Caspians are known as a largely irreverent people. Nevertheless, the Faith of the Sacred Flame is the most common religion throughout Caspia. Though Caspian dedication to the Sacred Flame is less than that of Westemär and very much Elyria, most major cities house a chapel or cathedral to the Faith. Devout noblewomen often travel to Elyria to train as a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers}, many Caspians see this as another possible avenue to add clout and renown to their house's name.</p>\n<p>Caspians tend to think of the Old Gods as ghost stories, and many Caspians speak of them as if they were demons or evil monsters. One Caspian legend claims that great heroes of House Jackson, Joplin, and Jones fought against and slew Kromac, Nodens, and Morrigan, which caused the Old Gods to run away from Caspia in fear of meeting the same fate. These Caspians are heroes in old tales used to impress upon young Caspian children the importance of strength and courage. Many point out, correctly, that the timeline given by these tales makes no sense, as the Caspian houses today did not exist at the time when the stories are said to occur. Facts often make for boring stories, however.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Military</h2>\n<p>Each notable house of Caspia has its own army. The size of these forces, their fighting styles, and equipment differ from house to house. Nevertheless, each Great House boasts about their soldiers and what they deem to be most valuable. The combined might of Caspia far outstrips the militaries of any other nation. However, this apparent strength is counterbalanced by the uncooperative nature of the Great Houses themselves. Still, when Caspia has faced invasion from Westemär, Elyria, or Terene, the Great Houses' armies have readily united and have proven to be an incredibly resilient and unstoppable force. The competitive nature of the Caspian Houses has also encouraged diversification amongst the household armies to cover a wide range of martial doctrines, as each house wants to be different from the others, and train their armies to be the best at something the others are not.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<p>By tradition, a court mage of the Amethyst Academy serves each of the Great Houses. However, the Amethyst Academy does not have a major stronghold in Caspia, instead operating through a variety of outposts or traveling from the Enigma Ziggurat in the neighboring city-state of Liberio.</p>\n<p>Caspians are fascinated with art and music, and love when bards tell stories and sing songs of their deeds. Noble houses often recruit a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.R3nChOQBH2LSU2NY]{minstrel} or herald, and it is a mark of prestige to have a bard with true magical talents on your household staff.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trade</h2>\n<p>Geographically, Caspia lies in the center of the Continent along the Middle Sea, and as such the nation is the crossroads for international trade. Goods flow through Caspia from Elyria and Westemär to Terene and Orleone, and Caspian spices are often used as a medium of exchange for cargo passing between these places. Such trade progresses by both land and sea, as most of the Six Great Houses make their estates on coastal ports.</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Exports:</strong> Tin, bronze, spices, wines</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Imports:</strong> Iron, steel, coal, silk, textiles.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History</h1>\n<p>Like their neighboring nations, the lands of Caspia were once part of the sorcerer-kings' Arcane Empire for hundreds of years. When the arcane tyrants' rule ended, the now-free settlements along the coast of the Middle Sea became a collection of squabbling city-states. Each controlled a small patch of land or a network of smaller towns, and a few became military powers in their own right.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Founding of Caspia</h2>\n<p>After the fall of the sorcerer-kings, countless wars were fought for control of modern-day Caspia. Few would-be conquerors could secure the entire region until a powerful warlord known as Kristoff Karn brought the Eastern Vales under his rule. Not content to claim that region alone, Karn moved south to invade the lands around the Middle Sea.</p>\n<p>He met his match in the mighty Rex Caspian. Although this renowned warrior did not have any noble ancestry, he united the city-states of the Middle Sea to fend off Karn's armies. After years of war, Karn's resources and troops were exhausted, and the two warlords met to negotiate a truce. The men had not met personally before, but inexplicably came away from their parley as friends, seeing much of themselves in one another. They agreed to lay down their arms and recognized the sovereignty of each other's lands.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Six Houses</h2>\n<p>Although infamous for his promiscuity and countless partners, Rex Caspian married Cordelia Karn. The two sired six children: Jackson, Jones, Joplin, John, Jagger, and Joyce. Rex ruled over his kingdom for many years, until during a sporting display he rashly decided to wrestle a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.nZthq6WHLhcdu3te] with his bare hands. The old king was turned to stone while holding the beast in a headlock. The petrified body of Rex Caspian still stands as a statue in the center of the Rex Colosseum, clutching the gorgon in place. Though mages and apothecaries offered to reverse the curse many times, Rex Caspian's six children instead decided to let their father remain as a “glorious symbol” while they promptly divided his kingdom amongst themselves. Each formed one of the six houses of Caspia, fracturing their father's empire into six warring kingdoms.</p>\n<p>The decision to leave their father as a stone statue and go their separate ways was the last thing all six of Rex Caspian's children could ever agree upon, and their descendants carried this rich tradition onward for generations. The houses would go to war to prove they had a better army, stronger knights, or any reason imaginable. Occasionally, the houses collaborated but quickly fell back to sibling-like infighting. During the renowned Battle of Skulls, House Jones and House Joyce united to defeat a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.K4vsSlHqbBAHUDHY] that was tormenting the outskirts of their lands. Upon defeating the hydra, both houses wanted to adorn their throne with the skulls of the beast, but could not agree which house would get five skulls, and which would get four. Appropriately, the resulting war lasted nine years.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Establishing the Kingsmoot</h2>\n<p>The Caspian houses were deeply divided over the place of magic in their laws and realms during the Mage Wars. When Divine Matriarch Humility III called each of the Great Houses to negotiate the Edicts of Lumen, another war almost started over which house would represent the nation of Caspia as a whole. It was only prevented by the suggestion from the newly-formed Academy Directorate that all the higher nobles of each nation could attend the summit and sign the treaty.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the fact that Caspia was simultaneously a singular and divided nation was a vexing problem during the peace talks, as the Faith of the Sacred Flame and the Amethyst Academy planned to offer each realm a magical crown as a gesture of goodwill. The clerics and wizards of the time knew it would be foolish to give each of the Caspian Houses their own crown, especially ones which could grant them a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]. Instead, they forged six mighty blades, one for each House, and a single crown, which they announced could be worn by whoever was the singular inheritor of Rex Caspian's legacy — so long as the matter could be decided peacefully within ten years.</p>\n<p>Naturally, with their usual solution of making war on one another off the table, the Caspians were unable to decide upon who should wear the crown. Each house presented their case for their house ruling over Caspia as a whole. The Jacksons argued that since they had recently slain a gang of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ZHAFrnCwCz17dmLc]{trolls} that were stealing livestock, that their house deserved the crown. House Jones argued that their military was the largest and strongest. House John argued their castle was the largest and most well decorated. Each house put forward their case, and in challenging one another to meet the prestige of their own deeds, the Caspians found their way. They each agreed to issue a challenge to all the others, and whichever house won the most challenges would become High King for the next decade. Arcturus Jagger became the first to claim the crown as the High King of Caspia, and the Kingsmoot was born.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">War of the Sword</h2>\n<p>There was once a Caspian prince who was also a famous bard, Prince-Elector Oberon Joplin. This warrior-poet was a peerless swordsman, perhaps the greatest duelist of the age in any continental style. Oberon was also known for his outstanding performances and even possessed magical talents, though he was not mageborn. In the year 971, the well-loved Caspian prince won the Kingsmoot and was to be crowned High King of Caspia. However, this was met with great opposition from the Faith of the Sacred Flame and many nobles in Westemär and Elyria, who claimed the man's magical abilities were irrefutable evidence that he was mageborn.</p>\n<p>Under the Edicts of Lumen, Divine Matriarch Temperance IV invoked the Articles of Umbrage to call the High King to trial in Lumen. Prior to the final judgment, rumors spread amongst the Elyrian nobility the scheme was an elaborate ruse by the Academy to seat a mageborn on a royal throne. As a result, the assembled nobles and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers} rejected the testimony from the Academy Directorate, which claimed Oberon was not mageborn. The Divine Matriarch proclaimed that House Joplin must disinherit Oberon and renounce the throne. Oberon refused, and the Great Houses stood united behind their king and stormed back to Caspia.</p>\n<p>The continent braced for war, but in a last-ditch attempt at peace, a year later an Elyrian delegation visited the High King led by the High Paladin of the Silver Order at the time, Miranda Crake. Unfortunately, a fierce row broke out during the talks, and Oberon Joplin challenged Miranda Crake to a duel. The fight would be his last. The High King died at the feet of the High Paladin.</p>\n<p>House Joplin reacted with rage to the death of their liege, and diplomatic relations spiraled out of control. The result was the War of the Sword, which raged for twenty years. The war was characterized by duels between Elyrian knights and Caspian Princes. The war raged on until the death of Divine Matriarch Temperance IV, when a Caspian Flamekeeper, Ganymede Joyce, was chosen as her successor and became Divine Matriarch Charity VII.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/caspian-warriors-final-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<p>Some of Caspia's prominent groups and figures include:</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Joplin</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/154-house-joplin-heraldry-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/154-house-joplin-heraldry-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>House Joplin is considered the foremost amongst the Great Houses, having won the Kingsmoot seventeen times since it was established. The head of the household, Venus Joplin II, sits upon the throne in the Tower of Swords as the High King. She has ruled in this position for over thirty years, while the Joplin estates are looked after by her daughter, Magellan Joplin. They proudly boast the largest army, featuring large regiments of halberd wielding infantry. Their tactical combat acumen and polearm mastery is unmatched throughout Caspia.</p>\n<h3>High King Venus Joplin II</h3>\n<p><strong>Venus Joplin</strong> is an imposing woman in her late fifties. She has broad shoulders, a square face with defined features, and black pixie cut hair. She has almond shaped brown eyes and narrow lips. She wears a thick breastplate with open arms to accentuate her muscular strength. Her cape is emblazoned with the crest of her house, and she wears a circlet with a single sapphire gem placed in the center.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I let my actions speak for me, and am a woman of few words. I know my house's worth, and I treat each Caspian as their house demands. Which means some I speak to as equals, and some I speak to as inferiors. Mostly inferiors.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I am always the strongest and bravest person in the room. To say you are a great warrior is one thing, to be one takes guts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> House Joplin is the strongest Caspian house; the evidence is in the history books. I will hold the title of High King until I die, and on that day, my daughter will take my place.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I do not care for the petty squabbles of my fellow houses. I am rude and demeaning to the other Caspian Houses when I feel they are not living up to my expectations of what a Caspian house should be, which is basically always.\n</p>\n<p>Venus has held tightly to the role of High King for nearly three decades, and does not plan on relinquishing her title at the next Kingsmoot. Although she is well-loved by her people, and spoken of highly in tales and songs of her incredible victories, great monster hunts, and amazing arena duels, the other houses often dislike her, or are intimidated by her. She often enjoys this fact and revels in being the greatest Caspian warrior since Rex himself.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Jackson</h2>\n<p>House Jackson rules their domain from the port city of Jackson's Keep. They are renowned as great monster slayers and take pride in the many trophies collected by their scions. The current head of the household is @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.WW7N5lqY7azWsXFi]. His children, Pluto and Eris, are both renowned warriors and Sol pushes them to perform great heroic deeds in hopes of winning votes for the upcoming Kingsmoot. Sol has even sent his son Pluto to the city of Drakkenheim in Westemär in hopes of having house Jackson be at the heart of resolving the conflicts and issues of the fractured nation.</p>\n<p>House Jackson is the only house to have never won a single Kingsmoot, and they are the laughing stock of the other houses as a result. Sol is determined to be the first Jackson to take the position as High King of Caspia. Nevertheless, House Jackson has a capable army skilled in swordplay and javelin-throwing.</p>\n<h3>Prince-Elector Sol Jackson</h3>\n<p>Sol is a ninety-year-old barrel-chested @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.OcJoakgBoM6FdYTj] who is almost always wearing his shining decorated armor. He wears a red cape with several small motifs of his family's crest upon it, and he sports a great white beard and slicked back hair. He is tall and muscular, sporting an envious physique for a man half his age. He speaks in a booming voice, and often spouts tales of glorious battle and exaggerated monster hunts.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I take every opportunity to speak of my great deeds and the deeds of my house. People need to know that although the Jacksons have yet to win a Kingsmoot, we are still one of the strongest houses in Caspia.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Every Jackson needs to know three things: how to swing a sword, when to swing a sword, and how to tell everyone how good you are at swinging a sword.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My family is important to me. I push them to do great deeds to achieve glory for our house.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I often talk over people and completely ignore what they say. I much prefer the sound of my own voice anyways.\n</p>\n<p>Sol is a boisterous and proud man who will never say a bad thing about his house or his family. He spends most of his time bragging about their deeds and ensuring everyone around him knows how great the Jacksons are. In truth, the upcoming Kingsmoot has Sol on edge. His house has never won a single Kingsmoot and at ninety years old, his time is running short for him to claim being the first Jackson to ever take the throne of the High King. Since he started swinging a sword, Sol determined himself destined to be the first Jackson on the throne, and wants that title more than anything. If he does not win the upcoming Kingsmoot, he doubts he has another decade left in him.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Jones</h2>\n<p>House Jones resides in the coastal city of Jonestown. However, they do not focus their attention on ships and naval combat. Instead, the family is renowned for their great horse breeding facilities, and they fancy themselves the greatest equestrians on the continent. They spend years mastering horseback archery, jousting, and riding skills, and Prince-Elector Saturn Jones has never lost a horse race or a jousting match.</p>\n<p>House Jones has held the title of High King more than any other house except House Joplin. However, even when not seated on the throne of the Tower of Swords, House Jones is extremely active in domestic and international politics. They entertain nobles from Westemär and Elyria on a regular basis, and always ensure their scions marry members of prominent foreign families. As a result, House Jones also has some of the strongest alliances and ties to the nobility of the other nations. In fact, the late Queen Lenore of Drakkenheim was a member of House Jones, and her marriage solidified strong ties between Westemär and Caspia for a time. Since her apparent death after the destruction of Drakkenheim, House Jones is attempting to recuperate their alliances and maintain a grip on their position. They see an opportunity to vastly expand their holdings now that Westemär is falling apart.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the household has been able to maintain a highly influential position within Caspia due to the recent appointment of a House Jones scion to the position of High Flamekeeper of Caspia.</p>\n<h3>High Flamekeeper Elara Jones</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/108-pg78-flamekeeper-elara-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"High Flamekeeper Elara Jones\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/108-pg78-flamekeeper-elara-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Elara Jones is an anomaly in her family: the household is not normally known for being particularly faithful or zealous. However, Elara nonetheless found herself called to the faith at a young age, and departed her household as a teenager. She returned years later as a devout warrior-priest of the Sacred Flame having spent many years in Elyria under the mentorship of the Divine Matriarch. Now in her early thirties, she has retired from adventure, and taken up the mantle as High @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] for the High King of Caspia. However, thanks to her new station, she has now become entangled in the politics which drove her to leave Caspia in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I speak slowly and calmly to ensure I am understood. I often feel like Caspians yell and shout like wild animals, so a firm but soft voice often puts them in their place.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Strength is one thing, but having a good head on your shoulders and knowing how to use it will take you much further in Caspia than you might expect.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I live by the tenets of the Sacred Flame, which I hold in higher regard than my household. Still, as both a noble Caspian and High Flamekeeper, I am burdened with many responsibilities, and must uphold my obligations to the faith, the crown, and my house.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I sometimes talk down to Caspian men when I find their pig-headed nature exhausting or absurd.\n</p>\n<p>Elara uses her words of wisdom to sway @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.MhYZLI3KuAvBvckv] towards a righteous course, and also towards favorable outcomes for her family in political matters. Long has the High King contemplated invading Westemär now that the kingdom is weakened, and it has been Elara's urgings that have prevented that from happening.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House John</h2>\n<p>The seat of House John is located in Bladeshatter Bay at the sprawling coastal town of Port John. Their navy is well known in the Middle Sea for being more deadly and vile than the many pirates who pillage the trade ships through those waters. They have the strongest fleet of any Caspian house, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.Z1A6dTGPWiBhvIRh] is a famous naval captain, swashbuckler, and strategist.</p>\n<p>House John is sometimes looked down on from the other Caspian houses, as Neptune John is not actually a direct descendant of Rex Caspian. House John has a history of mageborn children, and even several half-elves, tieflings, and dragonborn in their bloodline. Since the Edicts of Lumen require noble houses to disinherit their mageborn children, it came as a great tragedy when an entire generation of House John's heirs all turned out to be mageborn. Since none could inherit the household lands and titles, a bastard child of a lesser Caspian house was adopted into House John and chosen to inherit the family estates.</p>\n<p>The mageborn trait was so strong in House John's bloodline that when the Edicts of Lumen were first presented, House John was the strongest opposing voice. They were instrumental in shaping the final document, and only agreed to sign it after they themselves established the practice of allowing noble mageborn to take up positions as court mages for their own households. Today, the true descendants of John Caspian still live, but all are mageborn members of the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<h3>Prince-Elector Neptune John</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/024-pg79-neptune-john-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Prince-Elector Neptune John\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/024-pg79-neptune-john-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Neptune is a middle-aged man with a bushy blonde beard and a bald head. This @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.fsPruAIDOg4tVrgb] has a burly build, and unlike many of the Caspian Princes, rarely wears armor. Instead, he is known for sailing the Middle Sea in his leather tricorn hat, a sea-swept beige tunic, and a large belt with a silver skull for a buckle. He has tattoos covering his arms and back detailing every monster he has claimed to have slain, including a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.kVg37NlPcACAzjCT]{kraken}, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ijsfYEDqSuwQXwNN]{dragon turtle}, and most important to him, a great white sperm whale who devoured his original crew. Neptune is known to be a ruthless commander in combat, and takes endless joy in downing pirate ships and plundering them of their stolen goods. He is often accompanied by a pet ferret he calls Pip.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I use naval jargon and sailing analogies whenever I talk. I curse often, and have little mind for manners.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Go where the wind takes ye, and always be ready to fight for what ye believe in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I may not be a trueborn scion of House John, but I was brought into this family all the same. I have proven myself my own brand of warrior. No one can take my title, or my victories away from me. I'm still waiting for a thank-you from Joplin for keeping the Middle Sea safe for our people.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> If anyone mentions my bloodline as not being a true heir to the throne of Caspia, I'll stick 'em with my saber a few times to show them my Caspian ways.\n</p>\n<p>Neptune John wants to win the next Kingsmoot to stir the pot of Caspian royalty, and rub it in the face of the other houses for thinking low of him. Most Caspians are loud and proud with their shining armor and big swords, and not used to seeing a tattooed pirate amongst their people. Currently Neptune has been detailing plans to slay the great Leviathan of the South Ocean, which would surely claim him some votes in the Kingsmoot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Jagger</h2>\n<p>House Jagger's holdings are nestled at the end of the Great Caspian Canyon along the River of Rust, in the small city of Jagger's Ford. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.7jq0hUNSM2WuY0rQ] rules over the city from his cliffside castle. Surrounded by badlands, their estates are quite a bit rougher and rugged than other Caspian cities. House Jagger maintains a smaller army than the other houses, but one no less mighty, for their wyvern-riders are the envy of Caspia. For generations, the Jaggers have hunted the Caspian Canyon for @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.7198siHjPJf8g0cG]{wyvern} nests. After collecting and hatching their eggs, the Jaggers raise and train the creatures to use as mounts. The powerful air force of wyvern-riding @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{knights} has been instrumental in many Caspian wars.</p>\n<p>As rulers of the southernmost regions of Caspia, House Jagger has fought constant battles and wars with the people of Terene over the borders between their lands. Caspians often see the jungles as a wild land filled with monsters, and venture forth on hunting expeditions. However, the Terene locals do not want Caspian @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO] stomping through their lands slaying their creatures, and so violence between the two is common.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“In Caspia, I'm pretty sure they think violence is the answer.

He is focusing all his energy training more wyvern-riders to push into the neighboring lands to capture and tame the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.pLzSh4dA517Tn73E]{giant lizards} of the jungle. His goal is to build a force of both mounted ground and aerial troops that puts all other Caspian houses to shame.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Joyce</h2>\n<p>House Joyce's domains stretch out along the coast of the Middle Sea; the family makes their home in Joyce Harbor. The household is the only Caspian Great House who prominently professes their faith in the Sacred Flame — the family built the largest cathedral to the Faith in Caspia. Scions of the household often become clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame, and the family is relied upon to bring healing and divine magic to many Caspian battles. They wish to see the Sacred Flame shine its light more strongly within Caspia.</p>\n<p>Due to their close ties to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, they have a strong relationship with Elyria. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.fsD7ghTqT9USMag3] frequently travels to Lumen to meet with the Divine Matriarch. However, she hasn't been back since Elara Jones was appointed High Flamekeeper of Caspia, and the development has strained the political ambitions of House Joyce, who in the past could reliably arrange one of their scions to the position.</p>\n<h3>Princess-Elector Persephone Joyce</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/107-pg82-persephone-joyce-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Princess-Elector Persephone Joyce\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/107-pg82-persephone-joyce-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Persephone Joyce is a middle-aged @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] woman who wears white robes similar in fashion to those seen within the clergy of the Sacred Flame, but greatly embellished with gaudy Caspian baubles. She often wears gold jewelry to contrast her white attire and mimic the colors worn by the Divine Matriarch. Persephone fancies herself very in tune with the teachings of the religion, and she attends the cathedral in Joyce Harbor every day.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I offer guidance and wisdom with my words, and aid those who would turn away from the Sacred Flame by gently pushing them in the right direction towards the light.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Caspians should take their inspiration more readily from righteous figures like Saint Tarna, not uncouth warlords like Rex Caspian.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My faith has proven a valuable ally to me and I believe that as long as I work under the guidance of the Flame, I will always be moving in the right direction.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I believe the Sacred Flame guides my every choice, and so I rarely question the wisdom of my actions.\n</p>\n<p>Persephone is aiming to take the seat of High King in the next Kingsmoot, tear down the Rex Colosseum, and construct a great cathedral in its place. She dreams of turning the Tower of Swords into a holy site of worship, and sparking the Sacred Flame throughout all of Caspia. She has wild ambitions this would unite Caspia and Elyria as a unified force, and fancifully imagines her and the Divine Matriarch as two pillars of the Faith working together to spread truth and justice to the continent.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Scalebreaker Legion</h2>\n<p>Part mercenary company, part monster-hunting lodge, and part adventuring guild, the Scalebreaker Legion is a prestigious paramilitary organization in Caspia which stands apart from the noble houses. The Scalebreakers count amongst their ranks some of the greatest monster hunters the world has ever known, and are specifically trained in the art of hunting and killing dragons. Rising in its ranks is among the highest honors in Caspia for warriors who do not belong directly to one of the six Great Houses, and the legion has been instrumental in protecting the realms of Caspia from dragons and other monsters, but also from foreign invasions.</p>\n<p>The Scalebreaker Legion has existed in some form in Caspia even before the nation itself, but rose to modern prominence when they defeated the invading forces of Albrecht von Drakken in the year 822. During the Dragonfall War, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.TH3oHGAPZbWHSM3H]{Scalebreaker Knights} slew the House von Drakken dragons and routed their armies, and Commander Bernard of the Scalebreakers<strong></strong> presented the head of Albrecht von Drakken himself to High King Andromeda Jones<strong></strong> at the Tower of Swords.</p>\n<h3>Scalebreaker Commander Callisto</h3>\n<p>Commander Callisto, a male @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.TH3oHGAPZbWHSM3H], has looked after the Dragon Vault for thirty years as the head of the Scalebreaker Legion. He himself is noted for having slain the children of Amarodial “Bitterheart” the Black Dragon of the Eastern Vales when they ventured over the mountains into Caspian territory. That was some time ago, and now, over the age of seventy, Commander Callisto has retired from the battlefield and helps train new recruits. He is a strict commander who expects the best from his knights, and constantly reminds them that if they think he is too harsh, they will be sorely disappointed with how a dragon treats them.</p>\n<p>Callisto has short gray hair and keeps a gray stubble beard. He has an eyepatch over his left eye and three scars across his face — a memento from one of his earliest battles. Commander Callisto wears the same armor into battle each and every time, complete with its many burn marks, dents, and holes from draconic teeth and claws. He is missing his left arm after having lost it to a red dragon on the Drakeclaw Mountains years ago. Despite his injury he returned with the head of the dragon in tow. Anyone who has made a comment about his missing arm is thrown into the training pit with the commander, who challenges them to beat him in a duel. The Scalebreaker Commander remains undefeated.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I am a stern man with a lot of wisdom from experience. I speak harshly and honestly. In battle there is no place for niceties.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I train the best, because anything less won't survive long enough to learn better.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> The Scalebreakers are one of the most important forces in all of Caspia, we may not be nobles or High Kings, but you can bet on your life that they know they need us when the monsters of this world come crawling out of their holes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I am incapable of relaxing. I have been on my guard my whole life and constantly in battles. I don't know if I am capable of settling down.\n</p>\n<p>Callisto has a long-standing rivalry with the black dragon Amarodial, who dwells in the Eastern Vales. He has faced the dragon several times and the two are well aware of one another. Since they are separated by the Rust Edge Mountains, their battles have subsided for many years. Still, Commander Callisto dreams of facing the dragon once more. If he is to die, he would rather it be in the jaws of that treacherous beast than lying in a bed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Amethyst Academy</h2>\n<p>Although no stronghold of the Amethyst Academy exists in Caspia, the cheerful @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.rJ05Zzvm3G17rQjX] has operated as the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6] of Caspia since the Kingsmoot was established. She was eager to take the position and has happily seen over magical dealings in the nation since. Many High Kings have spoken highly of Marigold and expressed that her counsel is always highly regarded.</p>\n<h3>Marigold Kettleborn</h3>\n<p>Marigold is an @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf], and possibly the most mysterious of them all. This two-and-a-half foot gnomish woman is about as wide as she is tall. She has curled yellow hair that falls about her round rosy face. She is always beaming with a large smile, red dimpled cheeks, and an abundance of chins. She has a round nose and big bright eyes; one is green, the other is a strange crimson red. She carries a short staff made of iron laced with golden swirls.</p>\n<p>Marigold wears a wide-brimmed, pointed, purple hat and a well-fitted purple Academy tunic. She is always a delight to be around and many Caspians admire her optimistic attitude and overt friendliness.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I speak in excited and friendly tones and am always looking for an opportunity to help out. No one suspects a jovial gnome!\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Tricking mortals is so easy, you just need to smile and nod and occasionally throw in a mild request and a quick illusion and you can bend them to your will.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> No one suspects the truth of my presence here, and I will continue to play this role and pull the strings of the Amethyst Academy as I see fit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I am reckless and care little for those around me. My friendly facade is merely another illusion.\n</p>\n<p>Marigold is a master of illusions and has been known to occasionally pull pranks and small jests on the High Kings of Caspia, and even the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf]{Academy Directors}. Behind closed doors, Marigold has been heard muttering in deep whispers of unknown languages to herself. She vanishes every night when her duties are done, and even goes weeks or months without communicating with the other Academy Directors. She has spoken briefly of her walking castle, but no one is sure what she refers to, and assume it is another jest.</p>\n<p>Marigold has been working in secret to study how delerium affects illusion magic. She hopes to create a means of making illusion spells function like summoning spells — conjuring up an illusion and infusing it with delerium to give it form and make it real. If she can master this new advancement, she will be able to create any object, reshape landscapes, manifest riches and items, and reshape reality in ways hitherto unheard of.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“I thought some of my professors were bad, but my brief encounters with the Directorate have been at their best, unpleasant”</blockquote>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trogrowth Forest</h2>\n<p>The largest forest in Caspia is infamously lousy with @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ZHAFrnCwCz17dmLc]{trolls}. The willows and gnarled root trees stretch up from marshy lakes and rivers, and large stretches of the forest are swamps. Though many warn of the dangers within, such words are merely a challenge to the ears of most Caspian princes. The thick mists and damp air make for an uncomfortable hunt, but Caspians hoping to prove themselves as warriors, monster slayers, or Scalebreakers will venture in nonetheless. Beyond trolls, the forest is known for giant snakes, colossal man-eating toads, two-headed @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8aCTKP5qaBPFOqxM]{crocodiles}, and massive demonic insects.</p>\n<p>Many a Caspian will boast with pride about the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ZHAFrnCwCz17dmLc]{trolls} they killed in Trogrowth, but the number of the monsters never seem to dwindle. Local legend tells of a magic portal deep within the forest which leads to a vast underground city where trolls and other shadow fey dwell, but the Caspians do not venture far enough to prove these claims.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Great Caspian Canyon</h2>\n<p>This canyon stretches from the base of the Rust Edge Mountains down the center of Caspia towards the Jungles of Terene. The beautiful Vermillion Falls flow from the mountains down into the canyon and are the largest waterfalls in the world. The River of Rust that flows through the canyon gets its name from the red earth of the mountains and the canyon, which causes the river to take on a rust like color.</p>\n<p>The canyon has a large population of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.7198siHjPJf8g0cG]{wyverns}, which Caspians have both hunted for sport and tamed for mounts.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/016-pg83-rex-colosseum-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Tower of Swords</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of Caspia</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 2,725 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.MhYZLI3KuAvBvckv]</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Arena Battles, Political Center of Caspia,<br />the Kingsmoot</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>In the midst of the Caspian plains, resting beside the River of Blood is a massive stone tower built to resemble a colossal sword with its blade plunged into the earth. It reaches hundreds of feet into the air, and a chain-powered lift operates an elevator which runs up the furrow of the blade. There, the court of the High King is built into the crossguard of the stone weapon, with stained glass windows like jewels decorating a hilt.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>The Tower of Swords is the tallest structure in Caspia, and located in the heart of the nation. It is the seat of the High King of Caspia and the place where each Kingsmoot is decided. After a new High King is elected, the new monarch and their immediate family and retainers take up residence in the apartments built into the pommel of the blade-tower, where the yawning windows and stone balconies look out in every direction across Caspia.</p>\n<p>The High King holds court in the Great Hall located in the crossguard of the blade. There stand statues of the six children of Rex Caspian, as well as a central statue of Rex himself with an inscription that reads “May our swords shatter the will of those who rise against the might of Caspia.” Beneath the tower is a crypt of sorts, but no bodies are held there. Instead, the chosen blade or weapon representing each High King is hung upon the wall or placed on display on tables throughout the mausoleum. A small village has sprung up around the tower, providing lodgings for royal visitors and the household staff.</p>\n<p>No Caspians constructed the Tower of Swords, and the structure supposedly dates before even the time of the Arcane Empire. Caspians tell a story that it is in fact a titan's blade. The fearsome creature planned to devour the people of the earth, but when the primordial monster saw the warriors of Caspia, he was so intimidated by their might he dropped his sword and fled. As with most Caspian stories, the details and timeline of events become extremely incongruent the more one thinks it through. Most Caspians get quite angry if you mention this.</p>\n<h3>Rex Colosseum</h3>\n<p>Constructed beside the Tower of Swords is a large oval-shaped arena that can accommodate nearly ten thousand spectators. The outer facade is decorated with bas-relief carvings depicting horrific monsters being slain by Caspian warriors. Inside is a sandy fighting pit with barred gates facing each cardinal direction. Standing in the middle of the pit is the petrified statue of Rex Caspian, still holding the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.nZthq6WHLhcdu3te] that petrified him in his grip. The supernatural creature is still alive, but has been unable to free itself for hundreds of years. Those fighting in the arena must be careful to avoid the petrifying fumes it belches forth.</p>\n<p>Beneath the arena is a sprawling labyrinth of chambers, with ready-rooms for @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.fsPruAIDOg4tVrgb]{Gladiators}, a forge and smithy to maintain weapons and armor, a hot spring bath to relax between fights, and copious stores of meat and beer. The lower levels house various pens where animals and monsters are kept to await combat. The High King pays well for new creatures that offer unique fighting opportunities, and some adventurers make their entire careers as monster-wranglers for the arena.</p>\n<h3>The Troll's Head</h3>\n<p>For those traveling to the Tower of Swords or Rex Colosseum, they can find accommodations at the Troll's Head tavern and inn. Both gladiators and spectators all come to the Troll's Head to enjoy a pint of ale and enjoy stories of great victories and bitter losses. The tavern has the mummified head of a troll on a stake outside acting as a signpost for the tavern.</p>\n<p>Comet Smith, a member of a smaller Caspian house, runs the inn, which is actually the manor house of his family. He loves to share stories and gossip with guests, especially telling newcomers about the troll outside who tried to kill him when he was in the Trogrowth forest on a hunt. His story changes slightly every time he tells it, getting more and more heroic as time passes.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right region-symbol\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/152-house-jackson-heraldry-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/152-house-jackson-heraldry-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Jackson's Keep</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Home of House Jackson</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 10,500 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Prince-Elector Sol Jackson</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Fishing, Jackson Knights, Caspian Smithing, Trade</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>The blue rooftops of Jackson's Keep stand in stark contrast to the rich red soils of the surrounding landscape.

Its prime waterfront location has meant that it is the most popular port for imported goods coming from Elyria. Its inns and taverns serve some of the best fish in all of Caspia.</p>\n<h3>Castle Jackson</h3>\n<p>The Jackson's Keep Castle is a high perched structure atop the nearby hills. It's made of white stone with blue roofed towers and great flags waving in the wind. The castle has three towers, a central keep, and two outer walls, one around the keep proper, and one surrounding the noble houses that lay on the hillside just outside the castle. These houses are occupied by all who bear the name Jackson.</p>\n<p>Currently Sol Jackson, renowned warrior and monster slayer, sits on the throne of Jackson's Keep.

The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.R3nChOQBH2LSU2NY]{minstrels} and heralds who accompany Caspian nobility often attend Lento College.</p>\n<p>Due to the Edicts of Lumen, the school is strictly prohibited from teaching magic. Rufus Stonewall, an Amethyst Academy academic, is positioned at the college to oversee the teachings of these Caspian artists. His specific task is to observe and see if any students possess magical potential as bards, and to send them to an Academy school to further train their arcane skills. Many of these bards return to Caspia to finish their artistic training and hone their Academy-learned magic skills.

The door is etched with carvings of heavily armored knights fending off an army of dragons.</p>\n<p>Outside the Vault doors is a walled-off camp with training pits, blacksmiths, watch towers, and other minor fortifications and amenities. Inside, the Vault is a war room, a command post, a bunker, and a deep catacomb. The catacomb is a massive hollowed-out cavern below the mountain where dead Scalebreakers are brought when they die. Their bodies are burned on a pyre made from the bones of every monster they themselves slew. The ashes remain atop these piles of bones as a testament to the deeds of that knight.

The Vales have excellent timber, open plains, a great marshland, and beautiful lush beaches towards the southeast coast. However, these lands are best known as a quiet and peaceful place free from much of the political turmoil that plagues the continent. Many who seek a quiet life reside in the Vales.</p>\n<p>Still, the Eastern Vales are not without their own conflicts and hardships. Dragons stalk the southern regions, and large monsters traverse the woods. Since the cities of the Vales are not a united nation, there are few who keep these problems in check outside of the largest settlements. Wandering into the uninhabited places of the Vales is often a fool's errand.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>The Vales take their name simply from their geographical location and landscape: the eastern edge of the continent is made up of valleys and plains, with spots of green hills and lush greenery. The Eastern Vales were briefly dubbed Karnsreik by a ruthless tyrant, but no one living in the Vales today calls their home by that name.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Roughly two million people live in the Eastern Vales, mostly in dispersed clusters of small villages and towns. The region supports only a few cities, but most are an eclectic melting pot of cultures and ancestries. The Eastern Vales are home to the largest communities of halflings in the continent, located amongst the green hills and open fields.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>Foreigners typically regard Port Brynor as the unofficial capital of the Eastern Vales thanks to its fortified position and status as a destination for established trade routes across the Ender Ocean. Regardless, the Eastern Vales are proud to be a free league of small communities and cities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Government</h2>\n<p>Although the Vales have been claimed by several rulers in the past, today the Eastern Vales have no unified government. Most settlements are wholly independent, though a few are vassals to the larger cities in the region. This informal arrangement has worked well for the people of the Vales since the fall of Karn, and locals believe it has successfully insulated the Vales from the political turmoil facing the rest of the continent.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Military</h2>\n<p>In the past, the Eastern Vales have assembled great armies under powerful warlords, but today their militaries focus on defending their own lands. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.8cHD1s9vFBVMds0L] of Port Brynor has organized a defensive pact with her neighbors, and sports a respectable navy. Otherwise, towns rely on volunteer forces, mercenaries, and local militias for protection.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>Religious beliefs in the Eastern Vales are extremely heterogeneous. Worship of the Old Gods is openly practiced in the Eastern Vales. A popular sect in the Vales regard Arwyn, Morrigan, and Phantasia as a trinity of three wise sisters, and halfling communities are among the few places where public shrines to Shegorach may be found.</p>\n<p>Alongside worship of the Old Gods, the Faith of the Sacred Flame is firmly rooted here. However, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers} in the</p>\n<p>Eastern Vales are far removed geographically from the church hierarchy in Lumen, including many who have never traveled to Elyria and only rarely communicate with their peers in other lands. As a result, the Vales are home to several divergent denominations of the Faith, including unorthodox beliefs which attempt to reconcile the Faith of the Sacred Flame and myths of the Old Gods. These beliefs conflate Saint Tarna with the goddess Nuada and tell how the Sacred Flame was created by Ogham, Lugh, and Gaibhne to protect the world with a beacon of knowledge and light.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy operates its most important school for the instruction of young mages in the Eastern Vales at Paradox Castle. As such, the people of the Eastern Vales are quite accustomed and comfortable with arcane magic, and the purple-robed wizards are often encountered escorting new students to the castle. Alongside the distance from the great nations and mild political climate in the Vales, the Academy can operate with more privacy and autonomy here.</p>\n<p>Since the Eastern Vales lacked a singular ruler when the Edicts of Lumen were enacted, it's unclear whether or not the treaty actually applies to the region as a whole, as only Port Brynor was represented during negotiations. Nevertheless, the Eastern Vales largely abide the Edicts in spirit if not always to the letter, lest they incite the ire of their warlike neighbors.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History</h1>\n<p>The Vales were the eastern frontier of the Arcane Empire. Among the lands once held firm under the sorcerer-kings' regime, the Eastern Vales were the first to wrest free of their grasp. Sorcerer-Queen Kaestelaria VIII greatly weakened the armies and fortunes of the empire during her reign, and subsequently had to recall many soldiers sent to enforce her rule in the Eastern Vales to secure the heart of the empire. The people of the Vales seized this opportunity to rebel and slay her governors and vassals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Reign of King John Tolan</h2>\n<p>When the forces of the sorcerer-kings departed the Vales, a man named John Tolan tried to forge the region into a kingdom under his household. Far from being a capable warlord, House Tolan used their clout and wealth to establish themselves as a valuable friend to all living in the Vales. His son, John Tolan II, succeeded him as the first King of the Eastern Vales.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, John II proved a less-than-capable leader. He found the dreary and cold Port Brynor an unsatisfactory capital for his kingdom. He emptied his father's coffers constructing a massive palatial castle on the edge of Second Sister Lake to be his seat of power, ignoring the pleading of his architects and advisors who warned him building there was folly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Fury of Bitterheart</h2>\n<p>After the castle was finished, John Tolan II faced countless problems with the spring water levels that turned much of the landscape in the southern Shadowfens into a marsh, and expended even more of his fortune trying to prevent Tolan's Keep from sinking or collapsing into the bog. Worse, John Tolan II did not account for the presence of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.qNdFhY3JOkCfhG3d], @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.FbVTWCeJ0b5UeOfK], who lived in the Shadowfens — and saw the castle as a wonderful new lair gifted to them by a petty mortal king.</p>\n<p>The great dragon resolved to destroy John Tolan's kingdom and seize the castle for themselves. They drove off Tolan's armies, and slew the would-be king while he cowered in his chamber. The ruins slowly sank into the marsh over years, though Bitterheart still lives there upon a mountain of treasure. The people of the Eastern Vales never attempted to reclaim the ruins, nor establish any towns or cities between the Sister Lakes again.</p>\n<h3>Rage of Karn</h3>\n<p>Many years after John Tolan II died, Kristoff Karn emerged as the ruler of Port Brynor. He seized control of the city through much bloodshed and ruthless tactics, then assembled an army made up of mercenaries and bloodthirsty murderers to help him conquer the Vales. These forces laid siege to the northern cities of the Eastern Vales, killed their leaders, and plundered the surrounding villages. Karn offered any able-bodied folk the option to join him in his conquest or die to his ruthless army, and thus his army grew.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Karn's greed led him to eye the lands to the south, but met staunch resistance from the united warriors under Rex Caspian. Eventually, the war came to a stalemate, and the two warlords agreed to parley. They walked away from their meeting as fast friends, and agreed to acknowledge the sovereignty of each other's kingdoms. Karn returned to Port Brynor to rule over Karnsreik, while Rex Caspian united the lands of Caspia.</p>\n<p>However, Karn ruled the lands as a tyrant, and over twelve years drove most of his kingdom into famine and drought. After a plague swept through Port Brynor during a particularly brutal winter, his own soldiers turned on him. Karn was dragged outside his castle, and the knights and nobles of Port Brynor stoned him to death while he tried to flee. They hung his quartered remains on the castle walls as a display.</p>\n<h3>Lasting Peace</h3>\n<p>The Vales were happy to be rid of Karn, and no distinct ruler ever took his place since. After the reign of Karn, the people of the Vales have been extremely wary of any ruler, king, or lord who would claim title to the lands. Over the years, the Eastern Vales have fallen into a sort of routine, each keeping the others in check. The leaders of the Vales' many townships are fearful to overstep their bounds in case they bring down the wrath of the rest of the region. It has worked out for the Vales so far, and the lands have prospered under this unspoken system.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<p>These prominent people inhabit the Eastern Vales:</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Commander Esther Livingston</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/006-pg88-esther-livingston-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Commander Esther Livingston\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/006-pg88-esther-livingston-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Commander Livingston, a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.J8xjoG4Dxb8WkHtV] is the current ruler of Port Brynor. She commands the strongest military force in the Vales and overlooks much of the trade passing through her city. She is a stern and intellectual woman, but honest to a fault. Commander Livingston has no desire to stretch her reach any further than the outskirts of her city, and instead wants to ensure that the Eastern Vales remains a free and proud collective of communities. She has been known to aid many of the other towns and cities along the Dawnbreaker Trail when dealing with unwanted monsters from the woods, or rival nations interfering.</p>\n<p>Esther is a sturdy woman with short brown hair, thin pointed eyebrows, dark eyes, and pursed lips. She is often clad in dull steel armor and carries her sword with her wherever she goes. She drapes a red mantle cape off her left pauldron.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I speak in a gruff and commanding voice. I haven't gotten where I am being soft, so don't expect me to humor you with false kindness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> It's a dangerous world, full of dangerous people. Rely on yourself, and those you know you can trust.

She is sometimes seen drifting through the halls of Paradox Castle like a wayward ghost. She greets students occasionally, but many are uneasy around her and find her blank stares and emotionless expression rather haunting.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I speak in an ethereal voice, and often my words slip into ancient dialects and riddled expressions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I know full well the destructive potential of evocation magic. These world-shattering spells must be kept as safe-guarded secrets, to be used only in times of dire need.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> The other @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf]{Academy Directors} cannot match my absolute mastery of war magic. Their magic is but parlor tricks compared to the destructive power I command.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I often miss or completely ignore social cues, forgetting that other beings have opinions… or relevant thoughts.\n</p>\n<p>There is a rumor amongst many Academy students and even some faculty regarding Lasaia's origins. Students and faculty speculate that she came through the Elfgates when elves first arrived, and unlike the other elves of the world, the archmage knows exactly why and how they came. When Headmaster Rupert Greywell of Paradox Castle once confronted her on the topic in front of several observing students, Lasaia trapped him within a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Y7uWUO4yqUN0JKl0] and classes were canceled. It is well-known that Lasaia has been trying to replace Rupert Greywell for some time and is seeking a good excuse to demote the care-free oaf.</p>\n<p>In the twisting unrealities of Paradox Castle, there sometimes appears a blue door with a gemstone knob in various locations throughout the school. The door leads to Lasaia's offices and lab, but students who have opened the door have found nothing but an eternal black void stretching out forever.</p>\n<p>Deep within this secret laboratory, Lasaia Nightbreeze has been working to unlock the full destructive power of delerium. She has assembled a sequestered team of brilliant evokers all sworn to absolute secrecy — the archmage has inscribed an explosive rune on the forehead of each wizard, which will slay them if they utter a single word of their great project outside her lab. Together, they have created the<em> disjunction bomb</em>, a horrifically devastating delerium-based weapon of mass destruction with the power to annihilate an entire city district. Now, they are working on even more powerful variants.</p>\n<p>One of the compelling outcomes of this research has been the potential for delerium to be used simply as a conventional power source which could unlock wondrous improvements into the lives of common folk, though such quotidian applications bore the archmage. She is convinced delerium is the next evolution of magic, not a frivolous tool.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“The Eastern Vales have such beautiful cities, green fields, a terrifying black dragon, and the best pies in the continent.

He has a bushy brown beard, and a thick curled mustache that spans the entire length of his face. He has large circular glasses that cause his eyes to look much larger than they should. He is a hefty man who wears elegant purple robes and a pointed purple hat. He is always smiling and his bellowing laugh echoes through the chambers of his school. He adores the Academy Stronghold and loves meeting and pranking the students. Headmaster Greywell has a tendency to speak in riddles, and half-true jovial warnings.

However, the Directorate does not love his quirky and rambunctious attitude, and have been waiting for him to slip up for years so they can replace the headmaster. Rupert however, is not a dullard, and knows well the opinion his higher ups have of him. He has a cunning intellect and mind for politics that many do not expect, and carefully treads the line of being regarded by his staff and students as carefree, fun-loving, and a joy to work with, while also making sure he stays well within the guidelines, rules, and structure laid out by the Academy.

She is well-loved by the people and is regarded as a kind and caring individual, welcoming to all people, and exuding love and compassion to everyone she meets. Greta has established the Kinland Hills as a welcoming place for smallfolk to escape the many wars of Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär.</p>\n<p>Standing four feet tall, Greta is a rotund elderly woman. She often wears a brightly-colored yellow dress.

As the sun rises, those heading along the road towards the coast are greeted by the morning sun, a welcoming glow on the horizon.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Gilded Grasslands</h2>\n<p>The Gilded Grasslands are the stretch of farmland along the Dawnbreaker Trail from Dregden's Ferry all the way to Port Brynor. The golden fields and tall grasses make up the heart of the Eastern Vales and make for a pleasant stretch of road amongst the smaller rural communities and farmsteads that dot the landscape.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Ironhelm Ridge</h2>\n<p>This range of snow-peaked mountains falls at the break between Westemär, Netherwind, and the Eastern Vales. The remote range is home to several large dwarven communities. Ever since the fall of Glitter Peak, the mighty Ironhelm Keep has stood as the last great bastion of dwarven power, architecture, and engineering on the continent.</p>\n<p>Ironhelm Ridge was named by the dwarven clan who settled there when they emerged on the surface. While the titular keep stands prominently along the slopes of the mountains, dozens of other mining communities, mountain villages, and winter holdfasts are found in the foothills of the mountain range.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Shadowfens</h2>\n<p>The Shadowfens are a large bog in the south of the Eastern Vales. The fens stretch from Kinland Hills all the way to the Ruins of Tolan's Keep. The Shadowfens are filled with tall reeds, thick sawgrass, pickleweed, and a rough patchwork assortment of muddy earth drowned in a thin layer of water. Throughout the spring and fall, the waters become extremely deep, leaving only the highest tops of the hilly grasslands poking out. During midsummer, there are a few more walkable paths through the fens, and some areas freeze over in winter. The fens connect the Sister Lakes through a series of waterways, and are home to many exotic birds and insects. The Shadowfens attract dragonflies and butterflies in large numbers, and there are also reports of giant carnivorous insects that dwell in the fens.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Ruins of Tolan's Keep</h2>\n<p>In the southeast of the Eastern Vales, on the edge of the Shadowfens, along the northern bank of the Second Sister Lake, lies the great ruins of Tolan's Keep. Not long after the fall of the Arcane Empire, Tolan's Keep stood as the largest castle in the whole East and was, for a time, the seat of a former king who ruled the Vales. However, John Tolan waged a foolish war against @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.FbVTWCeJ0b5UeOfK], an old and powerful black dragon. Tolan lost his kingdom to the dragon and eventually, his life.</p>\n<p>The Ruins of Tolan's Keep still remain today as a large blackened keep with three standing towers and two shattered towers that have been reduced mostly to rubble. The western side of the keep has collapsed and crumbled, and the surrounding area is now a wet marshland overgrown with sawgrass, vines, and other wetland flora. The surrounding area that was once a small kingdom is nothing more than some scattered stone walls overtaken by vines, fractured statues caked in moss, ruins of buildings sinking into the muck, and inhabited by a wealth of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8aCTKP5qaBPFOqxM]{crocodiles}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.kSAi2KRonL4G4JpO]{giant frogs}, and giant dragonflies.</p>\n<p>The black dragon Amarodial has claimed the ruins, and the former wealth of John Tolan as his own. Most do not venture too close to the ruins anymore, fearing the dragon's ire. Locals speculate that the Tolan family treasure is still mostly intact, including their crown, which was said to hold great magical properties. Tales of other unique and incredible items still echo through the Vales, but no one can prove these claims, and few dare to explore Amarodial's lair.</p>\n<h3>Amarodial the Bitterheart</h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.qNdFhY3JOkCfhG3d] of the Shadowfens is among the oldest living dragons in the known world. Residing in the ruins of Tolan's Keep, this dragon has a history of torment against the people of the Eastern Vales. While occasionally adventurers and even armies mustered in the Vales take up arms against the dragon, these attempts to drive the beast from the Shadowfens have never succeeded. Most now avoid venturing into the northern reaches of the marsh. Sometimes, when the wetlands are letting off ample mist, you can see the shadow of black wings soaring through the swamp gasses.</p>\n<p>Amarodial has a lasting rivalry with Commander Callisto of the Caspian Scalebreaker Legion, who lives just over the southern mountain range. The two have fought several great battles. Amarodial loves conflict, and thrives on devouring those foolish enough to believe they can defeat them. Some say that the ruined castle that they use as a lair is filled with thousands of bones from those the great dragon has feasted upon.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Sister Lakes</h2>\n<p>The Shadowfens house two large lakes that make up much of the water that spreads through the wetlands. Known as the Sister Lakes, both lakes are roughly the same size and feed from the Rust Edge Mountains, giving their waters a distinct red-brown color. The westernmost lake is referred to as the First Sister; the Second Sister lies to the east.</p>\n<p>The lakes were once disputed territory between John Tolan and the great dragon Amarodial. The dragon now haunts these lakes and the surrounding marshes, but mostly stays in the areas surrounding Second Sister. One of the great strongholds of the Amethyst Academy, Paradox Castle, magically floats above the First Sister.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Woodrun River</h2>\n<p>This great river flows through the heart of the Eastern Vales from the Ironhelm Ridge out to the Ender Ocean. The Woodrun passes by most major cities along the way. The name of the river comes from the great Windwail Woodlands surrounding it at the base of the Ironhelm Ridge. Many exports and trade goods move down the river, especially lumber from the woodlands.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Port Brynor</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 25,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Esther Livingston</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Ocean Trade, Military Strength, Fish, Coal, Iron</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Approaching the walled city of Port Brynor, you can make out the stormy, rocky coast of the Ender Ocean.

The current ruler of Port Brynor, Esther Livingston, acquired the title after being nominated as Lord Commander of the Port Brynor knights. After Karn, no family monarchy has ever taken the throne of Port Brynor, and the throne room still remains unused. Esther refuses to sit upon it, or even enter the room which holds the great iron-forged throne. Now the castle is simply a military stronghold for the greatest force of the Eastern Vales, and Esther works hard to undo the terrible reputation that stains the city.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Iron Castle.</em></strong> The Iron Castle is a great fortress built off the rough cliffs looking down into the Ender Ocean. A series of three rock formations make up the entrance to the castle, and a stone bridge extends from the shore.

Nonetheless, it is the most defensible location in the Eastern Vales.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>World's End Harbor.</em></strong> The waterfront boasts floating wood platforms with many fisheries, warehouses and boat docks with three large steep staircases that ascend the cliffs up to the city proper.

The island is constantly bombarded with sprays of saltwater and often drowned by storms. Still, a lone lighthouse sits on the island, where wickies from the city take week-long shifts working the light to bring sailors safely into harbor. The wickies almost always tell tales of mermaids, sea serpents, and creatures lurking amongst the rocks of the small island.

Demand is high for weddings during the few weeks a year that the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, and the town makes significant money off of the many who travel here to be wed. A chapel to the Sacred Flame rests on the edge of the park, where @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] Shayla holds worship and officiates the many weddings, often in the gazebo, its eaves cloaked in delicate pink pedals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Paradox Castle</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 2,000 students and faculty</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Rupert Greywell</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Stronghold of the Amethyst Academy</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>A strange white stone castle with purple shingled rooftops floats above the marshy wetland, drifting high above First Sister Lake. As one looks upon the unusual structure, the peculiar angles of its walls and shifting towers make little sense to the human eye. The towers, stairs, and walls of the castle form optical illusions which create an impression of impossible geometry and architecture. The castle appears slightly different each time you glance at it, as walls and towers appear to be both connected and disconnected, in front of one another or below, with no clear attachment from one to the next. At each glance, the configuration of the castle appears to change: one might see a square building with four towers, while simultaneously observing a hexagonal building with six towers, or any other arrangement of shapes and structures. There doesn't seem to be any obvious way up to the gates.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>Paradox Castle is a well-known Amethyst Academy stronghold which hovers hundreds of feet above the western banks of First Sister Lake, avoiding the problematic wetlands below. The road leading up to the castle is constantly illuminated by strange floating lanterns emitting green glowing light, allowing those traveling to the castle to easily find their way. The road is constantly dry and safe to travel despite its surroundings.</p>\n<p>As the name implies, the castle itself baffles those who look upon it. Exactly how many towers compose the castle, and the exact arrangement of the walls and courtyards is impossible to say from the outside. The entrance to the castle is a great door which has no hinges, handles, or obvious way of opening, nor any obvious way of reaching it from the ground, but Academy mages can enter the castle all the same.</p>\n<p>The interior of Paradox Castle is just as confounded. Hallways stretch in unusual angles — students have reported passing by classmates walking along the walls or ceilings who seemed just as confused. Staircases lead to nowhere — a corridor will extend far beyond the layout suggested by the exterior, and occasionally windows will look out to alien landscapes. Reports have been heard of a student opening the wrong door at the wrong time and ending up on the moon, while another fell into a pit while sitting through a lesson and wound up on the roof of the castle. As such, it is regarded by many students that making it to class on time is basically impossible.</p>\n<p>When, where, or how exactly the Academy mages constructed Paradox Castle is not widely known. Paradox Castle is the leading facility for training young mages on the continent; three-quarters of Academy apprentices study at the school. While many other Academy locations do offer limited instruction, most of the strongholds are predominately used as research facilities, labs, and offices for the Academy's operations. Paradox Castle is the only stronghold that is regarded as a school first and foremost. Headmaster Rupert Greywell takes his role very seriously and has long enjoyed teaching young wizards and sorcerers how much fun — and dangerous — magic can be.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“Paradox Castle, my old stomping grounds!

Sailors searching for these lands wove tall tales claiming the elusive islands rest not within the waters, but float within the air, drifting between the world of mortals and the realms of fey. They came to be known as the Isles of Skye.</p>\n<p>The myths go on to say that as humans came to these lands, building their castles and homes, the magic slowly faded, and the islands settled into place within the ocean. Yet the echoes of that powerful connection to otherworldly places remain strong here today. The druids say the islands are still capable of floating, and that they are simply resting for a time. One day, they will take off again to float amongst the clouds and travel to another world<em>.</em></p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>The Isles of Skye consist of a large central landmass surrounded by several smaller islets. The coastlines are rocky cliffs overlooking the oceans, while the inner landmasses consist of rolling highlands, mist-swept mountains, ancient green forests, and thick bogs. The isles have a colder climate often greeted by wintry winds, salty ocean air, and tempestuous storms, though it does not snow every winter. The western end of the Islands has a rigid range of mountains known as the Reeglin Highlands, while the eastern areas are home to many rocky beaches, glens, and green hills.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Only a few hundred thousand people inhabit the Isles of Skye, most of whom are human. Skye is home to the largest elven community in the known world; even still their total number is not much larger than a small town. Gnomes and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.TjWQOgI3A4UAl7lC]{goblins} are also more common here than in any other region on the continent.</p>\n<p>The humans of Skye are known as cunning navigators and ocean raiders led by spiritual druids, though their fierce warriors have a reputation on the mainland as seafaring raiders.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>Skye does not have a recognized capital, but the city of Darryl along the southern shores of the isles is often the first port of call for sailors and travelers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Government</h2>\n<p>Local chieftains and petty warlords rule the communities of Skye. Skirmishes, duels, and battles between the disparate factions are frighteningly common, and the blood feuds and familial grudges span generations. Among the fearsome war chiefs of Skye, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.IzaPJE0A789kmG6o] has reigned over Darryl for the past decade and commands the most loyalty from his warriors, but none thus far have unified Skye under a single banner.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>The people of Skye believe the Old Gods still roam their lands in physical form. The people hold great reverence for all the Old Gods, telling stories of how their heroes have fought alongside, and occasionally against, the gods. Prominent menhirs honoring the abyssal Nodens dot the coast, and druids openly lead their communities in blood rites to Kromac. Witches and apothecaries perform rituals to seek wisdom from Morrigan, Ogham, and Dian Cheht. Warriors of Skye take to battle invoking the name of Nuada, and give thanks to Gaibhne for the gift of steel. Farmers say prayers when sowing and harvesting to gain the blessing of Danu and Lugh. Ancient stone circles are arranged in celestial formations to please Arwyn and Phantasia, but no hunter in Skye dares slay or eat a rabbit for fear Shegorach will bring misfortune upon them.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the Faith of the Sacred Flame is but a flickering candle in the Isles of Skye. Only a few small chapels, shrines, and monasteries are found here. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers} and monks are isolated hermits who keep their distance from the heathens around them.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<p>The Isles of Skye are suffused with magic, and lie at the intersection of great ley lines which narrow the borders between the mortal world and other dimensions. Today, the Amethyst Academy keeps one of their great strongholds in Skye at Starspire Observatory to monitor these magical phenomena.</p>\n<p>The isles are strongly connected to Dreamland and the Faerie Otherworlds. Along the misty shores, fetid bogs, and trackless forests, countless humans have found themselves lost in another plane. Conversely, all manner of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.MUpBNDoJEr09bLaO]{sprites}, pixies, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.KOHVWl5RU9XBR8Jb]{dryads}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.TjWQOgI3A4UAl7lC]{goblins}, and other fey have made their homes in Skye after being stranded during a fey crossing. Most notable amongst these plane-walking nomads are the elves, and it is believed that a great many of the elves living in the world today are descended from refugees who arrived from their forgotten world in Skye.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“Home to the elves, and also a bunch of really burly guys wearing animal furs. Had to go there for a few classes in school. Overall, top notch! Would visit again”</blockquote>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History</h1>\n<p>Of all places on the continent, the history of Skye is closely tied to myth. Each human community in Skye has their own tale which tells how they arrived upon the island, and why the gods favor them above the others. The warriors of Darryl, for instance, believe that they are descended from Nuada's mortal son, from whom the city takes its name. Many came to the Isles of Skye during the days of the Arcane Empire, and most small cities and towns along the eastern coasts and glens were founded during this time. Though Skye was not beyond the reach of the sorcerer-kings, it was one of the few places which remained free from their absolute rule.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Elven Arrivals</h2>\n<p>None know exactly why the elves fled their homeworld, or by what means they made the Elfgates, though most scholars agree it was long before the rise of the Arcane Empire. The elves speak little of the tale, as even the eldest among them have forgotten the truth.</p>\n<p>The ruins attributed to the elves are more ancient than their oldest memories, but once they arrived in this world, the elves sailed from Skye and roamed the mainland searching for their other kin. Only a small community remained amongst the forest glades of Eladria. The mythical community attracted many other fey creatures from time to time, and human travelers would venture for miles to behold the marvel of the strange place.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Fall of Eladria</h2>\n<p>Sorcerer-Queen Kaestelaria VIII harbored deep hatred for the elves, who she believed had hidden their magical secrets from her. In retaliation, the vengeful queen resolved to seek out Eladria to steal its arcane secrets. She called up a vast fleet to scour the northern oceans in search of the Isles of Skye, which met its doom shipwrecked against the Dragonbreath Columns. Undeterred by these massive losses, Kaestelaria VIII personally teleported a legion of her finest soldiers directly into Skye. Though over half this force was swept into the Space Between Worlds and never seen again, the army was more than enough to reduce Eladria to a smoldering pile of ruins.</p>\n<p>Kaestelaria VIII absconded back to the City of Nox with plundered knowledge and stolen magical treasures, abandoning her soldiers to be ultimately defeated by the steadfast human warriors of Enniskillen. Only a handful of elven survivors remained. However, this grim genocide used up so much of Kaestelaria's resources that in doing so, she completely lost control of the Eastern Vales, which was held over her head for some time as her failure to keep rule over the Arcane Empire.</p>\n<p>The elven purge impacted the Isles of Skye in a major way. The elves were left scattered and it took many years for much of the beauty of the islands to reclaim the scorched earth and scars of war that Kaestelaria caused.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<p>Described below are several notable individuals who dwell in the Isles of Skye.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Northfolk Clans</h2>\n<p>The Isles of Skye are home to many skilled warriors renowned for their brutal battle tactics, rage-fueled combat, and animalistic rituals. Although many families and kin groups make up these marauding clans, they are collectively known as the Northfolk Clans. The two most notable are the Lochlann and Blythway clans.</p>\n<p>They live in wooded riverside villages with longhouses in place of castles or keeps. The Northfolk keep sturdy longships with animal figureheads mounted at the front; often wolves, bears, and boars are symbols of their clans. They rush into battle with axes, clubs, maces, and javelins and paint their faces with the blood of wild creatures or their slain enemies. At night they perform ritualistic fireside ceremonies, often led by druids dedicated to the Old Gods.</p>\n<p>The clans often war against one another and rarely go more than a few years without a bloody battle between families. However, the Northfolk have also invaded the mainland from time to time. During the reign of House von Drakken, the ancestors of the Lochlann clan raided the Crystal Coast with a force of one hundred longships in an attempt to capture Drannsmund. Although they could not seize control of the city, they ravaged the Crystal Coast for years, burning several smaller villages, and erecting shrines to Nodens that still stand today.</p>\n<h3>Martyn Mac Lochlann</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/080-pg95-martyn-lochlann-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Martyn Mac Lochlann\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/080-pg95-martyn-lochlann-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>A great bear of a man, Martyn Mac Lochlann is the chieftain of Darryl, and the mightiest warlord in Skye. This human @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.n6tx6Y2nEgr1LnIA] has a mane of long reddish-brown hair that goes down past his shoulders, a thick beard with a gray patch at the chin, bushy eyebrows, and wild sky-blue eyes. He is typically clad in animal pelts and furs, and has tattooed arms like tree trunks bearing druidic symbols. Standing almost eight feet tall and weighing nearly six hundred pounds of pure muscle, he is an intimidating beast to behold.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I adore stories of glorious battle, and revel in retelling and reliving the great myths of my people and our gods.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><strong></strong> Through signs and portents, the Old Gods guide my path and destiny. If I am to lead Darryl to a prosperous future, it is by their will.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><strong></strong> The druids have guided my family for generations, and I do not stray from their teachings or rituals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><strong></strong> My superstitious beliefs have gotten in the way of my goals in the past. I often wait for the correct alignment of stars before performing a task, or hold off on a battle until I can hunt a boar in the name of Kromac.\n</p>\n<p>When charging into battle, Martyn often paints his face with woad and bear blood and drinks mead from a goblet carved from a skull. He claims the skull belonged to his traitorous brother. Martyn keeps close relations with the Druids of Kromac and Nodens, and often seeks the elders for guidance and direction in his political dealings. However, he is a deeply spiritual and superstitious man, and frequently partakes in blood rituals and midnight seances.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Amethyst Academy</h2>\n<p>The Academy has a significant presence in Skye, with one of their elusive strongholds hidden amongst the highlands of the island.</p>\n<h3>Zodiac Allsight</h3>\n<p>This hermetic @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.68bAMIpe4jvDeR9G] @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf] is one of the eight members of the Amethyst Academy Directorate. Standing thirty feet tall with a flowing midnight-blue beard and pale blue skin, he carries a colossal staff carved from the trunk of an elm tree, topped with a boulder of elemental gemstones.</p>\n<p>Zodiac performs most of his research at Starspire Observatory, where he has spent centuries cataloging and monitoring the stars and cosmos. Zodiac rarely interacts with other mages in the observatory, and usually only speaks to the other Academy Directors. His oldest friend and former apprentice Delilah Willowart manages the day-to-day administration of the observatory, as Zodiac hates being disturbed and is quick to anger when someone interrupts him.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong><strong></strong> I only speak to those I deem worthy of hearing what I have to say, but lightning crackles in my eyes and my voice booms like thunder when I do. Very few people are worthy of my attention, and I do not care for small talk, japes, or trivial matters.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><strong></strong> I am the most powerful mage in the Amethyst Academy and expect to be treated as such. Monarchs, high priests, and common folk alike are but squabbling pests who should kneel before the might of my magic.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><strong></strong> I honor the Edicts of Lumen, but think the treaty is nonsense. Mages deserve to take their place as the true rulers of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><strong></strong> I am completely vexed by how I did not see the meteor on its way to Drakkenheim long before it appeared in the night sky. I grow furious and indignant when others question me about it.\n</p>\n<p>Zodiac has long known that small delerium crystals can be found powering rare ancient elven artifacts in Skye. He has had some larger deposits sent to him from Drakkenheim to compare samples. Meanwhile, the elusive mage has tapped into the thin places upon the Island, and is attempting to create controlled doorways to other timelines using delerium. Zodiac wants to explore not only other worlds, but the past and future as well. In particular, he would love to travel back in time to watch the arrival of the elves, and learn how they made the Elfgates to travel between distant planets.</p>\n<h3>Grandmaster Delilah Willowart</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/062-pg96-delilah-willowart-color2-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Grandmaster Delilah Willowart\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/062-pg96-delilah-willowart-color2-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>This wizened old @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6] of the Amethyst Academy resides at Starspire Observatory. She has held her position for nearly two centuries, having used magic to extend her natural lifespan. Delilah diligently manages the observatory's students and faculty, but is intensely devoted to the collection and study of astrology, the cosmos, the planes, and theories about time and space. Perhaps the greatest living expert on astronomy, she is a studied academic who has a tendency to talk for hours on end about any topic she is excited about.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong><strong></strong> I speak endlessly and in great detail about the stars, cosmos, and celestial bodies. They fascinate me deeply.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><strong></strong> A journey into outer space should be the Amethyst Academy's most important goal.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><strong></strong> Zodiac has been an incredible mentor. I am honored to be counted amongst his friends and will do everything in my power to follow his teachings.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><strong></strong> I can't keep my mouth shut and am terrible at keeping secrets. I just love to tell people things.\n</p>\n<p>Delilah is among the only mages outside the Academy Directorate that Zodiac confides in and discusses matters with regularly. The two are close friends despite the giant's misanthropic nature.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Elves</h2>\n<p>Though elves are a rare ancestry in the continent, there are a great many who have made their home in the Isles of Skye. Reclaiming the fallen ruins of an ancient elven kingdom, the people of Eladria have begun to rebuild their home, and make a place of their own within the deep woods of the island, where they feel close to the faerie realms and their own forgotten history.</p>\n<h3>Queen Genevieve Autumnfall</h3>\n<p>The current Queen of Eladria, Genevieve Autumnfall, is an elven @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE] with platinum hair, wide-set bright blue eyes, a long neck, and long, thin arms and legs. She wears faded brown robes interwoven with spun gold, and crown set with jewels to resemble red, yellow, and orange leaves upon her head.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong><strong></strong> I very carefully think out my words before I say them, making sure they are important and impactful.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><strong></strong> I believe the elven people came to this world for a reason, and that reason was more than to just forget who we were and fade away.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><strong></strong> We might never know where we came from, but my people deserve a place to call home.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><strong></strong> I am hopeful to a fault. I refuse to accept the end of the elves, and believe strongly that no matter what, we will endure.\n</p>\n<p>Genevieve has watched over the small community of elves for a hundred years. She wants nothing more than to create a kingdom for elves to thrive. However, she is welcoming to half-elves within her community as well. She wants to create a place where the elves can grow their population, and stop them from becoming the faded and lost memories like the ruins she calls home.</p>\n<p>Since the Isles of Skye are not a united nation, they were not an official party to the Edicts of Lumen. As a mageborn wizard, Queen Genevieve only holds her title thanks to the remoteness of her domain. As such, she is careful to remain relatively obscure lest she get dragged into the politics of the mainland.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<p>Here are but a few of the fantastic places found across the Isles of Skye.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Dragonbreath Columns</h2>\n<p>Along the southwestern shores of the mainland of Skye, as well as several of the smaller islands off the coast, stand countless hexagon-shaped basalt columns. The jagged columns form interlocking rocky escarpments and low plateaus. The tops of the basalt towers form stepping stones that lead down from the crags above and disappear under the sea. Locals believe these strange rock formations are all that remains of several great castles built by Gaibhne, and torn down by red dragons at the behest of Kromac and elemental storms conjured by Nodens.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Giant's Lean</h2>\n<p>In the northwestern end of the island is a renowned cliff known as the Giant's Lean, a massive flat slab of earth covered in lush green grass that rises upwards for miles before ending at a peak above Garlow Forest. The cliff is known as the best vantage point to see all of Skye, and in the distant horizon on a clear day you can even see the glimmer of the Crystal Coast of Westemär.</p>\n<p>Embedded in the stones at the edge of the cliff is an ancient sword. Local legends claim the blade once belonged to the Old God Nuada the Silver Handed. This blade has never been removed, although many have tried. It's said that the sword waits for a worthy valkyrie chosen by the Old Gods as their champion to claim the sword while on a quest to vanquish a great evil.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Glens of Vardale</h2>\n<p>The hilly green fields that span between Enniskillen and Darryl are a tightly packed patchwork of farms and known as the Glens of Vardale. The farms here produce much of the livestock and grains for the Isles of Skye. They branch along the Emerald Trail, the most popular trade route between the two major cities of the Isles of Skye. Countless battles have been fought throughout this region, and farmers plow up old weapons and bones as often as stubborn stones.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Reeglin Highlands</h2>\n<p>The western end of the mainland of Skye is known as the Reeglin Highlands. Consisting of a mountainous stretch of green hills and rocky mountains, the western coast line is a sheer cliff that drops hundreds of feet into jagged rocks along the ocean below. It's rumored that occasionally one can spot @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.KUpbXdn1XmHEeOPk]{merfolk} and other sea-dwelling creatures in the waters off the cliffs. A longstanding myth claims there is a city of waterfolk deep in the grottos and cave systems beneath the island. Meanwhile, the green mountains are said to be filled with covens of mysterious hags who use the natural magic of the island in their rituals and spells.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Starspire Observatory</h2>\n<p>This massive elven tower has been repurposed into a great observatory and library, one of the eight great strongholds of the Amethyst Academy. Few students are educated here, but Academy mages travel to the location to research not only the night sky but the entire cosmos.</p>\n<p>It is a large white cylindrical building hundreds of feet tall with a huge glass dome at the top. Winding staircases weave through a massive central library that fills the entire building. Magical platforms, some adorned with comfortable reading chairs, float amongst the seemingly endless shelves of books. Other rooms are dedicated to star maps, astronomical calculations, and a scriptorium that produces scrolls and magical inks. Beneath the great glass dome is a massive brass and copper telescope looking up to the sky above.</p>\n<p>At the behest of Archmage @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ZUhQYvVymk4PgNu6], @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.UxxrMnYJxnSuAcew] keeps the observatory in pristine shape and tends to all the needs of the facility, welcoming students and faculty of the Amethyst Academy to study the cosmos.</p>\n<p>Occupying a pocket dimension parallel to the Observatory is Zodiac's arcane lab, which is warded and off limits to everyone except Dililah Willowart. Zodiac uses delerium as an arcane conduit to harness and control the fluctuations of thin places between the planes. Although prone to arcane anomalies and accidental implosions, Zodiac has erected relatively stable gates to the Shadowrealm, the Faerie Otherworlds, Dreamland, and a distant unnamed planet with purple skies and orange grass fields. However, the experiments have caused several Thin Places to become highly active throughout Skye, drawing more dangerous fey and shadowy creatures to the island.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Stones of Almorra</h2>\n<p>Just off the northern coast of the mainland of Skye is a large flat landmass of green fields. The island is known to be so flat that you can see another person standing on the island from miles away. There is a strange, ancient druidic grove along the isle's northernmost tip.</p>\n<p>No record of the isle's origin exists, but the Northfolk named the location after Almorra, a divergent myth in Skye, which regards the Old Gods Arwyn and Phantasia as one entity. The grove consists of three rings of standing stones. In the very center is a stone disc embedded in the ground with a carving of nine imperfect ringed circles growing smaller towards the center of the slab, with a small carved dot found somewhere along each ring.</p>\n<p>The henge's purpose is unknown. Some have speculated the rings in the middle slab correspond to the planets found in the immediate cosmos, with the large stone rings representing each of the old gods observing and maintaining the cosmos. However, no one can account for the number of stone structures representing any gods at all, and so all theories are pure speculation. The druids claim they did not build it, but they now keep it and consider it sacred to the Old Gods.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Darryl</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 13,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Martyn Mac Lochlann</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> International Trade, Druid Circles, Lochlann Clan</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Amongst a thicket of pine, elm, and oak trees sits the town of Darryl. A large wooden longhouse perches at the top of a low hill overlooking the river, while a sprawling clutter of roughly made wooden cabins, shelters, and open-faced workshops extends towards the bay. Rows of stone houses line the winding path up to the longhouse. The smell of peat, chopped wood, and ocean water fill the town. A short way from the longhouse, in the nearby woods, is a great circular clearing with a central bonfire and a small square stone hut with a wood and moss roof where a Druid to Kromac performs ritual sacrifices and holds nightly worship. Along the bay is a small dock and harbor lined with rows of longships, a fishery, a sawmill, and a workshop. The sounds of gruff voices, clanging metal, and woodworking fill the air.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>Nestled in a natural harbor and surrounded by a network of fishing villages, the rainy city of Darryl boasts the only fortified port in Skye. As such, it is a primary destination for travelers and traders from the mainland.

Every full moon, townsfolk gather in the grove and sacrifice a wild boar in the name of the Old Gods and pray for a bountiful harvest, good hunting, calm seas, and fortune in future battles.</p>\n<p>The city is controlled by the Lochlann clan, led by the ferocious @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.IzaPJE0A789kmG6o]. These warriors often venture into battle wearing little more than animal furs, their faces painted with animal blood, incited into rage by the druids of Kromac. They sail the waters around the Isles of Skye in their longships, and are known as ruthless raiders on the mainland.</p>\n<p>The fearsome reputation of Darryl's warriors is matched only by the fame of the city's meadhalls, which are constantly bustling with revelry and tall tales of seafaring voyages, great travels, and adventures.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Enniskillen</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 6,500 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Dierdra Blythway, a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.kz1t6xeXVwODpYb2]{berserker}</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Monks of the Sacred Flame, Swans</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>The beautiful lake Cygnet glistens in the sun, as a flock of swans flutter about the waters near the banks of a small island.

Across from the island on the shores of the lake is a small city of stone buildings, their rooftops covered in moss. Chimneys puff wafts of smoke as the people within fight off the northern chill.

The cleanly built stone structures of Enniskillen, beautiful boardwalk along the lake, and central stone longhouse are testaments to the peak of northern architecture. The monastery brings the faith of the Sacred Flame to the village, and has been the cause of several wars between the Blythway and Lochlann clans. While the Blythways believe strongly in advancement and progression of their people, adopting design, religion, and war tactics from the mainland, they scoff at the Lochlanns, who remain dedicated to ancient tradition and archaic lifestyles.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/023-pg98-darryl-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Eladria</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Last City of the Elves</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 1,250 elves</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Queen Genevieve</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Elven Ruins, Passage to the Fairy Realms</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n        <p>Concealed by a thick grove, a mist-shrouded trellis of ancient trees leads into the ruins of Eladria.

Many true elves from all over the continent make a point to visit Eladria whenever the chance arises. It's said that no elf or half-elf should go their lives without making the trip to the ruins of Eladria.</p>\n<p>The city had glittering fairy lights illuminating ornate spiral staircases that spanned from the base of the trees up into the city above, thousands of hollowed tree houses, walkways, and beautiful waterways and fountains all among the tops of the trees.

The streets consist of a maze-like network of canals, elegant arched bridges, and stone walkways which spill over the Golden Bay harbor. Terracotta rooftops cover densely placed buildings with impressive marble and limestone architecture. Banks, chapels, workshops, galleries, townhomes, and estates are separated by large plazas decorated with statues, gardens, and fountains. The music of minstrels mingles with the murmur of merchants in the marketplaces. In Liberio, gold coins flow like water.</p>\n        <p>Hovering in the sky over the busy ship-filled port is a bizarre sight indeed. A colossal tetrahedral monolith larger than the biggest structures in the city below oscillates slowly in the sky. Its outer facade is a network of twisting puzzle-pieces in an indescribable color.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">This independent city-state rests between the nations of Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär, at the northernmost tip of Golden Bay. The free people of Liberio believe their city the greatest in the world, and perhaps there is some truth to it. Blessed with a democratic, if plutocratic, government, considerable wealth, and an agreeable climate, the city is a thriving place for commerce, culture, and industry. Thanks to its independence and central location along the Middle Sea, Liberio has become a hub for trade throughout the continent. All manner of goods flow through here — including delerium. Furthermore, as a neutral power resting between the three largest nations of the continent, Liberio is a hotbed for politics between the great nations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">History</h2>\n<p>Founded by Sorcerer-King Orion III as a shipyard to build a vast fleet of spell-ships with which he controlled the Middle Sea, Liberio has changed hands several times since the fall of the Arcane Empire. Originally a member of the League of Elyria, it has been besieged and captured numerous times. Kristoff Karn was the first to claim the city, after which Liberio was ceded to Rex Caspian. Subsequently, Elyria warred with Houses Jackson, Joplin, and Joyce over the city. It was then taken by Albrecht von Drakken, and after his invasion failed, the people of Liberio asserted their independence and founded their Republic.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Government</h2>\n<p>Liberio is a democratic state governed by two chambers. The Legislature is an elected body of one hundred citizens who serve four-year terms, and the Assembly consists of a rotating body of five hundred citizens chosen by lottery each year. The Legislature develops the laws and policies, which must then be ratified by the Assembly. The two houses jointly nominate and elect a Consul to lead the city every two years.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>Although its people are quite moderate, years of strong association and proximity to Elyria has left its influence. The Faith of the Sacred Flame flourishes in Liberio, and stories and myths from the religion are a popular subject for the artists of Liberio. Countless paintings, statues, and poems about Saint Tarna have been created and composed here: indeed, the Divine Matriarch has almost always been the greatest patron of Liberian art.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<p>The powerful and palpable influence of the Amethyst Academy is felt throughout Liberio. The purple-robed wizards are a common sight throughout the streets, often zipping overhead with magical spells and flying carpets, coming and going from the Enigma Ziggurat. The mages do most of their business in Liberio, trading magical items, potions, and spellcasting services for coin and delerium with the wealthy merchants and nobles who pass through and live in the free city.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<p>The city of Liberio is home to dozens of banks, guilds devoted to every craft and skill, and great vaults where the wealthy keep their coins and valuable artworks. The piazzas and many marketplaces of the city are abuzz with activity day and night. Canals, bridges, and footpaths, not roads, are the primary passage through the streets of Liberio. Boats and rafts all converge upon the harbor, a great ring of docks which thrust deep into the Golden Bay.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Conservatory of Creation</h2>\n<p>This large building sits in the heart of Liberio. It is an asymmetrical structure with odd, confounding angles that stands as an artwork all its own. It is made of ancient beige brick with large archways and great mosaics laid into the outer walls. Large stained-glass windows are dispersed irregularly along the outer walls depicting great historical breakthroughs in invention, art, and science. The building houses a beautiful central courtyard with stone walkways, benches, and a topiary garden.</p>\n<p>The conservatory functions as both a gallery and school for the arts. Since it was founded some of the greatest painters, sculptors, poets, bards, inventors, and philosophers have attended the unique school. Among them include: Horatio, the famous architect who designed the building itself, and many of the great cathedrals in the Continent, including the modernization of Saint Tarna's Cathedral. Then there was the brilliant inventor Ludovico, who has designed steam-powered engines, cannons, improved metallurgy, and even dreamed up designs for flight without using magic. Sarto, the great philosopher who composed works on politics, ethics, and religion in his work<em> The Nine Alignments</em>. Nicoletti, the famous sculptor, who created the statue of Goliath which now sits in the courtyard of the conservatory. Rosana, who painted the famous works<em> Lisella Maria</em>,<em> Midsummer Night</em>, and<em> The Lady with the Diamond Ring</em>; and Gotti, the renowned poet who wrote the<em> Canticle of Caspia</em> as well as<em> The Road Seldom Traveled</em>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Cathedral of Saint Fiona</h2>\n<p>The Cathedral of Saint Fiona is a testament of architecture and stands as one of the most beautiful cathedrals on the continent next to the Cathedral of Saint Tarna in Lumen, and the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio in Drakkenheim. It is a massive white building with a great central glass dome above the central altar, so the light from the brilliant beacon within the cathedral can be seen from the outside. Various stained-glass windows line the long building, stretching three stories tall, depicting the various stories of the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<p>High Flamekeeper Portia has tended to the church for decades, keeping the brazier lit and offering guidance to those visiting the sacred grounds. She is a mild-mannered woman who never forces the Faith, but simply offers a kind hand and helpful advice to any seeking it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Ponte Grande</h2>\n<p>The large stonework bridge extends over the central canal of the city and is lined with shops and buildings, making it the busiest marketplace in the city. Along both sides of the bridge are several large carvings of the faces of great artists of the city facing out towards the canal below.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Anchor Citadel</h2>\n<p>This greatly fortified fort rests upon the harbor of the city, and has its own internal docks and a huge water gate to allow ships in and out. The impressive castle is the military headquarters of Liberio's army and navy. The city has a modest military, but makes up for it with the might of its naval fleet. The great ships sport white sails with the symbol of the city upon them, and are great defenders of the Middle Sea.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Enigma Ziggurat</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Stronghold of the Amethyst Academy</em></p>\n<p>Hovering high over the harbor, the sight of the Enigma Ziggurat symbolizes the city of Liberio itself. An enormous octarine tetrahedron, the outer faces are covered in a slowly-shifting array of puzzle-piece shaped panels, staircases, columns, and balconies. There is no entrance by ground or sea, so flight or teleportation are needed to access the building.</p>\n<p>The interior is a labyrinthian dungeon, far larger on the inside than even the massive exterior implies. Chambers dedicated to the Academy's craft and industry fill the ziggurat's many corners and hidden niches. Spellforges, elemental foundries, and planar crucibles are used to fashion enchanted weapons, wandsand staves. Alchemical refineries and gigantic spinning cauldrons brew up vats of magical potions and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.items.Item.A9qY2fXBh1Ky1bOs]. Special arcane accelerators used to study magical energies, matter, and phenomena of all kinds, allow the mages to synthesize almost any material from base elements. The mages use secluded sections of the fortress reinforced with arcane wards and guardians to lock away unspeakable creatures and dangerous magic.</p>\n<p>The Enigma Ziggurat was constructed by Sorcerer-King Orion III. When the first mages of the Amethyst Academy sought a secure base of operations, they used their influence and resources to capture the ziggurat and repurpose it into an arcane research facility. While it has remained one of their principal headquarters, since the loss of the Inscrutable Tower in Drakkenheim, the Enigma Ziggurat has become the true fulcrum of the Amethyst Academy. In the laboratories, workshops, and foundries hidden deep within the bowels of the ziggurat, the mages study delerium and construct all manner of occult wonders using the crystals. The Amethyst Academy has constructed a yawning cavern at the core of the structure filled with a massive collection of delerium harvested from Drakkenheim. The mages hope the vast concentration will spur the growth of new crystals. Powerful containment measures and arcane wards seal the pressurized and lead-lined room to hold back the billowing energies of the new Haze developing here.</p>\n<p>Whenever a grave matter demands the Academy Directorate hold an audience with the continent's rulers, they conduct the matter in the Engima Ziggurat's Endless Corridor. This grand chamber has been ensorcelled in such a way that those who enter from the opposite ends of the hall can see and speak with one another, but cannot cross to the other side of the room. Instead, opposing occupants of the room can walk or run towards another forever and never come near.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<p>These prominent people inhabit Liberio:</p>\n<h3>Consul Isabella Ezio</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/065-pg102-isabella-ezio-cmykk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Consul Isabella Ezio\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/065-pg102-isabella-ezio-cmykk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Isabella is a bold, middle-aged @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] woman with long brown hair usually tied up in a ponytail. She wears a modest long skirt and blouse and has served three terms as Consul of the Republic of Liberio. Isabella is a well-spoken woman and a powerful leader. She is a staunch supporter of the people and has fought hard for the city and its freedoms.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I always speak as though I am giving a speech. I choose my words carefully to ensure their impact.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> No gods or kings rule Liberio; it is the people who make things great. By the choices of the people will we see our triumph or our ruin.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> Liberio is constantly on the brink of losing its freedom to one of the nations hounding our borders. Our freedom is a fragile thing, and we must treasure it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I will go to any length for freedom: lie, cheat, steal, and if I have to kill, I will.\n</p>\n<p>During her years in office, Isabella has found herself having to stand up to the High King of Caspia, and the Divine Matriarch of Elyria. She has struggled to have a voice in the concerns of delerium and Westemär, and has continually been pushed out of the major debates regarding the continent. Isabella feels it is her duty to bring the concerns of Liberio to the table and make a bold example to show Liberio is a player in the continental ongoings, especially during such tumultuous times.</p>\n<h3>Noble Houses</h3>\n<p>Three noble houses dominate culture, politics, and trade in Liberio:</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>House Leontes.</em></strong> Duke Benardo Leontes leads an extended family of bankers, notaries, and moneylenders. Their family has a hand in almost every business and financial transaction in Liberio.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>House de Vecsi.</em></strong> Duke Gueillermo's family are founders and primary benefactors of the Conservatory of Creation; the beauty and arts of Liberio have flourished thanks to their patronage. The de Vecsi family has commissioned many famous paintings, sculptures, and poems, and operate several theaters and hotels throughout the city.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>House Malvolio.</em></strong> Ruled by Duchess Francesca, House Malvolio is deeply involved in the political factions of the Liberian Legislature. The house is pushing the democratic body to form political parties — an idea long rejected by Liberio's republican founders. To what end exactly the family seeks greater political influence is unknown.\n</p>\n<h3>Archmage Alabaster</h3>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Director of the Amethyst Academy</em></p>\n<p>This powerful@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf] wizard is descended from a line of sorcerer-kings who infused their bloodline with a celestial heritage. As a result, he has angelic features, pale lavender skin, a short black beard, and sparkling opalescent eyes. He is often encountered simply wearing goggles and a stained leather smith's apron over a purple tunic, setting aside his Academy robes for attire more appropriate for his work.</p>\n<p>Alabaster is a peerless master of alchemy and transmutation magic. His experimentations and research involve using delerium to alter the material properties of other matter. Alabaster is well known to have created the formula for @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.items.Item.A9qY2fXBh1Ky1bOs]. He has already successfully developed a process to use delerium to transform lead into gold, but is now much more interested in using the stones to create some form of life. However, Alabaster is keenly aware of the erratic and chaotic effects of the crystals on flesh, which tend to produce insane, contaminated monsters. Instead, deep within the depths of the Enigma Ziggurat, he has fashioned several prototype human-sized golems with delerium crystal hearts. His unique method has produced magically animated constructs imbued with sentience and personality. Each is a unique and immaculately crafted being with intricate facial features, often decorated with porcelain, glass, and silver. The archmage quietly released a handful of his creations into the world to see what adventures they will find.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I seek to finish any conversation as quickly as possible so I can go back to my experiments.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><em></em> If it is true that celestial beings created life and the universe, I am merely striving to emulate the example of my ancestors. The world is but a grand experiment, now long-forgotten by those who set it in motion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond</em></strong><em>.</em> Delerium is the true philosopher's stone: its transformative properties are supreme. Using its magic, we can transform anything — perhaps even life itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw</em></strong><em>.</em><strong></strong> I have created many things in my life. However, I quickly move on to the next project and care little for my past experiments.\n</p>\n<p>Alabaster is a close confidant, partner, and sometimes lover to @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ggBl9pLVIGPL49rz]{Penumbra}, the Archmage of Terene. Together, the two are parents to several up-and-coming Academy students.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Adventures in Liberio</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Plot Hooks</h2>\n<p>Below are some specific adventures that might occur around Liberio you can use as small quests, or expand into entire campaigns.</p>\n<h3>The Stolen Maria</h3>\n<p>The famous painting<em> Lisella Maria</em> has been stolen!

Their leader charges forth hurling a spear directly into the gullet of the creature.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">The lands of Terene are covered by a large sprawling jungle that forms a natural border between the settled coastline of the nation and the realm of Caspia. Though many do inhabit the jungles in countless villages and tightly-knit communities, it largely remains a dangerous wilderness filled with monstrous reptiles, ferocious beasts, and primordial magic. Still, the lush green jungle is a sprawling natural environment filled with beautiful flora and fauna unlike anywhere else on the continent, and deep within the trackless foliage are many secluded druidic circles devoted to the Old Gods.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Terene takes its name from a misspelling of the word<em> Terrene</em>, which means “earthly,” or more generally “land or region” in Old Median. In the early days of the sorcerer-kings, many referred to the uninhabited jungles as simply “the jungles terrene,” which later were taken up as the name for lands of Terene.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Approximately two million people dwell in Terene, the majority along the southern shores which have long sandy beaches and beautiful blue ocean waters. Still, many others reside in the many villages which dot the banks of the Torvista River. Most are human, but mingled among them are several unique and varied folk with animal-like features, which locals claim is the mark and blessing of the Old Gods.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>The city of Sandspire rests where the beaches of the south meet the edge of the Terene Jungle along the Torvista River.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>Faith in the Old Gods runs strong in Terene. The pantheon of gods worshiped here features many more entities and figures not known prominently elsewhere in the continent. Danu, Kromac, and Nodens are held in especially high regard as the creators and sustainers of life and nature. The jungle is filled with old statues and worship circles to ancient beings. However, the Faith of the Sacred Flame is gradually spreading its influence in Terene.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Independence from the Arcane Empire</h2>\n<p>The furthest borders of the Arcane Empire ended at the Torvista River. Terene remained a largely independent nation during the reign of the sorcerer-kings, but the price was paid in the blood spilt by its defenders and massive tributes paid by its leaders.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Reptile Wars</h2>\n<p>The end of the Arcane Empire did not mark the end of foreign invasions into Terene. Reckless Caspian princes have made numerous attempts to “tame” the “wild jungles” of Terene. House Jagger regularly gathers their wyvern-riders on raids in search of glorious battle, whether against monsters lurking in the jungle or defenders mustered up to guard the borders of Terene. Time and time again, the Clawstriders have repelled the Caspians, sending them back to their homeland to lick their wounds.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<p>These prominent people inhabit Terene:</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Laurent</h2>\n<p>The Laurent dynasty reigns over Sandspire, claiming the towns and villages along the coast of Terene as part of their domain. Deeply devoted to Arwyn the Moon Hunter, House Laurent maintains strong connections to the druidic elders of the old goddess.</p>\n<p>The Laurents rose to power as great hunters responsible for defending the inhabitants of Terene from local threats and foreign invasion. Today, the household's holdings largely consist of the ranches and pens where their rangers tame the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.pLzSh4dA517Tn73E]{giant lizards} from the jungle to use as mounts and beasts of burden.</p>\n<h3>Prince Abdalla Laurent</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/042-pg105-abdalla-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Prince Abdalla Laurent\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/042-pg105-abdalla-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Prince Abdalla is the current head of House Laurent. He is a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] man of some forty years. He has short, tightly curled black hair, large brown eyes, brown skin, and a full face, with piercings through his nose and several along one ear. He wears a golden chain with the symbol of Arwyn the Moon Hunter as a pendant, but is an avid follower of the Old Gods and holds worship to Danu, Lugh, and Nodens as well. The prince wears a crown fashioned out of golden reeds upon his head and wears a yellow robe with red lining.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I speak often of the Old Gods, of their blessings, and look for signs and omens in the natural environments around me.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Terene is a free nation, where people may worship as they choose, live as they choose, and be who they choose. We do not squabble or dissolve into infighting as the “great” nations of the continent often do. We protect our borders and defend our lands from those who wish to bring their version of “civilization” to our peaceful kingdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My family has protected these lands, stood at the front lines of all our wars, and worshiped the gods who created this jungle and gave us this place to call home. I aim to continue their legacy as a leader and a prophet to my people.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I often read dark omens in the clouds, moon, and plants, and sometimes make drastic choices hoping to appease the gods.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Circle of Danu</h2>\n<p>The Circle of Danu is a large group of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.K15Yl8JmB5iPircc]{druids} who reside in the jungles towards the eastern end of the nation. They keep a community deep within the trees in an ancient grove that houses a massive stone temple to the Old God which dates back thousands of years.</p>\n<h3>Elder Nightsong</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/079-pg105-elder-nightsong-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Elder Nightsong\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/079-pg105-elder-nightsong-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ZWwmDC55io4rbFKF] has watched over the Circle of Danu and its druids for thousands of years. They are a respected druid sage amongst not only other druids, but all the people of Terene. The elder is a strange turtlefolk with pale, green, wrinkled skin and squinting beady eyes. They have a beard of moss that hangs off their chin, and their shell is adorned with carvings of ancient symbols of Danu. Elder Nightsong carries a gnarled wooden walking stick that has many mushrooms and flowers growing from it.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I speak on behalf of the forest and the earth, for mortals today can no longer hear the true voice of Danu. I am slow and ancient in my ways, but I offer wisdom to all who seek it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Danu is life. Without her blessing we cannot survive, and if we continue on our path, she will abandon us.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I am the keeper of these sacred grounds, and my followers are those who wish to aid in the betterment of this world. Together we can heal the harm being caused throughout the continent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> For all my sagely advice, I find myself untrusting of outsiders, and assume the worst in foreign travelers.\n</p>\n<p>Elder Nightsong enjoys sharing their wisdom with those passionate about the Old Gods, and keeping the temples of their ancient people safe and protected.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Amethyst Academy</h2>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy keeps a small presence in Terene, and only appears when matters in Sandspire call for a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] and Academy mage to be present. Nevertheless, great magic is hidden in these lands, so the Academy does keep a small tower in Sandspire.</p>\n<p>The Academy outpost in Sandspire baffles the locals. It is a ruined tower with the strange red door on the outskirts of town. Little remains of the structure save the doorway. Academy mages come and go through the door, vanishing through it to unknown places and emerging just as spontaneously.

She has large, spiraling gray horns emerging from her forehead, and keeps her blue-green hair in buns along the sides of her head. The archmage has deep, dark eyes, and sharp pointed teeth.</p>\n<p>Amongst the few who have met her in person, Penumbra is known as being both incredibly charming and extremely disarming. Those who speak with her are caught completely off guard by her outward kindness, and find themselves talking endlessly to her. Only after Penumbra leaves do they realize she never said anything about herself, and simply listened to them talk.</p>\n<p>Penumbra enjoys the trappings of everyday life, and is fascinated by the people in it. She enjoys spending time amongst the locals and admiring the sandy beaches and warm weather in Terene, though her powerful enchantments cause those who meet her to forget she was ever there. Penumbra's tendency to mingle with common folk has been a concern of the other Directors for some time. They know she travels to cities all over the continent, and often appears in taverns and pubs to hear tales of local problems, or sometimes sends hapless adventurers on dangerous quests to unknown ends.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Traits.</em></strong> I aim to be friendly and humble to the people around me. I am often delighted by mundane non-magical life.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> The more we can learn about the people of this world, the more we can use our magic to change it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> Alabaster has been with me through thick and thin for years and I admire his dedication and passion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I often upset my peers with my carefree attitude and nonchalant use of magic.\n</p>\n<p>The archmage works from a secret academy stronghold, where she had studied the effects of delerium contamination on the mind to understand the madness it causes. She has been using fish, rats, and birds as test subjects, attempting to imbue them with intelligence enough to manifest psionic abilities. If successful, she hopes to begin testing her method with human volunteers soon, potentially using delerium to imbue non-mageborn with magical powers.</p>\n<p>Penumbra has an on-again, off-again relationship with @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.C7yUf1r825NkN7TO]{Archmage Alabaster of Libero}.

Their traditions are ancient, as the people of these lands have been taming and riding the great lizards of the jungle for generations, both as beasts of burden and mounts in battle. They have fended off the Caspians many times in countless invasions.</p>\n<p>The rangers are often clad in natural armor made from tree bark, leaves, and tightly woven reeds and grass. They paint their faces with blue pigments created from local flora and use bows, javelins, and spears as their primary armaments. Clawstrider groups are often accompanied by a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.K15Yl8JmB5iPircc]{druid}, who brings the blessings of the Old Gods to the warriors. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.tbmsZEATC9dMthtF]{Clawstrider Rangers} worship many of the Old Gods, forming warbands dedicated to each. Groups dedicated to Arwyn, Danu, Kromac, Lugh, and even Morrigan are amongst the largest warbands stalking Terene.</p>\n<h3>Chief Ranger Tanesha Laurent</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/081-pg106-tanesha-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chief Ranger Tanesha Laurent\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/081-pg106-tanesha-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Tanesha, one of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.oaW0IAcWdRAkQoBs]'s sisters, is a fierce woman in her mid-thirties. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.tbmsZEATC9dMthtF] is athletic with flowing wavy black hair, a round face, and stern brown eyes. She is adorned with many piercings in her nose and ears. Tanesha is the current Chief Ranger of the Clawstriders, chosen to speak for all the warrior bands and lead them when they all fight together. She rides into battle atop a great red @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.HlddcPm4cWptj3ka] named Konak.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I am kind and caring to those who show loyalty and kindness to me. I often extend invitations and speak openly with people, knowing that if they decide to cross me, it will be their last mistake.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Do not give second chances to those who have not earned them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> The jungle is my home. I will protect it at all costs, and take vengeance against those who trespass here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I am incredibly impatient, whether in conversation<br />or battle.\n</p>\n<p>Tenesha wants to maintain the peace in Terene, but has an intense hatred for Caspians. She has long considered striking back into their lands as revenge for all the bloodshed their invasions have caused in Terene.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Terene Jungle</h2>\n<p>The rich jungles of Terene stretch across the nation. It is filled with primeval trees choked with vines, some hundreds of feet tall. While light shines throughout the canopy, the forest floor below is cast in deep darkness. Motes of magic dangle between the foliage, and colossal reptilian creatures stalk the thick plants and vine tangled debris. Here and there are found several old ruins that are not of elven, human, or dwarven design. Many assume the ancient inhabitants of the jungle built these shrines and structures thousands of years ago, and some are still used as holy sites by the elusive and strange folk of the jungle.</p>\n<p>Giant frogs, massive crocodiles, snakes, and all manner of beasts roam Terene's jungles, and they are a treacherous place for those who do not know how to navigate them. To many outsiders, the lands seem inhospitable, but to those who have made lives within the jungle, it is a safe and protected place, where the wild creatures help to deter outside invasion, and keep the villages along the great river safe.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Torvista River</h2>\n<p>This massive river — nearly a mile and a half wide in some areas — spans most of the length of Terene, starting at the southern end of the Rust Edge Mountains in Caspia and flowing through the Terene Jungle before emptying into the ocean at the city of Sandspire. Many communities in Terene lie upon the river; it is more common for traders and travelers journey down its length by raft or boat than attempt taking any road or pathway through the jungle. No bridge has yet been constructed across it, instead numerous ferries operate between riverside settlements. The water is known for being rich with beautiful flora and fauna, but the smaller tributaries flowing into it are hunting grounds for many deadly creatures, including @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.3YwmvDupMwycWNCO]{giant crocodiles}, aquatic snakes, and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.hqj2yXtgwt64v3Lj]{basilisks}.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Temple of the Elder One</h2>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>This temple is a towering monolithic structure of cracked stones choked by ancient vines.

Long ago it was a sacred place, once lost to time and overgrowth. The druidic Circle of Danu now holds the temple and its surrounding grove.

One can run their fingers through it like sand on the beach, but it still holds its structure. Orbs of glass occasionally form within the spire like tiny globes. No one is sure exactly when or how the strange spire was created, but local legends say that Nodens once sent an arcane storm over the beaches to scare away the first humans who settled on the beach.

The coasts are lined with white sand beaches and palm trees. It is nestled between the two distinct ridges of the Rust Edge Mountains. It is notable for the prominent Lake Leo as well as the great Glass River. It also houses the largest coral reef in the whole continent, whose intense colors and abundance of sea creatures is spoken of across many of the surrounding lands.</p>\n<p>Today Orleone is a strong independent nation who prides themselves on their powerful military, their beautiful landscapes, and their utopian ideals.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>\n  The lands of Orleone remained unsettled for some time.<br />\n  The sorcerer-kings considered it part of the Eastern Vales, but the first inhabitants of the region fought to keep their traditions and lifestyle free from the tyranny of the Arcane Empire.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Separation from the Eastern Vales</h2>\n<p>Orleone remained a part of the Eastern Vales up until the conquest of Karn, who held much of the region under his rule. After his invasion of Caspia, however, Karn's grip on power began to loosen with all the problems facing his tyrannical reign. After Karn's death, Rex Caspian saw an opportunity to add the lands of Orleone to his budding domain, thinking his old rival and friend would appreciate the gesture.</p>\n<p>Caspian was expecting little resistance. However, the people of Orleone had soldiers of their own, and put up a defense along their western border led by a warlord named Baasha the Red. The attempt to conquer the lands proved too costly for Rex Caspian, and so he abandoned his military ambitions and retired to sporting events in his arena.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Just under a million people dwell in Orleone. Most live along the Silver Coast, the Glass River, and the edges of Lake Leo. Humans make up about half the population of Orleone, but there are many other unique inhabitants in the region. The lands are known for a notable population of catfolk, said to be the favored people of the goddess Phantasia.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>Esnier is the notable city of Orleone, found along the Glass River where it empties into the Ender Ocean.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<p>Described below are several notable individuals who dwell<br />in Orleone.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The House of Kralj</h2>\n<p>The house of Kralj took over as lord of Orleone over two centuries ago when the former ruling house of Sjena was overthrown.</p>\n<h3>Lord Stari Kralj III</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/037-pg109-stari-kralj-edit-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Lord Stari Kralj III\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/037-pg109-stari-kralj-edit-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Stari is the third of his name and has ruled over Orleone for about thirty years.

His eyes are a piercing crimson and he is draped in a flowing red cloak. He wears a golden circlet of glittering ivy leaves encrusted with pearls from the Auroral Reef off the coast of his city. Stari often carries a golden scepter that is said to have magical properties that protect him from harm.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I hold my head high when I speak to others and enforce my words with authority and gravitas.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> One must always present themselves in the manner they wish to be perceived.

I am always concerned with politics and leadership, and forget to enjoy the small moments.\n</p>\n<p>Stari is a proud man and stresses endlessly about doing what is right and just for his people and his nation. He struggles to please everyone and has been known to come off as harsh or stern as he constantly tries to make rulings that best suit all parties. Many like Stari, but both his grandfather and father were regarded as the best rulers Orleone had ever had, and many worry that Stari is being crushed under the weight of his bloodline.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lion Guard</h2>\n<p>This elite order of warrior-monks has a storied tradition. It was founded by Majka Sjena when she defended the lands against the Karnsreik fur traders. These warriors combine agility and ferocity with brute strength and tactical positioning. They have faced many threats, both from foreign invaders, and monsters occupying the borderlands of their great nation. Time and time again the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.zFnO54srvoUrakeF] have proven their capabilities as some of the most unique and potent warriors on the continent.</p>\n<h3>Lion Guard Commander Lava Straža</h3>\n<p>This catfolk warrior has led the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.zFnO54srvoUrakeF] for the past decade.

Although most of the Lion Guard looks up to her, there are a few older warriors who do not like taking orders from someone much younger than them.

This reef is home to thousands of different species of coral, as well as countless tropical fish and sea creatures. From the sandy shores, one can still make out the cascades of vibrant colors beneath the surface of the waters.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lake Leo</h2>\n<p>Lake Leo is a large freshwater lake in the heart of Orleone. It provides much of the water for the central cities of the nation. There are legends of a great aquatic creature rumored to dwell at the center of the lake, however little reputable evidence exists of this creature. Occasional sightings and strange reports from sailors navigating the lake keep the legends alive for most of the locals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lions Gate Bridge</h2>\n<p>The famed Lions Gate Bridge is a massive bridge over the Silver River in the Northeast of Orleone, which connects the territory of Orleone to that of the Eastern Vales. The center point of the bridge opens into a large circular platform with twelve statues positioned like a clock face around the area. An iron slab in the middle of the circle acts as a sundial. Each statue depicts a great hero of Orleone with an inscription that tells their name and deeds they performed in life. A few of the most notable statues include Otac Sunca, who fought the Arcane Empire, Noćni Vrebač, who assassinated the Sorcerer-King Orion III, and Majka Sjena, who gave her life to defeat the Karnsreik fur traders.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Pyramids of Di'yone</h2>\n<p>Along the southwestern badlands of Orleone are the great Pyramids of Di'yone. These ancient stepped structures are thousands of years old, built by the inhabitants of these lands well before humans arrived. They house many of the cat-lords of the unknown past. The five pyramids are watched over by a massive statue of a sphinx known to the locals as the Great Grimalkin.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Goldplain Savanna</h2>\n<p>The south of Orleone is a sprawling savanna that is home to an abundance of wildlife for the eastern end of the continent. Orleone claims the land as theirs, but only a small few inhabit the areas, leaving it mostly open for the wildlife to flourish. Although there are a few sites of ancient ruins and a ghost town speckled about the dry grasses and widespread tree clusters, there is little else but great grasslands, a few rocky hills, and the great herds of animals moving about.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Esnier</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 35,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Lord Stari Kralj III</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Pearls, Clams, Oysters, Crab and Lobster, Exotic Fish and Animals, Spices</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>The great golden dome of the palace of the lord emerges, glowing in the sunlight of dawn.

Use this section to broaden your backstory or take up a Personal Quest to define your character's adventures!</p>\n<p>Herein you'll find rules for playing an Apothecary, a new base class for Fifth Edition, and additional subclass options for every other core class in the game. While these new player options are inspired by the Drakkenheim world, all of them can be readily played in other fantasy worlds as well.</p>\n<p>At the Game Master's discretion, players may utilize character options from other sourcebooks compatible with Fifth Edition when playing a Drakkenheim campaign. Such characters might represent a rare or unique character not typically encountered within the typical assumptions of the Drakkenheim setting.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Flawed Protagonists in a Broken World</h2>\n<p>The player characters are the heart of the story in a Drakkenheim campaign. However, player characters in Drakkenheim are seldom flawless figures — even the most altruistic have their faults and foibles. While pursuing their own aspirations and goals, the player characters unavoidably become entangled in the wider conflicts of the world at large. Their actions and choices will shape the fate of Drakkenheim, but the line between hero and villain rests entirely within one's point of view.</p>\n<p>Players shouldn't hesitate to create characters who are often at odds with the established order of the world. The world's nations, factions, religions, and laws exist to present compelling conflicts and deep dilemmas, and players should embrace characters who seek to challenge, defy, and resist them. When creating your character's backstory and personality, consider the following questions to deeply connect them to the forces at play in the setting:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>What was your character doing while civil war wracked Westemär?</li>\n  <li>How do the conflicts in the world affect your character's desires and goals?</li>\n  <li>Are your character's friends and family affected by these conflicts?</li>\n  <li>How does your character view the mages of the<br />Amethyst Academy?</li>\n  <li>What is their opinion of the Divine Matriarch of the Faith of the Sacred Flame?</li>\n  <li>Which noble houses hold your character's respect or rivalry?</li>\n  <li>Does your character care about who rules the nations of the continent?</li>\n  <li>What does your character think about delerium?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Player characters will face antagonists who defiantly wish to hold on to the old ways or aim to enforce their particular vision for the way the world ought to be. Meanwhile, the looming threat of otherworldly forces beyond mortal reckoning underpins a world slowly unraveling into chaos. Will your character meet these challenges head on, or be consumed by them?</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Exceptional Individuals</h2>\n<p>Adventurers of any race or class in the Core Rules can be found in the world of Drakkenheim. We've aimed to provide lots of ideas and inspiration for a wide variety of player character concepts, and believe a few well-considered constraints help foster creativity. However, players and Game Masters shouldn't shy away from making exceptions to the established lore when it comes to the origins and personal story of the player characters. After all, in many fantasy stories the protagonists are outsiders who don't quite fit into the world and every player should feel empowered to play the class, race, or background that speaks to them. The player characters get to be the exceptions to the rule. That's the beginning of an exciting story!</p>\n<p>Regardless of your character's origin, consider the<br />following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Where did your character grow up?</li>\n  <li>What cities, nations, and places has your character visited before? What did they do there? Who might they know there?</li>\n  <li>Does your character have living family members, friends, or loved ones? Where are they? What are they doing?</li>\n  <li>How did your character gain their class features and abilities?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Interconnected Relationships</h2>\n<p>Consider establishing a personal connection between two or more player characters, such as one of the following: They are…</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>...siblings, cousins, or childhood friends.</li>\n  <li>...a shared origin, religion, or teacher.</li>\n  <li>...former rivals turned unlikely allies.</li>\n  <li>...one saved the life of the other.</li>\n  <li>...saw each other in a dream or vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Personal Quests</h2>\n<p>A character's core motivation for adventuring is represented by their Personal Quest. This is a specific individual objective for player characters to achieve during the campaign. The players do not need to reveal their characters' Personal Quests to each other.</p>\n<p>When a character completes their Personal Quest, they choose one of the following rewards:</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Improvement</strong>. One ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.</p>\n<p><strong>New Feat</strong>. You gain a bonus feat of your choice, subject to the GM's approval.</p>\n<p>We've provided a few ideas for a personal quest related to each core class in Fifth Edition, but players can work with Game Masters to create one of their own design.</p>",

The sorcerer-kings destroyed many holy symbols and divinely empowered artifacts. The continent's first monks were forged in the rebellion against the sorcerer-kings, when a group of devout and faithful warriors channeled their divine powers into martial practices. While these monks could not master true divine spellcasting, they discovered how the meditative disciplines merged with martial practices led them to a higher spiritual state.</p>\n<p>These warrior-monks, imbued by the flame, led the devout in a rebellion against the sorcerer-kings after the fall of Saint Tarna. They sparked new hope into the Sacred Flame, when the sorcerer-kings thought they had squashed the rebellion by seizing holy relics and outlawing divine magic.</p>\n<p>In the time since the fall of the sorcerer-kings, the Faith has built many monasteries. These locations are holy places where monks train to harness the light of the flame through deep meditation. They practice martial arts and follow the sacred texts of the Flame. in their own way. The Isles of Skye houses one of the largest and most notable monasteries to the Sacred Flame, and many worshippers travel there to live a life in service to the flame. Regardless of the faith they follow, monks dedicate their lives to honing divine energy into themselves, perfecting their skills, mastering ancient combat techniques, and purifying their body and mind.</p>\n<p>While there are some ancient reports of druidic warriors who could channel the natural elements into their fighting style, most monks are dedicated to the Faith. Monks that meditate on the powers of primal elements, or follow the Old Gods, might very well be the first divine warriors of the lands. They share a lot of similarity to barbarians in their ancient traditions and paths, but with a dedication to control and calm, over brute strength and rage.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table041\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I only speak when it is absolutely necessary that I do so.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>I always have an anecdote to explain any situation.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p>I enjoy the beauty of this world and take every opportunity to embrace it.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Ideals</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table042\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Open.</strong> I have much to learn from others, and I embrace every opportunity to do so.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Cunning.</strong> I know I am capable, and many who doubt me have learned quickly not to do so.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Suspicious.</strong> Question everything: nothing in this world is as it seems, people especially.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Bonds</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table043\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>The order of my faith or tradition has sent me and I must do right by them.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>I am fascinated by new places, and this is my first time leaving my home.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p>I was exiled, and cannot return until I prove myself worthy.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Flaws</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table044\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I am so devoted to my faith or tradition that it blinds me from seeing other points of view.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>Sometimes I am so lost in meditation that I forget there are others around me.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p>I think less of the unconscious people who have not found the light within them.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Personal Quest</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table045\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I have traveled far in hopes of taking the Sacrament of the Falling Fire and joining their divine purpose.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>I have heard a rumor of a temple of monks to the Sacred Flame up in the Pale Teeth Mountains.

During the reign of the sorcerer-kings, Tarna turned away from her wicked ways and found redemption by swearing the first sacred oath before the archangels Michael and Gabriella. She fought righteously against the darkness of her time, and her martyrdom inspired the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Following her example, many have taken up the holy paladin's mantle and dedicated their lives to serve the Sacred Flame as champions of justice and hope.</p>\n<p>Today, most paladins are valiant warriors who take divine oaths and or venture forth on sacred missions, protecting the innocent from the deadly extraplanar forces which threaten the world. They are master combatants, but also devout worshippers who through meditation and practice are able to tap into divine magic. Many join knightly orders, such as the storied Silver Order of Elyria.</p>\n<p>Although the term “paladin” is most closely associated with the Silver Order and the tales of Saint Tarna, the word has been used to describe many outside the faith of the Sacred Flame who follow similar traditions with different gods. The dwarves of Ironhelm Ridge are defended by knightly protectors who swear oaths to Danu and Gaibhne, and among the elven communities of Eladria are paladins devoted to Arwyn, Morrigan, and Phantasia.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table047\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I do not respect those who do not share my faith and views.

Often separated from the heavily armored knights and soldiers, rangers stick to the fringes of society and are often seen as lone travelers who spent time surviving the wilds, or living amongst a druidic circle for a time. Rangers might be guerilla operatives of military organizations, bringing inventive tactics and skills to the battlefield, or protecting innocent people from the beasts and monsters occupying the untamed wilds of the continent.</p>\n<p>On the continent and beyond there are many skilled survivalists who travel to see the great sights, exploring the world to learn or adventure. These outlanders live a life on the road, venturing from location to location and aspiring to remain outside of society as nothing more than a wanderer. Some are simple survivors who lost their home to war or disaster, and are simply trying to reclaim what was lost to them.</p>\n<p>Many elven rangers hail from the Isles of Skye, protecting their sacred lands or traveling to see what the rest of the world has to offer. The Jungles of Terene have a great force of warriors who use the environments of the jungle, and commune with the animals who live there. Sometimes these jungle warriors ride fierce beasts into battle as mounts or fight alongside them.</p>\n<p>In Westemär, the Hooded Lanterns represent the remnants of the guards of Drakkenheim and the military sent to investigate the ruins. These rangers are more attuned to urban survival. They are military strategists, able to navigate ruins and rubble with ease, move swiftly through dangerous monster infested landscapes and get the drop on their enemies.</p>\n<p>Rangers are known to be resourceful and practical, mastering a wide range of martial and wilderness survival skills. Seeking every advantage they can, rangers often dabble in practical spellcasting. However, a ranger's magic comes not from their own power, but through knowledge of how to use material components, herbs, tools, traps, and natural conditions to invoke a bit of spontaneous magic from the environment itself. Occasionally, a ranger might master a true low-level spell taught to them after helping a local druid or witch.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table053\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I am calculating and precise in everything I do.

The Hooded Lanterns, and many military organizations use rogues for covert operations and scouting. Some work as mercenaries for anyone who needs something done quietly.

He winces from the coursing pain as his veins bulge and his eyes illuminate with an eldritch glow. A ripple of eldritch energy blasts towards the sorcerer's would-be attackers, and some are melted into puddles upon the ground, others warped into stone, glass, or wood, while more are just blown away like dust in the wind.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">A sorcerer is a mortal born with the innate ability to tap into otherworldly and extraplanar magic. The mageborn trait is passed on through the generations. Some sorcerers come from long lines of powerful arcanists — some even descended from powerful lines of mages tracing back to the sorcerer-kings of old — while others are wild talents, manifesting the latent potential long dormant in their families. Others gain the trait through magical or mysterious circumstances encountered at birth or a very young age.</p>\n<p>Most sorcerers manifest their powers by puberty. These spells and magical effects are often chaotic and destructive, and most young sorcerers have trouble controlling their powers until they receive proper training. As such, the mages of the Amethyst Academy devote considerable resources to locating those with sorcerous potential. By law, the Academy can take children as young as age six as wards. Those who take well to Academy education learn to refine their natural talents and become wizards. However, others struggle with such methods, or are not found until late puberty by the purple-robed mages. This enables their true sorcerous potential to flourish, and with less restraint and discipline, their magic diverges from the techniques of wizards, though shares the same origin. They choose emotion, drive, and intuition in place of advanced study, relying on their training to hone their skills to a level of control so they are no longer a danger to themselves or others.</p>\n<p>Amongst the Amethyst Academy, most sorcerers become field agents, investigators, and ambassadors rather than researchers and instructors, giving up academics for a purpose to use their skills more readily. Nevertheless, as mageborn, sorcerers are beholden to the terms of the Edicts of Lumen.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table064\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td>1</td>\n              <td>I am endlessly curious, especially when it comes to unique magic and otherworldly oddities.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>2</td>\n              <td>I strive to do good in this world, but constantly feel like my magic is a problem and not a solution.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>3</td>\n              <td>I consider myself clever and cunning.

Long before the rise of the sorcerer-kings, the first people to acquire arcane spellcasting were humans who sought out eldritch pacts with demons, angels, fey, dragons, and entities from distant realms for survival during an age of endless winter millennia ago. From these pacts, their blood was tainted with arcane power and their children were the first mageborn.</p>\n<p>In the modern world, most warlocks emerge due to either necessity, curiosity, or unfortunate accident. Many become warlocks not because they sought out an eldritch patron intentionally, but because these entities approached them in a desperate moment with an offer of power. Others become warlocks because they crave the potential that magic wields. Motivated by jealousy and greed, these warlocks often fall under the influence of fiendish and diabolical patrons seeking mortal pawns to advance their wicked schemes. Other warlocks are children of mageborn parents who hold no capabilities for magic, and forge an eldritch pact to live up to the expectations of their magical family members. On rare occasions, unknowable beings from far realms seek out individuals to use as their chosen ones, and grant them powers in exchange for service.</p>\n<p>Warlocks with malevolent patrons typically avoid the Amethyst Academy. Due to the nature of how warlocks acquire their powers — often as adults — it's extraordinarily rare to find a young warlock among the student body. Furthermore, since a warlock's eldritch patron acts as their mentor and instructor in magic, many warlocks may feel they have little to learn from Academy professors.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Amethyst Academy cautiously welcomes warlocks into their ranks, as often a warlock's unique connection to an extraplanar entity can bring valuable arcane knowledge. Experienced Academy instructors understand how a warlock's relationship with their patrons can be dangerous or problematic, but also that a warlock will always produce mageborn children. In some cases, Academy professors monitor these ties to distant beings amongst their students and faculty, but for the most part, warlocks are treated as equals to the great sorcerers and wizards of the world.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table070\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td>1</td>\n              <td><p>My familiar is an avatar of my patron.

Like sorcerers, the Amethyst Academy seeks out those with magical potential and brings them under their guardianship around the age of six, though their full magical training does not begin until puberty.</p>\n<p>On the continent, a wizard's strictly controlled instruction is carried out exclusively by the Amethyst Academy. It is not enough for a mageborn to learn this craft from a spellbook alone. Wizardly education demands years of apprenticeship under a careful mentor, and includes physical and mental conditioning alongside guided study of complex arcane theories and formulae. As a result, a wizard who was not raised and trained within the Amethyst Academy is almost unheard of. Although very rare, travelers from distant lands outside the reach of the Academy have shown up with advanced knowledge of arcane spellcasting. There are tales of other organizations and rival schools across the ocean who have their own practices and studies to train wizards in arcane magic.</p>\n<p>Once a wizard has completed their apprenticeship, it is up to them to decide whether or not they wish to advance within the ranks of the Amethyst Academy or depart to pursue their own interests. Those who strive to climb the ranks of the Academy can access fantastic resources and vast libraries of magical lore, but are required to work under the strict hierarchy of the bureaucratic organization.</p>\n<p>Other wizards are appointed to noble courts, and spend their days as advisors to the nobility, and some set up their own shops to peddle arcane services. The most adventurous mages travel the world in search for new magics, people, places, and ancient artifacts. Many of the great libraries of the world house Academy-trained wizards who dedicate themselves to the uncovering and protection of lore and history, keeping records and details of world events, and non-magical study, these wizards are responsible for making sure that all magical texts and spell books are sent to academy strongholds for proper safeguarding and study.</p>\n<p>Whether or not they remain within the Academy hierarchy, all mageborn must abide the rules of the Edicts of Lumen. Those who do not are declared malfeasants, and hunted by mages and paladins alike.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table078\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I am always buried in books, and distracted easily by a good library or bookshelf.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p>I use big words and complicated explanations to show my<br />vast intellect.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td>\n                <p>I ignore niceties and polite social queues and just say what<br />I am thinking, or what I think others won't say.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Ideals</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table079\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Inclusion.</strong> I strive to make the world better for mageborn.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Education.</strong> To share knowledge and wisdom is the greatest good one can do.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Secrecy.</strong> There are things about this world that should be kept from ordinary people for their own safety.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Bonds</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table080\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>My mentor taught me all I know.

    "original": "<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">People of the Continent</h1>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">This section includes a brief history and explanation of the place each race plays in the world. It describes their possible origin in the world, and what the world is like for them currently. Use this section to broaden your backstory, or inspire backgrounds and Personal Quests as you create your character.</p>\n<p>Otherworldly and extraplanar beings refer to the humanoid people of the world as “mortals” and refer to the material plane as the “mortal world.” Sages and scholars studying these topics occasionally adopt these same monikers, leading to a common naming convention in academic society.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Humans</h1>\n<p>Humans are the most common and plentiful inhabitants on the continent, making up almost ninety-five percent of the total population. In the present age, humans have built great nations, realms, and empires stretching across the continent. The most well-known monarchs, religious figureheads, archmages, military commanders, and villains throughout history have all been humans. With a small number of exceptions across the entire continent, human citizenry makes up the majority of every major city, village, and town.</p>\n<p>The full breadth and diversity of human body types, features, eye, hair and skin colors, and genders are found mixed throughout each nation in the continent. People have many religious customs with ancient roots, but the majority today keep faith in the Sacred Flame. Beyond this shared religion, humans take up a wide variety of fashions, traditions, and social norms which vary mostly based on geographic location, and tend to regard wherever they were born as home. As a result, many humans treasure their personal origins, and those living in the nations of Elyria, Caspia, Westemär, and beyond possess a strong sense for their national identities. The people of these nations communicate, travel, and trade readily between their borders, though just as frequently develop rivalries, feuds, and full-blown conflicts with their neighbors over disputed land claims and political disagreements, or all too often for much more trivial reasons.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Origins of Humanity</h2>\n<p>The early history of humanity is the subject of myth and legend; there are no agreed historical facts concerning human origins. The Faith of the Sacred Flame teaches that humans are incomplete beings of light and shadow, who must become whole by living a righteous life. However, its religious texts say little about how life itself came to be. On the other hand, the varied tales of the Old Gods speak of humans emerging from sea-foam at the behest of Nodens the Tempest, or sprouting from seeds sown by Danu the Mother and cultivated by Lugh the Sun. Others speak of how Gaibhne the Smith shaped their bodies from clay, dust, and rock, or that humans lived as beasts in thrall to Kromac the Ravager until Arwyn the Moon Hunter tamed and taught them.</p>\n<p>Just as mysterious and unknown is how magic first came to early humans — humans could cast spells long before they wrote history. One legend tells of a time when a great winter that lasted centuries fell upon the entire world. Desperate to survive, humans cried out to the cosmos for help, offering anything for the magic they needed to live through the endless sleet and snow. Humanity got their wish, but accounts differ on whether it came as a curse laid by Morrigan the Witch, a gift from Ogham the Sage, or a jest by Shegorach the Trickster. Far more say it was not the Old Gods, but something far darker and more terrible that answered humanity's call. Whoever or whatever it was that sealed this pact with ancient humans, the power of magic has flowed in their blood ever since. Exactly what they gave up in exchange for this power differs, but all the stories have one detail in common: humanity's debt was never paid in full.</p>\n<p>Yet centuries later, humans continued bargaining with eldritch beings to grow their control over magic. They mingled their bloodlines with many otherworldly and supernatural creatures, and from these unions came dragonborn, tieflings, and other half-human lineages. For the most part, these people are seen for their shared human ancestries, and regarded as part of the diverse makeup of humanity as a whole.</p>\n<p>Humanity's greatest empire was also its greatest folly; the sorcerer-kings of the old Arcane Empire ruled the continent as tyrants for a thousand years. Yet from these dark times came humanity's redemption, when Saint Tarna brought the light of the Sacred Flame to the people of the continent. In the world today, humans remain at the center of all great conflicts and upheavals. Indeed, the world of Drakkenheim is a very human place, one where all humanity's faults and facets are writ large.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Creating Human Characters</h2>\n<p>Humans occupy every corner of the continent and populate every nation. Your human character can come from anywhere you wish.</p>\n<p>Prominent human adventurers might hail from the lands of Caspia, where strong knights or sly bards journey far to test their might and earn renown for their houses back home. Elyrian humans are often devout worshippers of the Faith of the Sacred Flame, and clerics and paladins of the religion often embark on quests to bring light and righteousness throughout the world. Perhaps instead your character is among the rugged rangers, rogues, and other war-torn survivors hailing from the broken kingdoms of Westemär, hoping to rebuild their home, or gain power amongst the constant dispute between noble houses.</p>\n<p>Your character may be a sorcerer or wizard taken in at a young age by the Amethyst Academy, and thus not know exactly where you were born, instead being raised within one of their fantastical magical schools. From the primal druids in the deep of Terene to the barbarian warriors of Netherwind, a human character can be just about any type of adventurer, support any faction or nation, and come from anywhere.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/049-pg119-trio-in-liberio-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">\n  Dragonborn and Tieflings:<br />\n  Arcane Ancestries\n</h1>\n<p>Dragonborn and tieflings make up the next largest demographic throughout the continent. They are directly descended from humans who made pacts and covenants with magical creatures, and are accepted and welcomed as part of the wide family of humanity. Dragonborn in particular may have much more human features, with only scales, small horns, tails, or even wings marking their draconic heritage, though others have the starkly draconic features.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">History</h2>\n<p>During the height of the Arcane Empire, the sorcerer-kings and their loyal vassals sought every means to increase their inborn magical might. Eschewing study and hard-earned knowledge, the arcane tyrants instead merged their bloodlines with creatures of magical origin. Foremost among these were the ancient dragons and malevolent fiends, but some even captured angels and genies for their profane experiments. From this the first tieflings, dragonborn, and many other such human-bred races emerged.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Creating Characters of Arcane Ancestry</h2>\n<p>As part of the wide range of human kin, adventurers with arcane ancestries are just as diverse and varied as any human. It is extraordinarily common for these folk to be mageborn or carry some element of arcane power in their blood — a tiefling without some form of latent magical powers is seen as an oddity. People with these arcane ancestries often become bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards, and it's more common to see them walking the city streets wearing purple robes than anything else. Others turn away from their arcane heritage in place of religious beliefs as clerics or paladins.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">\n  Elves and Half-Elves:<br />\n  Otherworldly Origins\n</h1>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/132-pg120-elven-jewelry-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/132-pg120-elven-jewelry-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Elves are extraordinarily rare, and only a few thousand of them remain in the world of Drakkenheim. The elven people have largely lived as nomadic refugees upon the world of Drakkenheim itself — legend claims the elves come from another world entirely. Their mostly-forgotten history is ancient, and their ancestors left behind mysterious ruins in well-hidden places throughout the world. Every elf is mageborn, though not every elf develops their inborn magical abilities.</p>\n<p>However, in the modern era their numbers are thinning. Most elves today dwell alone as hermits or in small groups on the fringes of civilization. The only known elven community is secluded deep within the Isles of Skye, where the borders between the mortal realm and the Otherworlds of faeries and dreams are thin.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Elven Descendants</h2>\n<p>Half-elves are now much more common than their full-blooded cousins, as the traces of elven ancestry hold strong through human lineages. During the millennia of dwelling alongside humanity, many elves formed families with humans. Their descendants bear a distinctive elven heritage, though few have a recent elven ancestor. Most instead are later-generation descendants of elves. As a result, humans with elven ancestry can be found anywhere and everywhere throughout the continent.</p>\n<p>Not all are terribly concerned about their elven heritage, however. Many view it more as a curious quirk of their family tree and think of themselves as part of humankind, and in turn, most humans regard half-elves in the same manner.</p>\n<p>As elves are always mageborn, it is exceptionally common for their descendants to inherit the trait as well. However, they are not universally mageborn like their elven ancestors.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">History</h2>\n<p>It is a little-known fact that elves did not originally exist in the world of Drakkenheim, and the exact origins of the elven people are shrouded in mystery. Even the most ancient elves explain how their own grandparents had little more than vague recollections of elven history.</p>\n<p>The most common story claims that elves arrived on this world by traveling through shadow realms and faerie gates from a distant and unknown land. Why the elves left, none can say. A few scholars suggest the elves today are but the surviving remnants of a greater civilization which met some sort of disastrous end. They further theorize that crumbling elven ruins sequestered in remote places are all that is left of the powerful magical portals the ancient elves constructed to make their journey here. Indeed, explorers report finding bizarre arcane technology and advanced magic within the alien towers and glistening monolithic structures built by the elder elves.</p>\n<p>Although the elves seemingly arrived in this world with no recollection for their origins, they did bring with them powerful magical knowledge which they shared carefully with their new human neighbors. Unfortunately, the elves were hunted by the sorcerer-kings of the Arcane Empire who were jealous of their innate magical talents, but centuries later elven archmages were instrumental in founding the Amethyst Academy as a refuge for persecuted mageborn.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Creating Elven Characters</h2>\n<p>An elven character is always mageborn; many embrace their magical talents by becoming a sorcerer or wizard. Elves are counted amongst the most skilled mages of the Amethyst Academy. However, other elves choose to take on more martial paths and only dabble in magic; many elves become rangers. Other elves are deeply spiritual, and seek to find any semblance of the ancestral memories of their people through faith in the Old Gods as clerics and druids. An elven worshiper of the Faith of the Sacred Flame would be a true oddity, however.</p>\n<p>In contrast, half-elves take after their human cousins. Characters of any class, vocation, and calling can be found among them, especially those more integrated into the nations and cultures of the continent.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Dwarves: Shaped by Stone</h1>\n<p>The dwarven people claim they were the first to inhabit the world. Dwarven legends tell that Gaibhne the Smith forged them by hand to help the god lay the foundations of the earth, and that to this day, every dwarf is designed in the mind of the Great Smith. The weight of stone itself supports such tales, for traces of dwarven architecture can be found in the deepest bowels of the earth, all the way to the highest mountain spires.</p>\n<p>Today, dwarves are quite rare. Most have amalgamated into human societies and live openly amongst them, dedicating their lives to skilled trades, masonry, and mining. Notably, there are a few dwarven clans who still hold on to their ancient ancestral roots and occupy mountain strongholds and deep mines found in the Glimmer Mountains and Ironhelm Ridge. Dwarves are the only non-human people who hold large city-states of their own, though they do not rule any nation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">History</h2>\n<p>Remnants of dwarven masonry lay at the base of many cities, and many sewers and aqueducts are built from ancient dwarven tunnels and canals whose original purpose is lost to history.</p>\n<p>Indeed, dwarves say these ruins come from a time when they built vast cities that spanned the world until a great age of winter sent them all deep underground into the heart of the planet to survive. During their legendary journey through the Deep Dark, they constructed a nearly endless span of tunnels, halls, and artificial caverns searching for the core of the earth, where they could survive beside the molten heart of Danu, a place called “Vol Danun” in Dwarven. The myth claims the dwarven people built a sprawling metropolis there, where they lived for thousands of years. Of course, there are no records remaining that indicate where the city might be found or how to get there. While only a handful of dwarves truly believe this story, once in a while an intrepid youth or elder will pack their bags and venture into the deeps in search of Vol Danun.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Creating Dwarven Characters</h2>\n<p>Many dwarves keep personal interpretations of the Old Faiths; some dwarves are apt at harnessing primal and divine magic as druids and clerics. The dwarves have a strong martial tradition, and dwarven paladins devoted to Danu, Gaibhne, and Nuada are amongst the few known paladins outside the Faith of the Sacred Flame — a religion that most dwarves regard as hogwash. The few dwarves who do take up the human faith are regarded as mad by their kinsfolk.</p>\n<p>Dwarves are seldom mageborn, and so are extremely unlikely to be found amongst the Amethyst Academy. However, a rare few do acquire arcane powers. Dwarves have long held traditions for crafting magical items, and many dwarves resent the Amethyst Academy's exclusive right to manage the sale and manufacture of magical items.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“Dwarves have used ingenuity and quality craftsmanship to produce cannons and weapons of incredible power. When I get angry I blow up buildings by snapping my fingers. I win.”</blockquote>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">\n  Halflings, Gnomes, and<br />\n  Goblins: Small Places\n</h1>\n<p>Halflings can be found inhabiting all the towns and cities of the continent. However, they just as often form their own communities in small towns and farmland where they can raise families away from the bustle of large cities and the large people who live in such places. Today, rural halfling communities lie at the heart of important breadbasket regions in both Elyria and Westemär. Halflings dwelling in cities often run prominent businesses based on the bounty of their fields in the countryside: such as bakeries, breweries, tailors, and taverns. Kinland Hills, a notable village in the Eastern Vales, is made up almost entirely of halflings. It is a town of rolling golden hills, fertile farmland, and quint farmer's markets. Kinland Hills stands as a testament to the quaint and peaceful lifestyle that halflings often enjoy.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the fey-touched gnomes and goblins tend to be far more reclusive. They often dwell in remote natural places, making their homes under the roots of great trees, mushroom-filled caverns, behind secluded waterfalls, and other places which evoke the spirit of their faerie origins. Many are fascinated with magic, technology, and the comforts of urban life; and gnome and goblin communities are frequently wondrous fusions of nature and steam-powered machinery. Despite these similarities, the contemporary culture of gnome and goblin has fostered fierce rivalries and occasionally outright animosity between their people, though a few outspoken and adventurous individuals hope to mend these relations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">History</h2>\n<p>Halflings have dwelt in their hills and valleys long before any written history, and amongst their people few care about recording or recounting their origins. There are scant legends of halflings being created by the Old God Shegorach to entertain him, or as the youngest children of Danu and Lugh.</p>\n<p>The gnomes and goblins living on the continent today are descendants from those who crossed into this realm from the faerie Otherworlds many eons ago, mostly by accident or curiosity — the largest populations of these people still inhabit the faerie realm. Some sages speculate that gnomes and goblins are related, and two sides of the same coin. However, a gnome and a goblin will argue endlessly that they have no relations, and are completely different from one another. Regardless, both have a great tendency for magic and invention, and when the two passions meet there are often explosive results.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Creating Halfling, Gnome,<br />and Goblin Characters</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/133-pg121-goblin-doll-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/133-pg121-goblin-doll-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Halflings, gnomes, and goblins often live their whole lives never leaving the comforts of their home and community. However, a few halflings every generation are stricken with a wanderlust that drives them to great ambitions. Mageborn halflings become bards more often than any other people, but there are a handful of notable halfling wizards and sorcerers amongst the Amethyst Academy. There are even notable halfling champions who have fought alongside the Hooded Lanterns and the Knights of the Silver Order. Although short</p>\n<p>of stature, no one doubts the bravery and tenacity of these folk, nor the greatness they can achieve.</p>\n<p>Like the elves, both gnomes and goblins are almost always mageborn, but are more likely to hide their abilities. Only a rare few become members of the Amethyst Academy, and those who do often excel.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Uncommon Ancestries</h1>\n<p>Many distinct character ancestries are described in other Fifth Edition publications, far more than we can discuss in this book or find a place for in the world of Drakkenheim. Nevertheless, if you'd like to play a more fantastical or anthropomorphic character in Drakkenheim, we encourage you to do so.</p>\n<p>Although far less common than humans, there are many other peoples who populate the continent. Sometimes their origins are wholly unknown, but in other cases, they have been part of the world longer than anyone can remember. Regardless of their appearance, origins, or customs, they are treated with the same respect as all the other people, and each can find a place amongst the nations, societies, religions, and organizations of the world.</p>\n<p>For example, turtlefolk and birdfolk can be found in the lands of Terene, and many believe they are the original inhabitants of those regions given the blessings of the Old Gods. Orleone has a prominent number of catfolk and lionfolk, while Netherwind is home to half-giants, and who can say what aquatic folk might secretly dwell around the many islands surrounding the continent?</p>\n<p>If you have something more unusual in mind, we suggest framing these characters as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A traveler from a distant and unknown continent or another world</li>\n  <li>The result of a magical experiment</li>\n  <li>The last one of their kind</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want to capture the low-fantasy feeling of the world of Drakkenheim, consider requiring at least half the party create human characters (or ones with a human lineage, such as half-elves and tieflings) and/ or permitting no more than one player to choose one of the anthropomorphic character options found in other Fifth Edition sources. The strange encounters in Drakkenheim are made more special and alien by contrast, and so this may heighten the themes of cosmic horror and otherworldliness.</p>\n<p>However, this is merely a flavorful suggestion and by no means a requirement. Genre is important, but there is no reason why you can't experiment and make the world of Drakkenheim your own. Ultimately, it's far more important for players to be able to create characters which interest and excite them than to preserve the “sanctity” of the setting. After all, as the protagonists of the story, player characters are naturally oddballs and exceptions.</p>",

They wield their knowledge to both heal and harm, augmenting their conventional skills with alchemy and occult magic. Some apothecaries might first attempt treatment with traditional means like medicinal herbs and surgical techniques. When these mundane methods are not enough, they use arcane magic and eldritch forces to restore their patients. An apothecary's unique skills prove useful whether their patients suffer from natural or supernatural ailments, but apothecaries possess knowledge of the body which can be used for more than just healing. Their arcane methods can strengthen, transform, or protect their allies, and some apothecaries know deadly techniques which can harm and kill their enemies. An apothecary understands how the difference between a poison and a cure lies often only in the dose.</p>\n<p>Their careful study of life and death gives an apothecary the tools to both help allies survive horrible ailments, injuries, and pluck them from the clutches of death, or use their enemies as test subjects for their dangerous compounds, terrible diseases and poisonous magic.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Knowledge Seekers</h2>\n<p>Most apothecaries set out with the goal of furthering their studies and expanding their magical horizons, uncovering new ways to wield magic for dangerous or life-saving effects, and learning forbidden knowledge kept from the rest of the world. They believe that knowledge is power, and see themselves as seekers of knowledge. Some kinder apothecaries see their duty as protectors of the innocent, dedicating their lives to helping sick and injured people. Others see every opportunity to exploit the weak and push their search for true power forward. Many fall somewhere in between, riding the lines of mad scientist and renowned doctor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Occult Practitioners</h2>\n<p>Apothecaries seek out occult lore and use it to study and practice scientific theories. Many of their magical incantations, whether it be for the purposes of saving lives, or ending them, are deemed experimental. Many apothecaries keep a notebook close at hand and write down esoteric theories based on their findings and field work.</p>\n<p>Apothecaries are gaining renown within some remote communities on the continent as doctors and healers to whom one can turn to instead of religious figures. However, they are more often viewed as dangerous scientists and mysterious witches who use magic to create toxins and poisons that could eradicate entire armies.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Creating an Apothecary</h1>\n<p>When you set out to create an apothecary, the most important question is to decide your path of study. What is it that drives you to seek knowledge? Are you working in the service of good? Is your life dedicated to helping those in need? By studying poisons, diseases, occult lore, and forbidden knowledge, do you hope to help the sick and wounded? Perhaps you aim to save someone you care about, or protect your kingdom or homeland from the evils of this world. Or maybe your studies are more dangerous in nature. Do you set out on adventure to test your dangerous chemical formulae? Do you see each monster or enemy as a test subject for your concoctions and spells?</p>\n<p>All apothecaries share a search for knowledge, and dabble in forbidden lore and occult practices. Although many in their practice are happy to sell their services or potions in cities or to well-paying nobles and kings, some are called to adventure, setting out on the endless hunt for knowledge. Others work as investigators and researchers. Many apothecaries see adventure as a means to perform direct field research, perfect their skills, and test the true potential of their theories.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Quick Build</h2>\n<p>You can make an apothecary quickly by following these suggestions.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.</li>\n  <li>Second, choose your character ancestry and background.</li>\n  <li>Third, choose the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.dtoYtccI3x7J3KVy] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8zT7njvqbpXs4Cel] cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.x9rCqOtPhpL6F68C] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1].</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Apothecaries in Drakkenheim</h1>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Apothecaries can be found throughout the continent in many forms. The term is broadly used to describe many magic-adjacent professions found on the continent and the vast array of possible fields of study is ever expanding.</p>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy has departments of apothecaries managing their labs and research centers. Within their many schools and strongholds, they teach advanced sciences and using magic to better understand the body and mind, and the various modern medical practices that can be combined with magic to save lives — or end them.</p>\n<p>Not all apothecaries are mageborn. The broad term has been used to describe several practices that combine herbal ingredients, chemicals, and poisons with biological study to induce outcomes similar to the effects of evocation or necromantic magic. Pathogenists working in distant labs perform studies to create new powerful strains of disease and poison. Chemists find ways to surpass the potency of mageborn spellcasting with the right dose of chemicals for their explosive and destructive results. Other Mutagenists working with the mutating effects of delerium seek to control and isolate the elements of mutation and apply them in a more controlled manner. There are even reports of apothecaries who are studying techniques to unlock the potential of the mind. These Alienists have caused a stir amongst nobles, mages, and clergy for their ability to tap into mental capabilities that mirror magic, without requiring a mageborn's lineage.</p>\n<p>Secretive reanimators pursue grisly studies into the realms of death and undeath, mimicking necromantic magic using little more than new science and invention. There are apothecaries working under the Sacred Flame as exorcists, channeling their occult knowledge and research into helping rid holy sites of undead, dispatch unwanted spirits, and remove terrible curses.</p>\n<p>Apothecaries are found on every continent; whether mageborn or not, many are skilled academics who have a keen mind for pushing the boundaries of science. These researchers have found themselves on the path of the apothecary, lending their aid to cities and towns throughout the continent, and occasionally bringing unique chemical warfare to the battlefield of great wars.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table001\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I often use big scientific words; I just can't help but to embellish my superior intellect.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I have a dark sense of humor.

Refer to the Core Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing in this book for the apothecary spell list.</p>\n  <h3>Formula Book</h3>\n  <p>You have a book or collection of notes that you study to prepare your apothecary spells, develop your @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.9ygVgpyoY5TC6QhV], and record your occult practices. You may use your formula book as an arcane focus for your apothecary spells. You may describe this book any way you like. Some examples of your book's appearance include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A large leatherbound tome with yellowing pages bound shut with an iron lock</li>\n    <li>A scattered assortment of scribbled notes loosely held together by rope</li>\n    <li>A pristine journal with perfect edges and beautiful penmanship</li>\n    <li>A leather briefcase with two small golden locks</li>\n    <li>A medical bag with surgical symbols on the sides</li>\n    <li>A beat-up satchel slung over one shoulder with vials and bottles poking out of every pocket</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>If the book is destroyed or lost, you can recreate it using inks and paper during a long rest.</p>\n  <h3>Cantrips</h3>\n  <p>You know three cantrips of your choice from the apothecary spell list. You learn additional apothecary cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Apothecary table.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Elementary Reformulation.</em></strong><em></em> Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one apothecary cantrip you know with another cantrip from the apothecary spell list.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n  <p>The Apothecary table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your apothecary spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your apothecary spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n  <p>You prepare the list of apothecary spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the apothecary spell list. When you do so, choose a number of apothecary spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your apothecary level (minimum of one spell). A spell you prepare must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Apothecary table's Slot Level column for your level.</p>\n  <p>For example, if you are a 5th-level apothecary, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, in any combination. To cast the 1st-level spell<em> cure wounds</em>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n  <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of apothecary spells requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n  <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n  <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your apothecary spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and occult knowledge. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an apothecary spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n  <p class=\"save-dc\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n  <p class=\"save-dc\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n  <h3>Ritual Casting</h3>\n  <p>You can cast an apothecary spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n  <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>\n  <p>You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section of the Core Rules) as a spellcasting focus for your apothecary spells.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"class-feature\">\n  <h2 class=\"name\">Occult Practices</h2>\n  <p>At 1st level, you take up one of the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.3wvDHPWvb3yfZH7b], a chosen discipline which defines your ongoing research of the body and spirit: the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.LJn6blcn7U3WZM0f], the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.066tdj7Ot5Sf9Xj2], the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.JGquN35T5lVUy5EH], the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.f9mSl94Qzz5xjeGF], the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.iBeOFPdnKuZESA43], or the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.eUqv8wW7ar9CuQXh].</p>\n  <p>Your choice grants you additional proficiencies and an expanded spell list at 1st level, and additional class features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"class-feature\">\n  <h2 class=\"name\">Esoteric Theories</h2>\n  <p>You have discovered esoteric theories, scraps of forbidden lore that you can use to augment your magical abilities.</p>\n  <p>At 2nd level, you gain two esoteric theories of your choice. Your theory options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain apothecary levels, you gain additional theories of your choice, as shown in the Theories Known column of the Apothecary table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the theories you know and replace it with another theory that you could learn at that level.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"class-feature\">\n  <h2 class=\"name\">Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n  <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n  <p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"class-feature\">\n  <h2 class=\"name\">Greater Formula</h2>\n  <p>At 11th level, you discover a magical secret called a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.07E4LBlJB9LBxzzP]. Choose one 6th-level spell from the apothecary spell list as this formula.</p>\n  <p>You can cast your Greater Formula once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n  <p>At higher levels, you gain more apothecary spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You learn an additional 6th level spell at 19th level, and an additional 7th level spell at 20th level.</p>\n  <p>You regain all uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:0\"><strong><em>Master Reformulation.</em></strong> Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level from the Apothecary spell list.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"class-feature\">\n  <h2 class=\"name\">Miraculous Recovery</h2>\n  <p>At 20th level, you can spend 5 minutes channeling power into a number of creatures (which can include yourself) equal to your Intelligence modifier to facilitate an abnormally fast recovery. You must tend to the creatures during this period, using a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.6rocoBx5jdzG1QQH] with at least one use remaining. The targets regain hit points, spell slots, hit dice, and other abilities as if they completed a long rest. A creature can only benefit from one @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.oYiopBcTylWw2iMj] in a 24-hour period.

The description of each esoteric theory details the benefits you gain from selecting that theory.</p>\n<p>Some esoteric theories specify a minimum apothecary level. You can't learn such an esoteric theory until you are at least that level. Unless an esoteric theory's description says otherwise, you can't learn an esoteric theory more than once.</p>\n\n<section class=\"feature-choices-list\">\n<h3>Acquired Tolerance</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you gain resistance to poison damage.

You decide what the creature looks like, including facial features, the sound of its voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, but none of its game statistics change. You can't alter the size of a creature, and its basic shape stays the same. The resulting transformation is non-magical, however, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk] spell or similar magic cast upon the creature can restore it to its original appearance.</p>\n<h3>Critical Condition</h3>\n<p class=\"meta\">Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary</p>\n<p>When a creature rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw made against one of your apothecary spells that deals damage, roll all of the spell's damage dice twice and add them together.

The Game Master reveals to you two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Any one ability score</li>\n  <li>Armor Class</li>\n  <li>Current hit points</li>\n  <li>Resistances (if any)</li>\n  <li>Immunities (if any)</li>\n  <li>Vulnerabilities (if any)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively, you can spend 1 minute observing a corpse.

You must use the new result, even if the new roll is a 1.</p>\n<h3>Vital Signs</h3>\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw or death saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the creature's roll, potentially turning a failure into a success. You must finish a short rest before you can use this theory on the same creature again.</p>\n<h3>Vivisection</h3>\n<p class=\"meta\">Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary</p>\n<p>Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a 19 or 20.</p>\n</section>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light spell-list\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Apothecary Spell List</h1>\n      <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/068-pg129-vial-final-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/068-pg129-vial-final-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n      <p class=\"dropcap\">Below is the list of spells you consult when you learn an apothecary spell.

The cry is that of the battle-worn worshippers of Kromac warriors of the Old Gods. A sudden stillness strikes the skirmish as the combatants look toward the source of the echoing wail. There stands a woman clad in thick animal furs, her face smeared in the blood of her enemies. She belows “Kromac hungers!” as she grabs her nearest foe by the throat with her bare hands, lifting them off the ground effortlessly before tearing into their flesh.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p class=\"dropcap\"><img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/059-pg139-war-horn-cmyk.webp\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/059-pg139-war-horn-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" /> The so-called great nations of the continent claim every scrap of land as theirs. Yet, many places in the world remain wild and untamed, and the people who live there refuse to relinquish their freedom to any lord, nation, or creed. They must fight to protect their way of life from the political strife that plagues the nations. In places such as the cold northern tundra of Netherwind, or the mystical Isles of Skye, as far south as the Jungles of Terene, and to the fiery peaks of the Drakeclaw Mountains dwell fierce warriors who rise up time and time again to fend off the intrusion of civilization.</p>\n<p>These barbarians are bold and courageous warriors. They tend to lean towards more traditional combat tactics and rely on strength and cunning over plate mail and tactics. Many notable warlords have been referred to as barbarians, some famous and courageous, others infamous and terrible. Kristoff Karn, the invader of the Eastern Vales, carved a bloody path through the free lands of the east in the name of conquest. The Ironhelm Dwarves foster traditions of berserker warriors. The Northfolk of Skye and the Netherwind Reavers are all notable barbarian groups.</p>\n<p>Some barbarians hold deep faith and reverence for the ancient Old Gods, and view themselves as defenders of their sacred places. Keeping close ties to druids, they see themselves as warriors of the natural order, attuning to nature, animals, and the wilds. Others only loosely hold these ancient traditions.</p>\n<p>Some barbarians care little for the ways of the Old Gods, however, and simply live for battle and adventure. Many fought as mercenaries during the Westemär Civil War or as seafaring pirates of the Middle Sea, or even a handful of bold Caspian warriors who stood to prove their might for their home.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table014\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I know all the old stories of ancient gods, monsters, and heroes.

Once, many a passersby would drop copper pieces in his hat, eager to hear his stories and songs for the magical insights they tell. Now a sallow expression hangs over the bard, and his lyrics sing of a terrible doom coming from the stars beyond. Few heed these haunting words, unaware of the dangerous truths hidden within the puzzling verses.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Bards fine tune their magic through music, poetry, dance, and artwork. Weaving magic comes to bards like pulling the strings of a lute comes to a musician or brushstrokes to a painter, but to produce great magic requires talent honed by years of practice. While art and music have always been part of continental society, true bards are a rare breed, and only very recently has bardic magic been recognized as a distinct magical practice.</p>\n<p>The most famous bards hail from Caspia. The six Great Houses each have countless musicians, artists, and authors who accompany their scions, composing songs, poems, and creating other works of art to bolster their house's renown. Every Caspian noble leaves home with a trusty herald by their side to sing their praises and announce them, but having a magical bard amongst your entourage is a mark of true prestige well sought after by Caspian nobility. Oftentimes a particularly skilled bard will seek out a career in a Caspian noble house to leave their mark on the world. Yet for every famous Caspian bard, there are many more who seek their own adventures using their skills to help others or make their own fame and fortune.</p>\n<p>Most bards are thought to be mageborn who manifest their powers as teenagers or young adults, their powers latent until suddenly unlocked in a flash of creative inspiration. Creatively gifted mageborn who otherwise struggle to harness their magical abilities have found that performance, poetry, and song helps them cast certain spells in a more nuanced and controlled manner. However, a person with the right knack can master a cantrip or low-level spell without necessarily needing to be mageborn, and the power of art and music presents a pathway to much more powerful magic. Through mastery in their craft, bards can tap into the extraplanar forces to cast powerful spells, even though they lack the mageborn gene.</p>\n<p>As a result, there is still much dispute over whether bardic magic is a unique manifestation of mageborn magic, or whether it may be performed solely through the use of art and music. Bardic magic was not well known when the Edicts of Lumen were written. Many amongst the nobility and clergy believe bards should be held to the same restrictions and laws as mageborn, and disinherited from any noble claims. As such, bards often join the Amethyst Academy in hopes of refining and understanding their craft. Only recently has the school delved into art and music studies as a means of analyzing the unique nature of bardic magic.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table019\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p class=\"chart\">I take every opportunity to sing the praises of those I care<br />most about.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I enjoy the simple things in life; I find beauty in peace and quiet.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I love to hear gossip and stories, and then retell them with much more flair.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Ideals</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table020\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p class=\"chart\"><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Beauty.</strong> I want to leave my mark on this world and make it a more beautiful place for everyone.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p class=\"chart\"><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Love.</strong> I do what I do for love.

The Flamekeeper addresses her assembled congregation as the last sliver of suns sets under the horizon. “Before one can understand the true potential of the light, one must also understand what lurks in the shadows.” As night falls and the stars appear one by one above, the priest continues her sermon: “Never forget that Tarna herself wore that cloak of blood and shadow ere she stood before the angels. Do not fear the darkness; it is nothing more than what lies in the hearts and souls of every mortal. Even when light and hope are but a glimmer, the smallest flame is bright enough to carry you through the deepest night.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Faith has a power all its own, and mortals have long sought the wisdom of the distant gods and divine forces they believe shaped the cosmos. Hoping to understand the true nature and purpose of the universe through deep meditation and spiritual discipline, priests, mystics, oracles, and prophets have found the means to tap into the spark of divine magic that thrums like a heartbeat connecting all things.</p>\n<p>However, the largely silent gods have posed many long-standing mysteries about the nature of the heavens and divinity, and mortals long struggled to fully harness divine magic. While arcane magic spread like a scourge through mortal bloodlines and druids channeled the elements, only a few clerics would emerge every generation. Nevertheless, these individuals brought wisdom and enlightenment to others, and through their words, mortals came to understand the will of the Old Gods.</p>\n<p>That changed, however, when the legendary Saint Tarna found the Sacred Flame. During her trials and tribulations, Tarna learned many divine truths from angelic beings, and lit the fires of a new faith. She revealed how those who demonstrate unwavering faith and devotion can form a powerful connection with the Sacred Fire and harness divine magic for righteous purposes. While the study, discipline, and intense meditation required to wield heavenly power makes it a difficult path that few can achieve, Tarna illuminated a pathway others could follow. Nevertheless, the true nature of divine magic remains dimly understood, and many clerics spend their twilight years contemplating these heavenly mysteries hoping the Sacred Flame will shed light on new truths.</p>\n<p>There are still clerics who uphold the tenets of faith to the Old Gods, and even clerics of shadow cults. The dwarves have clerics who worship ancient stones and blazing forges, while the elves have clerics more tied to nature, resembling druids to many outsiders. Gnomes and goblins keep faith in their own fey gods as well. Amongst all people there are those devoted to the holy path who have been able to harness divine magic, but none as prominently or numerous as those dedicated to the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<p>Today, clerics are often the heads of their congregations in many places of worship, though not every priest and acolyte is a divine spellcaster. Other clerics go on adventures serving the cause of their respective faith. Some seek to bring justice and faith back to the world; some go on holy quests to investigate world events and see if they find divine purpose there.

While there is little recorded history concerning the first druids, it is believed they learned their ways through the whispers of the Old Gods, the secrets of elusive fey, and a strong connection to primal creatures and elements. Today, many druids shepherd the traditions of these faiths. Ancient shrines, standing stones, and circles of worship can be found throughout the wildlands, tundras, high mountains, and sprawling deserts of the world, still inhabited by ancient druidic circles. The jungles of Terene are particularly well known for great druidic temples dating back thousands of years.</p>\n<p>Druids often stand at odds to the rise of civilization and the politics of the continent. More and more, the nations of the world encroach upon natural lands, felling the great forests to fuel their industries, ripping stones from the earth to forge weapons and fortresses, and polluting the waterways with the filth of their cities. The dominant Faith of the Sacred Flame cares more for heavens and salvation of the soul than it does for the preservation and protection of the earth itself. Druids may even view arcane magic as a conduit for chaotic and otherworldly powers which subverts elemental energies and corrupts primal forces. Druids are often driven to adventure when they witness the impact of these imbalances, and desperately seek the means to restore the fragile equilibrium which sustains life on the planet.</p>\n<p>Druids do not have to be mageborn to acquire their powers. Instead, their deep connection to nature, the elements, and living creatures help guide them in intense practice to acquire their mastery over the primal forces of the world.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table030\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I see signs in the flowers and trees; everything in nature speaks to me in small ways.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>I hate cities and populated places, preferring the quiet of nature to people.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p>I speak to the Old Gods.

Bands of mercenaries and the remnants of defeated armies from the continent's many wars often feel the need to take up arms once again, either for their own survival or in service to some greater power.</p>\n<p>A fighter can come from just about anywhere and be part of any faction. Not all are noble with great causes. Some very skilled fighters have made entire careers of being hired blades. Rumors are that an entire group of fighters make their money as hirelings for the Amethyst Academy, and are paid well to do their dirty work.

The verbal, somatic, and material components of spells are vital: a spell fails if the pitch, resonance, and volume of the verbal components are out of tune, or if gestures are not performed in an exacting and precise manner. While casting a spell, mages eyes burn with octarine or radiant light, magical energies swirl about them, and their voices take on an otherworldly resonance. The act of casting a spell is obvious and unmistakable in the world of Drakkenheim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Secret Spells</h2>\n<p>In the world of Drakkenheim, several powerful spells found in the Core Rules are significantly rarer than normal:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]. While the knowledge of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz] spell is more widespread than the other secret spells, the planar tuning forks used by the<em> plane shift</em> spell are the stuff of legends; see the World of Drakkenheim section for details.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jccbeBIfLrqEZnDP]. This spell was only recently invented by the members of the Academy Directorate. While those within the Amethyst Academy are aware of the spell, the Academy Directors have not shared the means to cast this spell except with a few Grandmaster Wizards.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY] The only living nonplayer characters capable of casting these spells are Lucretia Mathias and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5] of the Sacred Flame.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]. For centuries, the mighty sorcerer-kings zealously guarded the knowledge of this mightiest of all spells. Today, while members of the Academy Directorate have knowledge of the spell, all have expended their ability to cast it on prior wishes made centuries ago. This is a fact that they do not disclose — not even to each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the Game Master's option, player characters must obtain knowledge of these spells as described in the “Learning new spells” section below, and cannot be selected as normal when characters gain a level.</p>\n<p>Non-player characters do not have access to these spells unless specifically indicated in their description or game statistics. Furthermore, the material components for these spells are exceptionally scarce and should be treated as consumable magic items of Very Rare (for 7th- and 8th-level spells) or Legendary rarity (for 9th-level spells).</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Contaminated Spells</h2>\n<p>The Contaminated Spells section contains new spells with the “contaminated” descriptor beside their school of magic. Such spells always require delerium as a material component, and cause the caster to gain Contamination Levels when cast.</p>\n<p>A contaminated spell simply fails if the spellcaster prevents gaining Contamination Levels from its casting. The only exception to this rule is if the spellcaster has a class feature or magic item such as the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.wp6siMcKHUXZbxgg] Druid's Purify Spell feature (described in Chapter 3) which specifically allows them to cast contaminated spells without gaining Contamination Levels.</p>\n<p>A monster with the Fully Contaminated trait can cast contaminated spells with impunity, and does not gain Contamination Levels when they do so.</p>\n<h3>Learning the Spells</h3>\n<p>While many monsters and NPCs know these spells,<strong> contaminated spells are not available to player characters at the outset of the campaign unless explicitly granted by a subclass feature in this book</strong>. Instead, characters must either study the spell from a found spellbook or scroll, locate a mentor to teach them the spell, or research the spells themselves!</p>\n<p>Once they've found a spellbook or teacher, a player character must spend two days of downtime and 100 gp per spell level practicing the spell. Once complete, the character may prepare the spell, add it to their spellbook, or replace a spell they already know with the new spell, as appropriate for the spellcasting features of their class.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Researching New Spells</h3>\n      <p>We've included three spells and two magic items that previously appeared in<em> Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em>. These items provide key tools characters need to deal with contamination in a Drakkenheim campaign.</p>\n      <p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.vs23ts2HfajIOxlI] and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.XVfNWNJ36bDL758U] are totally undiscovered at the outset of a Drakkenheim campaign, and instead, these spells must be discovered through research. The player characters might undertake this research directly during their downtime. Alternatively, the party may seek out an NPC spellcaster to help develop the spell, such as an Academy mage or @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]. The spell descriptions outline the prerequisites needed to successfully research the spell. Once these requirements are met, a character must spend downtime and gold to complete the research: for each level of the spell, the character must spend 5 days of downtime and 250 gp. Once complete, the character may prepare the spell, add it to their spellbook, or replace a spell they already know with the new spell, as appropriate for the spellcasting features of their class.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“What's the worst that could happen?”</blockquote>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/magic-list-sc.webp\" alt=\"\" />",

Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 necrotic damage. If you direct both hands to attack the same target, they gain advantage on the attack roll.</p>\n  <p><strong>Forceful Throw.</strong> The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. If both hands are used against the same target, you can throw them ten times your spellcasting ability modifier, and gain advantage on the check against a Large or smaller target.</p>\n  <p><strong>Eldritch Grip.</strong> The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it.

If both the hands are used against the same target, they can grapple a creature regardless of its size, and you have advantage on the grapple check against a Large or smaller target.</p>\n  <p><strong>Contaminated Crush.</strong> You can have a hand crush a target it is grappling. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Contamination Level.</p>\n  <p>If both the hands are grappling the same target, you can have them rip the grappled target limb from limb.

Alongside these three crowns, the clerics and mages constructed six other magical items for each nation which the monarchs could bestow to their closest councilors and confidants as badges of office. Made by the finest craftspeople and imbued with both arcane and divine magic, the regalia were intended to give a measure of magic which the nobility could use at their own discretion to serve as an important check against the vast magical powers wielded by both the Faith and the Academy.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Crown Authority.</em></strong> A character can never attune to more than one<em> National Seal</em> or @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.items.Item.hpJ7S9vnS1MQC3zv].\n</p>\n<p>The<em> Seals of Westemär</em> are lost in the ruins of Drakkenheim, and detailed in the adventure<em> Dungeons of Drakkenheim.</em></p>\n<article class=\"magic-item\">\n  <h3 class=\"name\">Continental Crown</h3>\n  <p class=\"type\"><em>Legendary wondrous item (requires attunement)</em></p>\n  <p>A character may only attune to the<em> Continental Crown</em> by performing a special 1-hour ceremony with six other characters who are each attuned to the corresponding Seals of the respective nation.</p>\n  <p>While attuned to the crown and wearing it, you are immune to any effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition.

Albrecht von Drakken used this power to bind three ancient dragons into his service so he could make war on Caspia, while Helena I of House von Kessel made a wish to end a great plague which ravaged her nation at the start of her reign. Elyrian monarchs have used their wishes to strip a favored child of mageborn traits, or aid the construction of great cathedrals to the Sacred Flame. Caspian High Kings have been known to use their wishes to restore the lives of their headstrong offspring killed in rash battles against fearsome monsters. Whether to save their nations from turmoil, or to increase their personal wealth and indulge in their own vices, more than once has a monarch hastily used their wishes, only to be left without it in a time of dire need. At other times they have carefully rationed their wishes, using them only towards the end of their reign.</p>\n        <p>Many believe the monarchs have used their wishes to undo and erase their most terrible mistakes, reversing the course of history itself with unknowable results. However, such wishes seldom end well, as monarchs meddling with time and destiny can rarely predict the consequences of their choices. Today, whenever a new monarch is crowned, the Divine Matriarch and the Academy Directorate secretly meet with the new ruler to caution them against using their wishes in such risky ways, often telling of how High King Oberon Joplin attempted to use a wish to avert the War of the Sword, but the war happened just the same each time.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </aside>\n</article>",

Although they typically interact with mortals in the guise of a human wizard, Amaranthyst is in fact an ancient delerium dragon. Indeed, the dragon's unique complexion of crystalline purple scales and gemstone-like features is the namesake of the Amethyst Academy itself.</p>\n      <p><strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> How do you know if you are the dreamer, or merely the dream? I speak in absurd paradox, asking mortals vexing questions to which they cannot answer within their limited reference frame.</p>\n      <p><strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> A single grain of sand makes no sound upon falling, but a million grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something. That is the nature of magic.</p>\n      <p><em>Bond.</em> Mortals believe they can comprehend the fundamental forces of the universe, but they are gravely mistaken. If I know one thing, it is that even I know nothing.</p>\n      <p><strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I find the fixed nature of the mortal world deeply strange. It is for the best that this world is unraveled by delerium, for chaos will only improve it.</p>\n      <p>Amaranthyst is order out of chaos incarnate. Aeons ago, the dragon entered the mortal plane from the Space Between Worlds, and has aided mortal mages out of curiosity and amusement. They have long sought to understand the unknowable properties of the strange dimension where it sprung into existence, and has spent millennia wandering that unfathomable place. Amaranthyst has long known about the secret properties of delerium, and views the crystals as merely the fundamental building block of reality itself. To them, the crystals are transforming the world into something wondrous, and he does not understand why mortals would fear it.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/010-011-version2-pg214-amaranthyst-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n<article class=\"bestiary\" data-split-here=\"Amaranthyst the Ultraviolet\">\n  <h3 class=\"name no-toc\">Amaranthyst the Ultraviolet</h3>\n  <p class=\"type\"><em>Gargantuan dragon, chaotic neutral</em></p>\n  <ul class=\"stats\">\n    <li><strong>Armor Class</strong> 22 (natural armor)</li>\n    <li><strong>Hit Points</strong> 546 (28d20 + 252)</li>\n    <li><strong>Speed</strong> 40 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul class=\"attributes\">\n    <li><strong>STR</strong> 30 (+10)</li>\n    <li><strong>DEX</strong> 14 (+2)</li>\n    <li><strong>CON</strong> 29 (+9)</li>\n    <li><strong>INT</strong> 18 (+4)</li>\n    <li><strong>WIS</strong> 17 (+3)</li>\n    <li><strong>CHA</strong> 28 (+9)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul class=\"traits\">\n    <li><strong>Saving Throws</strong> Dex +9, Con +16, Wis +10, Cha +16</li>\n    <li><strong>Skills</strong> Arcana +11, Insight +10, Perception +17, Persuasion +16, Stealth +9</li>\n    <li><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> psychic, force</li>\n    <li><strong>Senses</strong> Blindsight 60 ft., Darkvision 120 ft., Passive Perception 27</li>\n    <li><strong>Languages</strong> all, telepathy 1 mile</li>\n    <li><strong>Challenge</strong> 24 (62,000 XP)</li>\n    <li class=\"pb\"><strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong> +7</li>\n  </ul>\n  <div class=\"features\">\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The dragon can breathe air and water.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong><em>Delerium Healing.</em></strong> As an action, Amaranthyst can touch a delerium shard to regain 10 (3d6) hit points.

If the result is equal to or less than the character's current Contamination Level, the creature gains a mutation. The Game Master may choose the mutation, or determine it randomly by rolling 1d20 on the Mutations Table below. Unless otherwise specified, a creature can't gain the same mutation more than once. If a duplicate result is rolled, the Game Master chooses a different one or rolls again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Removing Contamination</h2>\n<p>Only magic can remove Contamination Levels. Creatures do not recover from contamination naturally. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.RCZRkk5mU0PoswsG] spell (see the Magic of Drakkenheim chapter) can remove contamination, but it leaves affected characters exhausted. A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1] spell removes all Contamination Levels and mutations from a contaminated character. An effect that removes a Contamination Level also removes one randomly determined mutation. All contamination symptoms end and all mutations are removed if a creature's Contamination Level is reduced below 1. Skin, hair, fingernails, and toenails lost to mutations regrow normally once contamination is removed. However, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.9kGrFXnLiRg3Xnbo] spell or similar magic is needed to restore any other body parts (such as teeth, limbs, or eyes).</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Death and Dying While Contaminated</h2>\n<p>When a humanoid creature with any Contamination Levels dies, it animates as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW] 24 hours later. A creature with six or more hit dice rises as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rbyp54px2D0ql4QK] instead.</p>\n<p>A creature restored to life with @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6] or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz] spell reduces a creature's contamination level by one, and all contamination level are removed from a creature restored to life by @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO] or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY]. Note however that a fully contaminated creature who was transformed into a monster is not restored to its original form if it is raised or resurrected.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Monstrous Transformation!</h2>\n<p>A creature who reaches Contamination Level 6 or higher undergoes a Monstrous Transformation into a horrific monster controlled by the Game Master. Once triggered, the transformation finishes in 1 round. It is thereafter permanent. Game Masters are encouraged to narrate a suitably gory description of the transformation.</p>\n<p>The Game Master chooses the creature's new form, which is most often an aberration or monstrosity of some kind such as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8pX2JhWUpTNNRBVx]. The new form usually has a Challenge Rating similar to that of the original creature — in the case of a player character, their level determines the transformation's Challenge Rating. Under appropriate circumstances, such as very sudden onset of contamination or the presence of arcane anomalies, you can choose one that is much higher or much lower.</p>\n<p>The creature's game statistics are entirely replaced by those of the chosen monster. The creature assumes the new form's hit points and Hit Dice. All Contamination Levels are removed, though the Game Master may grant additional traits to the new form similar to any beneficial mutations gained from Contamination Levels.</p>\n<p>The Game Master determines what remains of the original creature's personality and memories, if anything. Regardless, the creature is invariably driven mad by the transformation and falls under the Game Master's control.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Reversing the Transformation</h2>\n<p>The means of reversing a Monstrous Transformation are completely unknown at the outset of the campaign. A transformation is widely regarded as permanent.</p>\n<p>A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz] spell or similar magic can restore a single transformed creature to its previous form, removing all madness and contamination in the process. This is considered a stressful use of the<em> wish</em> spell, and thus there is a 33 percent chance that the caster will be unable to cast<em> wish</em> ever again if they use the spell in this manner.</p>\n<p>The transformation is otherwise irreversible by any means short of divine intervention. Nevertheless, at the Game Master's discretion, it may be possible to temporarily alleviate a transformed creature's innate madness. However, an intelligent monster who receives long-term treatment of any sort may eventually conspire to contaminate or subtly corrupt its caretakers.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <section class=\"table3-wrapper\">\n        @Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.tables.RollTable.MAPdTcv6s2out8Pr caption=false]\n        \n      </section>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>",

Consult the table to determine how long it takes characters to harvest delerium deposits of various sizes. Lacking proper equipment, extraction takes ten times as long. Massive clusters are impossible to extract without heavy equipment or powerful magic.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Uses for Delerium</h2>\n<p>Delerium has vast arcane potential. Beyond trade, delerium crystals are used for several purposes:</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Spell Component.</strong></em> Delerium may be used as an arcane focus or material component for any spell on the apothecary, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent value to the required cost.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Magic Items.</strong></em> Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Any magic item described in the Core Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM's discretion, characters who can cast 5th-level spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Stable Delerium.</strong></em> The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk contamination when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Delerium Dust.</strong></em> Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ]. Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks for<em> spell scrolls</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Improvised Weapons and Ammunition.</strong></em> Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a sling or fashioned into a makeshift club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, and humanoid creatures struck must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one Contamination Level. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed.\n</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <section class=\"table3-wrapper\">\n        @Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.tables.RollTable.qjt8fb06VRfDcems]\n        \n      </section>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>",

Humanoid creatures who remain in the Haze beyond 24 hours before recuperating risk contamination. For each additional hour spent within the Haze beyond 24 hours, a humanoid creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one Contamination Level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Environmental Effects</h2>\n<p>The Haze magically manifests mist throughout the area. Characters can see normally through the mist up to 150 feet. Vision beyond is lightly obscured, but vision past 300 feet is totally obscured. Any mists dispersed during the day re-form 10 minutes later.</p>\n<p>The mists dampen sunlight.

Telepathic communications or effects such as the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD] spell transmitted from outside the Haze fail to contact a character within it, and vice-versa. Finally, other divination spells fail to reveal useful information about delerium, the Haze, the origins of the meteor, or any events which occurred within the Haze.</p>\n<p>When a character attempts any of the above using a spell or other effect, they must make a [[/save int 15]] saving throw. On a failure, they take [[/damage 6d6 psychic]] damage and become incapacitated with madness until they finish a long rest. During this time, they speak only in gibberish.

Known as the Deep Haze, these areas have the following additional traits:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Deep Haze is instantly recognized by a thick prismatic fog. Characters can see normally through this fog up to 60 feet. Vision beyond is lightly obscured, but vision past 120 feet is totally obscured. If dispersed during the day, the fog reforms 1 minute later.</li>\n  <li>Characters entering the Deep Haze must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, and again for each full hour spent within. On a failed saving throw, they suffer 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and gain one Contamination Level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Delerium Sludge</h2>\n<p>Gargantuan delerium geodes perspire an opalescent sludge. Characters submerged in delerium sludge must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn. They take 42 (12d6) necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, and half as much on a successful one. In addition, characters who fail the saving throw gain one Contamination Level.</p>",

We want to thank everyone who tried out the Apothecary and our new game materials during the playtest, and took the time to send their thoughtful and honest comments. We also want to thank the close friends who played along with us personally to develop and showcase our new player options both behind the scenes and on live streams: Dael Kingsmill, Ginny Di, Ben Byrne, and our Discord moderation team.</p>\n      <p>And finally, to our loving partners - Kierston Drier and Shay Bytheway, your endless love and support during the many nights of writing and working to get this project finished do not go unnoticed, and we are so thankful to have your encouragement and patience.</p>\n      <p><strong>Kelly McLaughlin and Monty Martin, The Dungeon Dudes</strong></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:end;position:relative;margin-bottom:50px\">\n  <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/01-dd-scgd-world-map-cmyk.webp\" style=\"min-width:550px\" />\n  <h1 class=\"chapter longer no-toc\"><span class=\"chapter\" style=\"font-size:1.2em;line-height:0.8em;position:relative;top:-5px\">The World Of Drakkenheim</span></h1>\n</div>",
