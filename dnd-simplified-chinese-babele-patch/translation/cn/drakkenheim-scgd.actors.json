The spell simply takes effect.</p>\n        <p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following Effects of your choice:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n        <li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all Effects on them described in the Greater Restoration spell.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li>\n        <li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n        <p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend Resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

She is responsible for many of the diplomatic arrangements, political discussions, and negotiations with other cities and rulers. Verona von Baden is often dressed in a white button up with a brown leather vest, dark trousers, and swash- buckling boots. She carries a shimmering rapier with an ornate golden hilt with an engraving of her family crest upon it. Like her father, she is an avid sailor and ship captain. Her own caravel is known as the Rose of Thorns, a ship built from rosewood with an ornate carved bouquet as its figurehead, white sails, and armed with canons. She has been at the helm of many sea battles, and her swift ship is known and feared by many.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I am a careful listener and observer, knowing what to say to make people around me feel at ease, and get what I need out of them.

She hopes to not only claim the duchy of Drannsmund after her father steps down, but prove to the people of the city her value as their leader. In doing so, she believes that if no successor is found to rule Westemär, her connections and alliances will ensure she will be the most obvious choice.</p>",

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

The <span class=\"s1\"><strong>Academy Director Lich</strong></span> has held his position since the Amethyst</p><p class=\"p2\">Academy was founded, and was among the principal architects of the Edicts of Lumen. Indeed, since the time the Edicts were being drafted, the Divine Matriarchs have known about his undead nature, though they must tolerate this uncomfortable truth under the terms of the agreement.</p><p class=\"p2\">Even still, Xel'vocha's undead nature is not immediately apparent; aside from the High Paladin and the Divine Matriarch, the other members of the Elyrian Cabinet are not aware Xel'vohca is a lich. Upon first meeting he appears as an old man in an ornate wheelchair of strange metal, attended by his personal <span class=\"s1\">shield guardian</span>. He has drooping jowls, sallow skin, sunken octarine eyes, wispy white hair, and an expression of deep sadness upon his face. He wears a simple purple robe and carries a glass-encased delerium orb. Except to incant his magic, Xel'vohca no longer speaks and relies on telepathy to communicate.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> </span>I communicate telepathically in strained and long-winded streams of consciousness, my mind constantly burdened with centuries of thoughts.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> Magic can do great things. Terrible things, but great things indeed. We must wield it with responsibility, but wield it we must.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong> </span>I was there when the first warlocks made their ancient pacts. The burden of the original sin of magic rests upon me, and I will steward the inheritors of the arcane until the last sun goes out at the end of eternity. I think of all mages as my children, and the sorcerer-kings were my wayward sons and daughters. I cannot repeat those mistakes.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> Though my undead heart no longer beats, it pains me to feed my phylactery and sustain myself. The memories of these stolen souls haunts me, so I only do so rarely. As a result, my body has greatly atrophied, and now I fear my mind is slipping into madness as well.</p><p class=\"p2\">Xel'vohca was both the first warlock and the first lich. Far from an evil creature, Xel'vohca has spent thousands of years facing the consequences of the choices he made in life. He is older than recorded history, and was vizier to many of the sorcerer-kings, though he was unable to stop their tyranny.</p><p class=\"p2\">His existence has often been spent trying to make amends for the failures of his past, but this task grows ever harder as new conflicts arise. The destruction of Drakkenheim and the spread of delerium have posed a major challenge to Xel'vohca.</p><p class=\"p1\">Amongst the Directorate, Xel'vohca alone harbors grave doubts about whether using delerium is a good idea, but is the first to admit that he himself is deeply tempted by its power.</p><p class=\"p1\">Today, Xel'vohca keeps his tomb deep within a section of the Dungeons of Nox. This personal mausoleum has been his lair for thousands of years, and he is loath to give up the comforts of his long-established home. Many of the traps and monsters roaming the dungeons are Xel'vocha's designs to keep intrepid heroes out of his business — and far away from the more dangerous artifacts and creations of the sorcerer-kings, which Xel'vohca safeguards from the world.</p>",

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.

Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>.

She has dark brown hair done up in a bun at the back of her head. Her face is sharp and angular with a thin nose, pointed chin, pursed lips and narrow eyes. She often wears a long gray skirt, a white blouse, and a black overcoat. She is a stern negotiator and exceptionally clever. She often dresses for her role as grand Ambassador, opting for neutral tones and smart fashion rather than anything overbearing or ostentatious.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I am a forceful conversationalist and hardline negotiator. In an argument, I never let others get a word in edgewise. Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> Elyria is the greatest nation in the world. Our foes are envious of our mighty nation, and often hypocrites who seek one-sided concessions from us at every turn.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong> </span>I have two young children. Recently, I have noticed strange occurrences and happenings around my estates, and I'm greatly concerned they might be mageborn.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> The other people of the world should think and act more like Elyrians, and we have little to learn from their faithless ways.</p><p class=\"p3\">Beatrice has ruled Michael's Gate for the past six years. Previously she was in training to become a Silver Order paladin, and showed potential as both a cunning warrior, and clever diplomat.</p><p class=\"p3\">Now, with two young children to take care of, and the responsibility of ruling Michael's Gate, she has set aside her warrior days. Her new life of politics and leadership are no less fraught with conflict, however.</p><p class=\"p3\">Recently her two children have begun to cause strange sights and sounds around her home with no reasonable explanation. Beatrice is concerned they may be developing mageborn qualities. Terrified of facing this possibility, she has greatly ignored the signs and kept her concerns a secret. Unbeknownst to Duchess Atwood, the mages of the Amethyst Academy have already determined her toddlers are mageborn. Once they reach the age of six, the purple-robed mages will come to take them off to Paradox Castle.</p>",

She has large, spiraling gray horns emerging from her forehead, and keeps her blue green hair in buns along the sides of her head. The archmage has deep, dark eyes, and sharp pointed teeth.</p><p class=\"p3\">Amongst the few who have met her in person, Penumbra is known as being both incredibly charming and extremely disarming. Those who speak with her are caught completely off guard by her outward kindness, and find themselves talking endlessly to her. Only after Penumbra leaves do they realize she never said anything about herself, and simply listened to them talk.</p><p class=\"p3\">Penumbra enjoys the trappings of everyday life, and is fascinated by the people in it. She enjoys spending time amongst the locals and admiring the sandy beaches and warm weather in Terene, though her powerful enchantments cause those who meet her to forget she was ever there. Penumbra's tendency to mingle with common folk has been a concern of the other Directors for some time. They know she travels to cities all over the continent, and often appears in taverns and pubs to hear tales of local problems, or sometimes sends hapless adventurers on dangerous quests to unknown ends.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Traits.</strong></span> I aim to be friendly and humble to the people around me. I am often delighted by mundane non-magical life.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> The more we can learn about the people of this world, the more we can use our magic to change it.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> Alabaster has been with me through thick and thin for years and I admire his dedication and passion.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I often upset my peers with my carefree attitude and nonchalant use of magic.</p><p class=\"p3\">The archmage works from a secret academy stronghold, where she had studied the effects of delerium contamination on the mind to understand the madness it causes. She has been using fish, rats, and birds as test subjects, attempting to imbue them with intelligence enough to manifest psionic abilities. If successful, she hopes to begin testing her method with human volunteers soon, potentially using delerium to imbue non-mageborn with magical powers. Penumbra has an on-again, off-again relationship with Archmage Alabaster of Liberio. The two have several magically gifted children.</p>",

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

She vanishes every night when her duties are done, and even goes weeks or months without communicating with the other Academy Directors. She has spoken briefly of her walking castle, but no one is sure what she refers to, and assume it is another jest. Marigold has been working in secret to study how delerium affects illusion magic. She hopes to create a means of making illusion spells function like summoning spells — conjuring up an illusion and infusing it with delerium to give it form and make it real. If she can master this new advancement, she will be able to create any object, reshape landscapes, manifest riches and items, and reshape reality in ways hitherto unheard of.</p>",

She is secretly a <span class=\"s1\">vampire</span>.</p><p class=\"p2\">Constance Kleinkessel is a voluptuous woman who appears in her late forties. She has gleaming emerald eyes, crimson red lips, a flushed round face, and a small pointed nose. Her jet-black hair is tied up into braids and woven into an intricate headpiece set with pearls. She wears a scarlet gown and is dripping with jewelry. Her painted fingernails are sharpened into points. She often meets guests for dinner, where she licks her lips and runs her fingers on the edge of a cup of red wine.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I could eat you up. I fill my speech with macabre innuendo which mix dining, physical intimacy, and slaughter.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> The living must be made to serve the dead. When my plans come to fruition, mortals will be divided into cattle and corpses.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong> </span>I am bound by bonds of blood to serve dark masters and vampiric overlords, but one day I will take it all for myself.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I can't ever resist a good meal… would you like to stay for dinner?</p><p class=\"p2\">Constance Kleinkessel herself is in fact the sister of Helena I. Originally known as Camilla von Kessel, she has passed through a series of identities to hide her vampiric nature. Every few decades, she marries a hapless nobleman, slowly draining his life force so that he appears to expire from old age. Shortly thereafter, her so-called daughter inherits the estate and the cycle continues.</p><p class=\"p2\">During the Civil War, Constance Kleinkessel used her vampiric abilities to manipulate and scheme alongside Cecilia von Kessel and Lord Commander Elias Drexel to plot the murder of Mannfred von Kessel. She had planned to follow through and murder her co-conspirators, but the subsequent death of Cecilia von Kessel was an unexpected development: she had been planning to target Cecelia's future children with her replacement scheme to seize the throne of Westemär. Since undead creatures are not immune to the effects of delerium contamination, Constance Kleinkessel has also worked closely with her doctor, the malfeasant wizard Deidrick Mors, to experiment with new ways delerium can create augmented vampires.</p>",

He has a bushy brown beard, and a thick curled mustache that spans the entire length of his face. He has large circular glasses that cause his eyes to look much larger than they should. He is a hefty man who wears elegant purple robes and a pointed purple hat. He is always smiling and his bellowing laugh echoes through the chambers of his school. He adores the Academy Stronghold and loves meeting and pranking the students. Headmaster Greywell has a tendency to speak in riddles, and half-true jovial warnings. Many a new student is often put off at first when Rupert chuckles “Stay clear of the necromancy section in the library at night, unless you don't mind being possessed!”</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I love riddles, trivia, and curiosities. I adore the look of wonder on a student's face when they are unprepared for the magical madness that is my castle. Always play with their minds!</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> Being a wizard takes years of hard work and dedication, but what's the point of all that work if you can't have a bit of fun with it!</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> My students and faculty are my family. I would protect them with my life, every single one of them. If you are here at my castle, you are the most important person in the world to me.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I don't take anything as seriously as I should, and often overlook obvious problems and danger.</p><p class=\"p3\">Rupert loves his job, and is admired by the students and faculty of Paradox Castle. However, the Directorate does not love his quirky and rambunctious attitude, and have been waiting for him to slip up for years so they can replace the headmaster.</p><p class=\"p3\">Rupert however, is not a dullard, and knows well the opinion his higher ups have of him. He has a cunning intellect and mind for politics that many do not expect, and carefully treads the line of being regarded by his staff and students as carefree, fun-loving, and a joy to work with, while also making sure he stays well within the guidelines, rules, and structure laid out by the Academy. Whenever he is asked to answer to the Directorate, Rupert comes prepared with ironclad documents and signed papers to prove all his claims, ensuring the Directorate cannot find a sliver of a reason to justifiably remove him.</p>",

When Headmaster Rupert Greywell of Paradox Castle once confronted her on the topic in front of several observing students, Lasaia trapped him within a forcecage and classes were canceled. It is well-known that Lasaia has been trying to replace Rupert Greywell for some time and is seeking a good excuse to demote the care-free oaf. In the twisting unrealities of Paradox Castle, there sometimes appears a blue door with a gemstone knob in various locations throughout the school. The door leads to Lasaia's offices and lab, but students who have opened the door have found nothing but an eternal black void stretching out forever. Deep within this secret laboratory, Lasaia Nightbreeze has been working to unlock the full destructive power of delerium. She has assembled a sequestered team of brilliant evokers all sworn to absolute secrecy — the archmage has inscribed an explosive rune on the forehead of each wizard, which will slay them if they utter a single word of their great project outside her lab. Together, they have created the disjunction bomb, a horrifically devastating delerium-based weapon of mass destruction with the power to annihilate an entire city district. Now, they are working on even more powerful variants. One of the compelling outcomes of this research has been the potential for delerium to be used simply as a conventional power source which could unlock wondrous improvements into the lives of common folk, though such quotidian applications bore the archmage. She is convinced delerium is the next evolution of magic, not a frivolous tool.</p>",

You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become Blinded for 1 minute.</p><p>The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.</p><p>The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the Duration of the spell. An Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic works only against the violet layer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Red</strong>.

The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</li>\n<li><strong>Yellow</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Green</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.</li>\n<li><strong>Blue</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Indigo</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\n<ul>\n<li>While this layer is in place, Spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a Daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Violet</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
