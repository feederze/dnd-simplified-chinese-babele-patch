He himself is noted for having slain the children of Amarodial “Bitterheart” the Black Dragon of the Eastern Vales when they ventured over the mountains into Caspian territory. That was some time ago, and now, over the age of seventy, Commander Callisto has retired from the battlefield and helps train new recruits. He is a strict commander who expects the best from his knights, and constantly reminds them that if they think he is too harsh, they will be sorely disappointed with how a dragon treats them. Callisto has short gray hair and keeps a gray stubble beard. He has an eyepatch over his left eye and three scars across his face — a memento from one of his earliest battles. Commander Callisto wears the same armor into battle each and every time, complete with its many burn marks, dents, and holes from draconic teeth and claws. He is missing his left arm after having lost it to a red dragon on the Drakeclaw Mountains years ago. Despite his injury he returned with the head of the dragon in tow. Anyone who has made a comment about his missing arm is thrown into the training pit with the commander, who challenges them to beat him in a duel. The Scalebreaker Commander remains undefeated.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I am a stern man with a lot of wisdom from experience. I speak harshly and honestly. In battle there is no place for niceties.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> I train the best, because anything less won't survive long enough to learn better.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> The Scalebreakers are one of the most important forces in all of Caspia, we may not be nobles or High Kings, but you can bet on your life that they know they need us when the monsters of this world come crawling out of their holes.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I am incapable of relaxing. I have been on my guard my whole life and constantly in battles. I don't know if I am capable of settling down.</p><p class=\"p2\">Callisto has a long-standing rivalry with the black dragon Amarodial, who dwells in the Eastern Vales. He has faced the dragon several times and the two are well aware of one another. Since they are separated by the Rust Edge Mountains, their battles have subsided for many years. Still, Commander Callisto dreams of facing the dragon once more. If he is to die, he would rather it be in the jaws of that treacherous beast than lying in a bed.</p>",

He is often encountered simply wearing goggles and a stained leather smith's apron over a purple tunic, setting aside his Academy robes for attire more appropriate for his work.</p><p>Alabaster is a peerless master of alchemy and transmutation magic. His experimentations and research involve using delerium to alter the material properties of other matter. Alabaster is well known to have created the formula for aqua delerium. He has already successfully developed a process to use delerium to transform lead into gold, but is now much more interested in using the stones to create some form of life. However, Alabaster is keenly aware of the erratic and chaotic effects of the crystals on flesh, which tend to produce insane, contaminated monsters. Instead, deep within the depths of the Enigma Ziggurat, he has fashioned several prototype human-sized golems with delerium crystal hearts. His unique method has produced magically animated constructs imbued with sentience and personality. Each is a unique and immaculately crafted being with intricate facial features, often decorated with porcelain, glass, and silver. The archmage quietly released a handful of his creations into the world to see what adventures they will find.</p><p><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I seek to finish any conversation as quickly as possible so I can go back to my experiments.</p><p><strong>Ideal.</strong> If it is true that celestial beings created life and the universe, I am merely striving to emulate the example of my ancestors. The world is but a grand experiment, now long forgotten by those who set it in motion.</p><p><strong>Bond.</strong> Delerium is the true philosopher's stone: its transformative properties are supreme. Using its magic, we can transform anything — perhaps even life itself.</p><p><strong>Flaw.</strong> I have created many things in my life. However, I quickly move on to the next project and care little for my past experiments.</p><p>Alabaster is a close confidant, partner, and sometimes lover to Penumbra, the Archmage of Terene. Together, the two are parents to several up-and-coming Academy students.</p>",

When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.</p><p>The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the Duration of the spell. An Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic works only against the violet layer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Red</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Orange</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.</li>\n<li><strong>Yellow</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Green</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.</li>\n<li><strong>Blue</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Indigo</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\n<ul>\n<li>While this layer is in place, Spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a Daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Violet</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a Dispel Magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end Spells and magical Effects.</li>\n</ol>"

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p>\n        <p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly Components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>\n        <p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following Effects of your choice:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n        <li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all Effects on them described in the Greater Restoration spell.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li>\n        <li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n        <p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend Resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

Their waking always follows great eruptions from the Dragon's Maw, and many towns and villages are destroyed.</p><p class=\"p2\">Thus, the locals living south of the Drakeclaws grow up with well-made plans for their evacuation and escape should the dragon return.

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

The burden of the original sin of magic rests upon me, and I will steward the inheritors of the arcane until the last sun goes out at the end of eternity. I think of all mages as my children, and the sorcerer-kings were my wayward sons and daughters. I cannot repeat those mistakes.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> Though my undead heart no longer beats, it pains me to feed my phylactery and sustain myself. The memories of these stolen souls haunts me, so I only do so rarely. As a result, my body has greatly atrophied, and now I fear my mind is slipping into madness as well.</p><p class=\"p2\">Xel'vohca was both the first warlock and the first lich. Far from an evil creature, Xel'vohca has spent thousands of years facing the consequences of the choices he made in life. He is older than recorded history, and was vizier to many of the sorcerer-kings, though he was unable to stop their tyranny.</p><p class=\"p2\">His existence has often been spent trying to make amends for the failures of his past, but this task grows ever harder as new conflicts arise. The destruction of Drakkenheim and the spread of delerium have posed a major challenge to Xel'vohca.</p><p class=\"p1\">Amongst the Directorate, Xel'vohca alone harbors grave doubts about whether using delerium is a good idea, but is the first to admit that he himself is deeply tempted by its power.</p><p class=\"p1\">Today, Xel'vohca keeps his tomb deep within a section of the Dungeons of Nox. This personal mausoleum has been his lair for thousands of years, and he is loath to give up the comforts of his long-established home. Many of the traps and monsters roaming the dungeons are Xel'vocha's designs to keep intrepid heroes out of his business — and far away from the more dangerous artifacts and creations of the sorcerer-kings, which Xel'vohca safeguards from the world.</p>",

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p><p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it.

However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its <strong>Retributive Strike</strong> (see below).</p><p><strong>Spells</strong>. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.1LkZvINag7KqBmDR]{Conjure Elemental} (7 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} (3 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{Fireball} (7th-level version, 7 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.FjYE214HTERCRZNm]{Flaming Sphere} (2 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WN2LWEljYU6QqnRH]{Ice Storm} (4 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]{Invisibility} (2 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.1nhIxh0DsJsntCfj]{Knock} (2 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.IyikgTEOTv701jgQ]{Lightning Bolt} (7th-level version, 7 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{Passwall} (5 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]{Plane Shift} (7 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.HQfd7jJyULIoGxrZ]{Telekinesis} (5 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.X3DrXgxjwI2dvkD6]{Wall of Fire} (4 charges), or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.UJJu9c2UvCzVljiP]{Web} (2 charges).</p><p>You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{Arcane Lock}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{Detect Magic}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WahI41a3goVUg0x1]{Enlarge/Reduce}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Bnn9Nzajixvow9xi]{Light}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{Mage Hand}, or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}.</p><p><strong>Retributive Strike</strong>.

Some people have called me jumpy, or overly aggressive.</p><p class=\"p2\">Lava is still relatively new to her position and has a lot she feels she needs to prove. Although most of the Lion Guard looks up to her, there are a few older warriors who do not like taking orders from someone much younger than them. Lava takes the whispers about her and occasional comments of her age and position to heart, and is very eager to prove herself.</p>",

She is secretly a <span class=\"s1\">vampire</span>.</p><p class=\"p2\">Constance Kleinkessel is a voluptuous woman who appears in her late forties. She has gleaming emerald eyes, crimson red lips, a flushed round face, and a small pointed nose. Her jet-black hair is tied up into braids and woven into an intricate headpiece set with pearls. She wears a scarlet gown and is dripping with jewelry. Her painted fingernails are sharpened into points. She often meets guests for dinner, where she licks her lips and runs her fingers on the edge of a cup of red wine.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I could eat you up. I fill my speech with macabre innuendo which mix dining, physical intimacy, and slaughter.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> The living must be made to serve the dead. When my plans come to fruition, mortals will be divided into cattle and corpses.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong> </span>I am bound by bonds of blood to serve dark masters and vampiric overlords, but one day I will take it all for myself.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I can't ever resist a good meal… would you like to stay for dinner?</p><p class=\"p2\">Constance Kleinkessel herself is in fact the sister of Helena I. Originally known as Camilla von Kessel, she has passed through a series of identities to hide her vampiric nature. Every few decades, she marries a hapless nobleman, slowly draining his life force so that he appears to expire from old age. Shortly thereafter, her so-called daughter inherits the estate and the cycle continues.</p><p class=\"p2\">During the Civil War, Constance Kleinkessel used her vampiric abilities to manipulate and scheme alongside Cecilia von Kessel and Lord Commander Elias Drexel to plot the murder of Mannfred von Kessel. She had planned to follow through and murder her co-conspirators, but the subsequent death of Cecilia von Kessel was an unexpected development: she had been planning to target Cecelia's future children with her replacement scheme to seize the throne of Westemär. Since undead creatures are not immune to the effects of delerium contamination, Constance Kleinkessel has also worked closely with her doctor, the malfeasant wizard Deidrick Mors, to experiment with new ways delerium can create augmented vampires.</p>",

He has a bushy brown beard, and a thick curled mustache that spans the entire length of his face. He has large circular glasses that cause his eyes to look much larger than they should. He is a hefty man who wears elegant purple robes and a pointed purple hat. He is always smiling and his bellowing laugh echoes through the chambers of his school. He adores the Academy Stronghold and loves meeting and pranking the students. Headmaster Greywell has a tendency to speak in riddles, and half-true jovial warnings. Many a new student is often put off at first when Rupert chuckles “Stay clear of the necromancy section in the library at night, unless you don't mind being possessed!”</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I love riddles, trivia, and curiosities. I adore the look of wonder on a student's face when they are unprepared for the magical madness that is my castle. Always play with their minds!</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> Being a wizard takes years of hard work and dedication, but what's the point of all that work if you can't have a bit of fun with it!</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> My students and faculty are my family.

However, the Directorate does not love his quirky and rambunctious attitude, and have been waiting for him to slip up for years so they can replace the headmaster.</p><p class=\"p3\">Rupert however, is not a dullard, and knows well the opinion his higher ups have of him. He has a cunning intellect and mind for politics that many do not expect, and carefully treads the line of being regarded by his staff and students as carefree, fun-loving, and a joy to work with, while also making sure he stays well within the guidelines, rules, and structure laid out by the Academy. Whenever he is asked to answer to the Directorate, Rupert comes prepared with ironclad documents and signed papers to prove all his claims, ensuring the Directorate cannot find a sliver of a reason to justifiably remove him.</p>",

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.

Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n        <p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend Resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>"

The <span class=\"s1\">Academy Director</span> always levitates or flies through the air; her long elegant purple robes sweeping across the floors, and her platinum hair is constantly moving as if she were underwater. Writings attributed to Lasaia Nightbreeze have been found in Academy textbooks hundreds of years old, most notably a thousand-year-old tome titled On the Origins of Evocation buried in the great Starspire Observatory. She is sometimes seen drifting through the halls of Paradox Castle like a wayward ghost. She greets students occasionally, but many are uneasy around her and find her blank stares and emotionless expression rather haunting.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></span> I speak in an ethereal voice, and often my words slip into ancient dialects and riddled expressions.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Ideal.</strong></span> I know full well the destructive potential of evocation magic. These world-shattering spells must be kept as safeguarded secrets, to be used only in times of dire need.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Bond.</strong></span> The other Academy Directors cannot match my absolute mastery of war magic. Their magic is but parlor tricks compared to the destructive power I command.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Flaw.</strong></span> I often miss or completely ignore social cues, forgetting that other beings have opinions… or relevant thoughts.</p><p class=\"p3\">There is a rumor amongst many Academy students and even some faculty regarding Lasaia's origins. Students and faculty speculate that she came through the Elfgates when elves first arrived, and unlike the other elves of the world, the archmage knows exactly why and how they came. When Headmaster Rupert Greywell of Paradox Castle once confronted her on the topic in front of several observing students, Lasaia trapped him within a forcecage and classes were canceled. It is well-known that Lasaia has been trying to replace Rupert Greywell for some time and is seeking a good excuse to demote the care-free oaf. In the twisting unrealities of Paradox Castle, there sometimes appears a blue door with a gemstone knob in various locations throughout the school. The door leads to Lasaia's offices and lab, but students who have opened the door have found nothing but an eternal black void stretching out forever. Deep within this secret laboratory, Lasaia Nightbreeze has been working to unlock the full destructive power of delerium. She has assembled a sequestered team of brilliant evokers all sworn to absolute secrecy — the archmage has inscribed an explosive rune on the forehead of each wizard, which will slay them if they utter a single word of their great project outside her lab. Together, they have created the disjunction bomb, a horrifically devastating delerium-based weapon of mass destruction with the power to annihilate an entire city district. Now, they are working on even more powerful variants. One of the compelling outcomes of this research has been the potential for delerium to be used simply as a conventional power source which could unlock wondrous improvements into the lives of common folk, though such quotidian applications bore the archmage. She is convinced delerium is the next evolution of magic, not a frivolous tool.</p>",

Since the Isles of Skye are not a united nation, they were not an official party to the Edicts of Lumen. As a mageborn wizard, Queen Genevieve only holds her title thanks to the remoteness of her domain.
