Heroes seeking to fell one of these ill-tempered creatures are better served wrestling them down and strangling them instead, which has the added benefit of preserving their valuable pelts. Of course, this is much easier said than done...</p><div class=\"lt-paragraph  lt-paragraph--3\"><p>You have a <b>+1 bonus</b> to AC while wearing this armour.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"lt-paragraph  lt-paragraph--3\"><em><strong> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Golden Lining.</span></strong></em> Due to the comfortable fur that lines the inside of this armour, wearing it during a long rest has no detrimental effects. In addition, when you take non- and magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage while wearing the armour, that damage is reduced by [[/r 1d8]]. Once the armour reduces damage in this way, it can't do so again until the start of your next turn.<div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"lt-paragraph  lt-paragraph--3\"><em><strong> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Curse.</span></strong></em> This armour is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you until you're targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.

In addition, your Constitution modifier is considered to be 0 for the purposes of determining how long you can hold your breath or survive while choking."
