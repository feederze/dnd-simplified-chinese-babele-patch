    "original": "<p><em>Wondrous item, (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\n<p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>\n<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\n<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>\n<p>While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4]{Suggestion} on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"random-properties\"><strong>Random Properties</strong>. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties (see DMG pg. 219-21): </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties </li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"spells\"><strong>Spells</strong>. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds} (5th-level version, 3 charges)</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{Daylight} (1 charge)</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{Death Ward} (2 charges)</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{Scrying} (3 charges).</li>\n<li>You can also use an action to cast the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{Detect Magic} spell from the orb without using any charges.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Call Dragons</strong>. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Destroying an Orb</strong>. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.HBHbOGKNVVprSlwn]{Disintegrate} spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.</p>",

You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 1</strong>, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.)

When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrify</strong>. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>",

Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.</p>\n<p><strong>Comet</strong>. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Donjon</strong>. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Euryale</strong>. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of <strong>The Fates</strong> card can end this curse.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fates</strong>. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p>\n<p><strong>Flames</strong>. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>\n<p><strong>Fool</strong>. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p>\n<p><strong>Gem</strong>. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Idiot</strong>. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>\n<p><strong>Jester</strong>. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>\n<p><strong>Key</strong>. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Knight</strong>. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>\n<p><strong>Moon</strong>. You are granted the ability to cast the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell 1d3 times.</p>\n<p><strong>Rogue</strong>. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>\n<p><strong>Ruin</strong>. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>\n<p><strong>Skull</strong>. You summon an avatar of death - a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.</p>\n<p><strong>Throne</strong>. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.</p>\n<p><strong>Vizier</strong>. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.</p>\n<p><strong>The Void</strong>. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.</p>",

It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.</li>\n<li>The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>\n<li>The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30- foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.</p>",
