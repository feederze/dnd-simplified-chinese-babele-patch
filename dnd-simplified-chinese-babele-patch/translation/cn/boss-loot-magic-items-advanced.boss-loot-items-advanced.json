You can address the symbiote as \"Worm\" or \"Wyrm\".</p><p>The Wyrm does not want to leave its host and once you don this armor, you can't doff it unless you make a Charisma check contested by the Wyrm's Wisdom. You need to have a good argument to convince it. You can try this only when you level up your character. If you try to doff it in any other way you die.</p><hr /><p>The symbiote feeds off the host's energy, vitality, and magical power, which in return gives various advantages in battle.</p><p>Each time you use one of the active abilities, you must say the activation word \"Worm\" and the name of the ability. The symbiote will feed on 10% of your current and maximum hit points. Missing maximum hit points are only recovered when the character levels up.

During combat you ignore all buffs but you are immune to all conditions, you cannot cast spells, you have no bonus action, as an attack action you make a single attack with a +5 bonus and the attack always has advantage and critical damage. It requires feeding the symbiote 10% of your current and maximum hit points.

When you take lethal damage in combat, the symbiote can make you invulnerable for 2 turns.
