They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.</p><p><strong>OA: Swirling Dervish.</strong> Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of <strong>20 feet</strong>, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.</p><p>For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp’s extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-3coo2dVrb5JUPKGQ\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>This magical item represents two melee weapons.

As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of <strong>25 feet</strong>, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.</p><p>For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp’s extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).</p><section id=\"secret-rMdTPMvqFf5dU5QT\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>This magical item represents two melee weapons.
