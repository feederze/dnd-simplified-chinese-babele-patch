The moat is considered &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain}, and any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a <strong>[[/save dex 15]]</strong> or fall &amp;Reference[condition=prone].

They believe the movements of celestial bodies can reveal the secrets of fate and allow one to directly intervene in the schemes of destiny.</p><p><i><b>Prosthesis Properties.</b></i> This prosthesis can replace or enhance an arm. It has the Hookshot (30 ft.) property. Instead of firing a hook and rope, this prosthesis fires the hand itself, bound by a gravitational tether that cannot be damaged or destroyed. It otherwise functions in the same way.</p><p><i><b>Gravitational Anchor.</b></i> As an action while your hookshot hand is attached to a target, you can reel yourself in. When you do, you move up to <b>30 feet</b> in a straight line towards the hand. Additionally, while your hookshot hand is attached and you are within 15 feet of it, you have a flying speed of 15 feet.</p><p><i><b>Orbital Binding.</b></i> As an action, you can send a series of expanding rings to bind a creature you can see within <b>60 feet</b> of you.

The number in parentheses is the range of the hookshot. If the prosthesis isn’t being used to hold an item, you can shoot the hook at a fixed surface within range as a bonus action, or as a reaction when falling. The hook then attaches to that surface until you use a bonus action to detach the hook and reel the rope back in, or until the rope is destroyed. The rope is an object with AC 10 and 10 hit points.</p><p>Alternatively, you can fire the hook at another creature at least two sizes larger than you, making an attack roll with the prosthesis. You’re considered proficient with the attack, which uses your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack roll. On a hit, it deals no damage, but the hook attaches to the target. A creature within 5 feet of the hook can use an action to forcefully detach the hook with a successful DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check.</p><p>While the hook is attached, you have advantage on ability checks made to move along the rope, such as to climb a vertical surface, swim against a current, or walk against a strong wind, and you can’t move or be moved more than the hookshot’s range away from the point to which the hook is attached. If you’re falling, you stop falling further than the range at which you shot the hookshot and become suspended from the surface the hook is attached to. In addition, until the hook is reeled back in, the prosthesis can’t hold anything or be used to make attacks, and you can’t use or benefit from objects integrated into the prosthesis (such as attacking with a weapon or benefiting from a shield’s bonus to AC).</p>",

You’re considered proficient with the attack, which uses your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack roll. On a hit, it deals no damage, but the hook attaches to the target. A creature within 5 feet of the hook can use an action to forcefully detach the hook with a successful DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check.</p><p>While the hook is attached, you have advantage on ability checks made to move along the rope, such as to climb a vertical surface, swim against a current, or walk against a strong wind, and you can’t move or be moved more than the hookshot’s range away from the point to which the hook is attached. If you’re falling, you stop falling further than the range at which you shot the hookshot and become suspended from the surface the hook is attached to. In addition, until the hook is reeled back in, the prosthesis can’t hold anything or be used to make attacks, and you can’t use or benefit from objects integrated into the prosthesis (such as attacking with a weapon or benefiting from a shield’s bonus to AC).</p>",

      "description": "<div><p>Ring, very rare (requires attunement)</p></div><hr /><p>Designed by the master strategists of the Last Legion, these rings have been used to control and conquer countless conflicts. Commanders have been seen lifting grand defences from the earth in battle. They've also been seen massaging their fingers. The rings are really heavy.</p><p><em><strong>Tactician's Tailored Barriers.</strong></em> While wearing this ring, you can use an action to cast the <span id=\"was-tagged\">wall of stone</span> spell (<strong>save DC 16</strong>). When you cast the spell in this way, you can sacrifice a number of the panels it produces in order to augment the wall with one of the following additional defences:</p><ul><li><p><span><strong>Archer (2 panels):</strong></span> The wall is lined with arrow slits, crenellations, walkways, and staircases on one side (your choice). Creatures using the arrow slits have three-quarters cover from effects on the other side, and creatures on top of the wall have half cover against effects from below.</p></li><li><p><span><strong>Moat (3 panels):</strong></span> You create a moat of mud or shallow water that extends <strong>10 feet</strong> out from one side of the wall (your choice). The moat is considered &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain}, and any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a <strong>[[/save dex 16]]</strong> or fall &amp;Reference[condition=prone]. As part of this defence, you can add a drawbridge that spans the length of the moat. The drawbridge is 5 feet wide, has an <strong>AC</strong> of <strong>15</strong>, and <strong>60</strong> hit points. It can be raised or lowered as an action by a creature on the side of the wall without the moat.</p></li><li><p><span><strong>Oil (4 panels):</strong></span> Each creature within 10 feet of one side of the wall (your choice) when it's created must make a <strong>[[/save dex 16]]</strong>, taking <strong>[[/damage 3d6]]</strong> fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Abatis (5 panels):</strong></em> You create a line of spikes that extends <strong>5 feet</strong> out from one side of the wall (your choice). Each creature that is in this area when you create the wall must make a <strong>[[/save dex 16]]</strong>, taking <strong>[[/damage 2d6]]</strong> piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed back 5 feet, out of the spikes' area. A creature that enters the spikes for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the spikes takes <strong>[[/damage 1d4]]</strong> piercing damage.</p></li></ul><p>This property can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.</p>"
