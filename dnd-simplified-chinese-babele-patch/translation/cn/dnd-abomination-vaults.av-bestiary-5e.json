These bureaucrats of Hell are rarely found outside the infernal courts, and then almost always to pursue potential contracts, tempting mortals to sell their souls in exchange for achieving their worldly desires. While other contract devils pride themselves on airtight clauses, hidden meanings, and steep penalties to gain the upper hand, Urevian prefers to smile his way into a straightforward deal that’s beneficial to everyone. He’s as kind and generous as he can afford to be toward an opposing party, making them feel like they’re holding all the cards. In a world of snarling fiends and vicious hell-spawn, Urevian seeks to stand out by simply using manners. Devils have a bad reputation for taking advantage of their marks; playing against that is one of Urevian’s strengths, and he uses it to great advantage.</p><p>Urevian wants the soul of Carman Rajani. With Belcorra’s return, he can finally escape his agreement with her, but he needs a Rajani soul to do so. Only one such soul remains: the blacksmith and scoundrel who is Vol’s sole remaining descendant. Ideally, Urevian convinces the party to fetch it for him. The contract devil is true to his word, and he departs quickly once he has his prize. The characters might refuse—and, perhaps, should refuse—despite Urevian’s honeyed words. If they fight and defeat him, he isn’t destroyed. Instead, his soul is cast into the court of the powerful entity to whom he pledged the Rajani soul, where he must hastily explain his failure to avoid obliteration.</p><p>Urevian spends his time in the room he’s claimed as his personal domain (area <strong>G10</strong>).</p>",

You lose Attunement to the lens, and the target becomes attuned to the lens instead, except the target can’t use the lens’s Grim Resistance or Infuse Nhimbaloth’s Tenacity properties. The target can’t end Attunement to the lens, but it can be ended by any effect that removes a possession effect, such as the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDispelEvil]{Dispel Evil and Good} spell. Since this is a form of possession, the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbEvilAndGoodPr]{Protection from Evil and Good} spell protects the target and causes Nhimbaloth’s essence to remain in the lens.

The eyes on either side of their head-jaw are small but keen.

They grip said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving them four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with gore.</p><p>Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs’ wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p><p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn’t apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p><p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.</p><p></p>",
