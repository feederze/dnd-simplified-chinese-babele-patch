[[/r 1d6]] bludgeoning - versatile ([[/r 1d8]])</p><hr /><p>A focus for pliers of electrical currents and lightning-based magic, this staff represents the evolution of wizardcraft and artifice. While old-fashioned mages potter about with candles and arcane runes, the new blood embraces technology. This staff contains the latest in magic energy catalysts, allowing it to recycle and redirect residual magical energy.</p><p>You gain a <strong>+2 bonus</strong> to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you cast a spell that deals lightning damage while holding this quarterstaff, roll a <strong>[[/r d8]]</strong> and add the result to one lightning damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning Rod.</strong></em> When you or a creature within <strong>20 feet</strong> of you takes lightning damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by <strong>[[/r 2d10]] + your proficiency bonus</strong> as the staff absorbs the energy.</p><p><em><strong>Residual Charge.</strong></em> After you cast a spell that deals lightning damage or use the Lightning Rod property, purple crackling energy gathers at the tip of this quarterstaff. The next time you hit with a melee attack using this weapon within the next <strong>minute</strong>, you deal an additional <strong>[[/r 1d8]]</strong> lightning damage to the target.</p><p><em><strong>Versatile.</strong></em> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>"
