The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.</p><p><strong>Grasping Hand</strong>. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is Grappling the target, you can use a Bonus Action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p><strong>Interposing Hand</strong>. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>"

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.

You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>.

Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p><p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artefact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p><p><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong> Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</p><p><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p><p><strong>Spells.</strong> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p><p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p><p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p><p><strong>Magical Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p><p><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong> A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p><p><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong> Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.</p>"

<li>  <strong><em>妄质晶体的形成：</em></strong>“魔法会吸引来更多的魔法。在极其罕见的情况下，魔法能量会结晶化变成妄质。这种结晶块会慢慢地从遥远的位面、可能存在的其它现实以及其他的维度吸引来更多的原始魔法。这种吸引速率的增速是指数级的。在大量的妄质周围会发生更多的能量泄漏。这种混乱的能量本质上具有不稳定性。不集中的魔法会导致随机且矛盾的不可能现象的出现，并留下难以抹去的魔能污染。如果不加以控制，这些魔法能量就会以污霭的形式表现出来。更多的妄质将会在其中形成，从而再度加速整个流程。” </li>  <li>  <strong><em>维度裂隙的出现：</em></strong> “随着污霭扩张，它既能改变地貌，也能从世界之隙中汲取魔法能量。我很担心在一些魔法十分集中的区域，或者在世界间的边际较窄的地方，可能会出现灾难级别的维度裂隙。”</li><li>  <strong><em>控制手段的可能：</em></strong> “妄质带来了生存危机，但也带来了机遇。如果能直接利用德拉肯海姆的妄质浓度，而非单纯地使用其制作一个又一个独立的魔法物品，那么它就有可能为我们提供无穷无尽的魔法能量。截至目前，我已经在对结晶释放的能量的收集方面取得了可喜的成果，但问题在于储存和控制它。这所需的防护水平超出了我的能力范围。但如果它能大规模地投入应用，将不仅可以为无数的魔法造物提供原料，还能减缓污霭的蔓延，甚至能使其得到控制。”

<li>如果角色们难以想出一个计划，其中一个派系领袖就可能会建议尝试用某种诱饵引出饕餮之主。然后，派系突击队可以声东击西，引开大部分的加米尔怪物，而玩家角色（可能和派系首领一起）则趁机击败饕餮之主。发挥玩家的创造力，让他们想想有什么适合做诱饵，又有什么转移注意力的好办法！</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">饕餮之主</h2> <p>

尺高的宏伟大理石天使像。天使的一手拿着武器，另一只手拿着一面银色圆盾，盾面被打磨得有着镜面一般的光泽。一道光柱从天花板上的洞口照射下来，使雕像被天光所点亮。</p> <ul>  <li>雕像描绘的是大天使加百列（东壁龛）和米迦勒（西），他们分别手持矛和剑。拥有宗教技能熟练的角色会自动认出他们；他们是引导圣塔尔娜走上圣武士之路的两个天使。</li>  <li>盾牌被魔法固定在了每个雕像上。不过天使的手臂是可动的。角色可以花费一个动作移动并旋转盾牌，使其与地面呈 45 度角，这样就能将天上的光束直接从壁龛中射入通道。</li>  <li>角色们可以在十字路口放置一面镜面盾牌，将光线向北或向南反射。</li>  <li>每座雕像上的铭文都写着“光明开启真理之路”。</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">[1-3] 坟墓</h2> <p class=\"read-aloud\">这些长长的房间里摆放着古老的石制平板，上面摆放着神圣之火的牧师与圣武士的木乃伊遗体，这些遗体之上只简单地装饰着一件饰品或者生前的武器。每具遗体手上都紧握着一个圣徽，眼睛上也嵌有光滑的石头。每块石台周围都摆放有数十根形状、大小各异的蜡烛。这里的墓葬没有被人动过，到处都覆盖着厚厚的灰尘。石板铺成的地面和低矮的天花板，再加上许多墓室和壁龛上的骷髅在时刻注视着来客，即使是这些宽敞的大房间也令人感到幽闭与不安。</p> <p>  <strong><em>圣职者木乃伊：</em></strong> 每个房间内都存放着神圣之火牧师和圣武士的木乃伊遗体。虽然逝者通常会被火化，但信徒们相信，在世界陷入绝望时，圣火会通过逝者的肉体传递其意志，这些受祝福的灵魂终有一日会重返人间。他们的遗体被亚麻布包裹起来，且穿着生前使用过的衣物、盔甲和武器。铭文、挂毯和彩绘壁画装饰着每个存放石棺的壁龛，它们讲述着死者的生平事迹。最后，每具石棺周围都摆放有 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) 支蜡烛。圣仪可以让蜡烛永远长明且不会产生消耗，但也可以像平常一样被水浇灭。</p> <ul>  <li>这里的每具遗体都是一个 @UUID[Compendium.5e-monster-book.5e-guanmo.Actor.qJnfRcuxfx6HnCFo]{木乃伊} 几十年前为他们举行的最终仪式阻碍了污霭复活他们的魔法效应。</li>

<p>这个圆形房间的穹顶上绘有一幅壁画，画中的骑士们手持圣火，以螺旋式的队列向着中央的发光之处行进。房间的中央有一个巨大的大理石水池，水池远端有一座表情悲怆的雕像。水从雕像的眼中流出，顺着面庞淌下，缓缓落入下方的水池中。</p> <p>这座雕像描绘了一位男性天使仰望苍穹的样子，其哭泣的脸庞上露出悲伤痛苦的表情。他的双手放在距离水面 1

class=\"read-aloud\">缮写室是个宽阔的正方形房间，从地板到天花板都堆满了木质书架。书架上摆满了各种按日期粗略排列的文献、纸张、卷轴以及文档。在房间的中央摆放着四张大木桌，两旁是一排排的木凳。桌上摆放着几本古旧的书籍和几个卷轴，还有墨水瓶和羽毛笔。桌子上沾满了墨水，而且其中一个墨水瓶已经翻倒了，导致墨水流到了地上，从石缝间淌出来。</p> <ul>  <li>这些文件似乎都是圣典，以及对神圣之火有着重要意义的历史故事和文学名著的副本。</li>  <li>书架中有 [[/r 2d6]] 张牧师法术列表的<em>珍稀法术卷轴</em>，其中包括一张<em>scroll of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e_collection_2024.phb-content.Item.ZEX9RmEByJuYNy83]{死者复活}</em>

要打开宝库需要从东面的交叉口折射光线，然后在竖井底部向上折射光线，再将射到竖井顶部的光线向东折射。由于盾牌需要放置在半空中，这就需要角色们想出一个巧妙的方法来实现这一点，但无论如何，他们都需要三面镜面盾牌。 </li>  <li>  <strong><em>家谱：</em></strong> 这本家谱以魔法手段保存了家族中关于每人的文字描述、婚姻协议、嫁妆内容以及收养条例，并盖有王室印章。</li>  <li>  <strong><em>王室遗嘱：</em></strong> 你可以自行决定遗嘱的内容，但其中会提到乌尔里希四世在没有已知继承人的情况下去世时的打算。 </li>  <li>  <strong><em>血缘命匣：</em></strong>

<li>火柱随即崩塌，然后化作一个挥舞着利刃、身披炽炎的@UUID[Compendium.5e-monster-book.5e-guanmo.Actor.3Y8gJnFBVwQDMPUC]{天神使徒} ，并向角色们发起挑战。伊格内修斯将允许任何击败天神使徒的人驱使自己，并相信自己能够将其转化为正义之士。</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Tomb of Saint Vitruvio\">[9] 圣维特鲁维奥之墓</h2> <section class=\"read-group\">  <p class=\"read-aloud\">大理石的柱廊环绕着这个圆形房间形成了一条窄道，每根柱子上都有一个点燃的火炬。墙上的壁画描绘了一位英勇圣武士的功绩与战斗经历，房间中央的圆形台基上矗立着一尊真人大小的圣武士雕像。</p>  <p class=\"read-aloud\">他身着板甲，头戴华丽的头盔；背包上挂着一面盾牌，腰间系着剑，身旁还有一把权杖，脖子上挂着一个护符。他的双臂向两侧完全伸直，掌心朝外。雕像的右侧大腿、下颌以及几个指关节处的空腔内保存着圣维特鲁维奥现今仅剩的几块遗骨，每块骨头上都刻有精美的祷文。雕像的眼窝中安置着玻璃球，手掌上有着斑点状的小孔，每个孔里都嵌有小型的镜片。雕像的周围以及房间内点着数百支蜡烛，南面的墙上还固定着一块镜面盾牌。</p> </section> <ul>  <li>要进入圣维特鲁维奥之墓，需要使用两面镜面盾牌于十字路口反射光束，但可以从东西两侧任一方向射入。</li>  <li>墙上有一面金色的盾牌。盾牌后面是一个被玻璃填满的较大的圆形孔洞。周围有着圣维特鲁维奥骑着阿贡纳斯的浇铸图案。</li>  <li>维特鲁维奥的雕像可以旋转，也可以以一个动作通过对其施加压力来升高和降低。雕像可以移动到一个位置，使其手掌与门上的孔对齐，眼睛与南面墙上的镜面盾牌对齐。</li>  <li>如果来自两个上位大天使壁龛中的天光光束同时反射到雕像双掌的镜片上，雕像的双眼就会射出一道粗大的光束。这道光束命中南面墙上的孔洞，然后南墙就会在一阵轰鸣声中开启，露出一条通往阿贡纳斯安息之处的宽阔旋转楼梯。要实现这一点需要四面镜面盾牌，每个路口各一面。</li> </ul>  <article>  <blockquote class=\"quote\">

<li>如何处理王室档案？</li> <li>谁将持有目前已经取得的<em><strong>德拉肯海姆信物</strong></em>？将由谁来统治德拉肯海姆？</li>  <li>妄质应该如何处理？</li>  </ul>  <p>在会议期间，应当充分各派系的特点，它们各自的目标，以及派系领袖的形象。在冲突中要划分出明确的界线，不要害怕对角色们当场发难：每个派系的领袖都应该至少有一次直接向每位玩家角色提出某个尖锐的问题。</p>  <p>  <strong><em>残忍的背(可选)：</em></strong> 如果玩家角色们在会议前就与其中一个派系之间产生了极大的矛盾，那么该派系就会在会议前秘密调动数支精锐突击队待命，或者在大教堂地下埋设大威力的炸药。他们还为自己的领袖精心设计了一个逃跑计划（对于学院或盗贼女王来说，这就并不重要了，因为他们都是以代理出席的）。在会议期间，领袖会要求得到所有的 <em>德拉肯海姆信物 </em>、圣维特鲁维奥的遗物、大教堂的控制权，或者其他任何适合该派系的疯狂的最后通牒。如果他们的要求没有得到满足，他们的部队就会发起攻击，或者引爆炸药，产生类似@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e_collection_2024.phb-content.Item.nkgNj5H4VtY7bKui]{流星爆} 水平的大爆炸，这场爆炸会席卷整座教堂并导致屋顶和穹顶坍塌。</p>  <h1 class=\"sidebar-h1 no-toc\">重燃火祭盆</h1>  <p>@UUID[Actor.tqJK1mzxPst0xV08] 和 @UUID[Actor.1IaDUyBM9G4EEphL] 都会提议重新点燃<em>神圣之火祭盆</em>，并重新为大教堂进行祝圣仪式。这需要一些圣人的骨灰或骨片：圣维特鲁维奥本人或者金龙阿贡纳斯的遗骨皆可，这些都可以在大教堂的地下墓穴中找到。如果火祭盆被重新点燃，大教堂的烛台就会在该区域内产生类似于@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.SLxA9QhrggTz0taU]{圣居} 以及 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.64D1gNZ4hx7SWG2x]{禁制术} 的效果，并且可以成为在城市中对抗污霭的圣所，角色们也可以在这里正常休息。 </p>  <p>如果大教堂被炸毁，火祭盆会被摧毁且无法再被重新点燃。</p>  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">事后余波</h2>  <p>大教堂仍然会是竞相争夺的热点地区：无论谈判结果如何，天火信众和白银骑士团都会在会议结束后试图从对方手中夺取大教堂。如果覆影明灯或盗贼女王无法从冯·凯赛尔家族宝库中获取情报，他们也会发起反击来抢夺这些信息。</p>  <p>任何守住了大教堂的派系都可以在此建立一个不算稳固的安全据点，但这样做会导致派系的兵力捉襟见肘。不过，玩家角色可以将这里作为他们的行动基地。最终，除非玩家角色采取行动赶走敌方派系并完成盟友的主要目标，否则每个派系都会在坚守大教堂超过 14 ([[/r 4d6]]) 周后就因兵力不断削减而难以为继这里的控制权。夺取大教堂给玩家角色们提供了一个重要的机会，但他们必须及时抓住这个机会。</p>

<p>集市广场记录着许多战斗残留下来的伤痕：临时路障、烧焦的痕迹、破碎的武器、残破的盔甲还有一些散落的尸体。鼠群四窜，乌鸦食腐，空气中弥漫着银紫色的薄雾。向上望去，你可以看到穿透迷雾的寰宇钟塔。</p> <ul>  <li> 在集市广场逗留是一件危险的事情。没有采取任何隐蔽措施的角色们都会被塔上飞出的 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) 只

<p>中央时钟的边框是由压花金属和玻璃钟面构成的，上面描绘着每个月太阳的运行轨迹和月相。表盘还以独特的艺术风格展示着当前的季节和星座，因此人们不仅可以确认时间，还可以确认当前的日期。从钟面向下延伸则是一个由圆形玻璃板、齿轮和滑轮组组成的机械系统，它通过精准的机械构造展示了行星与恒星在星界飞驰时的雄伟舞姿。叠加在行星上的多色玻璃镜片描绘着来世和次位面的超自然运行轨迹以及他们与尘世间的联系。塔身的其他部分饰有优雅的雕像，描绘着天使、圣徒、恶魔、魔鬼、元素还有其他各种异界的生物。有些楼层还有一排哥特式的窗户，三叶草拱形的窗框上嵌满了彩色马赛克玻璃。</p>

Though there are five more hidden throughout the world, this is unquestionably the greatest of them all. The loss of the tower was a nearly crippling blow for the otherwise mighty and resourceful Academy, though the Directorate has taken great pains to conceal this uncomfortable fact.</p>\n<p>This enigmatic structure was a mystery even before a meteor struck it. None can say exactly when it appeared in Drakkenheim, but most think that it must have been some time after the Edicts of Lumen. Yet there is no record of its construction, which seems incongruent given the massive tower would have taken decades to build.</p>\n<p>In truth, the Inscrutable Tower is the ancient and legendary hidden fortress of the Sorcerer Kings. This extraplanar dungeon was built within the roiling realm of chaotic possibility known as the Space Between Worlds in far antiquity by powerful and insane sorcerers to hide away their magical knowledge, but was left forgotten and abandoned for a thousand years. When the mages of the Amethyst Academy located it several hundred years ago, they tapped into the immense power of its Arcane Nexus to shift the whole structure into the mortal world, where it now stands in Drakkenheim. Since then, the Amethyst Academy gradually expunged most records and memories of this accomplishment to rehabilitate the tower's evil and ominous history. Yet there are many secrets about this place unknown to even the Amethyst Academy, including whatever magical forces now hold the tower together even after a meteor smashed through it.</p>\n\n<h1 data-split-here=\"Overview\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Unlike the other faction strongholds described herein, the Inscrutable Tower is not occupied by its controlling faction. Instead, the Amethyst Academy aims to regain control of it. Though it will take them months, if not years, to refurbish and repair the tower once this is done, it could cement the Academy's controlling influence over Drakkenheim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Adventure Hooks</h2>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Seize the Tower.</strong></em> Securing control of the Inscrutable Tower is a make-or-break mission for the Amethyst Academy, but also its enemies. If the Academy is able to regain control over the tower and begin repairs, it will allow them to enact more ambitious actions to seize control of Drakkenheim. On the other hand, the Amethyst Academy can be organizationally paralyzed if another faction occupies the tower and takes the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.InsT000000000017].\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"map-frame\">\n  <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/gm_maps/inscrutable_tower.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h1 data-split-here=\"Interactions\">Interactions</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Interloper</h2>\n<p>Several malfeasant mages are found throughout Drakkenheim: @UUID[Actor.jfJGagVOoUgyCyxn], the @UUID[Actor.uMQvgbPhxlHLl1vG], and @UUID[Actor.8mw3Q1D3NIIXIlSg]. If any of them have survived to this point in the campaign, choose one of them to make their own incursion into the Inscrutable Tower to seize it for themselves (you might want to have Oscar Yoren “level up” to an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]). They gather up some appropriate minions of their own: @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rbyp54px2D0ql4QK]{Wights}, @UUID[Actor.sHgFXfdwxl0mefuB]{Haze Hulks}, or summoned <strong>elementals</strong> (respectively) and are encountered at the <strong>breach</strong> in the library, plumbing the arcane knowledge within. The malfeasant has managed to claim the Inscrutable Staff for themselves, and are searching for an alternate means to control the Nexus as they cannot do so alone.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if the players have made an enemy of the Amethyst Academy, @UUID[Actor.IFRQ1jK41KOQNjGl] sends his @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jccbeBIfLrqEZnDP] here instead under similar circumstances. If his simulacrum was already destroyed, he arrives in person with an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.h98AuPfomEPcCibP] and an Amethyst Academy strike team.</p>\n<p>Finally, if neither seems like a viable option, an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.LTomFUTBrkRi0Pj5] has managed to escape the Deep Cells and conjured several @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8SMQl75HLjhuSeau]{Fire Elementals} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.IiEDPMWqBlzkggYD]{Azers} to serve it.

The remaining floors in this unfathomably large structure have a sprawling maze-like layout with roughly a dozen rooms connected by a twisting set of corridors. There is no consistency in the floorplan from floor to floor, and the configuration of the rooms is often illogical and may even defy the spatial geometry. Dormitories might be beside highly dangerous laboratories, or storage rooms for ingredients used by a workshop kept several floors apart. You can construct layouts as you see fit by using the various rooms described in the Residence Floors and Research Floors.</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-frame\">\n  <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0019_BOOK_The_Tower_Academy_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<p>The Lobby, Great Hall, Library, Director's Office, Nexus, and Deep Cells are singular specific locations in the tower, however.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Exotic Materials.</em></strong> The walls, halls, and furnishings found in the Inscrutable Tower are made from obsidian, dark steel, granite, black marble, and glass.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Magical Amenities.</em></strong> Magic provides lush comforts throughout the Inscrutable Tower. Fireplace hearths don't have chimneys, instead using special @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f] spells that radiate pleasant but otherwise harmless heat. Most rooms are illuminated with persistent @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.CAxSzHWizrafT033]. Bound @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ccduLIvutyNqvkgv]{Unseen Servants} tend the halls, keeping rooms tidy. Magical fonts produce water via the <em>create water</em> spell. A creature can focus their attention (as an action) on a light source, heat source, or water source they can see to cause it to turn on or off, or adjust its brightness or intensity. The parameters are such that these can't become so hot or cold to harm a creature, or so bright as to blind them. However, each time these are manipulated, roll 1d20. On a 1, a random @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.tables.RollTable.pPGtKhPFFcHortCT]{Arcane Anomaly} is triggered due to the erratic magic that grips the tower.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Magical Wards.</em></strong> Powerful magic protects the Inscrutable Tower. The exterior walls and doors are magically reinforced and are immune to all damage (except meteors). The doors and walls extend into the ethereal plane, blocking ethereal travel through them, and magic can't alter their forms. Creatures outside the tower can't teleport inside, nor can they teleport within the tower rooms unless they have a direct line of sight to their destination.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Tower Exterior</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy is an immensely tall structure that reaches a dizzying height of twelve hundred feet. The shimmering obsidian walls are perfectly smooth; there is not a single window or embellishment along its outer face save a deep vertical groove cut into the pinnacle. Seen at a distance the tower appears relatively narrow, though it is roughly one hundred and fifty feet wide and anchored by sharply arched buttresses at the base. The tower has been smashed apart roughly two-thirds up its height. Remarkably, the top of the tower hovers above in utter defiance of gravity. Between the upper and lower sections is a gaping breach with pieces of floating debris locked in the air; frozen in time at the moment a meteor soared through it. A keen-eyed observer can see fragments of delerium, broken bookshelves, and scattered tomes bobbing about the wreckage.</p>\n<h3>Academy Plaza</h3>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The cobblestone streets break here, a campus park surrounding the Inscrutable Tower. A forest of delerium crystals have grown up around the tower that surrounds a small artificial lake. Overlooking the pond is a large stone plinth surrounded by arcane arches.</p>\n<p>The area around the Inscrutable Tower is covered by the Deep Haze.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Etched into the stone is a great @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW].</li>\n  <li>The remains of a pair of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.z3gSIXHHWYaHjfBT]{Stone Golems} who once guarded this site.</li>\n  <li>1d4 @UUID[Actor.BezicP0b3wmU2u4p]{Protean Abominations} and 2d4 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8pX2JhWUpTNNRBVx]{Gibbering Mouthers} inhabit the plaza.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tower Entrance</h3>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">A broad staircase of seventeen steps bordered by a sloping ramp leads up to the singular entrance of the Inscrutable Tower. The dark steel doors are engraved with the sigil of the Amethyst Academy: a lidless arcane eye set within an octagram. There are no handles or hinges upon the door.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A character attuned to a set of <em>academy rings</em> who places their hands upon the door causes a set of glowing arcane runes to appear. After a short set of arcane clicks and whirring noises, there is a flash of light and the doors slide open with a screech.</li>\n  <li>Since <em>academy rings</em> are made for a specific individual, if the player characters don't possess a set of their own, they will need either an ally or a living prisoner wearing them to gain entry into the Inscrutable Tower. Characters can also enter via the <strong>breach</strong> itself, assuming they can fly or climb there.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Lobby\">Lobby</h2>\n<section class=\"read-group\">\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">The front doors lead into a massive lobby that fills the tower base. The ceiling is nearly fifty feet high and supported by obsidian pillars etched with intricate sigils, and the floor is reflective marble decorated with intricate arcane patterns. Rows of tall, thin vents along the outer walls form transparent openings allowing a view of Drakkenheim outside. On two opposite sides of the lobby are three sets of metallic double doors, and railingless spiral staircases of metal and glass wrap upward around the pillars on each corner.</p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">Throughout the rest of the room are chest-high stone dividing walls that form semi-private meeting areas set with metallic chairs and glass-topped tables.

The last is erratically slamming shut and jolting open at random. Looking beyond is a ten-foot-wide shaft that bristles and hums with arcane energy. Once in a while there is a thunderous crack of lightning that resounds up and down the shaft.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    The shafts extend up the length of the tower, but are broken by the\n    <strong>breach</strong>. Four of these elevators still function, however, and can provide access to the lower portion of the tower.\n  </li>\n  <li>Once every 1d6 rounds a <em>lighting bolt</em> (DC 16) shoots up the length of the two broken shafts.</li>\n  <li>The closed doors magically open when any creature approaches within ten feet of them, and a prismatic platform of magical energy forms within the shaft, above which float glimmering arcane runes arranged vertically: from bottom to top, the runes read “Lobby”, “Great Hall”, “Residences”, “Research Levels”, “Library”, and “Director's Office”.</li>\n  <li>A creature may step onto the platform and speak where it wishes to go, and the platform ascends with stomach-churning speed to that level.</li>\n  <li>There are multiple runes for the residences, research levels, and library indicating the dozens of levels for each, thus the speaker must specify individual floors. The levels past “63” don't function, so travel via the elevators to the upper portions of the library, the director's office, or the nexus isn't possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Great Hall\">Great Hall</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">This resplendent dining hall prominently features an elevated platform where a long marble-topped dinner table with high chairs faces the room. Before it are three long rows of polished granite-topped tables with dark steel chairs. Spectral chandeliers and candles of magical energy hover above, illuminating the room. Along the walls are tall portraits of archmages and professors of the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The portraits are magical, and the figures within come to life and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy] anyone who casts a spell in this room.</li>\n  <li>The sleek dinnerware are all magically animated, and trundle into their place at the dinner tables with food from the kitchen, then whisk away to the scullery to clean themselves.</li>\n  <li>The large kitchen is immaculately clean and organized, featuring well-made iron ovens, stoves, steel-topped food preparation tables, and organized glass cabinets for the dinnerware and utensils. The cookware is similarly animated, preparing food and tending the kitchen on its own.</li>\n  <li>The well-stocked larder opens into a vast featureless extradimensional space containing prodigious food stores upon neatly organized metal shelves, all magically preserved. The kitchen cookware daintily retrieves ingredients as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Residence Floors\">Residence Floors</h2>\n<p>Throughout the Inscrutable Tower are numerous apartments and quarters for the mages:</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Apprentices' Dormitory.</em></strong> These rooms contain four single bunks set with personal chests and nightstands. There is a shelf over each bed for personal journals with an iron lantern hanging from it. Clusters of these rooms are often found around a small common room with a tiled hearth, glass-topped table, and shelved books on mundane topics.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Wizard's Apartments.</em></strong> These well-appointed apartments are sealed with @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP] spells.

Staircases zig-zag from wall to wall, weaving up the height of the tower between walkways of black marble with railings of dark steel and massive floating bookshelves of speckled granite and glass lined up like airborne dominoes. The stairs and shelves rumble lowly as they shift positions to converge at suspended balconies and galleries where obsidian-topped tables, plush couches, and amber spheres of glowing light are arranged into reading nooks and studying desks. Throughout, many stairs and platforms are nauseatingly oriented sideways, some even completely upside-down and backwards.</p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">Every conceivable surface stores books. The balconies, furniture, walls, and even the steps of each stair all have cavities, niches, and shelves containing tomes of varying shapes, sizes, materials, and colours, some in neat and tightly organized rows, others in disheveled piles and scattered masses of pages.</p>\n</section>\n<ul>\n  <li>The library comprises an ever-changing and dynamic layout. It is one hundred and fifty feet wide on each side.</li>\n  <li>The elevators stop at the ground level of the library and rise no higher. Before the damage was done, secret doors behind bookshelves along the walls opened for easier access, but these are broken now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Stairs.</em></strong> Most staircases are thirty to fifty foot long sections, each five feet wide. The stairs connect and disconnect to each other and the platforms by some unfathomable pattern. For any given stair section, roll 1d20 each round, and on a 1, it moves.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Platforms.</em></strong> The various platforms have a variety of equilateral shapes - square, triangular, hexagonal - and range from ten to thirty feet in diameter. The ground level of the library is arranged into reading nooks and study desks like the other platforms.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Gravity.</em></strong> Gravity is subjective here. Characters can walk normally on staircases and platforms, even sideways or upside-down. Creatures levitate in midair instead of falling, but those lacking a flying speed must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a railing or bookcase), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Soaring Intellect.</em></strong> A creature can fly and hover within the library with a speed equal to ten times its Intelligence modifier.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Tomes.</em></strong> Herein are books on every conceivable topic, from artworks, history, natural philosophy, magical matters, mathematics, and more. Among the books are introductory and advanced texts, exhaustive commentaries on those texts, poignant commentaries on those commentaries, scathing refutations of that commentary, a rebuttal to refutations of the commentaries, treatises that purportedly reinvent the topics altogether, and many works of complete fiction and utter fantasy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Spellbooks.</em></strong> The library contains multiple tomes detailing every spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list in the Core Rules (and many more beyond) with the notable exceptions of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.xNM9CzQQr2CieM4B], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.h830iyqParFleNqR], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jccbeBIfLrqEZnDP], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz], and the new spells described in <strong>Appendix D</strong>.\n</p>\n\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n    <p>“I've been to a couple Academy strongholds, none of them felt welcoming, this one feels less so.”</p>\n    <cite>— Sebastian Crowe</cite>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Shattered Breach</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">Looking above from the library, characters can see the breach in the tower. Visible are the remains of that section of the library, where the stairs, shelves, and platforms still shift and move, but in a field of wrecked debris. A crackingly storm of eldritch lightning erupts between the gently floating debris, cast adrift gently in space, defying gravity.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The breach is a one-hundred-fifty-foot-wide gap in the library. Traversing the breach requires flight, but there are several stray shelves, platforms, and stairs creatures can rest upon.</li>\n  <li>Chunks of delerium and meteoric iron hover about the air, interacting with the magic within.</li>\n  <li>\n    Gravity remains broken in the breach, and creatures may still fly via\n    <em>soaring intellect</em>.\n  </li>\n  <li>A creature who ends its turn in the breach rolls 1d6. On a 1, it's struck by eldritch lightning. It must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 lighting damage, or half as much on a successful save.</li>\n  <li>Casting a spell in the breach automatically triggers an @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.tables.RollTable.pPGtKhPFFcHortCT]{Arcane Anomaly}.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Directors Office\">Director's Office</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">Behind an impressive set of double doors is the director's audience chamber. Opposite the entrance to this circular room is a sumptuous obsidian throne flanked by iron candelabras. The sigil of the Amethyst Academy decorates the wall overhead, and the marble floor depicts a complex planar astrolabe. Overhead, a chandelier of steel and copper rings gently rotates, showing the movement of the celestial spheres. On either side of the throne is an arched iron door.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>This room is located on one of the topmost floors of the tower, just below the Nexus.</li>\n  <li>The archmages of the Amethyst Academy keep personal chambers within the Inscrutable Tower merely as a formality: all maintain private @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.xNM9CzQQr2CieM4B]{Demiplanes} as their primary abodes. Instead, this room serves as a meeting place to conduct business with others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The left door opens outside the tower itself. As the door opens, a glimmering balcony of magical force takes shape that rings the entire tower with a narrow walkway five feet wide. There is a heaving lurch, as panels in the outer wall swing open below. A great telescope of glass and bronze emerges from within, supported by a metallic crane that moves it into position over the balcony. A chair is built into the side of the telescope, upon which are several intricate switches and levers.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Controls on the telescope allow it to be moved and rotated around the tower.</li>\n  <li>Several runes on the telescope play back a record of past observations. The last rune indicates a record was made the day the meteor struck, indicating that the archmage only became aware of the meteor in the final moments before it struck.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The right door opens into a smaller circular chamber where a round granite slab hovers three feet off the ground. Splayed out over it are all manner of missives, magical implements, and occult instruments. Glass shelves holding arcane components and books line the walls.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> This is a tuning fork keyed to the mortal plane, the material focus for a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz] spell. Scrolls of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Y7uWUO4yqUN0JKl0] and a very rare magic item can be found here.\n  </li>\n  <li>A sealed chest in this chamber contains the components needed to repair the clocktower, including an ancient (pre-meteor) delerium crystal in a preserved glass sphere.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"img-frame\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:250px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0066_BOOK_Old_Book_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"map-frame\">\n  <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/gm_maps/library_and_nexus.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Nexus\">Nexus</h2>\n<section class=\"read-group\">\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">A gigantic and incomprehensible arcane apparatus whirs, clicks, and hums upon an obsidian plinth at the centre of this chamber. Revolving rings of brass, rotating golden plates embossed with diagrams of magical formula, whirling crystal lenses, spinning bronze rings etched with markings bearing out the movement of the planes, receptacles bearing lambent glass orbs of various colours and sizes, and delicate brass instruments orbit around a pulsing sphere of collecting energy. It glows with a strange prismatic light as it erratically convulses and emits spasmodic arcs of arcane plasma that send shudders and shakes through the room.</p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">Surrounding the machine are eight massive cushioned chairs held aloft by articulated bronze arms. Levers, buttons, switches, and plates that glow with magical runes are built into the armrests, and an array of telescoping apertures and lenses are affixed to the headrests with jointed metal rods. Seated within each is a warped and barely recognizable lifeless body.</p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">The ceiling is a massive dome made from interlocking glass panes in organic shapes, each which gazes upon a different alien sky. Booming lightning crackles above. The rest of the room is ringed with shelves holding jars of spell components and eldritch curiosities.</p>\n</section>\n<ul>\n  <li>This is the topmost level of the Inscrutable Tower.</li>\n  <li>The nexus contains a dimensional rift that has become unstable due to the damage caused by the meteor. The nexus must be rebooted to stabilize the dimensional rift.</li>\n  <li>Rebooting the nexus requires each of the eight chairs be disengaged and shut down. A creature seated in the chair can use an action to manipulate the apparatus. Doing so takes an action and DC 20 Arcana, Investigation, or Sleight of Hand check. Checks can also be made with tinker's tools or thieves' tools.</li>\n  <li>On a failed check, the creature suffers 4d6 psychic damage from backlash. Failure by 5 or more causes the creature to become stunned for 1 round.</li>\n  <li>Each attempt immediately triggers an @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.tables.RollTable.pPGtKhPFFcHortCT]{Arcane Anomaly}.</li>\n  <li>After the first chair is reset, on the following round on initiative count 20, 1d6 random extraplanar creatures are conjured by the erratic interference of the machine being partially on and partially off.</li>\n  <li>Once all eight chairs are successfully disengaged and shut down, the nexus powers down and the dimensional rift becomes stable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Deep Cells</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The floor of this forty-foot-wide obsidian chamber contains only a twenty-foot-wide cylindrical shaft lined with rows of hexagonal cells arrayed in a honeycomb.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>This is the bottom chamber of the Inscrutable Tower, but space warps around itself, and it can only be accessed from a stairway opposite the Director's Office that seems to impossibly lead back down the entire tower.</li>\n  <li>The cylindrical shaft descends one thousand feet into the earth before ending in an immobile @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.2YNqk5zm9jDTvd7q]. All in all, there are over eighty thousand cells here.</li>\n  <li>Two @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.z3gSIXHHWYaHjfBT]{Stone Golems} stationed here as guards have gone berserk, and attack any who enter the chamber.</li>\n  <li>A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.o9ZCvuD2B1OTcubb] once covered the opening of the shaft, but the magic has failed. Fortunately, most of the other defensive features of the cells remain intact:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Cells.</em></strong> Each cell is a hexagonal cavity about ten feet wide and ten feet deep. An @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ] fills each, and either a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.o9ZCvuD2B1OTcubb] or a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jmfu8zj4zjjzUbeh] covers the opening. An arcane rune identifying the contents of the cell hovers in the air before the wall. A destroyed <em>wall</em> reforms one round later.\n</p>\n<p class=\"no-indent\">\n  <strong><em>Keys.</em></strong> The magical wards upon each cell are individually keyed to a specific person, a password, and a token, and are manipulated by providing two of the keys and then speaking a command word within ten feet of the corresponding cell. The command words and their effects are as follows:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Secure.</strong> Raises the <em>wall</em> and activates the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ].</li>\n  <li><strong>Release.</strong> Lowers the <em>wall</em>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Disengage.</strong> Deactivates the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ].</li>\n  <li><strong>Discharge.</strong> Lowers the <em>wall</em> and deactivates the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ], then causes a blast of force to violently expel the contents of the cell into the shaft, where they fall into the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.2YNqk5zm9jDTvd7q] below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each token is a magical trinket and could be almost any kind of object, but each always bears an invisible arcane rune that identifies the corresponding cell. Thousands of such objects are scattered about the Inscrutable Tower.</p>\n<p>The exact contents of the cells are best left to the imagination, but they could contain all manner of extraplanar entities, fiends, and magical artefacts. Given the variety of creatures and objects stored within, it isn't uncommon for unique specimens to have specific safeguards.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\" data-split-here=\"Developments\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h1 data-bad-cut-point data-split-here=\"Developments\">Developments</h1>\n      <p>\n        <strong><em>The Tower Reclaimed.</em></strong> While it will be some time before the tower can be repaired and brought to a fully operational state again, accomplishing this major objective allows the Academy to move on to the next stage of their plans for Drakkenheim.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The Amethyst Academy will permit a player character who is a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard that can cast spells of 6th level or higher and opts to formally join the Amethyst Academy to carry the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.InsT000000000017] on a mission to Castle Drakken that requires it.</li>\n        <li>The Amethyst Academy offers three very rare magic items in exchange for the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.InsT000000000017] to groups who wish to keep it.

Most of the enclosure is filled with neatly organized rows of large canvas tents, grouped around small cooking fires and supply carts.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The main walls of the camp are constructed by double-layered wooden logs. Each log is twelve to fourteen feet long and ends in a spike. Stone and gravel have been piled along the base of the wall for reinforcement.</li>\n  <li>A ditch fifteen feet deep and ten feet wide has been dug around the entire perimeter like a moat. The trench is filled with sharpened wooden spikes and knee deep water.

As such, following, interrogating, or tricking the Queen of Thieves' own strike teams is the best method for locating the court. Important prisoners and treasures seized by the Queen's Men agents eventually make their way back here. The player characters might be able to engineer an opportunity to lure out a strike team to track back to the court by using tantalizing bait.</p>\n<p>Regardless, those who come to parley with the Queen of Thieves are presented with a fiendish puzzle before they are granted an audience (see the “Queen's Riddle” below).</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Queen's Champions.</em></strong> A widely-circulating rumour claims that the Queen of Thieves grants a personal favour to any who defeat the arena champion, and so characters who made a name for themselves fighting in the rings of Buckledown Row might be invited to the Court of Thieves to test their mettle in the arena instead.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Defenses</h2>\n<p>The Court of Thieves focuses on security through obscurity.

The main canal is drained, relatively dry, and blocked with debris in several places. Wooden planks hammered and lashed across the canal form bridges and decks above, accessible through ladder-like stairways. The broad upper sewer walkways have been cleared out to make room for about a dozen round tables with stools set around each. Hanging lanterns are strung up throughout to light the chamber, and a few coal stoves provide meager warmth. An impressive bar has been constructed, lined with barstools from which a curiously dapper mechanical barman serves ale and mead. At the far end of the tavern is a small band of ruffians performing lively music upon an improvised stage. Several rogues and thieves mingle about.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The canal continues east to another intersection, which heads north into a fog-shrouded tunnel and further east to a collapsed tunnel.</li>\n  <li>One or two Queen's Men <strong>strike teams</strong> are watchfully relaxing here most of the time.

If someone drinks, he gestures towards the mist. The correct solution is to simply ignore all the drinks, and walk through the mist.

The bottom of the pit is different each time this ability activates:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Featureless.</em></strong> There's nothing at the bottom of this pit.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Acid Pool.</em></strong> The bottom of the pit is filled with a five-foot-deep pool of acid. A creature who starts its turn in the acid takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Spikes.</em></strong> The pit is lined with sharp spikes. A creature falling into the pit takes an additional 5d6 piercing damage.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Contaminated Water.</em></strong> The bottom of the pit is filled with contaminated water ten feet deep. A creature that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of Contamination.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Liquid Hot Magma.</em></strong> Ten feet at the bottom of the pit is filled with lava. A creature who enters the pit or who starts its turn there takes 10d10 fire damage.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Portcullis (5/day).</em></strong> A heavy iron gate slams down from the ceiling above. Creatures below can make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to leap clear on either side. A creature who fails this saving throw lands prone. Those who fail the save by 5 or more are instead crushed under the portcullis. The creature suffers 5d6 bludgeoning and 5d6 piercing damage, and becomes restrained under the portcullis until freed. A creature can lift the portcullis by using an action to make a successful DC 17 Strength check. It may also be attacked and damaged; it has AC 20, 30 hit points, and is immune to psychic and poison damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Nerve Gas</em> (2/day)<em>.</em></strong> The hallway releases a deadly neurotoxin. Each creature in the hall must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magical gas. On a failed save, the target takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. In addition, it can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for one minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n</p>\n<h3>Countermeasures</h3>\n<p>Characters can use whatever means at their disposal to defend themselves, or simply take the Dash or Dodge actions and hope for the best, or try the following:</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Perception.</em></strong> On its turn, a creature can spend an action to examine the area around it for signs of traps with a successful DC 17 Perception check. On a successful check, either the next saving throw it makes against the trap automatically succeeds, or the next attack roll made against it by the trap automatically misses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Disarm.</em></strong> A creature can attempt to disable one of the gauntlet's systems. It chooses which action it wants to disarm and makes a DC 22 Dexterity (thieves' tools) check. On a successful check, the mechanism is disabled for one minute. On a failed check, the creature accidentally triggers the mechanism.\n</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n    <p>“Respect where it is due although the crown belongs to the youngest as the older generation has been corrupted by greed and madness.”</p>\n    <cite> — Pluto Jackson</cite>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"The Office\">The Office</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">Beyond the door is a tidy and luxurious office paneled with wood and bookshelves. Three bronze candelabras illuminate the chamber with soft ember light. A mahogany desk sits in the middle of the room with a sumptuous upholstered chair behind and two fine wooden chairs before it. Atop are several neatly stacked papers and journals, a lamp, and a box of fine fountain pens. Several large framed mirrors hang on the wall opposite the desk and to the left and right side of the room. A model globe rests in one corner, and in the other is a petrified wingback chair fixed to the floor.</p>\n<p>A mental @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.7p9IuWrSWFgfyQo2] spell notifies the Queen of Thieves whenever someone enters this chamber.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bookshelves.</em></strong> Gothic novels, play scripts, and other fiction involving dastardly criminals, tricksters, and other villains are found here. Written in the margins of each text are commentaries left by a genre-savvy reader about the many mistakes made by the villain in the story. Occasionally, particularly clever reversals made by the heroes are circled in red ink.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Mirrors.</em></strong> These magical mirrors are positioned such that anyone seated at the desk may see behind themselves and observe others in the room from every angle. In addition, the reflections of invisible creatures and objects are visible in the mirrors, which also reveal the true nature of any illusions or shapechangers. Hidden behind one of the mirrors is the end of a thin tube that connects to the Shackled Door in the Rogue's Gallery.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Resplendent Desk.</em></strong> Kept in the desk drawers are comprehensive dossiers on each of the player characters, faction leaders, and lieutenants. Not only do these notes detail virtually everything about their capabilities and exploits thus far, within may be secrets unknown even to the player characters themselves. The desk and chair are magical; a creature sitting at the desk on the chair can use an action to cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ePhRKHXRE7l1sEoQ] to a range of 300 feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Petrified Wingback.</em></strong> A creature who sits on this stone chair is immediately teleported as if by @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.A4RsPuSvB9wFtz1j] to an identical-looking chamber (see below). In that moment, the teleported creature sees an illusion of any other creatures in the room being disintegrated, while those creatures see an illusion of the teleported creature having its flesh painfully seared away, leaving behind nothing but a blackened skeleton that crumbles into ash if touched. Looking at the skeleton through the mirrors in the room reveals it to be an illusion.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Globe.</em></strong>This inaccurate but meticulously detailed globe opens at the equator, revealing a liquor cabinet with seventeen bottles of fine spirits and eight tumblers. Only four contain real alcohol; two bottles are actually @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.bqZ6NTLDCUB98YjV]{Potions of Gaseous Form} disguised using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.RvEqsD89Zvd5yex4] to appear nonmagical. The rest are poisoned. A creature who drinks from one must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 ([[/r 10d6]]) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only the Queen of Thieves knows which is which.\n</p>\n<h3>Secret Sanctum</h3>\n<p>These chambers are deep under the earth, and almost entirely inaccessible except via teleportation. They are outside the Haze, and creatures can rest here normally.</p>\n<p>This secret room is completely identical to the office in every way, and sitting on the wingback again returns a creature to the original office. However, the doorway exits to a short hall with two impressively secure iron doors. Each door is @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{Arcane Locked} and warded with a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.B2kbmgbA2WQR00kx] spell. The rooms beyond are both protected by @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.NJgxf7pmSsBArIG7]:</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bedchamber.</em></strong> A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.f38w5rd9SgdmWc6F] spell has decorated this room to appear like the penthouse apartment in Castle Drakken with a magnificent view of the city as it was twenty years ago. The only real objects in the room are a comfortable bed, a table upon which the Queen of Thieves keeps her spellbook, and a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.qXcUKfCVxEvV3VU8]. If you wish, a trinket that provides a revealing clue about her true identity is found here, and the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.f38w5rd9SgdmWc6F] can be adjusted to better reflect the real person behind the Queen of Thieves. Hidden beneath a loose tile under the bed is a <em>scroll of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV]</em> she uses to escape if she ever becomes trapped here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Queen's Vault.</em></strong> This vault contains 10,000 gp worth of bullion, coins, and gems, neatly stacked, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.rhGulc3gEJhnuP31], and one other rare magic item of your choice. If the Queen of Thieves has acquired any <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>, <em>Relics of Saint Vitruvio</em>, or other important items, they are kept here (unless she is using them herself).\n</p>\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0125_BOOK_Big_Linda_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Arena\">Arena</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">This natural cavernous chamber is roughly fifty feet high and supported by stone pillars.

The no-holds barred contest merely stipulates that combatants who are knocked unconscious or surrender are pulled from the field.

Big Linda uses the game statistics of a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.HlddcPm4cWptj3ka] with the following additional traits that increase its challenge rating to 9. Big Linda has been permanently charmed by the Queen of Thieves and (usually) obeys her spoken commands.

The Queen of Thieves takes any important or choice items belonging to captives and stores them in her vault, and the minions who made the capture get their pick of the rest. As such, there's no convenient place where captured characters can recover lost equipment, as it's quickly dispersed amongst the ranks of the Queen's Men. When they release prisoners, the Queen's Men don't return stolen equipment.</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Guard Room\">\n  <strong><em>Guard Room.</em></strong> This dingy chamber has a rickety wooden card table and containers with manacles and chains.

An eldritch storm of falling stars\n    devastated the city on that woeful eve, leaving behind a meteorite that\n    would have lasting effects. Fifteen years later, Drakkenheim is a dismal\n    urban wasteland contaminated by otherworldly magic and haunted by hideous\n    monsters. Fantastic wealth, lost knowledge, and powerful artefacts lie ready\n    for the taking by adventurers brave or foolish enough to venture into the\n    ruins. However, even those who survive the dangers of Drakkenheim might not\n    return unmarked by its terrors!\n  </p>\n</article>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Campaign Overview</h1>\n<p>\n  <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> is a fantastic adventure set in a gothic\n  Renaissance ruined city. The campaign is designed with four player characters\n  in mind, so adjust accordingly for smaller or larger groups. You can play\n  <strong><em>Drakkenheim </em></strong>as a series of loosely-connected\n  exploration quests or an unpredictable narrative filled with faction conflict.\n  The material herein will challenge characters from 1st to 13th level.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong class=\"inline-sub\">EXPLORATION.</strong> Characters embark on\n    dangerous expeditions into monster-filled ruins, haunted streets, decrepit\n    gardens, shattered mage towers, baroque cathedrals, and ancient castles to\n    plunder treasure and solve mysteries.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong class=\"inline-sub\">INTERACTION.</strong> Five rival factions clash\n    over the ruins of Drakkenheim. A tangled web of secrets, subterfuge, and\n    sabotage awaits when the factions' opposing objectives and your characters'\n    personal goals come into conflict!\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong class=\"inline-sub capped\">Combat.</strong> Beyond fierce warriors\n    dispatched by the factions, all manner of otherworldly horrors inhabit\n    Drakkenheim. Characters battle undead husks, predatory beasts, mutated\n    monstrosities, and terrifying abominations produced by the mysterious\n    meteor.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  You'll need a copy of the core rules for Fifth Edition to properly run this\n  adventure. When reading this book, text in\n  <strong>bold</strong> usually references a creature or non-player character\n  stat block, while text in <em>italics</em> often indicates spells or magic\n  items. Many new monsters, items, and spells are described in the appendix\n  sections of this book; otherwise, consult the Fifth Edition core rules.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Delerium</h2>\n<p>\n  Iridescent crystals of vast magical potential are found throughout\n  Drakkenheim. Known as delerium, these lambent stones emanate unnatural\n  energies that induce madness and monstrous transformations. Despite these\n  dangers, delerium is ideally suited to crafting magic items and fuelling\n  mighty new spells. Sorcerers, warlocks, wizards, and all manner of occult\n  magicians crave its supernatural power, thus delerium commands a high price\n  within arcane circles and underground markets alike. Many prospectors risk\n  everything to collect a few fragments, but the true origins of the strange\n  mineral remain unknown. The rival factions stand divided over whether the\n  crystals should be destroyed, harnessed, or worshipped, and their simmering\n  disagreements threaten outright war.\n  <strong>Appendix D: Delerium, Magic &amp; Spells</strong> covers the crystals\n  in detail.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Broken Realm</h2>\n<p>\n  Drakkenheim was the cosmopolitan capital of Westemär, ruled by the imperious\n  House von Kessel. A decade of bloody civil war erupted after the city's\n  destruction. The realm was left shattered and the royal line broken. Now, the\n  political order of the wider world lies in shambles, torn apart by religious\n  schism and military conflict, and only a faint hope remains that the city can\n  be rebuilt and the nation restored.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Rival Factions</h2>\n<p>\n  Five factions have arrived in Drakkenheim to advance their ambitious agendas.\n  Though their ideologies and methods differ, each seeks valuable resources and\n  lost secrets within the city. However, the ruins present many confounding\n  obstacles for their agents. As such, all the factions hope to attract talented\n  adventurers to their cause, drawing would-be heroes into a fierce political\n  intrigue that may boil over into violent struggle. Those who wish to decide\n  the fate of Drakkenheim must choose their allies well and their enemies\n  carefully!\n  <strong>Chapter 3: Factions</strong> contains complete details for running\n  each faction, but they are summarized below:\n</p>\n<h3>Hooded Lanterns</h3>\n<p>\n  Formally known as the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the\n  Capital, the Hooded Lanterns are an irregular military drawn up from veterans\n  of the Civil War and remnants of the old Drakkenheim City Watch. Led by the\n  dour @UUID[Actor.L0yjx19PnmJgrqVk], they wage a guerrilla war against the\n  monsters, bandits, and scavengers who have taken root in their nation's\n  capital. Each has pledged their swords and lives to rebuild Drakkenheim and\n  restore the Realm of Westemär. Several noble houses have set aside their feuds\n  to support the Hooded Lanterns' efforts. These families believe once the city\n  is restored, evidence will emerge revealing the true heir to the throne of\n  Drakkenheim... or enable a cunning house to seize the crown.\n</p>\n<h3>Queen's Men</h3>\n<p>\n  The Queen's Men are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands,\n  outlaws, and scoundrels, all of whom owe fealty to the enigmatic\n  @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe]. These reprobates prey upon the pilgrims,\n  prospectors, and explorers drawn to the city, extort and rob adventurers,\n  smuggle delerium to disreputable clients in distant lands, and plunder the\n  fantastic treasures and incredible wealth left behind in the city. The\n  @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] dreams of building an influential and powerful\n  criminal empire forged in the anarchy and lawlessness of the ruins, and\n  conspires against the other factions at every turn.\n</p>\n<h3>Knights of the Silver Order</h3>\n<p>\n  The Knights of the Silver Order are an organization of oath-bound paladins and\n  devout warriors sworn to combat supernatural evil, dark magic, and\n  otherworldly incursions. The questing knights normally travel the realms in\n  small bands and companies, and adhere to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the\n  dominant religion across the continent. They believe delerium is a\n  contaminating blight borne of the darkest chaos, and have resolved to\n  annihilate the corrupted crystals, slay every monster it has created, and hunt\n  down diabolical mages who would wield its power to work evil magic. Now an\n  entire regiment has been dispatched to Drakkenheim to carry out this righteous\n  task, led by @UUID[Actor.q4jRqiq5PgWcqvxD].\n</p>\n\n<h3>Followers of the Falling Fire</h3>\n<p>\n  The annihilation of Drakkenheim incited a serious religious schism within the\n  Faith of the Sacred Flame. A new sect has emerged known as the Followers of\n  the Falling Fire, who adhere to the prophecies of former\n  @UUID[Actor.tqJK1mzxPst0xV08]{Flamekeeper Lucretia Mathias}. She attests that\n  delerium is a divine gift, not a blight, and that these sacred stones will\n  offer salvation against a greater darkness yet to come. The mainstream clergy\n  have excommunicated Lucretia Mathias and branded her followers as an insane\n  cult with heretical beliefs and blasphemous practices. Even still, masses of\n  devout commonfolk now embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to Drakkenheim to take\n  their place in a divine plan.\n</p>\n<h3>Amethyst Academy</h3>\n<p>\n  The Amethyst Academy is a magical school for sorcerers and wizards, where\n  students learn magic in remote castles and secluded universities. Directed by\n  a shadowy cabal of powerful archmages, the Academy also operates an\n  enterprising mage guild that controls the manufacture of magical wares, and\n  orchestrates an influential arcane syndicate that provides occult counsel to\n  the nobility of the continent. However, the Academy was dealt a terrible blow\n  following Drakkenheim's destruction, as the city was home to their greatest\n  stronghold: the Inscrutable Tower. @UUID[Actor.IFRQ1jK41KOQNjGl]{Archwizard\n  Eldrick Runeweaver} leads the Academy's efforts to access the tower and\n  safeguard the secret lore within. Meanwhile, their survey teams conduct\n  ongoing research regarding delerium's supernatural qualities and unknown\n  dangers. The mages plan to harness the crystals' vast energies to craft\n  magical items and power new arcane spells.\n</p>\n\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n    <p>\n      “A dangerous foe, moving almost unseen, it invades your wits and saps your\n      strength when it's needed most.”\n    </p>\n    <cite>- Pluto Jackson</cite>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Haze</h2>\n<p>\n  There are more hazards in Drakkenheim than monsters and rival factions. A\n  billowing mist filled with glinting multi-coloured motes has settled over the\n  entire city, which adventurers call the <strong>Haze</strong>. It's like the\n  dust never really settled after the meteor fell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Characters gain no benefit from taking a long rest within the Haze</strong>. Adventurers should be well-rested\n  before they head into the ruins, as\n  they'll need to escape the city to regain their hit points and spell slots.\n  This effect cannot be circumvented by any mundane equipment, nor bypassed with\n  spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ap4dmtshjEbwU3Ts],\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.NXWWWgHtWb7Nv21F], or similar character\n  abilities. These effects are described in detail in\n  <strong>Chapter 5: Exploring Drakkenheim</strong>.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Contamination</h2>\n<p>\n  Characters will also encounter deadly\n  <strong>eldritch contamination</strong> caused by creatures, delerium, and\n  other magical phenomena in Drakkenheim. Abilities, equipment, and spells that\n  protect against diseases, magic, or poisons do not work against contamination.\n  It cannot be healed naturally, nor readily removed with low-level spells.\n  Player characters will need to work with the factions and find creative\n  solutions to manage these problems during their adventures. The full rules and\n  debilitating effects of contamination are outlined in\n  <strong>Appendix C: Contamination</strong>.\n</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Dangers of the Dark City</h2>\n<p>\n  Finally, be warned that in Drakkenheim, characters will often stumble upon\n  creatures and other perils far beyond what they can defeat on their own.\n  Discretion and cunning may prevail when strength of arms fails. Adventurers\n  must seek out like-minded allies, and be wary of making new enemies. They must\n  have all the equipment they need before setting out on an expedition, use\n  their resources carefully, and be prepared to retreat at a moment's notice!\n</p>\n\n<article>\n  <div class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n        <h2>Content Warning</h2>\n        <p>\n          Drakkenheim portrays a dark fantasy world.

              "text": "<p>\n  In a <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> campaign, the player characters are the\n  heart of the story. Their choices, conflicts, and personal goals could decide\n  the fate of Drakkenheim - if they survive! Below are guidelines for creating a\n  player character ready to take on the dark city. We recommend players and Game\n  Masters collaborate closely during character creation for the best possible\n  results.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Character Options and Backgrounds</h2>\n<p>\n  Adventurers of any race or class in the Core Rules can be found in\n  Drakkenheim.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong class=\"inline-sub\"><em>Appendix E: The World of Drakkenheim</em></strong>\n    describes how many character ancestries, religions, martial arts, and\n    magical traditions fit into the wider world.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong class=\"inline-sub\"><em>Appendix F: Character Backgrounds </em></strong>includes new backgrounds players may use to closely connect their\n    characters to the events, people, and mysteries in Drakkenheim.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Personal Quests</h2>\n<p>\n  A character's core motivation for adventuring in Drakkenheim is represented by\n  their personal quest. This is a specific individual objective for player\n  characters to achieve during the campaign, but players need not reveal their\n  personal quest to each other.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a character completes their personal quest, they choose one of the\n  following rewards:\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> One ability score of your\n  choice increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>New Feat.</em></strong> You gain a bonus feat of your choice,\n  subject to the GM's approval.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Player characters may select from the quests below, or work with the Game\n  Master to design one:\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Apocalyptic Vision.</em></strong> I have been haunted by visions\n  of the meteor for fifteen years. Every time I sleep, I see it crashing down\n  upon me. My personal quest is to see for myself what lies at the heart of the\n  Crater. I must overcome whatever I find there in order to stop these\n  nightmares.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Arcane Secrets. </em></strong>Forbidden lore lies in Drakkenheim.\n  Several dark wizards living in the ruins have mastered terrible and powerful\n  new magic. The Inscrutable Tower library stands unguarded, filled with\n  spellbooks containing secret arcana. My personal quest is to learn these\n  spells.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Blighted Landscape. </em></strong>A blight on the natural order\n  envelops Drakkenheim, but the contamination could spread beyond the city. My\n  personal quest is to study the unnatural phenomena found within the most\n  corrupt places in the city: Queen's Park Garden, the underground waterways,\n  and the Crater's Edge. Perhaps then I can develop a way to reverse the\n  contamination.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Claim the Throne. </em></strong>Though my family has fallen on\n  hard times, we were distantly related to the royal House von Kessel. I may\n  have a claim to the throne of Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to search the\n  cathedral, noble estates, and the castle for sufficient evidence to\n  conclusively prove my inheritance. Then I will take the crown for myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Faction Aspirant. </em></strong>I believe strongly in the ideals\n  and goals of one of the five factions: either the Amethyst Academy, the\n  Followers of the Falling Fire, the Hooded Lanterns, the Knights of the Silver\n  Order, or the Queen's Men. My personal quest is to join the faction, aid their\n  mission, climb the ranks, and rise to a high leadership position within their\n  organization.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Family Matter.</em></strong> One of my family members or close\n  friends has become mixed up with one of the factions. Perhaps they have\n  foolishly decided to join the organization. Alternatively, they've been taken\n  prisoner by the faction due to some trespass or misunderstanding. Either way,\n  my personal quest is to bring them back home.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Find a Cure.</em></strong> I have a friend, family member, or\n  loved one who was contaminated by delerium and turned into a monster. They\n  have gone mad and are lost somewhere in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to\n  locate them, then discover a way to reverse their horrific transformation.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Lost Heirloom. </em></strong>I used to live in Drakkenheim. My\n  personal quest is to recover a lost heirloom from my old home, which was\n  located somewhere in the Inner City. Perhaps the item is sentimental, valuable\n  only to members of my family. Alternatively, it may have magical properties,\n  and I wish to use these powers to aid my own ambitions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Monster Slayer. </em></strong>I wish to leave behind a heroic\n  legacy by defeating dread beasts. My personal quest is to slay three of the\n  greatest monsters rumoured to dwell in Drakkenheim, and bring back their heads\n  as trophies. Each must be a notable creature with a challenge rating greater\n  than my own level when I defeat them. My allies can assist me, but I must\n  strike the decisive blow myself!\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Overwhelming Debt. </em></strong>I owe a tremendous debt of 10,000\n  gold pieces, maybe more. My personal quest is to pay it back by making a\n  fortune in Drakkenheim collecting delerium, plunder, and completing\n  work-for-hire. Meanwhile, I must hide from bounty hunters my creditor sends to\n  kill me.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personal Pilgrimage. </em></strong>As an acolyte of the faith, my\n  personal quest is to visit several holy places in the city and perform a\n  sacred ritual before the remains of the martyrs interred within each: the\n  Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, Saint Selina's Monastery, and the Chapel in\n  Castle Drakken. Through these devoted acts I will understand my place in the\n  divine order.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Score to Settle. </em></strong>I have come to Drakkenheim to kill\n  one of the faction leaders: either Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver,\n  Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal, Lord Commander Elias Drexel, Lucretia\n  Mathias, or the Queen of Thieves. Perhaps I seek revenge for a past wrong.\n  Alternatively, I may covet their position and wish to replace them. Either\n  way, my personal quest is to slay them.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Character Relationships</h2>\n<p>\n  The campaign begins with the player characters setting out on their first\n  foray into the ruins, but how did they meet? Consider establishing a personal\n  connection between two or more player characters, such as one of the\n  following:\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"text-center center-prose\">\n  <p class=\"solo-p\">...siblings, cousins, or childhood friends.</p>\n  <p>...a shared origin, religion, or teacher.</p>\n  <p>...former rivals turned unlikely allies.</p>\n  <p>...one saved the life of the other.</p>\n  <p>...saw each other in a dream or vision.</p>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n\n<div class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2>Four Quick Facts about<br />the World of Drakkenheim</h2>\n      <p>\n        <strong><em>Appendix E: The World of Drakkenheim</em></strong> explains\n        these background details further, but the setting of Drakkenheim\n        diverges from the default assumptions of Fifth Edition in four key ways:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <strong>The gods are silent and distant</strong>.

Under extraordinarily rare circumstances, magical energies crystallize into\n          delerium. The stones slowly draw more raw magic into the world from distant planes, possible realities, and\n          alternate dimensions. The rate is exponential. Considerably more leakage occurs around vast quantities of\n          delerium. These chaotic energies are inherently destabilizing. Unfocused magic conjures up paradoxical\n          improbabilities at random, leaving behind lingering eldritch contamination. Uncontained, these magical forces\n          manifest as the Haze.

Left unchecked, the Haze can overtake an entire world within a few centuries, leaving behind\n  a chaotic landscape of churning madness and wild magic. The infected world cataclysmically shatters when more\n  destructive magic inevitably erupts, sending a hail of delerium-filled comets throughout the cosmos.

Countless worlds have\n  met this fate; the rest are wholly ignorant of the doom that might one day descend upon them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If nothing is done to stop the spread, the Haze will fully engulf Westemär in roughly one hundred and fifty years.\n  Once this happens, little hope for reversal remains, and the dread mists will envelop the world two centuries\n  thereafter.

              "name": "Fall of House von Kessel",
              "text": "<p>House von Kessel ruled Westemär from the capital of Drakkenheim for one hundred and fifty years. The last monarch, Ulrich IV, inherited a period of relative political stability, and so pursued interests in architecture, education, and carnal affairs instead of politics and warfare. He married a Caspian princess, Lenore, and they had three children: Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza. Ulrich IV was ten years into his reign when the meteor struck Drakkenheim. The King, his wife, and their children were never seen again after that day, but their true fate remains a mystery.</p>\n<p>However, many members of the royal household were not in Drakkenheim when the meteor struck, including the King's younger siblings, Mannfred and Cecilia von Kessel. The two spent vast sums commissioning the clergy of the Sacred Flame and the mages of the Amethyst Academy to use divination magic to discern what happened, but to no avail. They nearly bankrupted themselves by launching multiple large-scale military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of which failed. Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further efforts were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown and relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim, arguing there was no conclusive evidence that confirmed their brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided over the issue, and a civil war ensued that raged for nearly a decade. As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal. Cecilia von Kessel herself died unexpectedly only a few days later, leaving behind no heirs of her own. Lacking a clear successor, the Civil War ended with a whimper.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Royal Family</h2>\n<p>Since the royal household were recognizable public figures in their lifetimes, any character proficient in History instantly recognizes them in artwork or portraits.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>King Ulrich von Kessel IV</strong> was a portly man of average height with a wiry beard and rather unremarkable features; artwork often exaggerates his appearance with a heroic barrel chest, a lush curly beard, and a regal countenance. Stately artwork shows him clad in a royal mantle wearing the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.CroT000000000022]. Those who knew the King in life remember him as a capable if overindulgent ruler who left most matters of state to his administrators.</li>\n  <li><strong>Queen Lenore von Kessel</strong> was a woman in her late thirties; six feet tall with graceful limbs, hair dyed bright orange, and bleached white skin. Her face had chiseled and angular features, and with every gesture she struck a pose. She wore outrageously ornamented gowns and jewelry, including a famous golden necklace set with eleven emeralds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Leonard von Kessel</strong> was eighteen years old when the meteor struck, but would be thirty-three years old now. Leonard took to military interests at a young age. Artwork often depicts him as an aristocratic young soldier with sandy brown hair wearing a dragon-decorated breastplate and wielding a longsword.</li>\n  <li><strong>Katarina von Kessel</strong> was an inquisitive and acrobatic eleven-year-old with wide eyes and auburn hair. She typically wore a frilled shirt, fitted trousers, and cape instead of dresses, and had a penchant for stealing hats. She would now be twenty-six years old.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eliza von Kessel</strong> was only six years old at the time of the disaster. The button-nosed child was usually dressed in a bonnet and patterned dress. Assuming she survived, she would be twenty-one years old today.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0111_BOOK_Family_Portrait_CMYK_.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">A Long Lost Heir</h2>\n<p>None have yet discovered that King Ulrich von Kessel IV and Queen-Consort Lenore von Kessel were both transformed into monsters. Ulrich is now part of the hideous @UUID[Actor.FaQBcQeboMfO6hOL] in Castle Drakken, and Lenore has become a mad creature hiding in Queen's Park. Their children haven't been seen in fifteen years. It's up to you to decide whether or not they survived, and where they might be found.</p>\n<p>Beyond the immediate offspring of Ulrich IV, however, many relatives and cadet branches exist. As such, the House von Kessel family tree has been left intentionally vague so you and your players may freely insert your own player and non-player characters as potential heirs. They need not be one of Ulrich's known children, but instead illegitimate offspring, a grandchild, niece, nephew, or other family relative. The most dramatically compelling possibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>One or more player characters (known or unbeknownst to them)</li>\n  <li>A close relative of a player character (offspring, half-sibling, cousin, or niece/nephew)</li>\n  <li>The @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] or a faction lieutenant (see the NPCs entries for specific ideas)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, there is no need for there to be a single surviving heir, or even any at all. Anyone can say they have royal blood. It's another matter to prove it, and gain the support to actually take the crown. Finally, it's possible another noble household could gain sufficient political clout and military power to turn a tenuous claim into a credible one, and simply supplant House von Kessel entirely.</p>\n<h3>Complications</h3>\n<p>At the outset of the campaign there is no heir apparent to the throne, nor have any credible claimants to the throne stepped forward. There are many reasons why a potential claimant to the throne hasn't emerged yet. Decades of affairs, disaster, and war have ravaged the public records, and conclusively determining heredity via magical means requires the blood or remains of Ulrich IV. While an heir could possess a locket, signet ring, or some other document, this must be substantiated with something from the ruins to prove their identity and ancestry. Consider introducing one of the following additional complications:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Kept as a long-forgotten prisoner in an iron helmet in the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe]' dungeon.</li>\n  <li>Grew up adopted; no idea about their true parentage.</li>\n  <li>Working as a humble stablehand living in Emberwood Village.</li>\n  <li>Secretly hidden and protected by a distant noble house.</li>\n  <li>Petrified into a statue in Castle Drakken.</li>\n  <li>Accidentally banished to another plane.</li>\n  <li>Succumbed to contamination; transformed into a monster.</li>\n  <li>\n    Secretly an arcane spellcaster; disinherited under the Edicts of Lumen. (See\n    <strong>Appendix E</strong>)\n  </li>\n  <li>Target of an assassination attempt by faction agents; have been hiding since.</li>\n  <li>Born from an affair; their birth was kept secret to conceal a scandal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<article style=\"position:relative;margin-bottom:75px\">\n  <aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n        <h2>Embracing the Unknown</h2>\n        <p>What has happened to Drakkenheim is simply a cosmic accident. It is not the intentional work of an inscrutable extraplanar being, nor did any chortling demon lord or scheming evil deity set these events in motion. Instead, it is more akin to a natural disaster, albeit one caused by the magical forces that underscore the cosmos. Much like an earthquake, hurricane, or volcano, the calamitous forces that cause such magical catastrophes are entirely beyond mortal means to control or reverse. This fact may come as a surprise to players who expect they can simply defeat some tangible evil entity and save the world. However, the dark fantasy and cosmic horror literature that inspired this adventure rarely ends in such clear-cut ways. Instead, the heroic actions of the player characters may avert further disaster, but will never erase the damage that has already been done.</p>\n        <p>While outwardly presenting a tantalizing mystery, the meteor functions more as a catalyst for conflict in Drakkenheim. My players failed to fully uncover the origins of the meteor during their adventures, but our campaign still had an immensely satisfying conclusion. In fact, themes of cosmic horror and madness are greatly enhanced when the real answers are never fully understood.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </aside>\n  <img style=\"max-width:200px;position:absolute;margin:auto;bottom:-75px;z-index:75;right:0;left:0\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0017_BOOK_Meteorite_Delerium_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</article>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Seals of Drakkenheim</h2>\n<p>\n  These six wondrous items were entrusted to the royal council of Westemär. Each identifies the bearers as important administrative and political figureheads. In addition to their potent magical powers (described in\n  <strong>Appendix D</strong>), the seals have an important purpose in a special coronation ritual that attunes a new monarch to the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.CroT000000000022] itself (described in chapter 9). As such, many factions seek these seals, which are thought lost in the ruins. Two are already in the hands of faction agents, while others lie among the ruins. They can be found in the following locations:\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Chancellor's Crest.</strong></em> Balrin Barthes failed to escape Drakkenheim, and was transformed into a monster. This mutated wretch still wears the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.ChaT000000000016], and serves the horrific Duchess deep in its lair below the cistern.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Inscrutable Staff. </em></strong>Adriana Modiera, the Archmage of Drakkenheim, died within the Inscrutable Tower. This mighty magical staff remains there today. Traditionally, the Amethyst Academy has the right to determine who holds this staff.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Lord Commander's Badge.</em></strong> Elias Drexel survived the fall of Drakkenheim and spent years fighting in the Civil War before taking charge of the Hooded Lanterns. He still holds his original badge of office.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio. </em></strong>High Flamekeeper Gregora led the faithful in the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio. Her true fate is unknown, but now a monstrous garmyr priest carries the phylactery in the cathedral. It is traditionally entrusted to the highest ranking cleric of the Sacred Flame in Drakkenheim, as this item is also one of the\n  <em>Relics of Saint Vitruvio.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Spymaster's Signet.</strong></em> Spymaster Magdalena Vasari was a half-elf assassin. A loyal operative through-and-through, Vasari took advantage of her assumed death to secretly seek any surviving heirs of the royal family during the Civil War. She may have succeeded had she not been killed and her signet ring stolen by the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] several years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Steward's Seal. </strong></em>Johann Eisner, the royal steward, became trapped in Castle Drakken after failing to rescue Ulrich IV. However, he entrusted his young daughter with hiding his seal as a precaution for this exact predicament. While her fate is now unknown, the seal is now amongst the treasures of the @UUID[Actor.PiuU7fM0cJ07APjq] in the <strong>Cosmological Clocktower</strong>.\n</p>"

            "Running Personal Quests": {
              "name": "Running Personal Quests",
              "text": "<p>These adventure hooks give the players their own personal objectives for venturing into the ruins. Players might choose one of the quests presented in chapter 1, or you may work with the player to invent one of your own design.</p>\n<p>The personal quests have been kept open-ended so you can work with your players to deeply customize them. You should feel free to integrate unexpected twists or complications along the way, and establish strong connections to the city, events, and factions in the process. Here's a few suggestions for how these quests might proceed:</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Find a Cure.</strong></em> The character's relative may be found in an area of the Deep Haze: near the Inscrutable Tower, Queen's Park, the Crater, or perhaps in thrall to the Duchess or the @UUID[Actor.uMQvgbPhxlHLl1vG]. Unfortunately, they are indeed mad, and once found resist capture and constantly try to escape. A monstrous transformation can be reversed in three ways: using a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz] spell, by @UUID[Actor.tqJK1mzxPst0xV08] performing a divine intervention, or by researching the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.SipT000000000011] spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Claim the Throne.</em></strong> This quest ties the character strongly to a central conflict in the campaign. A fun twist is introducing a rival adventurer with an equally valid claim. Consult that section for more details. This character could even be one of the children of Ulrich IV.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Apocalyptic Vision.</em></strong> This character will need to seek out the means to survive the most contaminated area in the city. Once they reach the heart of the Crater, the character has another apocalyptic vision when they touch the Delerium Heart. The character must now decide what they will do to save the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Faction Aspirant.</em></strong> Advancement in a faction requires a full commitment from the character, exclusive of any other faction. Achieving this quest happens when a faction's leader regards the character as a capable and trusted confidant, and appoints them as their right-hand lieutenant. The most challenging aspect of this quest are the conflicts of interest it may cause with the other player characters, but embrace this conflict as a sticking point between the characters!\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>A Score to Settle.</strong></em> This is a very difficult personal quest, but a straightforward one. The faction leaders are all well-protected and formidable in their own right, though Elias Drexel and Theodore Marshal are significantly easier to encounter in person. Characters targeting the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] or @UUID[Actor.IFRQ1jK41KOQNjGl] are in for a vexing challenge!\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Arcane Secrets.</strong></em> These spells can be learned from @UUID[Actor.jfJGagVOoUgyCyxn], the @UUID[Actor.uMQvgbPhxlHLl1vG], @UUID[Actor.8mw3Q1D3NIIXIlSg], and spellbooks contained within the Inscrutable Tower; the character must seek knowledge from each. Collecting these spells raises the ire of the Amethyst Academy, who wish to keep knowledge of this magic secret. Characters can complete this quest by researching the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.ConT000000000002] spell.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>The Blighted Landscape.</em></strong> After visiting each location, the character can research the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.AquT000000000001]{Aqua Expurgo potion}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.NeuT000000000006], and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.ConT000000000001] spells respectively, even if they haven't met the other prerequisites to research these spells.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>A Family Matter.</em></strong> Captive or convert, the relative is found at a faction stronghold. They could even be one of the faction lieutenants! It is difficult to convince them to leave; they have to see the faction do something horrible with their own eyes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Overwhelming Debt.</strong></em> Rival adventurers, a Queen's Men strike team, or an assassin might be pursuing a bounty on the character. You may want to have the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] or the Amethyst Academy “acquire” the character's debt and use that as leverage over them!\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>A Lost Heirloom.</em></strong> Any rare magic item is an appropriate heirloom, and you can choose any location in the city where the item is lost, although Reed Manor, the Kleinberg Estate, and Slaughterstone Square are good possibilities. If you'd really like to create complications, this item could be stolen by the Queen of Thieves or a rival adventurer, or could even be one of the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personal Pilgrimage.</em></strong> The ritual the character wishes to perform at each location need not be simple. Instead, it might be a time-consuming process that requires a rare offering and takes several hours to complete, or perhaps can only be performed at a certain time of day (either dawn or dusk). As such, the character will need the protection and support of their allies to stay safe during the rite.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Monster Slayer.</strong></em> Suitable foes might include the @UUID[Actor.wguXXOlJxvHZw7xo], the @UUID[Actor.PiuU7fM0cJ07APjq], the Duchess, the @UUID[Actor.CF7PHcpwR43Z2LVS], the Prince of Carnage, a @UUID[Actor.nqdTPETJHquUMVIW], or a @UUID[Actor.uXmefMFY5tadWoMU].\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Finishing a Personal Quest</h2>\n<p>Upon completing a personal quest, a player character gains rewards as described in chapter 1. In addition, you should reward each character in the party experience points based on the advancement method you are using.</p>\n<p>At your option, once a character completes their personal quest, you might work with the player to create a follow-up personal quest for them to reflect the character's ongoing and evolving story. Furthermore, if conditions emerge where a character either can't complete or decides to abandon their personal quest, you should work with the player to develop a new one.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Creating a Custom Personal Quest</h2>\n<p>When designing a custom personal quest, keep the following principles in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The quest should require characters to explore one or more locations within the Inner City ruins. A character shouldn't be able to complete their personal quest too early. Conversely, a personal quest involving Castle Drakken likely can't be completed until late in the campaign.</li>\n  <li>It should present some sort of complication with one of the factions, or perhaps require the characters to seek help from the faction to complete their quest.</li>\n  <li>The quest should be specific and achievable, and not related to character advancement (such as reaching 10th level or taking a specific feat).</li>\n  <li>Be careful about using a “ticking clock” for a personal quest. While this can introduce a compelling complication, focus on long-term goals rather than extremely urgent matters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Players often suggest personal quests involving missing persons, lost objects, or revenge. Many example personal quests provided already cover such motivations, such as “A Family Matter'', “A Lost Heirloom”, and “A Score to Settle”. Ask players to consider these options first. Perhaps their idea can be easily adapted to work with one of these quests (or vice versa).</p>"

              "name": "Running the Factions",
              "text": "<p>\n  Five factions are struggling to control the ruins of Drakkenheim: the Hooded Lanterns, the Queen's Men, the Knights of\n  the Silver Order, the Followers of the Falling Fire, and the Amethyst Academy. Each is commanded by a prominent\n  faction leader, but the faction as a whole behaves like a major recurring NPC, except they are composed of many\n  individuals working together who share the same ideology, goals, methods, and resources.\n  <strong>Chapter 3: Factions</strong> describes the background, objectives, roleplaying characteristics, major NPCs, and assets\n  of each faction. Using this information, it's up to you to determine how the factions might help or hinder the player\n  characters during their adventures in Drakkenheim.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Rather than uniting the factions as one against a common foe, the player characters must navigate a fractious web of\n  intrigue, negotiation, sabotage, and violent conflict if they wish to uncover the greatest treasures and secrets in\n  Drakkenheim. Their relationships with each faction will naturally develop as a consequence of the characters' choices,\n  but it's ultimately up to them to decide who they want to join and who they will oppose. Thus, each individual faction\n  might become a supportive patron, fierce competitor, close ally, bitter enemy, or anything in between.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Exploring the most dangerous locations in Drakkenheim is extraordinarily difficult without gaining the support (or\n  inciting the ire) of one or more factions. Correspondingly, the factions need the player characters' help to\n  accomplish their own goals in the city, and offer rewards to their allies and assistance with the characters' personal\n  quests. Conversely, factions that become antagonistic create dynamic problems and new complications throughout the\n  campaign when they use their resources against the characters. Either way, the factions are best played in a reactive\n  manner. Their leaders make firm demands when characters try to negotiate, orchestrate counterstrikes when characters\n  foil their plans, and conduct sabotage when characters oppose their goals.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Eventually, these interactions may blossom into a full-scale hostility between the factions. Once this occurs, aim to\n  keep each faction in play as long as possible. Don't be afraid of letting the players get in over their heads if they\n  make enemies with more than one faction, either. Your players will find surprising ways to foil the factions, and\n  develop cunning plans when they collaborate with them.

Not only do they seek\n  the aid of the player characters, many factions see the benefits to collaborating with each other. Diplomatic\n  characters could negotiate an alliance, truce, or ceasefire between two (or more) factions. Convincing any two\n  factions to set aside their differences and work together should be difficult, but achievable. In order to broker such\n  a deal, characters will need to demonstrate how the alliance will help both factions achieve their objectives, but\n  also make an appeal to the roleplaying characteristics, ideals, bonds, and flaws of the factions and their leaders. These tense\n  negotiations can make for some of the most memorable moments in the campaign, so potential alliances are best arranged\n  in dramatic locations such as the faction strongholds and the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The factions have been designed such that a long-term alliance between any two factions is achievable, and a\n  short-term truce involving three is difficult but entirely possible. Countless situations in your campaign may emerge\n  that could cause the factions to re-evaluate their priorities, and clever and convincing players might present\n  compelling arguments. Bear in mind of course, that the factions are composed of people - and people don't always act\n  in logical ways. These alliances are always unstable, however, as each faction presses to have their own goals\n  prioritized. Unless the player characters make an ongoing effort to keep a coalition together, any alliance between\n  factions will inevitably collapse.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Factions such as the Amethyst Academy and the Queen's Men may even use alliances as a convenient opportunity to\n  manipulate the player characters and the other factions, and possibly even make a dramatic reversal at a critical\n  moment. Especially cunning characters might help the factions weave such deceptions and plots, resulting in brutal\n  betrayal against an unsuspecting ally which allows the faction to seize full control of Drakkenheim for themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since the threat of betrayal is so real, player characters who build a coalition between multiple factions may\n  compromise the trust they earn with an individual faction. They won't receive the greatest boons the faction can\n  offer, and faction agents don't trust characters with sensitive information. Faction leaders are wary of\n  double-agents, and would much rather see the player characters make a commitment to them. As a result, the player\n  characters should constantly be called upon to demonstrate their loyalty.\n</p>\n\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0006_CINE_Assassination_CMYK_CUT.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-top:25px\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Resolving the Conflict</h2>\n<p>\n  Unfortunately for the player characters, discovering the full properties of delerium and facts regarding the meteor's\n  origins will not unite the factions. Instead, these revelations will drive further wedges between the fractious groups\n  since they deeply disagree on the best way to address the problem. Given that the Haze threatens to overtake the\n  entire world, it may at first appear the Silver Order is completely correct that the crystals must be destroyed.\n  Throughout the campaign however, the feasibility of accomplishing such a task should be consistently cast in doubt.\n  You should strive to contrast this viewpoint against the rational yet questionable stance of the Amethyst Academy\n  which insists arcane means may harness delerium to prevent further catastrophe, and the zealous and apocalyptic\n  prophecies of the Followers of the Falling Fire. Whenever it seems like the players have made up their minds, rival\n  factions should present a gnawing sense that some alternative might still be possible. You should avoid presenting any\n  “correct” answer: It's up to the characters to piece it all together, draw their own conclusions, and decide how to\n  act.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As such, there is no fixed resolution to the faction conflict. By the end of the campaign, several factions could be\n  routed from Drakkenheim entirely, their leaders slain and strongholds toppled. While a showdown in Castle Drakken is\n  inevitable, who exactly is present for that battle and the outcomes that may arise are unforeseeable.\n  <strong>Chapter 10: The Fate of Drakkenheim</strong> describes a few possibilities.\n</p>\n\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n    <p>\n      “A lot of people seem hopeful to find the royal family alive in the city, as if that's going to fix everything.\n      First off, they weren't all that great, second of all, the chances they are alive are.... dismal.”\n    </p>\n    <cite>— Sebastian Crowe</cite>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>"

Either\n  way, good rivals spur the characters into action and create unique roleplaying\n  opportunities.

They'll pay each character 25 gold for the trip upon arrival in Emberwood Village. It's the perfect way to make some money as characters trek towards the city. The characters meet Eren Marlowe in the city of Altberg, which is the closest large city to Drakkenheim. It's a three week journey to the ruins.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Eren Marlowe</h2>\n<p>Eren Marlowe is a lean person in their mid-forties with shoulder-length brown hair under a leather cap. They wear a slightly shabby woolen traveller's jacket and well-worn slacks. Chatty yet professional and with an opinion about everything, they enjoy having company on the road as much as they enjoy having the extra protection. As the characters travel along the road, Eren Marlowe asks each of them about their reasons for travelling to Drakkenheim, and how the characters met each other. This is a perfect opportunity to introduce the player characters, their relationships, and personal quests. In turn, Marlowe can share the following information with characters:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>They are bound for Emberwood Village, which is the only settlement within two weeks' travel of Drakkenheim that hasn't been abandoned. It is about five miles south of the dark city.</li>\n  <li>The increasing number of fortune-seekers, mercenaries, and prospectors exploring the ruins has turned the sleepy village into a boom town again.</li>\n  <li>Most farms and villages within one hundred miles of Drakkenheim have been abandoned. Crops and livestock don't grow anymore as the water and soil are contaminated by foul magic.</li>\n  <li>The folk of Emberwood Village rely on outside supplies entirely. Flamekeeper Hanna, a priest of the Sacred Flame, provides seed funds to attract the caravanners.</li>\n  <li>Once they arrive, Eren Marlowe will stay in Emberwood Village for a few weeks selling goods.</li>\n  <li>If characters are interested in heading into Drakkenheim, Marlowe offers to introduce them to their friend and frequent business partner, Armin Gainsbury, who runs a supply company in Emberwood Village. Armin sells useful adventuring equipment and can provide good advice about exploring the ruins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Events on the Road</h2>\n<p>While most of the journey is uneventful, once characters are a few days from Drakkenheim, read:</p>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">After two weeks travelling on the road, the countryside turns dreary and desaturated. You pass many abandoned villages with dilapidated homes, crumbling farmsteads with sallow empty fields, and forests of dead trees. Thorny brambles and harsh scrubgrass are all that grow along the mud-slick road. Drizzling rain fills most days, and the wind howls at night. Aside from the creaking wagon wheels, you only hear the cawing of crows.</p>\n<h3>Marlowe's Caravan</h3>\n<p>Eren sits atop a large covered wagon pulled by two @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Bupo3E9X5Ptx6XeT]{Draft Horses}. It's packed with common provisions and trade goods: flour, salt, dried fruits, preserved meats, several jars of sauerkraut, a few casks of mead, a case of cheap wine, and a barrel of fresh water. The wagon also packs a few sets of common artisan's tools, cook's utensils, empty waterskins, climber's kits, rope, and mining tools. Marlowe carries two @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potions of Healing} on their person for emergencies, and an extra light crossbow. Beneath a hidden plank in the wagon is a locked chest that contains 200 gold.</p>\n<h3>Bandit Shakedown</h3>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">“Oi, oi! Hold there, friends… you're travelling on a royal road, eh? In these troubled times it falls to loyal servants like ourselves to keep these highways free of reprobates and outlaws, eh? I'm afraid we'll need to collect a fee to ensure your safe passage to the capital, eh?”</p>\n<p>During one afternoon on the road, several cutthroats emerge from the ditches and rubble of a nearby farmhouse with crossbows at the ready.</p>\n<p>Bogdan, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam] mounted on a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rz8UTUnFT87BsAFR], leads four @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN]{Bandits}: Hosh, Mildred, Sanna, and Mudface. They demand the horses, all the booze in the wagon, a pound of food each, and a payment of 25 gold per character (including Eren Marlowe).</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Negotiation.</em></strong>\n  The bandits can be talked down with three successful Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) checks (in any combination). It's DC 10 if the characters offer to pay the bandits something, but DC 15 if they try to convince the bandits to walk away empty-handed but alive. However, after three failed checks, the bandits are convinced the characters are full of hot air and won't entertain any further negotiations.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Combat.</em></strong> If it comes down to a fight, the bandits try to gang up on the most vulnerable target. Then, Bogdan threatens to finish off an unconscious character unless his demands are met. Otherwise, the brigands disengage when wounded. They flee if one-third of their number are killed and none of the player characters are downed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Developments. </em></strong>These bandits are only loosely associated with the Queen's Men and don't venture into Drakkenheim themselves. If captured or questioned, they don't know anything about the Queen's Men or Drakkenheim that isn't common knowledge. They have a hideout in an old barn a few miles off the road. If the characters follow up, the barn is guarded by six @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN]{Bandits}. It contains their spoils: 75 gold in trade goods and coins and a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs].\n</p>\n\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n    <p>“Sneaking and skulking is the preferred method, second best is having someone like me around.”</p>\n    <cite> — Pluto Jackson</cite>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n\n<h3>A Night on the Road</h3>\n<p>\n  A trio of harrowed adventurers approach the characters' campsite on the last night of their journey.

They are bitter, defeated, cynical, and never plan to return, but share one or more\n  <strong>rumours</strong> about the city as they sit and share stories by the fire.

He follows his companions in a daze, and cannot speak as his tongue has rotted out from a <strong>rasping mutation</strong>. His friends have covered him in a heavy cloak to conceal his <strong>wasting mutation</strong> and the <strong>tentacled limb</strong> growing in place of his left arm.</p>\n<p>If the characters detect Vos' mutations or pry the adventurers about his illnesses, they confess that he became sick after picking up one of the strange crystals in Drakkenheim. They insist the illness is not contagious, but rather caused by overexposure to the contaminated magic in Drakkenheim. They've heard expensive magical medicine might be able to help, but they can't afford it. Instead, they're hoping he'll get better once they bring him far away from the city.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, during the night, Rikard Vos succumbs to contamination and transforms into a @UUID[Actor.jWhywrjRVft3DkSx]{Tentacled Delerium Dreg}. The monster flies into a rage and attacks one of its former companions. It's up to the characters to decide how to intervene. The creature is beyond reason and attacks unceasingly until killed. If von Graff and Jansen survive, they are deeply troubled by this incident. They solemnly warn the characters about the horrors of the city as they set off in the morning.</p>\n<p>Marlowe has heard stories about contamination and delerium, but never witnessed it firsthand.

Early in the campaign, your players might closely follow the story overview described below. As they advance further into the city and interact with the factions, their decisions will reshape the story in unpredictable ways.</p>\n  <p>This book contains inspiration, guidelines, and tools to help you adjudicate and respond to your player characters' actions as they explore Drakkenheim. Running an exciting and dynamic nonlinear adventure requires sound judgement and good use of logic on your part. You should feel empowered to make changes so your players have a rewarding and challenging experience. Occasionally, you may even need to devise your own material or repurpose adventure hooks, characters, and locations to better suit the changing conditions in your campaign.</p>\n</article>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Story Overview</h1>\n<p>The characters arrive in Drakkenheim to pursue their personal quests or a few freelance missions from friendly contacts in Emberwood Village. They face ravenous @UUID[Actor.v6osXCahFwmobuQz]{Ratlings}, malfeasant wizards, and rival adventurers in the Outer City Ruins. During their first forays into the city, the characters witness the strange magic of delerium and contend with the mysterious Haze. The threat of contamination makes survival in Drakkenheim difficult and dangerous. The characters may seek assistance and resources from the five factions to accomplish their goals and find a way deeper into the city.</p>\n<p>As the characters learn more about the factions' differing ideologies, the various faction leaders take notice of their progress. Once the characters successfully traverse the City Walls and begin exploring the Inner City Ruins, each leader approaches the characters for help with their objectives. They appeal to the characters' Ideals and Bonds, offer resources and support, and promise crucial assistance with the characters' personal quests.</p>\n<p>However, as the characters collaborate with the factions to advance their mutual goals, they become increasingly entangled in the political machinations between the competing groups. Each organization has a different vision for the future of Drakkenheim, and the tenuous peace won't last much longer. Nevertheless, with the support of one or more of these groups, the characters can explore dangerous Inner City locations such as the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, the Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy, or perhaps even mount an expedition into the Crater. Characters may unearth stunning revelations from Drakkenheim's past and recover powerful artefact which threaten the balance of power between the factions. They might even discover how the Haze threatens to engulf the world itself.</p>\n<p>The factions are deeply divided over what must be done to solve these problems. As a result, simmering tensions boil over into outright conflict. As the city streets become a battlefield between the organizations, the faction leaders each demand the characters' loyalty. Now, the characters must decide which factions are their allies, and which are their enemies. Eventually, the unraveling situation may require the characters to act directly against one or more of the factions, who respond with counterstrikes of their own. In turn, the characters may launch major assaults against enemy factions to destroy their strongholds, defeat their leaders, and drive them out of Drakkenheim. As the conflict reaches its zenith, the surviving factions set their master plans into motion, requiring an expedition into Castle Drakken. There, a final showdown will decide the fate of Drakkenheim.</p>"

Not every combat encounter is fairly\n  balanced in a level-appropriate manner. Deadly threats lurk down every street,\n  and many scenarios intentionally stack the odds against the player characters.\n  They must use cunning, ingenuity, and teamwork to survive and seek the aid of\n  the factions to accomplish their most important goals.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Character Death</h2>\n<p>\n  Characters looking to revive a slain companion have limited options. Few\n  non-player characters are capable of casting the necessary spells, and the\n  expensive material components are rare. Prominent members of the Silver Order\n  and the Followers of the Falling Fire can cast\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz] and other\n  higher level spells. Consult the Faction Boons section in chapter 3 regarding\n  each respective faction for details on what each faction requires. Characters\n  might also seek out the druid of the Shrine of Morrigan (see chapter 6).\n  Finally,\n  <em>spell scrolls of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]</em>,\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz], and\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO] may be found as treasure\n  in various locations in the city, usually the chapels and cathedrals. At your\n  option, the characters may find another scroll elsewhere in the ruins.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Regardless, the players may need to create a replacement character, or play\n  one temporarily. A player may easily create a new arrival to Emberwood Village\n  to replace a slain character, or perhaps be encountered as the lone survivor\n  of another adventuring party. Alternatively, they might play a faction member\n  assigned to the party as a reinforcement.\n</p>\n\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n    <p>\n      “My best tip for staying alive in Drakkenheim is to just kill everything\n      that moves.

Each dossier is broken down into the\n    following sections:\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Background</h2>\n  <p>\n    This details a brief history of each faction and its recent activities in\n    Drakkenheim.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Objectives</h2>\n  <p>\n    These describe the faction's major goals in Drakkenheim. Most concern two\n    core conflicts that define the campaign:\n    <em>Who should control Drakkenheim? What should be done about delerium?</em>\n    Conflict is inevitable because every faction desires very different outcomes\n    with regard to these questions. All wish to control the ruins and decide how\n    delerium will be used (or destroyed). In addition, some factions have\n    additional objectives which may directly oppose those of a rival faction.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Each faction's <strong>Roleplaying Characteristics</strong> resonate\n    strongly with their <strong>Objectives</strong>. However, a faction may\n    tolerate setting aside or even adjusting its objectives if it perceives a\n    chance for greater gain in the future; if acting on its objectives would\n    incite overwhelming retribution from political forces beyond Drakkenheim; or\n    if circumstances emerge where achieving its objectives would contradict the\n    faction's own ideals. In such a situation, a faction might even modify its\n    objectives. Player characters might create alliances or expose weaknesses in\n    the factions by taking advantage of this fact.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Key Figures</h2>\n  <p>\n    Each faction has two major NPCs: the faction leader and their lieutenant(s).\n    The stat blocks for these characters are detailed in\n    <strong>Appendix B</strong>, and their roleplay traits are provided here.\n    Use these NPCs as the player characters' primary points-of-contact during\n    faction interactions such as:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Briefing or hiring the characters for a mission,</li>\n    <li>Meetings and diplomatic negotiations,</li>\n    <li>Sharing information, advice, and creating mutual plans,</li>\n    <li>\n      Offering rewards or resources to the player characters on behalf of the\n      faction.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>Faction Leader</h3>\n  <p>\n    A formidable legendary non-player character commands each faction. These\n    faction leaders issue orders to faction agents, direct faction resources,\n    and make the final decision on how the faction acts in all matters. Each has\n    their own individual Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws, and\n    perhaps a few dark secrets too! As conflict in Drakkenheim escalates, the\n    player characters should interact with the faction leaders often, and might\n    even bring several faction leaders together for negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The faction leaders spend most of their time coordinating strategy and\n    logistics within their faction stronghold. They are the organizational\n    lynchpin for their entire faction, and rarely take to the field. A faction\n    leader should only personally venture into Drakkenheim for a major gathering\n    or offensive involving the cathedral, Castle Drakken, or a faction\n    stronghold. The risk to the faction is simply too great to risk their lives\n    in the field otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If a faction leader is slain or permanently incapacitated, the faction must\n    withdraw from Drakkenheim shortly thereafter unless there is someone else to\n    take up their mantle. Surviving faction agents may seek immediate\n    retribution, but the death of a faction leader seals their defeat in\n    Drakkenheim for the foreseeable future.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Under the right circumstances, a player character who demonstrates\n    unwavering belief in the faction and great leadership could rise through the\n    ranks and replace a faction leader.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Faction Lieutenant</h3>\n  <p>\n    The faction lieutenant is the right-hand of the faction leader. As such, the\n    lieutenant is usually the first point of contact the player characters have\n    with a faction, and most can be encountered in Emberwood Village. Once the\n    lieutenant is confident the players are capable and trustworthy\n    collaborators, they'll facilitate an introduction with the faction leader.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Many lieutenants also lead elite faction strike teams. If the lieutenant is\n    slain, the faction leader will appoint another faction member as a\n    replacement.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Supporting Characters</h3>\n  <p>\n    Each faction has numerous rank-and-file members, support staff,\n    craftspeople, recruits, and other followers. Use these lists to generate\n    quick NPCs who might be guarding a stronghold, relaying a message,\n    maintaining the supply lines, or fighting alongside (or against!) the player\n    characters. You can add additional NPCs to the factions if you wish, but be\n    careful when adding high-level NPCs or spellcasters capable of casting\n    spells above 3rd level. The factions have specific and limited access to\n    high-level magic. Powerful NPCs are meant to be rare so the player\n    characters may rise to a position of importance and prominence during the\n    campaign.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Strongholds</h2>\n  <p>\n    Most factions have several holdings in Drakkenheim, but one major location\n    is the faction stronghold. Full details on each faction stronghold are\n    described in chapter 8. This is where most faction members reside and where\n    many faction resources are kept. If a faction loses its stronghold, the\n    rank-and-file members are routed and the power of the faction is broken. If\n    the faction leader survives, they may still be able to muster together a few\n    remaining diehard agents to cause a few more complications for the player\n    characters, but the faction teeters on the brink of defeat.\n  </p>\n\n  <article>\n    <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n      <p>\n        “As useful as magicians and wizards can be when organized, you should\n        always have a bag of tricks... for sale of course.”\n      </p>\n      <cite>— Pluto Jackson</cite>\n    </blockquote>\n  </article>\n\n  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Missions</h2>\n  <p>\n    The faction leader or faction lieutenant may present these missions to the\n    player characters, which further the faction's objectives. The missions are\n    presented in a rough progression: those presented first may lead to later\n    ones. Characters who complete these missions gain greater respect and trust\n    from the faction, and are rewarded with faction boons (described below). In\n    addition, when the player characters complete a faction mission they recieve\n    experience points based on the advancement method you are using (as\n    described in\n    <em>Character Advancement</em> in chapter 2).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Many missions are directly tied to the\n    <strong>City Locations</strong> described in chapters 6 and 7. In such\n    cases, further details for running that mission are found in the “Adventure\n    Hooks” section of the location entry. Other missions are open-ended\n    adventure seeds to spur interactions with other factions. Nevertheless, you\n    should feel free to invent additional missions for the factions based on the\n    player characters' choices. Especially when the factions clash against each\n    other, the player characters themselves collaborate with their faction\n    allies to devise their own missions and specific goals.\n  </p>\n\n  <aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n        <h2>Roleplaying Characteristics</h2>\n        <p>\n          Much like a player character, every faction has Personality Traits,\n          Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. Rather than qualities of any individual\n          person, these describe ideological beliefs shared by all faction\n          members. Use these characteristics to guide roleplaying interactions\n          with faction agents, determine the way the faction behaves, and judge\n          how their leaders might react to changing circumstances or unexpected\n          events.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Faction NPCs often possess these characteristics, but may have their\n          own personal interpretations. However, a faction that betrays its\n          ideals or bonds has betrayed its own members. When a faction\n          repeatedly fails to uphold its own ideals and bonds, its agents might\n          start deserting Drakkenheim or refuse to comply when called to action.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </aside>\n\n  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Boons</h2>\n  <p>\n    Every faction possesses valuable resources and knowledge they use to advance\n    their agenda, including equipment, information, magic items, mounts,\n    spellcasting services, and more. These are represented by faction boons,\n    which may be awarded to the player characters for completing faction\n    missions, but also offered to player characters\n    <em>before</em> a mission to help them complete it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    These boons are presented in a roughly escalating order: latter boons should\n    only be offered later in the campaign to characters who have demonstrated\n    their commitment to the faction. Unless otherwise indicated, a faction can\n    only offer each boon once. Beyond this, how often you reward characters with\n    a faction boon is up to you.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Other Resources</h3>\n  <p>\n    The factions' exact assets and wealth are intentionally abstract so you may\n    exercise your judgement and decide what's appropriate given the\n    circumstances. Regardless, the factions do not have infinite resources.\n    Every faction is stretched thin, and must cope with severe limits and\n    constraints on their finances, personnel, materials, equipment, and time.\n    The nearest large city is several weeks' travel away and the surrounding\n    villages have been abandoned. More troops require exponentially more\n    supplies since there are so few uncontaminated food and water sources. For\n    many of the factions, simply maintaining the ground they currently hold\n    requires everything they've got.\n    <strong>This is why the factions need the player characters to help them</strong>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The characters may occasionally demand more from the factions, citing dire\n    need or urgent circumstances. If the characters push hard for more resources\n    and appeal to the factions' ideals, objectives, and bonds, you might grant\n    them an additional boon for that mission. However, the next time the\n    characters need help from the faction or would receive a boon, the faction\n    can't offer them anything as they are recuperating their stockpile!\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Strike Teams</h2>\n  <p>\n    While the factions seek assistance from the player characters, they aren't\n    without their own agents. When they must dispatch their own warriors\n    directly into the ruins, they send a <strong>Strike Team</strong>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    An allied faction might send strike teams as reinforcements to help the\n    player characters on a critical mission. Consequently, an enemy faction can\n    dispatch a strike team against the player characters to disrupt missions,\n    capture them, or even assassinate them. Each faction keeps tabs on the\n    player characters, and might even send a strike team to interfere during a\n    mission that wouldn't otherwise involve them just to sabotage the\n    characters' efforts. More ruthless factions might take the fight directly to\n    the characters' doorsteps, hitting them while they are retreating,\n    recuperating, or simply unprepared for battle. Especially devious GMs may\n    opt to have faction strike teams operate behind-the-scenes by carrying out\n    attacks while the player characters are occupied elsewhere!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Mustering Forces. </em></strong>Any faction can call up a strike\n    team within a few hour's notice. However, mustering up larger forces for\n    major offensives takes time. When a faction needs to assemble multiple teams\n    at once to perform a specific task, it takes at least one day per strike\n    team involved. This can give characters the chance to notice something big\n    is being planned.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Reinforcements. </em></strong>The factions regularly bring in\n    reinforcements and new recruits. However, increasing casualties amongst the\n    rank-and-file devastate morale within all the factions, and it's a problem\n    when its more elite strike teams are captured, defeated, or killed. When a\n    faction strike team is destroyed, it takes roughly five days for the faction\n    to assemble a replacement team. Under desperate circumstances, a faction can\n    put together another group immediately. Should this group also be taken out,\n    it takes ten days to draw up further replacements thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Retribution. </em></strong>Faction leaders often investigate\n    when their agents go missing. Each faction possesses a web of informants,\n    scouts, and spies, and can possibly use magical means to find out what\n    happened. Unless an active effort is made to conceal what occurred, most\n    factions can discover the fate of their agents within seven days and\n    possibly even determine who was responsible. Skirmishes between adventurers\n    and low-level faction agents are relatively common in the ruins, so such\n    events may not incite immediate retribution, but rather careful observation.\n    If the situation continues to escalate, the faction responds.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Major Offensives. </em></strong>Every faction knows that sending\n    large numbers of soldiers into Drakkenheim is a foolish risk: several\n    attempts have been made by much larger forces and failed. The biggest issue\n    is contamination: there simply aren't enough spellcasters and materials to\n    remove it quickly enough. Generally speaking, the factions will only\n    consider launching major offensives if it means taking the cathedral, Castle\n    Drakken, or another faction stronghold.\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"text-center\">\n    <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0076_BOOK_Queen's_Men_Thug_CMYK.webp\" style=\"max-width:400px\" alt=\"Queen's Men Thug\" />\n  </div>\n\n  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Schemes</h2>\n  <p>\n    Should your player characters become enemies with one of the factions, the\n    factions enact these dastardly plots against them. These schemes are\n    presented in escalating hostility; latter schemes are only used in dire\n    conflict. Set one of these schemes into motion the next time the player\n    characters venture into the ruins. If the players manage to foil the\n    faction's schemes, the defeated faction will need at least a week before\n    they can muster up another. On the other hand, the factions don't do things\n    “just to get revenge”. They instead consider their long-term goals first.\n    They retreat, regroup, and find a way to attack from a position of strength.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    You can invent your own schemes. Try using a strike team in a creative or\n    unexpected way, or consider the personal capabilities of each faction\n    leader, especially the spells, magic items, and unique knowledge at their\n    disposal. Don't be afraid to turn the player characters' own motivations,\n    goals, and flaws against them!\n  </p>\n\n  <br /><br />\n  <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0077_BOOK_Bounty_Hunt_CMYK_CUT.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n\n  <h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Faction Reputation</h2>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Champions. </em></strong>The player characters have demonstrated\n    themselves to be staunch supporters of the faction's cause. They've\n    successfully completed multiple missions for the faction that prove their\n    loyalty, including a mission where they acted <em>directly</em> against\n    another faction. The faction offers the characters complete access to their\n    resources, support, and information. The characters receive faction boons to\n    help them complete missions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Allies. </em></strong>The party and the faction are working\n    together to advance their mutual goals, but they have some minor differences\n    and disagreements. Characters might be working with multiple factions in\n    this manner. The characters have helped the faction in several ways by\n    completing a few missions, and proven themselves reliable and capable. The\n    faction rewards characters with boons after they complete these missions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Indifferent. </em></strong>They are neutral. Perhaps they aren't\n    known to each other yet. The faction is willing to hire the party on a\n    freelance basis to help fulfil their objectives — especially ones that\n    require arm's-length interaction (such as working against another faction),\n    but the faction doesn't trust the players yet. They may have had some rough\n    interactions with low-level faction members, so the faction won't offer the\n    players resources, support, or information beyond what is required to fulfil\n    any missions they hire them to do. The faction might offer to trade for\n    services and pay the characters in gold rather than grant them boons.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Adversaries. </em></strong>There isn't any trust here. The\n    players show disregard for the faction's objectives. Minor skirmishes may\n    have broken out with low-level faction members. The faction won't let the\n    players use their resources or help. If the players want to repair the\n    relationship, the faction offers the players a chance to complete a mission\n    to demonstrate their commitment, possibly by striking directly at a rival\n    faction. The faction occasionally sends strike teams to impede the party,\n    disrupt their goals, and dissuade them from entering the city. However,\n    these teams don't try to kill the characters. If violence breaks out, these\n    strike teams either knock the characters out to try to capture them,\n    deescalate, or flee.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Enemies.</em></strong> The characters have betrayed the\n    faction's trust, murdered its members, <em>and</em> are working against the\n    faction's most important goals in a profound way. The faction actively tries\n    to thwart the characters using its schemes, and sends its deadly strike\n    teams against the the characters.\n  </p>\n</article>"

We shall use it to create unfathomable magical wonders on a scale hitherto undreamt of, for the betterment and protection of all people. Only the Amethyst Academy has the knowledge to accomplish such a feat, and the wisdom to temper the wild and destructive potential of this volatile resource.”</p>\n        <cite>- Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver</cite>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n\n<p class=\"dropcap\">The Amethyst Academy is a research institute, educational organization, and mage guild pursuing the arcane mysteries of delerium. The faction is small and outwardly aloof, yet subtly influential and tremendously wealthy. They are led by a shadowy directorate of powerful archmages who dispatched Archwizard @UUID[Actor.IFRQ1jK41KOQNjGl] to oversee their operations in Drakkenheim. Most of its members are potent arcane spellcasters with access to rare magical resources, but only a handful of agents are active in Drakkenheim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Background</h2>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy began as a secret school for young sorcerers during a time when arcane magic faced extreme persecution from the clergy of the Sacred Flame. The mages located children who manifested magical talents, rescued them from their fearful and paranoid communities, and educated them in hidden strongholds and far-away castles so they might wield their abilities with trained and refined control. The secret school gradually grew into a secret society in its own right.</p>\n\n<img style=\"transform:scaleX(-1);float:right;max-width:400px;shape-margin:10px;shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0029_BOOK_Eldrick_Runeweaver_CMYK.webp&quot;)\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0029_BOOK_Eldrick_Runeweaver_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"Eldrick Runeweaver\" />\n\n<p>Sequestered in unseen universities to hide from the mage-slaying Knights of the Silver Order, the mages pooled their knowledge. They conducted research into arcane and cosmological phenomena, and developed the modern practice of wizardry. Over time, the Amethyst Academy secured allies amongst the nobility by providing them clandestine magical services and occult counsel, crafting enchanted heirlooms, protecting their castles with arcane wards, and teaching their heirs magic.</p>\n<p>\n  When these schemes were discovered by the Faith of the Sacred Flame, a renewed series of brutal inquisitions and vengeful witch-hunts began. What had been a shadow conflict between paladins and sorcerers for centuries spilled into outright war between noble houses who championed the Faith, and those that supported the Amethyst Academy. These conflicts ended with the\n  <strong>Edicts of Lumen</strong> (detailed in <strong>Appendix E</strong>). Enacted three hundred years ago, this landmark treaty stopped the murderous suppression of arcane magic by the religious ministry, and established a new balance of power between mages, the Faith, and the nobility throughout the continent.\n</p>\n<p>The Edicts of Lumen bestow extensive protections, full autonomy, and economic advantages to the Amethyst Academy, but also require the Academy to observe strict standards of mercantile neutrality and political non-intervention. Most importantly, it grants the Amethyst Academy guardianship of any child who demonstrates magical aptitude until they come of age and master their abilities. In exchange, the agreement stipulates that all arcane spellcasters are disinherited from any land, rank, or titles, including the scions of noble and royal families. Since the Edicts, Academy mages may work magic without fear of oppression from church or state, though the organization remains withdrawn as it increasingly turns its attention to global affairs and extraplanar happenings. However, the direction and focus of the Amethyst Academy has dramatically shifted following the destruction of Drakkenheim, when their greatest stronghold was cut off from them.</p>\n<p>While the Amethyst Academy outwardly upholds the Edicts of Lumen, in recent years some have claimed the mages furtively flaunt its restrictions and disregard the terms that forbid dark magical practices. Others suspect the mages are weaving an arcane conspiracy to control commerce and influence politics while shielding themselves from the wrath of the Faithful.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Attire</h2>\n<p>Agents typically wear purple robes, cloaks, or hoods.</p>\n<h3>Academy Rings</h3>\n<p>Members of the Amethyst Academy each wear a set of rings made from exotic arcane metals. The number of rings worn corresponds to the highest level spell they can cast. Known as <em>academy rings</em>, these are magic items that identify them as an Academy graduate, and often permit access to Academy strongholds. A set of five or more functions as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.9cIlRtKDtDXQtElf], and some allow control over a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.z85EsGS2GVWj46qE]. However, each set is made for a specific individual, and only that person may attune to that set of academy rings.</p>\n\n<article>\n  <aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n        <h2>Roleplaying Characteristics</h2>\n        <p>\n          <strong><em>Symbol. </em></strong>A lidless arcane eye set within an octagram.

Indeed, one of their most important objectives is reclaiming the Inscrutable Tower, so it can be used for such purposes!</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Emberwood Accommodations. </strong></em>For the time being, most Academy members simply make use of local accommodations: Eldrick and @UUID[Actor.1p6ksQrMvxCBPkga] have booked a permanent suite in the Red Lion Hotel. However, the Amethyst Academy has secretly created a permanent @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW] in the cellar beneath the abandoned Eventide Manor in Emberwood Village. Academy agents come and go from the cellar using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]spells.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Distant Fortresses. </em></strong>Far away from Drakkenheim, the Amethyst Academy has many great fortresses, libraries, and universities. Most notable are the Enigma Ziggurat in the Free City of Liberio, and Paradox Castle in the distant Eastern Vale. Both have well-guarded @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{Teleportation Circles}, and Academy agents working in Drakkenheim usually teleport back and forth between these strongholds and the secret circle in Emberwood Village. The sigil sequences of these teleportation circles is a closely guarded secret known only to Academy mages who can cast 5th level spells.\n</p>\n\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n    <p>“The Academy proves to be mysterious and secretive at every turn, but I know not to ask too many questions if I want to bring home the bacon. I'd be a fool to bite the hand that feedssme.”</p>\n    <cite>— Veo Sjena</cite>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Objectives</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Collect and Study Delerium</h2>\n<p>Far away from Drakkenheim in secret laboratories, Amethyst Academy wizards relentlessly research delerium samples recovered from the ruins. Their brilliant minds have crafted potent arcane artefacts and invented mighty new spells powered by the vast energies contained within the crystals. Though the true origin of delerium remains unknown to them, many Academy assets are now dedicated to the study and refinement of delerium. They procure enormous quantities to fuel their esoteric experiments and eldritch industries. Rather than risk their own members' lives in the ruins of Drakkenheim, the Academy usually obtains delerium through various grey market sources, typically by hiring adventurers.</p>\n\n<p>The mages do not disregard the dangers presented by delerium's contaminating properties. In fact, it is precisely because of these hazards that the mages believe only they can use the crystals responsibly. Thus, the Academy seeks complete control over this critical resource both to protect the wider world and to secure their magical hegemony for the foreseeable future. However, other factions are now moving to reclaim Drakkenheim and potentially install a new ruling dynasty. Such political upheavals could affect the Academy's ability to research and harvest delerium.The Academy does not want a ruler who will destroy delerium, force the Academy to pay exorbitant sums to obtain it, or impose conditions on how the Academy may use the crystals.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Academy has zero interest in seeing Drakkenheim restored and rebuilt, and view this as a folly doomed to fail. Rather, they have an ambitious plan to transform the city ruins into a quarry for their research and industry. Once they fulfil their other goals, the Amethyst Academy wants the other factions to totally abandon Drakkenheim so they can have sole control over the ruins.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Reclaim the Inscrutable Tower</h2>\n<p>Drakkenheim was home to one of the Amethyst Academy's most important strongholds: the Inscrutable Tower. This immense structure houses vast repositories of magical lore, incomplete magical experiments, hidden vaults containing unspeakable extraplanar entities, and powerful magic items sheltered from the world at large — all rendered completely inaccessible to the Academy since the meteor fell. The Deep Haze has settled within the tower, scrambling the Academy's own arcane wards and foiling every attempt to enter or observe the Tower using teleportation or divination magic.</p>\n<p>The mages have already expended considerable effort attempting to retake the Tower on their own. These attempts catastrophically failed. The pragmatic wizards cannot afford to exhaust the Academy's resources in such a fruitless manner any longer, so now they turn to research and patient methods to advance their goals in Drakkenheim. They seek a suitably talented, trustworthy, and expendable adventuring party to conduct survey and recovery missions into the Inscrutable Tower. If the Tower were to be secured and repaired, the Amethyst Academy would have the ideal staging ground to begin the mass industrial exploitation of delerium, and would be able to bring its full resources to bear in Drakkenheim.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;width:85%;margin:0 auto\">\n  <img style=\"transform:rotate(30deg);shape-margin:10px;shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0078_BOOK_Inscrutable_Staff_CMYK.webp&quot;)\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0078_BOOK_Inscrutable_Staff_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"Inscrutable Staff\" />\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Obtain the Inscrutable Staff</h2>\n<p>Many talented mages were lost or killed by the meteor strike — including the former Archmage of Drakkenheim, Adriana Modiera. Her position on the Archmage's Directorate has remained vacant ever since. The Academy desperately wishes to discover her ultimate fate, recover her research, and obtain the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.InsT000000000017], the symbol of office for the Archmage of Drakkenheim, which is also one of the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>. Traditionally, the Archmage of Drakkenheim acts as an advisor on the royal council, so possessing this @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.InsT000000000017] ensures the Amethyst Academy maintains their influence in the political destiny of Westemär.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Key Figures</h1>\n<p>Archwizard @UUID[Actor.IFRQ1jK41KOQNjGl] heads up the Amethyst</p>\n<p>Academy operations in Drakkenheim and serves as the faction leader. The tiefling mage @UUID[Actor.1p6ksQrMvxCBPkga] works alongside him as lieutenant.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.IFRQ1jK41KOQNjGl] serves as the acting Archmage of Drakkenheim within the Academy Directorate, but this is a provisional position. He will not be confirmed to a lifetime appointment until he successfully secures the Inscrutable Tower. He is accountable to the Academy Directorate, but only reveals his true position to close collaborators. Although he does not lead the Amethyst Academy as a whole, his death or defeat would cause the Directorate to seriously reevaluate their position in Drakkenheim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Eldrick Runeweaver</h2>\n<p>One of the finest professors in the Amethyst Academy, @UUID[Actor.IFRQ1jK41KOQNjGl] has personally instructed a generation of talented arcane spellcasters. He is the foremost living expert on abjuration magic, but is also highly regarded within the Academy as a dedicated administrator and calculating leader. If Eldrick Runeweaver successfully retakes the Inscrutable Tower, he will likely take up the vacant spot in the Academy Directorate and assume the mantle of Archmage of Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>Eldrick Runeweaver is a towering and broad-shouldered man in his mid-sixties. His amber eyes glow softly behind his circular glasses, and he has a square-cut, greying black beard. He wears nine rings of silver, gold, and electrum: one on each finger except his left thumb. He wears flowing purple garb with golden embroidery, and carries an obsidian staff tipped with a delerium crystal.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I carefully calculate my every action, and I speak using a few well-chosen words.

He most often communicates via @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uAwtVZkiSTyP6ORB], and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ePhRKHXRE7l1sEoQ] spells, or by sending his @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jccbeBIfLrqEZnDP] instead. Eldrick always has a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.4smlOvpF5AQHcyg1] spell in place, and has a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.h830iyqParFleNqR] kept in a distant stronghold with extra equipment should the unthinkable occur.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Eldrick's Simulacrum.</em></strong> This special simulacrum uses the game statistics for an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6].\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Eldrick's Spellbooks.</em></strong> Eldrick keeps many spellbooks in secret places, which contain every spell on the Wizard spell list except @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz] (knowledge of this spell is restricted to the Academy Directorate).\n</p>\n\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0079_BOOK_River_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"River\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">River</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.1p6ksQrMvxCBPkga] is a tiefling mage. She is a short woman in her late twenties. Her attire is practical and professional: a hip-length purple jacket with a high collar, and belted at her waist are several pouches and pockets. She wears five rings on her right hand. Two oddly-shaped dark brown horns sprout backwards from her flowing blue hair, creating the impression of two boats at sea. River has spotted brown skin and impish features: her teeth are too sharp, her tongue too long, and it's slightly unsettling when she smiles.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I converse using precise academic terminology, but amongst those I trust as competent and capable, I inject a wry and sardonic sense of humor.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ideal.</strong> I like people who are professional, deliver results, and don't ask questions.

She wears a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.9cIlRtKDtDXQtElf] that also acts as her shield guardian control amulet. Only River can attune to this ring. She also carries 2d6 uncommon <em>spell scrolls</em> or <em>potions</em>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Academy Mages</h2>\n<p>A handful of other @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE] lead survey teams in the ruins.

(See chapter 6)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Exclusive Contract.</em></strong> Secure the cooperation of the Ironhelm dwarves prospecting in the Scar. (See chapter 6)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Stolen Homework.</strong></em> Steal the research and findings of malfeasant wizard @UUID[Actor.jfJGagVOoUgyCyxn] from his lair in Reed Manor. (See chapter 6)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Recover an Eldritch Lily.</em></strong> If the Amethyst Academy learns about the formula for @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.AquT000000000001], they'll dispatch characters to gather samples from Queen's Park. (See chapter 7)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Broker an Alliance.</strong></em> The Amethyst Academy asks characters to broker a truce with either the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe], the Hooded Lanterns, or possibly, the Followers of the Falling Fire so they can secure their supply of delerium and access to the ruins.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Plight of the Pale Man.</strong></em> Slay the @UUID[Actor.uMQvgbPhxlHLl1vG] and acquire his spellbooks.

(See chapter 10)\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Boons</h1>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Arcane Supplies.</em></strong> The Amethyst Academy gives each character one uncommon <em>potion</em> or <em>spell scroll</em> (of a spell from the Wizard spell list) of their choice when they begin a mission that directly advances the Academy's goals. Higher-level characters with proven reputations may be offered items of rare or very rare quality instead.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Arcane Spellcasting Services. </strong></em>@UUID[Actor.1p6ksQrMvxCBPkga] and Eldrick Runeweaver can offer their services as spellcasters to the characters as needed (they won't personally travel to the ruins, however).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Material Components.</em></strong> The Amethyst Academy can provide material components for spells of 5th level or lower, whose sum total value is no more than 500 gold pieces, prior to any mission.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Occult Lore. </em></strong>The Amethyst Academy is the foremost authority on magical lore and arcane phenomena. Their sages can answer questions about contemporary magic, magical creatures such as constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead, any spell or magic item in the Core Rules, and historical facts about the past five hundred years. If you feel the matter is something that might require some deeper research, it takes the Academy one week to unearth relevant information. The Academy uses its discretion when revealing details about sensitive topics — especially information about the meteor or delerium, and <em>never</em> reveals its own secrets or details about its internal politics to outsiders.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Elemental Summons.</em></strong> If the player characters have a reasonable need for reinforcements during a mission, the Amethyst Academy offers the characters an <em>elemental gem</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Magical Artifice. </em></strong>As a reward for completing an Academy mission, the mages offer the party one uncommon magic item of their choice, subject to GM approval. The Amethyst Academy grants this boon once per player character. Once each character has received an uncommon item, the Academy will begin granting them one rare item each, then one very rare item each, as appropriate for completing missions of commensurate importance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Guild Membership.</em></strong> A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard who can cast spells of 5th level or higher is offered guild membership in the Amethyst Academy. If they accept, they are given a purple\n  <em>robe of useful objects, </em>\n  a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.1taRIMF9w7jpnonN], and a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.9cIlRtKDtDXQtElf]. These items bear Academy iconography, and clearly identify the character as an Academy member when worn.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Library Gift. </em></strong>Characters instrumental to retaking the Inscrutable Tower who demonstrate a complete commitment to the Academy's ideals and goals are rewarded with their choice of a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.BjyTJn9oGvURWKJR], a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.2BYm8to5KldN8eYu], or a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.WnKWD1FuAFUE7f4v].\n</p>\n\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0080_BOOK_Living_Deep_Haze_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"Living Deep Haze\" />\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Stike Teams</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Summoned Spies</h2>\n<p>\n  The Amethyst Academy agents send summoned creatures and magical constructs into the ruins to gather information: either 7 ([[/r 2d6]])\n  <strong>mephits</strong>, 2 ([[/r 1d4]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.dLQiESMsfsXijD5c]{Imps}, or a single @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ZQTCZfTV9ZoTjNCU]. As magical communications are disrupted in the Haze, these creatures must survive and escape the city to report their findings, so they rarely engage in combat. These creatures often do not survive these missions, and some get lost and never return. Nevertheless, they're an essential tool for the Academy to have eyes and ears inside Drakkenheim.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Academy Survey Team</h2>\n<p>Though rare, a handful of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]{Mages} lead survey teams into the ruins to carry out field research. They are typically encountered conducting experiments, observing magical phenomena, facilitating communications between other Academy agents, and providing magical support as needed. However, if the situation in Drakkenheim escalates, these agents help by casting spells, orchestrating traps, and summoning creatures.</p>\n<p>A survey team is led by a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE] with a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.fkCNtbvPOMd7mipF]familiar and a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.z85EsGS2GVWj46qE] bodyguard.

They conduct their affairs like a business, and orchestrate events behind the scenes to turn out in their favour.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Magical Surveillance. </em></strong>If the player characters pose a threat to Amethyst Academy's goals, the mages begin using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20] spells to observe the characters when they are outside the Haze, and send summoned spies to tail them within the city. At first, their aim is to simply learn as much about the characters and their plans as possible, then use this knowledge to dispatch their own strike teams to disrupt the players. Eventually, they may begin using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.kSPRpeIx3w3nihrF] spells to interrupt their rests!\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Well-equipped Rivals.</em></strong> If the player characters do not work with them, the Amethyst Academy invests its resources in <strong>rival adventuring teams</strong> instead. In tandem with their magical surveillance, the Amethyst Academy sends these rival adventurers to sabotage the characters' missions. In many cases these rival adventurers are given a false premise and don't actually know disrupting the player characters is their primary purpose. The Amethyst Academy might even charge rival adventurers to accomplish one of the player characters' goals before they can do it (such as taking the Clocktower, recovering a <em>Relic of Saint Vitruvio</em>, finding a <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em>, or something important to a personal quest). They keep the item as a bargaining chip.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Shadow Assassins.</em></strong> Should the Amethyst Academy need to dispose of the characters entirely, they dispatch one @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.oDspGxRQFBhE74L2] per character to carry out the deed while the characters are sleeping. They use a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20] spell to confirm the characters are resting, and a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV] spell to move their agents into position nearby. If the characters are using magical means to protect themselves, such as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.NXWWWgHtWb7Nv21F] spell, they send one @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE] who casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.tEpDmYZNGc9f5OhJ] upon themselves and then casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8] to destroy the barrier.

The flickering stars cast within the Astral Void symbolize how the faithful see their place in the cosmos: points of light holding darkness at bay. Scripture tells how a shooting star inspired Saint Tarna to seek redemption before a pair of angels. The story of a blackguard-turned-paladin who founded the Faith itself established an important message within the religion: that from the deepest darkness may arise the brightest light.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.tqJK1mzxPst0xV08] was one such Flamekeeper who read omens in the night sky, and was regarded as one of the most learned and wise amongst the clergy. She channeled immense divine power, and invoked miracles that have not been witnessed in a generation. A decade before the meteor destroyed Drakkenheim, she beheld a vision of a falling star that would arrive on earth and signal a great upheaval for the faithful. Despite her reputation, her visions were dismissed as an apocalyptic fantasy and largely suppressed at the time.</p>\n<p>Her visions proved true; right down to the hour. However, even Lucretia Mathias did not expect the actual destruction the meteor would cause, nor did she anticipate it would annihilate her birthplace, Drakkenheim. She spent several years afterwards contemplating the heavens and several strange stones recovered from the city. Her conclusion was dire indeed: the world stands on the precipice of darkness unending. Yet within delerium, she saw the spark of salvation. Though the stones are the stuff of chaos, black charcoal and midnight oil may fuel a great flame. Perhaps if taken up by righteous souls, the crystals might become an earthly vessel for the Sacred Flame itself. Rather than fall to all-consuming shadows, Lucretia Mathias prophesied a New Age of Heroes that could meet the coming night. She spoke widely about her beliefs and discoveries, and her fiery sermons galvanized a throng of loyal supporters who proselytized her new creed across Elyria, Westemär, and Caspia. As her support grew, she resolved to make a pilgrimage to the Crater itself to confirm her revelations.</p>\n<p>\n  Meanwhile, the mainstream clergy reacted to delerium with disgust and horror. When Lucretia Mathias returned from her pilgrimage bearing a delerium crystal embedded in her own body, she was declared a heretic and excommunicated. However, she refused to be silenced. Escaping Elyria, she expanded her original writings and published them as the\n  <em>Testament of the Falling Fire</em>. This religious essay proclaimed a radical new doctrine for the faith, and called upon all devout believers to make pilgrimage to the Crater in Drakkenheim. Those who finish this arduous journey partake in a controversial rite known as the Sacrament of the Falling Fire.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Attire</h2>\n<p>The Followers of the Falling Fire give up most of their worldly possessions. Many are clad only in sackcloth jerkins or monastic robes, and often carry salvaged weapons adapted from everyday equipment and tools.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Strongholds</h2>\n<p>While the Falling Fire is now sending missionaries out all over the world, they have four important holdings in Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Hendrix Farm.</em></strong> Pilgrims camp out here in Emberwood Village before embarking on the last stage of their journey to the Crater.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Champion's Gate.</em></strong> Not a stronghold in any true sense, the pilgrims use Champion's Gate as a waypoint on their way to the Crater's edge or Saint Selina's Monastery.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Chapel of Saint Gresha.</em></strong> Located on the edge of the Crater, this is the place where Lucretia Mathias performs the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.q1NhS5cx7cp2vBMl] each day at dawn.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Saint Selina's Monastery.</em></strong> Located in the Deep Haze, this is the sanctuary for members of the Falling Fire who have completed their pilgrimage and taken the Sacrament.\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n  <img style=\"transform:rotate(-120deg)\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0045_BOOK_Delirium_Crystal_CMYK1.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<article>\n  <aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n        <h2>Roleplaying Characteristics</h2>\n        <p class=\"no-indent\"><strong>Symbol.</strong> A soaring comet.

Once they do, the Sacred Flame will set alight every righteous mortal heart, and a glorious new age of heroes shall begin. Until then, they must ensure many more can make the journey, and preserve the delerium, the sacred charcoal needed to enact their rituals. Thus, they wish to make Drakkenheim itself a holy site.</p>\n<p>Those who complete their pilgrimage to the Crater's edge participate in a ritual called the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.q1NhS5cx7cp2vBMl]. This controversial rite requires supplicants to impale a delerium fragment into their hearts. Those who survive the pilgrimage are spiritually transformed and physically empowered, rendered immune to contamination and able to survive in the Haze. Many who complete the pilgrimage suddenly discover they are able to tap into powerful spiritual energies, which they claim are the Sacred Flame. Thus many followers channel divine magic who had not before exhibited the necessary willpower to master such abilities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Spread and defend their new faith</h2>\n<p>The Followers of the Falling Fire seek to convert others to take up their cause and their beliefs, no matter their former lives. They believe members of the Hooded Lanterns and the Silver Order could be convinced to abandon their organizations to join the Followers of the Falling Fire.</p>\n<p>Should a new ruler of Westemär emerge, the Followers of the Falling Fire wish to convert this individual to their faith. Doing so will legitimize the Falling Fire politically, and make sure that they can continue their pilgrimages.</p>\n<p>At the same time, they must defend their faith. The Followers of the Falling Fire have been declared heretics and excommunicated by the clergy of the Sacred Flame, and must protect themselves from attacks (both physical and political) by the Knights of the Silver Order.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Claim the lost relics of Saint Vitruvio</h2>\n<p>Drakkenheim was home to many saints of the Sacred Flame: most notably, the heroic Saint Vitruvio, who fought astride the mighty gold dragon Argonath centuries ago. Both were buried beneath the cathedral that bears his name. Many relics of this mighty paladin are lost in Drakkenheim, such as Ignacious, the <em>Sword of Burning Truth</em>. If the Followers of the Falling Fire were to obtain these relics and resurrect the dragon it would significantly legitimize their beliefs to many laypeople.</p>\n<p>\n  They wish to reclaim these artefacts and reconsecrate the altar of the Sacred Flame in the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio. The\n  <em>Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio</em> is also one of the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>. Traditionally held by a Flamekeeper of the Sacred Flame, possessing it ensures the Followers of the Falling Fire gain influence over the political destiny of Drakkenheim and Westemär.\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Key Characters</h1>\n<p>The vast majority of the Followers of the Falling Fire are commoners, mere pilgrims seeking salvation in the ruined city. Many bring children, infirm, or sick family members seeking miraculous healing. Hundreds have arrived already, and thousands more are coming.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lucretia Mathias</h2>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias is a willowy and wizened woman with piercing eyes and pursed lips.

She has not yet found a true disciple who could take up her mantle after she passes, and she knows that her followers will need to rally behind a new leader when she is gone.\n</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Boons</h1>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Divine Spellcasting Services.</em></strong> Lucretia Mathias can offer her services as a spellcaster to the characters. She can help them recover via spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MOEmz9N0j0QPkKEE], @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.PurT000000000008], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk], and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.mgFqi0ev8f7Ut19y]. While characters must still provide any costly material components, she does not charge them to cast the spells.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Celestial Lore.</em></strong> Lucretia Mathias is an unparalleled expert on celestial phenomena, cosmology, religion, and divine magic. In addition, she possesses unique insight about delerium and the meteor, and has prescient divine visions. While she could conceivably answer questions about anything, she speaks in prophecy and mystery, and often encourages others to “seek the truth for themselves.” She's more likely to guide characters towards an answer than outright reveal it. For example, while Lucretia Mathias has personally ventured to the centre of the Crater and knows what lies there, she believes others must witness it firsthand. Furthermore, she has her own subjective point of view about events coloured by her faith, though she sincerely believes them to be true.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Prophecy.</em></strong> Lucretia Mathias can cast a wide range of divination spells, including @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.W4Qx5z0id6da0vqg], and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]. She will cast these spells to gain knowledge and insight about future events.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Revive the Fallen.</em></strong> Lucretia Mathias is willing to cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO], or even @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY] upon a faithful champion. She will use delerium as a material component for these spells, and so any character raised by her gains a form of indefinite madness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Sanctified by the Falling Fire.</em></strong> Characters who demonstrate full faith and devotion to the Falling Fire are invited to make a pilgrimage to the Crater's edge and partake in the Sacrament of the Falling Fire. This ritual imbues characters with powerful protection against the Haze, but has a serious cost.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Relics of the Faithful.</em></strong> As a reward for completing an important mission, the Followers of the Falling Fire will grant the party one magical rod, staff, or wondrous item from their reliquary. This will be an uncommon item for an Outer City mission, a rare item for the Inner City or a faction stronghold, or a very rare magic item for a successful mission to Castle Drakken or the cathedral. This boon can be granted multiple times, once for each character in the party. The Game Master can either choose the item, or allow the player to choose it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Testament of the Falling Fire.</em></strong> Lucretia Mathias allows characters to read one of her original manuscripts. These take the form of a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.2BYm8to5KldN8eYu], a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.WnKWD1FuAFUE7f4v], and a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.oN4Glcmi4BhdAI3k].\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:250px;margin:2em 0\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0070_BOOK_Incense_Brazier_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Sanctified by the Falling Fire</h2>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.q1NhS5cx7cp2vBMl] is a new spell described in <strong>Appendix D</strong> known only to Lucretia Mathias and Saint Gresha, who cast the spells each day at dawn and dusk respectively at the Chapel of Saint Gresha on the Crater's edge. A character who participates in the Sacrament of the Falling Fire gains the following traits, so long as they adhere to the tenets and faith of the Falling Fire:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>You gain advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and resistance to necrotic and radiant damage. You are immune to contamination.</li>\n  <li>If you die, your soul enters the delerium fragment embedded into your chest. You can't be raised from the dead while your soul is in the fragment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The embedded delerium fragment does not contaminate or otherwise harm a character who keeps their conviction.</p>\n<h3>Loss of Faith</h3>\n<p>A character who violates or loses their faith in the Falling Fire loses the protections of sanctification and the beneficial traits above. Instead, their body is directly exposed to the delerium in their chest and they immediately gain one level of contamination. Until the fragment is removed or they atone for their sins, their hit point maximum is reduced by 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) and they gain a level of delerium contamination each time they finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Sanctified Delerium</h3>\n<p>A delerium fragment filled with a sanctified soul glows with golden light. It becomes inert and immune to all damage except bludgeoning damage from magical weapons. Sanctified delerium possesses no other magical properties and is worthless for all arcane applications. A creature holding the fragment can telepathically communicate with the soul held within. If a sanctified fragment is destroyed, the soul inside is utterly annihilated, but the fragment can be used in a spell to return the dead soul within to life.</p>\n<h3>Removing the Fragment</h3>\n<p>The sacrament ritual fuses delerium to the body.

While it might\n          <em>seem</em> like she is speaking in metaphor, she is actually being quite literal. Lucretia Mathias has seen how the Haze will consume the world, but also knows that the spread of delerium through comets has continued for untold eons. She intends to break this cycle.\n        </p>\n        <p>“From the deepest darkness comes the brightest light.” is a core doctrine for the Sacred Flame, and Lucretia Mathias. believes the chaotic and destructive energies of the Haze and delerium can be re-made into a vessel for light and order. One must only plant the seed of righteousness within. Thus the purpose of the Sacrament of the Falling Fire is only realized when participants die and their souls are drawn into the delerium crystals in their chests. Lucretia Mathias believes that if enough of these sanctified stones are gathered by the time the world ends, a divine apotheosis will result in a new generation of harbingers of light and salvation, rather than chaos and doom. Whether or not this will actually happen is impossible to say. Since Drakkenheim is a world of distant and unknowable gods, there is no way to prove or disprove her claims. It is entirely a matter of faith.</p>\n\n        <img style=\"position:absolute;left:0;right:0;bottom:-60px;transform:rotate(60deg);margin:auto;z-index:51\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0045_BOOK_Delirium_Crystal_CMYK2.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </aside>\n</article>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Strike Teams</h1>\n<p>The Followers of the Falling Fire lack military training and possess few resources. What they do have, however, is great faith and determination. In battle, the Followers of the Falling Fire surge forward in a mob to engage in zealous combat. However, they staunchly defend one another and look out for their fellow believers. They have little regard for tactics or strategy, believing instead that their actions are guided by divine providence instead. They rarely retreat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Pilgrimage</h2>\n<p>A mob of 21 ([[/r 6d6]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners} led by a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1].

Her aim is to simply learn about the characters, their motivations, and actions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Compelling Plea.</em></strong> Lucretia Mathias uses her knowledge of the player characters to implore them to join the Followers of the Falling Fire. She uses information gleaned about the characters' ideals, bonds, and flaws to impress the importance of her own visions. She makes prophecies and delivers omens that the characters will not succeed without faith, and perhaps even exposes their vices, flaws, and past sins. However, in bringing up the characters' failures, secrets, and flaws, she offers them hope for atonement and absolution by joining her.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Salvation and Penitence.</em></strong> If the characters are in dire circumstances, Lucretia Mathias receives a vision of their plight and dispatches a Falling Fire strike team to rescue them.The strike team brings the characters back to Saint Selina's and offers them healing and help, but also takes their possessions and tries to forcefully convert them. They may even imprison the characters until they repent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Conversion.</em></strong> If the player characters have any family members or loved ones, the Followers of the Falling Fire seek them out and attempt to convert them. Alternatively, they convert members of the Queen's Men, Silver Order, or Sacred Flame to join them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Truth of the Crater.</em></strong> Lucretia Mathias invites the player characters to accompany her to the centre of the Crater so they can see for themselves the truth of what is to come. If they do not agree to join her, she incites the monsters therein to attack, relying on her own divine power to protect herself.\n</p>\n\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n    <p>“They may have strong faith and good intentions, but you've gotta be out to lunch if you're willing to stab delerium into your chest!”</p>\n    <cite>— Veo Sjena</cite>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>"

Each has ended in miserable failure, and the contaminated ruins have swallowed thousands of soldiers' lives. What remains of these assaults are merely twisted monsters and undead monstrosities formed from the risen corpses of these regiments. After these disastrous attempts, Drakkenheim was left abandoned while civil war ripped Westemär apart instead. These conflicts also ended in vain, with the royal line of House von Kessel undone by fratricide.</p>\n<p>Westemär is slowly disintegrating into a realm of squabbling fiefdoms, yet some amongst the fractured nobility hold a glimmer of hope in restoring the nation and rebuilding the capital. Three years ago, they marshaled up the remnants of the royal guard, the city watch, and patriotic veterans of the civil war to make one last-ditch attempt to retake the city. Although officially dubbed the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, this guerilla regiment was nicknamed after oil lamps carried by the old city watch: the Hooded Lanterns.</p>\n<p>The core members of the Hooded Lanterns are warriors fighting for their homeland. Few honest soldiers survived the civil war, so many veterans have a life of bloody deeds behind them already. On the other hand, new recruits are seldom old enough to have any strong memories of Drakkenheim before it was destroyed. As such, many possess naïve and idealistic notions honed into simmering rage and fury at a golden age stolen from them.</p>\n<p>Under the leadership of @UUID[Actor.L0yjx19PnmJgrqVk], the Hooded Lanterns have finally broken the losing streak of previous military operations. Rather than making an all-out assault on the ruins, they have taken a methodical approach. After spending nearly a year carefully scouting out the ruins, they began clearing out important fortifications in the city to use as staging grounds for future operations. This strategy has paid off: the Hooded Lanterns have managed to establish countless safehouses and supply caches within the city. They captured Shepherd's Gate and the Drakkenheim Garrison last year. However, in recent months their efforts have been stymied by sabotage enacted by the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe], and the emergence of a horrific garmyr warlord in the Inner City known as the @UUID[Actor.CF7PHcpwR43Z2LVS]. While the Hooded Lanterns have imposed the mantle of law-and-order in the city, these setbacks have revealed their actual authority is limited to their strength of arms. The regiment maintains only a fragile foothold in Drakkenheim, and their supply lines are now exceptionally difficult to maintain. It's taking almost everything the Hooded Lanterns have to hold their current position.</p>\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns are supported by surviving loyal vassals of the royal family who wish to see the old monarchy of Westemär restored. Many of these wealthy nobles lost estates, treasure vaults, family heirlooms, and personal documents when the city was destroyed, and expect the Hooded Lanterns to retrieve them. In return, these noble houses provide soldiers, material, and other supplies to the Hooded Lanterns on a periodic basis, but their financial resources are not inexhaustible. Indeed, the Hooded Lanterns have often resorted to selling delerium themselves to make ends meet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Attire</h2>\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns are a professional military unit. Every member uses standardized equipment: their uniform consists of a forest-green cloak with yellow trim, the traditional colours associated with the Drakkenheim coat-of-arms. They bear the Hooded Lanterns' symbol on their chest pieces, and shoulder stitches denote their rank and company. Scout units wear light armour, and often wield longswords, shortswords, and longbows. Guard units are equipped with chainmail, shields, spears, and crossbows. Each member also wears a metal chain with an inscribed plate bearing their name, hometown, and next of kin. Most Hooded Lanterns cut their hair when they sign up, but since many spend weeks at a time fighting, they end up a disheveled mess by the end of their assignments.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Strongholds</h2>\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns hold three key positions in Drakkenheim and its environs: the Emberwood Watchtower, Shepherd's Gate, and the Drakkenheim Garrison. They have converted the stockade beneath the garrison into a bunker insulated from the Haze. Beyond these key locations, the Hooded Lanterns have several minor bases in old cottages and watchtowers a few days outside the city where their soldiers rest and recuperate after being posted to the ruins.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<article>\n  <aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n        <h2>Roleplaying Characteristics</h2>\n        <p class=\"no-indent\">\n          <strong><em>Symbol.</em></strong> A hooded lantern held by a dragon's claw.\n        </p>\n        <h1 class=\"sidebar-h1 no-toc\">Personality Traits</h1>\n        <ul>\n          <li>We're not looking for glory or wealth, we're fighting for our home.

The rank-and-file soldiers fight a guerilla war to reclaim Drakkenheim street-by-street, slaying monsters, driving out outlaws, and arresting scavengers. @UUID[Actor.L0yjx19PnmJgrqVk] plans on establishing strongholds at key sites of strategic importance: the City Gates, Saint Selina's Monastery, Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral, the Clocktower, and eventually, Castle Drakken. Thus far, the Hooded Lanterns have only succeeded in taking Shepherd's Gate and the Drakkenheim Garrison.</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-frame\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:350px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0082_BOOK_TheMasteroftheForge_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"The Master of the Forge\" />\n  <label>The Master of the Forge</label>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Obtain the Seals of Drakkenheim</h2>\n<p>\n  The ruling council of Westemär wore enchanted badges of office attuned to the magical defenses and arcane wards that once protected Drakkenheim, and also served as the keys to Castle Drakken itself. Known as the\n  <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>, all are lost within the ruins save the Lord Commander's Badge, carried by Elias Drexel himself. Until all the seals are assembled, the city's magical defenses are subject to the chaotic whims of the Haze. The Hooded Lanterns are constantly searching the ruins for any sign or clue of the whereabouts of these items. Unfortunately, several are already in the hands of rival factions. See <strong>Appendix D</strong> for their game statistics.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Re-establish a rightful monarchy</h2>\n<p>Many Hooded Lanterns hope a legitimate heir to the throne still survives somehow. Others believe that even if House von Kessel is truly extinct, a new monarchy could be formed by a prominent noble house with some connection to the royal line. Both Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral and Castle Drakken are believed to contain archives detailing the line of succession, and magically preserved vials of royal blood that can be used in a special ritual to confirm legitimate royal ancestry. A potential claimant with access to these documents could galvanize the support needed to ascend to the throne. However, proof of royal ancestry alone is not enough - any claim is spurious at best without the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>, the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.CroT000000000022], and Castle Drakken. Even a true heir to House von Kessel will have immense difficulty holding the Realm of Westemär together without these keys to power.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Key Characters</h1>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.L0yjx19PnmJgrqVk] leads the Expeditionary Force as the Faction leader. He has two close confidants who interchangeably act as the faction lieutenant: Captain @UUID[Actor.zAumxn18Z0GTvBbL] and his sister, Lieutenant @UUID[Actor.Yry1g6heIrVxK7xN].</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>NOTE: </em></strong>The Hooded Lanterns use a formal military rank structure. Although Ansom and Petra are ranked as “captain” and “lieutenant”, this doesn't change their role as faction lieutenants for the purposes of their interactions with the player characters.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lord Commander Elias Drexel</h2>\n<p>Elias Drexel is a man in his early fifties. He is stocky and imposing with a furrowed brow and a grim frown on his wide and angular face. His harsh features are framed with a thick moustache, side chops, and a mane of long braided brown hair. He is garbed in chainmail armour with heavy leather gloves and boots, worn under a fur-lined dark green cloak and iron pauldrons. He wears a pinned brooch - the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.LorT000000000018], the symbol of his office. A quiver, a longbow, and two longswords are strung on his back.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I am blunt and direct, and expect my soldiers to obey my commands and deliver results promptly.I find no humor in anything.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ideal.</strong> Loyalty and trust are priceless. They must be carefully given, but staunchly held. There is nothing worse than betrayal and treason.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bond.</strong> During the Civil War, I switched sides and killed several scions of House von Kessel who could have claimed the throne. I once believed it was for the right cause, but now I feel personally responsible for breaking the royal line. My mission in Drakkenheim is penance and redemption.</li>\n  <li><strong>Flaw</strong>. I'm filled with rage and conflict because of my contradictory actions and beliefs, and I don't take defeat, setbacks, or even missteps lightly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elias Drexel was appointed to the office of Lord Commander before the fall of Drakkenheim, and was outside the city leading training drills when the meteor fell. Afterwards, he took part in three military expeditions to reclaim Drakkenheim, and saw firsthand their horrors. He then went on to fight in the Westemär Civil War alongside Mannfred von Kessel. However, the idea that his soldiers died for nothing in Drakkenheim festered in his mind, and made him doubt Mannfred's ability to be a good ruler. He secretly participated in a successful conspiracy to assassinate Mannfred von Kessel. Little did he know that shortly thereafter, tragedy would soon befall Cecilia von Kessel. He isn't exactly proud of his choice to betray Mannfred, and that causes him considerable guilt, regret, and internal self-loathing.</p>\n<h3>Command Staff</h3>\n<p>The Lord Commander has several important aides who assist with the day-to-day operations of the Hooded Lanterns' forces:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The Warden</strong> - a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO] who oversees the defenses and dungeons of the City Watch Barracks.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Quartermaster</strong> - a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.13K3XK2A3wwxVKLD] who attends to the supply cache.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Apothecary</strong> - a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.K15Yl8JmB5iPircc] who tends the wounded and manages their hospice.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Master of the Forge</strong> - a dwarf @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1].</li>\n  <li><strong>Paige</strong> - a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq] and personal attendant to the Lord Commander.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Petra Lang</h2>\n<p>Lieutenant @UUID[Actor.Yry1g6heIrVxK7xN] is a human @UUID[Actor.02VvEfOHseDs38Jm]. She is a fit and nimble teenager with long black hair, a narrow pointed chin, and bold features. She wears a hooded green cloak and light chain armour of the Hooded Lanterns with a lieutenant's insignia on her shoulder pauldron.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I see the value in those willing to risk their lives in the ruins. I have great insight and trust in my own judgement of character.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ideal.</strong> The right path is often the harder path, but it is always one worth walking.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bond.</strong> I was adopted by Elias Drexel, who raised and trained me. I don't want to let him down.</li>\n  <li><strong>Flaw.</strong> I am too open and trusting of people who claim to be on the same side as me, and I put a lot of weight in counting on people who I assume are able to handle themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Ansom Lang</h2>\n<p>Captain @UUID[Actor.zAumxn18Z0GTvBbL] is a human @UUID[Actor.02VvEfOHseDs38Jm]. He is an athletic teenager with long black hair and a short neat beard, angular jaw, and rugged features. He is garbed in a hooded green cloak and light chain armour of the Hooded Lanterns that prominently displays a captain's insignia on his shoulder.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I have been in Drakkenheim long enough to know not to trust anyone. I am extremely wary of adventurers, and anyone who might cause problems for the Lanterns.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ideal.</strong> I believe that if my sister and I work hard enough, with the right people, that maybe we can change things.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bond.</strong> Myself and Petra have had each other's backs since we were children. That will never change.</li>\n  <li><strong>Flaw.</strong> I find reasons to not like people, and find reasons to doubt the commitment of the people around me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Royal Bastards.</strong></em> @UUID[Actor.zAumxn18Z0GTvBbL]{Ansom} and @UUID[Actor.Yry1g6heIrVxK7xN] were adopted by Elias Drexel during the Civil War. At your option, you may determine they are secretly the illegitimate offspring of King Ulrich von Kessel IV and an unknown mother. This fact was concealed to prevent a scandal, and even Elias Drexel doesn't know it. A letter revealing this could be found in the Steward's Archive in Castle Drakken.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Company Roster</h2>\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns are organized into a regiment of five companies, making up a total force of approximately one thousand soldiers plus their support staff, orderlies, and crew. Each company is led by a captain and two lieutenants, and each has a distinct role:</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Scout Company</em></strong>. Intrepid infiltrators who undertake dangerous reconnaissance operations into the city centre. Led by Captain Raine Highlash.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Garrison Company.</em></strong> Protects the established holdings of the Hooded Lanterns such as the Watchtower, Shepherd's Gate, and the Drakkenheim Garrison. Led by Captain Jakob Slovak, the Garrison company operates at double strength, since these soldiers must be constantly rotated to prevent them from becoming contaminated while on duty.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Vanguard Company.</em></strong> These experienced shock troops carry out offensive operations against priority targets, led by Captain Ansom Lang.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Reserve Company.</em></strong> A reserve force maintained outside the city composed of new recruits and aging veterans charged with maintaining supply routes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Royal Guard.</em></strong> A special unit activated only if the Hooded Lanterns discover a royal heir. This small unit is composed of veterans hand-picked by the Lord Commander for trustworthiness and skill.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Hooded Lanterns Soldiers</h2>\n<p>Below are several NPCs to fill out the various Hooded Lanterns guards and scouts the player characters may encounter in Drakkenheim:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Chud Hopkins</strong> - A halfling scout who occasionally helps with patrols or watches, or works as a chef in the barracks kitchen.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sten Livingston</strong> - A human scout often positioned out in front of the City Watch Barracks as one of the head watchmen.</li>\n  <li><strong>Raine Highlash</strong> - A human @UUID[Actor.02VvEfOHseDs38Jm] who runs patrols around the Outer City.</li>\n  <li><strong>Jakob Slovak</strong> - A human @UUID[Actor.02VvEfOHseDs38Jm] of Shepherd's Gate.</li>\n  <li><strong>Luther Hess</strong> - A rotund guard, lazy and unwilling to do above the bare minimum.</li>\n  <li><strong>Alena Kruger</strong> - A calm human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.J8xjoG4Dxb8WkHtV] who prides herself in her observational skills.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tresa Metterling</strong> - An optimistic @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS] with a hopeful outlook for Drakkenheim.</li>\n  <li><strong>“Old” Symon Vasilisk</strong> - An aging human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS] who rarely leaves the barracks and is on his way to retirement.</li>\n  <li><strong>Rolf Wagner</strong> - A young man of noble birth, sent to the city on his father's behalf to fight for the Lanterns.</li>\n  <li><strong>Greta Braun</strong> - A young @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS] with aspirations of climbing the ranks of the Lanterns.</li>\n  <li><strong>Alycia Martell</strong> - Afraid of almost everything in Drakkenheim but determined to fight for her beliefs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Missions</h2>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Missing Lantern.</em></strong> Petra Lang went missing on a recent supply run. Her brother, Ansom, has resolved to rescue her from the Rat's Nest Tavern. (See chapter 6)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Potions Inspectors.</strong></em> The recent shipment of health potions from @UUID[Actor.jfJGagVOoUgyCyxn] never showed up. The Hooded Lanterns need someone to look into this matter and make sure Oscar is still upholding his end of their deal. (See chapter 6)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Dwarven Prospects.</em></strong> A group of intrepid dwarves has a delerium mining operation in the Smithy on the Scar, and have brought incredible equipment with them. The Hooded Lanterns want to make a deal with the dwarves to secure their equipment and a share of the delerium.

The Hooded Lanterns will need to secure the assistance of another faction to develop a means of dealing with the Haze: either the Amethyst Academy, the Followers of the Falling Fire, Knights of the Silver Order, or perhaps even the malfeasant wizards rumoured to dwell in the city. (See chapter 7)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Noble Backer.</em></strong> A wealthy noble who supports the Hooded Lanterns used to own the Kleinberg Estate.

This will be an uncommon magic weapon for an Outer City mission, a rare magic weapon for the Inner City or a faction stronghold, or a very rare magic weapon for a successful mission to Castle Drakken or the cathedral. The Hooded Lanterns will grant this boon once per player character.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Call for Aid.</em></strong> The Hooded Lanterns give the characters a flare gun and a horn that can be used as an action to summon emergency help. When used, help arrives 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) minutes later in the form of a randomly determined Hooded Lanterns strike team. Player characters who call for help recklessly or without appropriate need lose this boon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Intelligence Reports.</em></strong> No one knows the layout and the defenses of Drakkenheim better than the Hooded Lanterns. If asked, the Hooded Lanterns can provide detailed descriptions, directions, and information on the prominent structures in the city, maps of the city streets and public buildings, as well as information about the movements of known monster groups and other factions in Drakkenheim.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Urban Survival Training.</em></strong> Characters can spend one month training with veteran Hooded Lanterns soldiers to gain one of the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Ability Score Improvement.</strong> The character can increase one ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by 1 each.

Their combat doctrine emphasizes organized teamwork, scouting ahead, stealth ambushes, hit-and-run tactics, seizing elevated ground, and heavy use of ranged attacks and traps. Once engaged, squads communicate using whistles, code-signs, signal flares, and horn calls to execute complex and practiced maneuvers. While the Hooded Lanterns don't have access to much magic, they're prepared to fight spellcasters in battle. They know much about the monsters they fight on a regular basis, and they always confirm their kills. The Hooded Lanterns know the layout of the city streets well, and stash caches of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potions of Healing} and emergency supplies throughout the city.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Supply Convoys</h2>\n<p>These supply convoys are often encountered in Emberwood Village and the northwestern side of the Outer City, usually bound for one of the Hooded Lanterns' strongholds.

They step up patrols around the other gates to block characters from using them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Stalkers.</em></strong> A Hooded Lanterns strike team tails the characters as they move through the streets. They assault the characters after they are weakened by a difficult encounter and attempt to arrest them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Wanted!</em></strong> A series of wanted posters are put up around Emberwood Village with a reward for bringing the characters to justice. This draws the attention of Queen's Men bounty hunters as well as rival adventurers, and anyone else keen to make money to bring the characters to justice.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Deadly Ambush.</em></strong> The Hooded Lanterns set up extensive traps down a city street and lure the characters into a deadly ambush where two strike teams await on rooftops and in covered windows to surprise the characters. They attempt to encirclethe characters in a pincer maneuver.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Crown Authority.</em></strong> The Hooded Lanterns banish the characters from Emberwood Village: local merchants refuse to do business with the characters as a result, and the characters won't be allowed to stay at any of the inns or taverns.

As faithful devotees of the Sacred Flame, they believe delerium is a dangerous and contaminating blight. Led by the valiant @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO], the knights have been dispatched to eradicate the corruption at its very source.</p>\n\n<img style=\"float:right;max-width:350px;shape-margin:10px;shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0030_BOOK_Knight-Captain_Theodore_Marshal_CMYK.webp&quot;)\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0030_BOOK_Knight-Captain_Theodore_Marshal_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"Theodore Marshal\" />\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Background</h1>\n<p>The Silver Order was founded several centuries ago as a militant arm of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. These knights and paladins act by the decree of the Divine Matriarch to defend the faithful from demons and monsters, and are called up as witch-hunters when wayward mages dabble in forbidden arcana. Their holy missions transcend sovereign borders, but the order is headquartered in the Holy City of Lumen in Elyria.</p>\n<p>Paladins are revered figures in the Faith of the Sacred Flame, as the founder of the faith was herself a paladin. Though not every warrior in the Silver Order is a paladin, each strives to emulate Saint Tarna's valiant example. Though they usually operate as individual questing knights or in small warrior-companies, occasionally they are deployed as a regiment. Members of the Silver Order have been traditionally drawn from all peoples and all levels of society. Nobles and commoners are found within the Order, and one's station in life does not reflect one's position in the Order.</p>\n<p>In their role as witch-hunters and mage-slayers, the Silver Order was complicit in the persecution and oppression of arcane spellcasters. To this day, the issue remains a deep stain on the order's honor, as many observed that the injustices and persecution visited upon spellcasters stand in stark contrast against the tenets of the faith of the Sacred Flame, a faith that calls out for justice for the oppressed. Nevertheless, staunch supporters of the Silver Order argue that their deeds were indeed justified. Decisive action is necessary to defend the innocent and the faithful from wicked sorcerers who sought to dominate others with magical might, or cut down foul warlocks who spread wickedness through demonology and necromancy. The chronicle of the Silver Order records countless heroic missions that have prevented a dire threat from growing into a far greater crisis.</p>\n<p>The Silver Order answers to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, not to the command of any sovereign nation. However, the Order remains strongly connected to its roots, and most of its members hail from Elyria. Ever since the realm of Elyria came under the de facto rule of the religious ministry, the order has become increasingly entangled in state affairs. Their knights have been deployed on inquisitional crusades against heretics, heathens, and other political enemies of the Sacred Flame. The distinction between an “enemy of the Sacred Flame” and an “enemy of Elyria” is not entirely clear anymore. As such, some worry the Order's presence in Drakkenheim is an invasive ploy by Elyria to wrest control of Westemär, rather than a righteous expedition to purify the city of eldritch contamination.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Attire</h2>\n<p>As befits their name, the knights are clad in silver plate with gold filigree. They wear flowing tabards of white, prominently decorated with symbols of the Sacred Flame, rather than any individual heraldry. The Flamekeepers who accompany the knights wear religious vestments of white and gold.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Strongholds</h2>\n<p>The Knights of the Silver Order have built a military encampment known as Camp Dawn about two miles outside Drakkenheim, just on the outside edge of the Haze. Outside Drakkenheim, the Silver Order can often find shelter in any chapel or cathedral of the Sacred Flame, though not every Flamekeeper in Westemär now supports their mission. Their headquarters is the impregnable Vigilant Keep in the far city of Lumen in Elyria, where the Grandmaster oversees the entire order at the behest of the Divine Matriarch.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<article>\n  <aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n        <h2>Roleplaying Characteristics</h2>\n        <p class=\"no-indent\">\n          <strong><em>Symbol. </em></strong>A burning chalice upon a shield.

These chaotic seeds of evil magic must be wholly destroyed before they can take root. By her command, the Silver Order has come to cleanse Drakkenheim of this foul taint: even if it means burning the city to the ground. Furthermore, the knights have resolved to stop others from harvesting and using delerium, especially the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<p>The Silver Order insists that Drakkenheim - and by extension, the nation of Westemär - cannot be rebuilt until the threat of delerium is entirely eliminated. While the Silver Order does not intend to establish Elyrian rule over Westemär, they want to ensure any new ruler honors the Sacred Flame, commits to destroying delerium, and helps them dissolve the Followers of the Falling Fire.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Stamp out the heresy of the Falling Fire</h2>\n<p>The demagogue Lucretia Mathias has fractured the Faith of the Sacred Flame, and twisted its noble and pure religious teachings into the debased worship of a blasphemous and evil rock from the darkest depths of the outer void. Lucretia Mathias must be captured and brought back to Elyria to stand trial for her grave sins, where she may find repentance in a burning pyre. Her misguided followers must be driven from the city.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Preserve the holy relics in Drakkenheim</h2>\n<p>\n  Drakkenheim was home to many saints of the Sacred Flame: most notably, the heroic Saint Vitruvio, who fought astride the mighty gold dragon Argonath centuries ago. Both were buried beneath the cathedral that bears his name. Many relics of this mighty paladin are lost in Drakkenheim, such as @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.IgnT000000000023]. The Silver Order wishes to reclaim these artefacts and reconsecrate the altar of the Sacred Flame in the\n  <strong>Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio</strong>, so it may serve as a beacon of light from which the rest of the city may be purged.\n</p>\n<p>It is of vital importance to the Silver Order that these relics and places do not fall into the hands of the Followers of the Falling Fire, who they fear may use them for heretical purposes.</p>\n<p>One of the relics of Saint Vitruvio is also one of the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>: the <em>Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio</em>. Traditionally, this item is entrusted to the High Flamekeeper of Drakkenheim. If the Silver Order obtains it, they can ensure the Faith of the Sacred Flame has some influence over the political destiny of Drakkenheim and Westemär by demanding who is appointed the new High Flamekeeper.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Key Figures</h1>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.q4jRqiq5PgWcqvxD] is faction leader of the Silver Order in Drakkenheim.

High Flamekeeper @UUID[Actor.1IaDUyBM9G4EEphL] can offer her services as a spellcaster to the characters. She can help them recover via spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MOEmz9N0j0QPkKEE], @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.PurT000000000008], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl], and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]. While characters must still provide any costly material components, she does not charge them to cast the spells.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Religious Lore.</em></strong> The Faith of the Sacred Flame believes knowledge is a form of illumination, and keeps historical texts and religious lore. Flamekeepers can answer questions about religious practices, magical creatures such as celestials, fiends, and undead, historical facts about the past five hundred years, and mythological stories about events that happened up to one thousand years ago. If you feel the matter is something that might require some deeper research, it takes the Flamekeepers one week (or 2d6 days) to unearth relevant information.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Take to the Sky.</em></strong> The Silver Order grants the player characters access to their griffons and training on how to fly them. Each character gains a griffon mount. If this mount is killed it cannot be replaced.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Revive the Fallen.</strong></em> @UUID[Actor.1IaDUyBM9G4EEphL] will cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz] on a fallen player character of 9th level or higher who falls in battle fulfiling objectives of the Silver Order. They can provide the material components for the spell. The Silver Order will offer this boon once per player character. However, player characters of any level who are trusted by the Silver Order, provide the material component for @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz], and make an offering of 1,000 gold pieces to the Sacred Flame may also receive this boon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Teachings of the Faith.</em></strong> The Silver Order allows characters to read from relic holy books of the Sacred Flame. They present them with a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ykefWXBjq3y6y9Se], a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.WnKWD1FuAFUE7f4v], or a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.oN4Glcmi4BhdAI3k].\n</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Strike Teams</h1>\n<p>The Silver Order favours aggressive charges and defensive bastions, employing a “hammer and anvil” approach whether on the battlefield or in skirmishes. Their inspiring commanders drive their rank-and-file soldiers to greater acts of boldness and heroism, while the magical support of their clergy means they can tend the wounded and unravel evil magic levied against them. The Silver Order have superlative training in combating spellcasters and fiends, and know how to recognize the magic and tactics of such foes. They target spellcasters aggressively, and seek to break their concentration or end their spells using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8].</p>\n<p>Before a battle, the Silver Order draws up a straightforward battle plan, which they execute with discipline and focus. In all matters, they operate with honor. They will often reach out in parley before engaging, and even in battle they will often implore their foes to retreat or surrender once they seize the upper hand. On the contrary, members of the Silver Order expect no quarter themselves, and offer none to the wicked and unrepentant.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Questing Knight</h2>\n<p>A lone @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO] of the Silver Order often carries out missions accompanied by a personal retinue of 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS]{Guards}. This knight is often mounted on a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.T1xZTDCGuvMBSq8d]. Knights are occasionally accompanied by a smaller number of retainers who are also on horseback.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Silver Order Cavalry</h2>\n<p>This company of heroic knights consists of a group of 5 ([[/r 2d4]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knights} all mounted on @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.T1xZTDCGuvMBSq8d]{Warhorses}. Such units are mustered for offensive operations on when force is certainly expected.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Silver Order Infantry</h2>\n<p>The knightly retainers sometimes form large infantry units equipped with spears and shields, pikes, or halberds: such units may include 35 ([[/r 10d6]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS]{Guards}, perhaps more. They may be commanded by a single @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]. The Silver Order deploys such units to hold ground while their cavalry are charged with seizing it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Clergy</h2>\n<p>\n  Any Silver Order strike team may include support from a cleric of the Sacred Flame: either a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1] or @UUID[Actor.JLIamINrQLGlBiPn] (see\n  <strong>Appendix B</strong>). They may be accompanied by 3 ([[/r 1d6]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolytes}. Sometimes several Flamekeepers gather together on their own for special circumstances when a great deal of divine magic is needed, or to perform religious rites.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Sky-Cavaliers</h2>\n<p>The elite air force of the Silver Order are units of 3 ([[/r 1d6]]) @UUID[Actor.SMiupa0DgaBQbmmU]{Cavaliers} mounted on @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.h052EIIUmRwJum65]{Griffons}. These riders strike like heavenly thunderbolts against ferocious monsters, flying demons, and other airborne threats, or descend from the sky upon wretched spellcasters and enemy leaders.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Schemes</h1>\n<p>As an honorable military regiment, the Silver Order does not engage in subtle or stealthy schemes. Instead, they enact traditional military strategies with commensurate discipline and effectiveness.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Loyal to the Flame. </em></strong>The Silver Order petitions Flamekeeper Hanna in Emberwood Village to withhold her spellcasting services from the player characters.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Military Blockade.</em></strong> The Silver Order creates fortified outposts on the main roads leading into Drakkenheim. Each consists of a fortified watchtower and a palisade wall, and is garrisoned by 2 ([[/r 1d4]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knights}, 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS]{Guards}, and a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]. They have @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.T1xZTDCGuvMBSq8d]{Warhorses} and ballistas. These blockades prevent outside supplies from reaching Emberwood Village or other strongholds within the city - most crucially, food.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Occupy Emberwood Village.</em></strong> The Silver Order mobilizes in force to take Emberwood Village. Unless the Silver Order is stopped, they drive out the other factions entirely and install a strict curfew on the villagers, effectively ending all trade and services within the town. The knights fortify the town and relocate their base of operations here, retaining a small garrison at Camp Dawn.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>An Honorable Challenge.</em></strong> Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal challenges the most martially skilled player character to a one-on-one duel to the death. This honorable combat must be conducted without any external interference. If he wins, he immediately challenges <em>another</em> character to a duel under the same conditions. He repeats this process until either himself or the entire party is killed.\n</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"img-frame\" style=\"text-align:left !important\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:450px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0084_BOOK_Ophelia_Reed_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"Ophelia Reed\" />\n  <label style=\"text-align:center !important\">Ophelia Reed</label>\n</div>\n<br /><br />\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0075_BOOK_Sacred_Flame_Commands_CMYK_copy.webp\" alt=\"\" />"

The ever-present dangers of the dark city make it the perfect place to hide for someone on the wrong side of the law with nothing left to lose. Opportunities for plunder abound within this new frontier for banditry. Many more ply their trade raiding the supply caravans making their way to Emberwood Village. Sly cutthroats know that simply taking the spoils from a weakened but successful adventuring party at swordpoint makes for a highly profitable enterprise, and a far less risky one to boot!</p>\n<p>When the Hooded Lanterns arrived in Drakkenheim a few years ago, they resolved to restore order. Presenting a united front against the fractious outlaws, the Hooded Lanterns met with early success in driving out the more violent and bloodthirsty among them. Then, an enigmatic figure emerged. This self-proclaimed “Queen of Thieves” used assassination, trickery, intimidation, and guile to reshape the disparate gangs into a budding criminal empire. Her plots have sabotaged many important Hooded Lanterns operations, and the Lord Commander believes the Queen of Thieves blackmailed several of his important backers into withdrawing their support.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the Queen of Thieves has established a general truce between the various bandit leaders occupying the city to share territory, resources, and contacts. In exchange, every gang must pay a regular tribute in gold and plunder to the Queen of Thieves. Those who don't become a target for all the others, while loyal and successful scoundrels enjoy extra benefits and kickbacks. Though the Queen of Thieves is now infamous for her schemes and skill, her web of black market smugglers secures her rule over the underworld. Her agents funnel treasures and delerium purloined from Drakkenheim to skilled fences and unscrupulous merchants in the world beyond. This ensures ample gold and booze flow back into Drakkenheim to keep her army of scoundrels happy and well-supplied.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Strongholds</h2>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>The Skull &amp; Sword Taphouse. </em></strong>The Skull &amp; Sword Taphouse in Emberwood Village is a favoured haunt for many outlaws, and the best place to find @UUID[Actor.btuo8mywkRo5g6M9]. This location is detailed in <strong>Chapter 4: Emberwood Village</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Buckledown Row</em></strong>. In Drakkenheim itself, the gangs often meet in several run-down pubs along this dingy street. The sewers beneath connect to a series of smugglers' tunnels that lead to the underground stronghold where the Queen of Thieves holds court. Though the way is littered with deadly traps, it leads nowhere — a cruel joke the Queen of Thieves plays upon would-be hunters.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>The Court of Thieves. </em></strong>Only the Queen of Thieves' most trusted agents know the true location of her personal lair.

As it is, the city is a bandit's paradise. They scour the ruins for treasure, delerium, and lost magic items to sell to the highest bidder on the black market. Most outlaws don't have any loftier goals, but the Queen of Thieves wants to expand her criminal empire.</p>\n<p>However, other factions are trying to gain ground in Drakkenheim. Driving them off isn't a simple matter, either. Several of these new rivals are also potential customers: the Amethyst Academy pays top dollar for delerium. The pilgrims flooding into the city to join the Followers of the Falling Fire are easy pickings for shakedown and robbery as well.</p>\n<p>Others pose a more existential risk to the Queen of Thieves. If she pushes too hard against the Hooded Lanterns or the Silver Order, a much more aggressive military crackdown could ensue. To preserve the delicate balance, the Queen of Thieves has resolved to deceive, blackmail, exploit, and outwit the other factions, but not to destroy them — that would be bad for business! Therefore, she aims to disrupt and sabotage the other factions' goals. Perhaps she might even install a puppet on the throne of Westemär!</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Obtain the Crown of Westemär</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <p>“Stealing it would be the crowning achievement for a Queen of Thieves, don't you think?”</p>\n      <cite>— Sebastian Crowe.</cite>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  This objective is only known to the most trusted associates of the Queen of Thieves.

There is no greater prize to the Queen of Thieves, and she wants to steal the crown so she may use its power for herself.

Having the ability to make @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wishes} is a massive deterrent for anyone who would move against her, cementing her power over the ruined city.

She has transformed a hundred squabbling bands of brigands and outlaws into a burgeoning criminal empire. However, none know her true identity or origin, for she wears many faces. Though she is most infamously encountered as a lithe masked woman garbed in swashbuckling attire with a wide-brimmed hat and jewelled rapier, the Queen of Thieves adopts a variety of costumes, facial features, skin and hair colours, body shapes, ages, and genders depending on her mood and circumstances. As such, she typically confirms her identity by revealing some secret about whoever she is speaking with or demonstrating her uncanny ability to change appearance seemingly at-will.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I am never caught unprepared, and have contingencies for my contingencies.

Once her true identity is revealed, she is effectively defeated. In this regard, it's important to separate the “persona” that is the Queen of Thieves from the actual <em>person</em> behind her. While this book includes one possible suggestion, you may decide the true identity of the Queen of Thieves in your campaign, and decide her true motivations for yourself. You might choose one of the missing heirs to the monarchy, or a long-lost friend or relative connected to one of your player characters. The Queen of Thieves does not disclose her identity readily, but foreshadowing various possibilities with uncanny remarks and subtle hints makes the final reveal that much more dramatic!</p>\n<p>In the original <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> campaign, the Queen of Thieves was none other than <strong>Katarina von Kessel</strong>, one of the lost scions of House von Kessel. Unfortunately for her, she is an arcane spellcaster. Under the Edicts of Lumen, she cannot inherit the throne.</p>\n<p>An “incident” involving an upstart wizard resulted in her sister, Eliza, being banished to the Abyss. Unwilling to accept her sister's death, Katarina von Kessel fled the Amethyst Academy and travelled the world to find a way to bring her sister back. In the process, she learned to weave her proclivities for enchantment and illusion magic with her noble-born fascination for swordplay and scheming. Eventually, she hatched a plan to return to Drakkenheim under a false identity and claim her birthright. She does not want to be used as a pawn of the Amethyst Academy or the nobility. She wants to do things <em>her way</em>, and does not believe such organizations have <em>her</em> best interests in mind — nor the interests of the common folk, for that matter. Katarina von Kessel wants to obtain the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.CroT000000000022] and use its power to restore her lost sister's life, then erase all public knowledge of her magical abilities so she may rule Westemär legitimately.

Each outfit holds a claim to its own territory within the ruins that is their exclusive right to plunder. In return, each must pay a share to the Queen of Thieves. They must also heed her summons, which takes the form of a playing card showing the Queen of Diamonds. She arbitrates disputes and enforces dissent in a ruthlessly efficient manner. Ultimately, the gangs are disposable pawns to the Queen of Thieves, and she\n  <em>doesn't care</em> if the player characters get into fights with them.\n</p>\n<p>Below are a few of the most prominent gangs that work under the Queen of Thieves. Feel free to expand or use these as you see fit to help flesh out the myriad outlaws encountered in the city:</p>\n<h3>Pins &amp; Clubs</h3>\n<p>The Pins &amp; Clubs are general ruffians. They often have iconic colourful mohawks or other wild-coloured hairstyles. They wear a lot of spikes and chains and notoriously break the legs of people who cross them.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Leader.</em></strong> Leon the Swine, a scrawny middle-aged @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY] with a scar over his left eye and a mohawk. He carries a saber and a dagger, and chains hang from his leather vest and black trousers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Symbol.</em></strong> A club logo from a card deck with several pins sticking out of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Quote.</em></strong> “If ya don't like the way they looked at ya, if they seem too pompous, too arrogant, too wise, or too righteous, you club them down and let them know where they really stand.”\n</p>\n<h3>Rose &amp; Thorns</h3>\n<p>This group is known for their confidence. They often are known for using daggers, spears, and shortswords and always have high-quality leather armour and steel-toed spiked boots. A lot of the most well-known members of this gang are a group of women renowned amongst the thieves as the Bouquet, led by the unwavering Rose Carver.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Leader.</em></strong> Rose Carver, a striking red-haired @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.J8xjoG4Dxb8WkHtV] with piercing eyes and studded leather armour. She has a belt filled with daggers, and steel-tipped boots with several spikes on the toes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Symbol.</em></strong> A thorn-covered rose.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Quote.</em></strong> “All beautiful things have their sharp edges. Let's show them ours!”\n</p>\n<h3>The Wounded Hearts</h3>\n<p>The Wounded Hearts use cunning, deceit, and charm to get what they want. They are masters of swindling, scheming, and double-crossing. Nowhere else will you find better liars. They often wear elegant noble's garb and act stuck-up, as if they deem themselves superior to the other gangs.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Leader.</em></strong> Christain Lament, a tall blonde elven @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.13K3XK2A3wwxVKLD].

Kindness is the great mask of all evils.”\n</p>\n<h3>The Howlin' Dogs</h3>\n<p>These bandits are all about intimidation. They have size - usually only the strongest get into this gang.

She rewards characters with 100 gold pieces each for successful missions to the Outer City, 250 gold each for missions to the Inner City, and 1,000 gold each for missions to Castle Drakken or faction strongholds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Poisons.</em></strong> Trusted associates of the Queen of Thieves can procure any poisons described in the Core Rules from her quartermasters. The Queen of Thieves will give characters an allowance of up to 500 gold pieces to procure these poisons before any mission.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Purloined Equipment.</em></strong> If the player characters need a mundane item for a mission, the Queen of Thieves can use her web of connections to obtain it for them. This may be any mundane item in the Core Rules. How valuable the item can be depends on how long the characters are willing to wait to get it: 100 gold pieces per day spent seeking it out, up to a maximum of three weeks (or 2,100 gold)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Potions and Scrolls. </em></strong>The Queen of Thieves can provide the party with 1d4 <em>spell scrolls</em> from the enchantment and illusion school of magic, and potions that aid stealth or trickery, such as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.rTn4p9nJr4Aq2GPB] or a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.bqZ6NTLDCUB98YjV]. Determine these randomly from items up to very rare quality, or choose items appropriate for the mission at hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Fences.</em></strong> Access to smugglers and dealers of ill-gotten goods. There's many items stolen from noble houses, guild vaults, or churches that normal dealers simply won't purchase. These merchants have few scruples, and can find a buyer for almost anything.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Smugglers' Passages.</em></strong> The Queen's Men have maps of the smugglers' passages and sewers. Characters can use these maps to move through the city sewers at twice the normal speed, and make checks for random encounters while doing so with advantage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Stolen Magic Items.</em></strong> As a reward for completing an important mission, the Queen of Thieves bestows the party with a magic item she has stolen. The Game Masters can choose this item or determine it randomly. The item can be consumable or permanent. This will be a common item for an Outer City mission, an uncommon item for the Inner City or a faction stronghold, or a rare item for a successful mission to Castle Drakken, the cathedral, or the Inscrutable Tower. As long as the items are randomly determined, there's no limit to how many times she might grant this boon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Cloak and Dagger Training.</em></strong> The Queen of Thieves allows the characters access to her training rooms. Her trusted associates Lies &amp; Deceit can spend time showing the players new skills and combat techniques. Each character can gain one of the following of their choice:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> The character can increase one ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by 1 each. The ability score can be increased above 20, up to a maximum of 30.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>New Feat.</em></strong> The character gains a new feat of their choice(subject to GM approval)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bandit Backup.</em></strong> If the player characters have a reasonable need for reinforcements during a mission, the Queen of Thieves can dispatch one of her gangs to help them out. The gang sends 1d6 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN]{Bandits} and a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY] to help out. They demand an equal share of any loot the characters find on the mission, and a share of any payment. If all bandits are killed on the mission, the player characters will not receive this boon again. If circumstances with other factions escalate into open conflict, the Queen of Thieves might dispatch 1d4 of her @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.EMvcuOpu7ABCmBWi]{Assassins}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]{Mages}, or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.fsPruAIDOg4tVrgb]{Gladiators} to join the characters.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Informants.</em></strong> The Queen of Thieves has a wealth of spies and informants. The player characters can ask her to spy on or investigate a location, character, or event. She can provide a clue or details on that location. Her information is reliable, but not always complete.\n</p>\n<p>However, the Queen of Thieves always uses her discretion and judgement in giving out this information, and she's cautious to reveal anything that could be used against her or be used to predict her own plans. She knows the value of revealing information at the right moment, so she's careful about sharing information she might use as blackmail later.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>She never reveals the locations of the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>. Even if she's sending the characters to claim one, she doesn't reveal that the item in question is a <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em>.</li>\n  <li>She does not tell anyone about the powers of the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.CroT000000000022], what she plans to do with it, or any personal information about herself.

The Queen of Thieves herself oversees this strike team, using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uAwtVZkiSTyP6ORB] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20] spells. This strike team only conducts infiltration, information gathering, and clandestine asset recovery.

This strike team fulfils a wide variety of roles, and is sent in when the Queen of Thieves needs exceptionally skilled agents for an important mission. Occasionally, the Queen of Thieves uses @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.r3243JU4AyQJyfX4] on members of this strike team so they can't reveal secrets about their missions when captured, or even casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.91Sw6vOIaO7U8DvM] on one of them so she can “personally” oversee the operation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Royal Assassins</h2>\n<p>This elite strike team consists of one @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.EMvcuOpu7ABCmBWi] per player character.

She doesn't have them killed, but she steals their equipment and valuables.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Blackmail.</em></strong> The Queen of Thieves uses her agents and magic to discover a terrible secret about one of the player characters, or some crime or trespass they committed in the ruins. She threatens to reveal the secret if the characters don't work for her.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bribery. </em></strong>Using the intel she has gathered, the Queen of Thieves caters to the goals of the party and offers to pay them an exorbitant sum of money (as you see fit) to buy the characters' loyalty — or at least their services.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Eyes and Ears.</em></strong> Spies tail the party and gather information on their next moves and plans, along with any factions they associate with for the next 1d4 days. If undiscovered they relay all information to the Queen of Thieves for her to use to her advantage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Backstabbing.</em></strong> The Queen of Thieves expects the player characters will betray her. She is never surprised when this happens, and should always have a plan in mind for if the player characters' decide to double-cross her.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Puppetmaster.</em></strong> The Queen of Thieves kidnaps a faction member. Thereafter, she controls the faction agent using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.91Sw6vOIaO7U8DvM] and sends them back as a spy. If caught, the Queen of Thieves might try to create the impression that the puppet is actually a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mWbrPhcKOz6oLXMV] or magical disguise, rather than a <em>dominated</em> person. Thanks to the Queen's <em>Modify Memories</em> power, this faction member won't have any knowledge of what happened.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>An Audience with the Queen.</em></strong> The Queen of Thieves invites the characters to the Court of Thieves to negotiate. Once they arrive, she lures them into the arena to face her gladiators, and then her favoured pet: @UUID[Actor.IXr0RVQeYkl4emKC].\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Captured by the Queen.</em></strong> The Queen of Thieves prefers taking the characters prisoner over killing them. If captured, she'll interrogate them using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ppWAAEul0QHtm4er] spells to learn their secrets and gain leverage over them, so she can force them to do her bidding.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Imposter Syndrome.</em></strong> The Queen of Thieves sends @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mWbrPhcKOz6oLXMV]{Doppelgangers} disguised as the party to Emberwood Village where they cause a commotion and set fire to a building.

However, the village centre is alive with activity.\n  Conversation, laughter, and music resound from several taverns along the main\n  thoroughfare. Amidst a bustling market square, a small crowd of adventurers,\n  merchants, and prospectors busily traffic all manner of weapons, equipment,\n  coins, recovered treasures, and a few strange glimmering crystals. Even the\n  light of the Sacred Flame still glows within the modest stone chapel at the\n  heart of town.\n</p>\n\n<h1 data-split-here=\"Overview\">Overview</h1>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">\n  This chapter details Emberwood Village, a safe haven where player characters\n  may rest, recuperate, and resupply between their adventures in Drakkenheim.\n  Equipment, lodgings, spellcasting services, a few magic items, and other\n  amenities are available from the many folk dwelling in the village.\n</p>\n<p>\n  By interacting with the various townsfolk, faction agents, and other\n  non-player characters in Emberwood Village, the player characters will\n  discover many adventure hooks and rumours that direct them towards key\n  locations within Drakkenheim. The taverns and inns are the perfect place to\n  make initial contact with various faction lieutenants who use the\n  establishments as neutral ground for meetings. Many rival adventurers can be\n  encountered in Emberwood Village as well, ready to swap stories and stoke\n  friendly competition.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Emberwood Village Background</h2>\n<p>\n  Two decades ago, Emberwood Village was little more than a farmers' market,\n  blacksmith, a pub, a small chapel, and a few dozen cottages. The local\n  businesses served the farmlands and logging camps surrounding the capital, and\n  the town was an occasional rest stop for merchants to stop off on their way to\n  Drakkenheim.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As the town lies some five miles south of the capital city, it was not\n  directly damaged by the meteor shower, though the impact shattered the windows\n  of every building, caused some weaker structures to collapse, and left some in\n  the village blinded or deafened. Unfortunately, the aftermath was all the more\n  terrible. Over the past fifteen years, the contamination in Drakkenheim has\n  affected the countryside for miles around. The once fertile fields and dense\n  woods are now barren and dying. Gradually, most folk gave up, departing for\n  safer and more prosperous places. A few people remained behind, determined to\n  hold onto their family homes and salvage their livelihoods.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Emberwood Village persisted despite the odds. After the civil war, adventurers\n  began showing up in the town. Explorers heading towards the dark city needed a\n  safe place to tend their wounds and rest, and so Emberwood Village gradually\n  became a sort of boom town on a new frontier for adventure.\n</p>"

However, the recent flow of coin from explorers scouring the ruins allows many to live modest or comfortable lifestyles. The common folk tend to keep their dealings with adventurers friendly but professional. They give rough-looking warriors a wide berth, but enjoy hearing news, gossip, and stories about daring exploits in the ruins. As long as interactions stay peaceful, the villagers will deal with anyone regardless of their faction allegiances. The villagers live in strange times, and are used to seeing odd-looking folk and weird magic. They can recognize delerium, severe contamination, and mutations, and encourage such individuals to seek magical aid.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Arrival by Caravan</h2>\n<p>If the characters arrived in Emberwood Village in the company of Eren Marlowe (see “The Road to Drakkenheim”), they are paid the agreed rate of 25 gp per character. While Marlowe doesn't sell goods commonly needed by adventurers, they can offer some friendly advice about town:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>They invite characters to meet them again at the market square in the village. Marlowe will introduce characters looking for adventuring equipment to Armin Gainsbury.</li>\n  <li>Marlowe suggests characters visit the Bark and Buzzard if they're looking for a place to relax and get a good meal.

She skips up to adventurous-looking newcomers and introduces herself as the daughter of the local blacksmith, Tobias Crowe. She offers them a tour around Emberwood Village for a gold piece. At each location, the precocious youngster tells a story about an adventurer who once frequented the business, then gives a lighthearted account of the grisly fates they met in Drakkenheim. The tour ends at the Crowe and Sons Smithy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Adventuring Equipment</h2>\n<p>Most weapons, armour, and adventuring equipment described in the Core Rules are available in Emberwood Village. The various merchants and their wares are described in the Area Details below.</p>\n<p>Emberwood Village relies entirely on trade for goods and supplies, since all other settlements for miles around are now abandoned and local food production has become impossible. As a result, weapons, armour, and adventuring equipment are sold for double the normal price found in the Core Rules. Food costs five times as much, and water isn't given freely. Instead, it is priced like alcohol.</p>\n<p>Exotic equipment, vehicles, mounts, or other mundane items that cost over 500 gp are especially rare and must be brought in from outside Drakkenheim. It takes 21 ([[/r 6d6]]) days to deliver such items, which cost five times the typical price.</p>\n<p>The folk of Emberwood Village have grown accustomed to adventurers trying to haggle and swindle them. They don't give discounts or make deals, and tell adventurers who push for better prices to pay up or go elsewhere (there isn't anywhere else to go).</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Selling Treasure</h2>\n<p>Most merchants in Emberwood Village will trade or purchase found treasure, salvaged equipment, gems, or art objects at half their listed value.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trading Delerium</h2>\n<p>Only a few intrepid and wealthy purveyors can afford to trade in delerium. These include @UUID[Actor.YH9zw9TYs5cPJGQd], Orson Fairweather, and @UUID[Actor.1p6ksQrMvxCBPkga] of the Amethyst Academy. Typically, most delerium is bought and sold for about half its listed value in <strong>Appendix D</strong>. However, some traders may offer more preferable rates for proven associates. Due to their rarity, crystals and geodes typically command their full market value.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lodgings</h2>\n<p>Though there are many taverns and public houses in Emberwood Village, the only actual inn is the Red Lion Hotel (see description below). However, the Alsbergs of the Bark and Buzzard tavern can make arrangements for characters to bunk in one of the abandoned homes and cottages in town.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic Items and Spellcasters</h2>\n<p>A few NPCs in Emberwood Village sell a limited selection of magic items, mostly potions and scrolls:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.YH9zw9TYs5cPJGQd] sells a small selection of uncommon and rare magical items, and will offer to purchase found magic items as well.</li>\n  <li>Flamekeeper Hanna or Old Zoya offer spellcasting services of spells up to 3rd level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These characters also sell expensive spell components for spells of 3rd level and lower, and occasionally have one or two components for spells of 4th or 5th level.</p>\n<p>Characters seeking more powerful magic items, higher level spell components, or the services of higher-level spellcasters must seek assistance from the factions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>“A lot of fires happen in this town. Oh wait, none have happened since I left? That's strange.”</p>\n  <cite>— Sebastian Crowe</cite>\n</blockquote>\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/Emberwood_village_map.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Law and Order</h2>\n<p>Although the Hooded Lanterns claim otherwise, there is no established law and order in Emberwood Village. Most businesses provide their own protection and security, and the villagers look out for each other. Word travels fast, though. Services, supplies, or shelter aren't available to adventurers with a violent and antagonistic reputation — for any price.</p>\n<p>Belligerent curs who disturb the peace are beaten. Those who commit robbery, fraud, and property damage are driven out of town and never welcomed back. Murderers and arsonists are executed. Crimes of any sort involving magic are punished by hanging. On the flipside, there's little the villagers can do when perpetrators aren't caught red-handed. There's no authority willing to investigate crimes or search for missing people, so the villagers must petition adventurers or the factions for help. There are no trials; the mob becomes judge and jury.</p>\n<p>In this respect, characters who make themselves villains may be targeted by the Hooded Lanterns, the Silver Order, or even the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] should they directly threaten the immediate safety of Emberwood Village. Alternatively, a rival adventuring party might even take up the bounty or intervene in a crisis. However, if any of the villagers are killed, no one comes to replace them.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Making Contact with the Factions</h2>\n<p>During their first visit to Emberwood Village, characters may encounter several faction agents. Each is a key contact between the characters and the factions during their adventures in Drakkenheim:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.zAumxn18Z0GTvBbL]{Ansom} and @UUID[Actor.Yry1g6heIrVxK7xN] are human @UUID[Actor.02VvEfOHseDs38Jm]{Urban Rangers} of the <strong>Hooded Lanterns</strong>. They are frequently relaying messages and leading scout teams to the Old Watchtower, and can be encountered there most days.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.btuo8mywkRo5g6M9] is a human @UUID[Actor.RSVYdtx9l6jQkjiV]working for the <strong>Queen's Men</strong>. He can always be found at the back tables of the Skull &amp; Sword with a bodyguard of 2d6 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thugs}. He's happy to talk shop with mercenaries.</li>\n  <li>\n    @UUID[Actor.fKwswI79J2z7lM0i] is a human @UUID[Actor.JLIamINrQLGlBiPn] of the\n    <strong>Followers of the Falling Fire<em>. </em></strong>He is regularly seen at the Hendrix Farm preparing the latest group of pilgrims for the last leg of the journey towards Drakkenheim. He uses the old barn as a meeting place for important matters.\n  </li>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.1IaDUyBM9G4EEphL] is a human @UUID[Actor.JLIamINrQLGlBiPn] of the <strong>Silver Order</strong>. She is visiting the Chapel of Saint Ardenna where Flamekeeper Hanna has granted her permission to hold meetings and discussions.</li>\n  <li>\n    @UUID[Actor.1p6ksQrMvxCBPkga] is a tiefling @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE] of the\n    <strong>Amethyst Academy</strong>. She can be met at the Red Lion Hotel. She rents a private suite and is often reading in the parlour, where she might chat with adventurers.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Roleplaying characteristics for each of these characters are described in detail in chapter 3 but all act mostly neutral during their first encounter with the player characters. Instead, they try to size up their potential. Each explains some information about their faction, such as their ideals and general mission (see the faction dossiers in chapter 3 for more information). These NPCs might share a drink or meal with the characters, ask them if they've been to the ruins yet, or inquire about why they've come to Drakkenheim. However, they won't offer missions or quests until the characters have survived at least one expedition of their own to the ruins.</p>"

              "text": "<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Bark and Buzzard\">Bark and Buzzard</h2>\n<p>Nestled amongst the residential cottages of Emberwood Village, this small one-level public house is a popular spot for locals and adventurers seeking a peaceful and laid back place to unwind. The sign hanging above the door depicts a cartoonish vulture feasting on the entrails of a bloodhound, both smiling pleasantly. The public house has a cozy and familial character: there's no proper bar, nor any walls separating the kitchen from the dining room. Instead, a few benches are arranged beside the main cask, and about a dozen round tables surround an inviting hearth. The Alsberg family has owned and maintained the establishment for a generation. Karin Alsberg and her husband, Holger (both human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners}) make fine home-brewed beer known as Ember Ale, and serve hearty braised lamb stew with fresh-baked bread.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A mug of fine ale costs 2 sp. A meal costs 1 gp.</li>\n  <li>The Alsbergs keep half a dozen one-room cottages in the village that they will rent to travellers. The price is 2 gold per night.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Old Rattlecan</h3>\n<p>\n  Sitting behind the Bark and Buzzard like a scarecrow, Old Rattlecan is an intelligent suit of\n  <strong>animated armour</strong> which was found in the ruins of Drakkenheim. A mysterious magical enchantment causes it to rebuild itself when destroyed:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Rival adventurers</strong> drinking in the Bark and Buzzard may invite player characters to “come kick the can out back”. They challenge them to see which character can defeat Old Rattlecan the fastest, or who can survive the longest before being knocked out. Adding handicaps or bizarre “house rules'' are popular ways to spice up the contest, such as being blindfolded, using no weapons, or taking drinks between hits.</li>\n  <li>Rattlecan rejuvenates after one minute when reduced to 0 hit points unless it is disintegrated or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8] is cast on its remains. Everyone in town is terribly upset if this happens.</li>\n  <li>A creature reduced to 0 hit points by Old Rattlecan is unconscious but stable and wakes up one minute later with 1 hit point.</li>\n  <li>Old Rattlecan can occasionally be heard making remarks to those it fights. It yells things like “Have at thee cur!”, “‘Tis a flesh wound!” or “Was that the best you can do?” as it seems to revel in battling any challenger.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Gilded Lily\">Gilded Lily</h2>\n<p>This lavish two-storey building is surrounded by a veranda decorated with a swirling lily motif and painted purple. It has ornate golden glowing lanterns hanging between the veranda arches and within its curtained windows. Inside, four large golden lamps light a small stage set before rows of candlelit tables. Floral arrangements line the walls. The well-stocked bar displays wines and spirits from across the world. The Gilded Lily is owned by a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] named Mr. Killian Vandire, but the exquisite hostess Madam Rochelle (a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.13K3XK2A3wwxVKLD]) runs the business and organizes the nightly performance acts. The tavern is a popular place to share company, gossip, and have a few drinks, and many adventurers make their last stop here for some good memories before trudging into the dismal ruins.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Drinks cost 5 silver: wine, spirits, and coffee only, no beer or food is served here.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Open Mike Night</h3>\n<p>“Mike” was the master of ceremonies who went missing shortly after the meteor fell. One of Mike's final wishes was to open the stage to any performer for magic shows, musical numbers, poetry readings, performances, or storytelling. The Gilded Lily is willing to host any performer who wishes to take the stage and though they do not pay their acts, they do put a hat out so patrons can toss a coin to their performer if they like the show.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Any sort of act is allowed in the Gilded Lily. Performers may tell a story, recite a poem, sing, or play an instrument. Spellcasters might put on a magic show, and even demonstrations of acrobatic or athletic skill are welcome. Player characters are invited to be as creative as they want to earn some extra coins.</li>\n  <li>Player characters who take to the stage may make a skill check related to their performance: acrobatics, arcana, athletics, history, and performance are all suitable ways to represent their act.</li>\n  <li>Characters are paid in tips: they receive an amount of gold based on their skill check result:</li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"table-wrapper roll-table-wrapper\">\n  <table data-title=\"Performance Results\">\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>1 to 9</td>\n        <td>The character is booed off the stage, and receives no gold for their performance. If this happens three or more times, they are banned from ever performing again.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>10 to 14</td>\n        <td>Characters collect 2d6 gp in coins from tips.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>15 to 19</td>\n        <td>Characters earn 5d6 gp from the impressed audience</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>20 or higher</td>\n        <td>The wonderful performance earns 10d6 gold pieces, and characters are invited to perform an encore performance. However, characters must exceed their previous check result to win further encores.</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</section>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Skull Sword Taphouse\">Skull &amp; Sword Taphouse</h2>\n<p>This dingy saloon was converted from an old farmstead. A jawless skull impaled upon a rusty sword is embedded beside the main doors: no one knows who it was or who did them in, but it's tradition to make a macabre greeting to the skull on your way into the bar. Inside the establishment is a rowdy environment - brawls and fist fights happen daily, and several ruffians are thrown out nightly.</p>\n<p>The Skull &amp; Sword is a popular place for scoundrels and misfits to gather thanks to the cheap mead and liquor served here. It may very well be the best place in Emberwood Village to pick up rumours from the city, but you may want to keep a low profile hanging out around there, or be ready to draw swords for looking at someone the wrong way.</p>\n<p>The establishment is run by a half-orc @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.fsPruAIDOg4tVrgb] named Frida Longhorn, who keeps most people in check. Despite the rough reputation of the establishment, Frida is pretty good at keeping the peace and making sure there are no killings or broken windows in her bar. Her business partner, a halfling @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.13K3XK2A3wwxVKLD] named Cuff Goldburg, is usually sitting at one of the back tables with @UUID[Actor.btuo8mywkRo5g6M9]. Cuff typically excuses himself when Blackjack Mel deals with mercenaries and adventurers.</p>\n<p>The @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] bankrolls the bar, ensuring the flow of cheap booze (which is almost all stolen). While commonfolk in Emberwood Village believe the Skull &amp; Sword is a hub for unlawful activity, most of what goes on here is above-board aside from a few sketchy meetings. The real dirty deals and smuggling happen in Buckledown Row where the other factions can't easily interfere.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A mug of cheap mead is 5 copper pieces. Brandy, rum, vodka, and gin are 1 silver.</li>\n  <li>Blackjack Mel is here every night, where he has a favourite spot amongst the back tables with 7 ([[/r 2d6]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thugs}. He's eager to meet potential recruits in a private booth in the back corner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Red Lion Hotel\">Red Lion Hotel</h2>\n<p>Upon a small hill overlooking the village is the impressive Red Lion Hotel. Before the meteor struck it was known as Stavros Manor, home to a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] named Kosta Stavros who served as Reeve of Emberwood Village. After narrowly avoiding destitution when Drakkenheim was destroyed, Stavros converted his home into a hotel that serves wealthy explorers, merchants, and nobles conducting business near Drakkenheim. He is an older man with a sallow face, thinning hair, and monocle, always garbed in a rich blue vest and doublet.</p>\n<p>The three-storey manor is made of red brick. It features lion-shaped gargoyles, large glass-paned windows, and embossed wooden doors painted green. The estate includes a dozen well-appointed bedrooms, each with their own private bath and common room. A full service staff provides patrons' every need. Meals are taken in a sumptuous dining room outfitted with an impressive crystal chandelier, and drinks are served in a vast parlour furnished with fine antiques and decorated with various sculptures, paintings, and bookshelves. Each room features a great hearth and lovely views which overlook the village or the surrounding countryside.</p>\n<p>The Reeve has abandoned his civic duties, and is now little more than another business owner in the town. However, he still lords his imagined authority and privilege over others in the village, and prefers to share wine and gossip with travellers and merchants than deal with common folk. He regards the idea of adventuring in Drakkenheim as a sort of sport. He often makes wagers on who will die first amongst any adventuring groups who visit the Red Lion Hotel.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Kosta Stavros loves the fine arts, especially sculpture, paintings, and literature. He's assembled a vast collection of art objects recovered by adventurers from the ruins, and exchanges coin or credit towards accommodation for works in good condition.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.1p6ksQrMvxCBPkga] of the Amethyst Academy stays at the Red Lion Hotel. She's happy to chat, but prefers to conduct business privately. She asks any potential new associates of the Amethyst Academy to meet with her later at Eckerman Mill (see Chapter 6).</li>\n  <li>The<strong> Ironhelm Dwarves </strong>(see Smithy on the Scar in chapter 6) keep rooms here, along with many merchants who operate in Caravan Court and one or two groups of wealthy <strong>rival adventurers</strong>.</li>\n  <li>Rooms are 25 gp per night and include meals.</li>\n  <li>Wine and liquors are sold at 100 gold per bottle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Crowe and Sons Smithy\">Crowe and Sons Smithy</h2>\n<p>This smithy is little more than a one-level log cabin with an overhanging thatched roof covering a workbench, stone forge, anvil, and grinding wheel. Various tools hang along the walls beside several finished weapons.</p>\n<p>Master smith Tobias Crowe (a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.J8xjoG4Dxb8WkHtV]) owns and operates the smithy with his son and apprentice, Peter (a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]). Crowe is a quiet family man who stands six feet tall with fiery red hair and beard. He's often drenched in sweat and soot, and wears a greasy pair of old goggles. Crowe proudly demonstrates the high quality of his work to customers, and openly criticizes the shoddy workmanship of their existing equipment. He spends most of his days repairing broken gear, and his evenings at the Bark and Buzzard, before returning home to his wife Moira and daughters Emma and Sybil. Although he lacks the spellcasting abilities to work with delerium, he dreams of one day creating a masterpiece out of the meteoric iron found in Drakkenheim.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Tobias Crowe sells weapons and armour at twice the price found in the Core Rules.</li>\n  <li>Plate armour must be made-to-order. Payment is triple the list price, paid up front, and is available in four weeks.</li>\n  <li>He accepts payment in coins, gems, or precious metals.</li>\n  <li>He pays half-price for salvaged equipment if he thinks he can repurpose or melt it down.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Chapel of Saint Ardenna\">Chapel of Saint Ardenna</h2>\n<p>Located at the heart of Emberwood Village is a small chapel of the Sacred Flame. The circular fieldstone building has a copper domed rooftop, thin windows set with stained glass, and simple wooden double doors. Outside is a small crematory garden and scattering plot for the ashes of the dead. Within the chapel is a bronze brazier of the Sacred Flame, alight with golden fire that burns all night and day. It serves as a peaceful place of quiet worship in the harsh wasteland surrounding Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>The chapel is maintained by Flamekeeper Hanna (a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]) and 2 ([[/r 1d4]]) human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolytes}. Hanna is a young woman who wears a simple white and yellow frock and keeps her black hair tied in a braid. Hanna was merely an acolyte when the last Flamekeeper died several years ago, but opted to take up the position herself rather than abandon the folk of Emberwood Village. She believes the Faith of the Sacred Flame is needed here now more than ever, and offers hospitality, kindness, and prayer to any who visit the chapel.</p>\n<p>High Flamekeeper @UUID[Actor.1IaDUyBM9G4EEphL] of the Silver Order regularly visits the Chapel of Saint Ardenna, protected by Ser Virgil Underwood and Ser Cassandra Wyatt, two Silver Order @UUID[Actor.SMiupa0DgaBQbmmU]{Cavaliers}. Ophelia Reed has been trying to convince Flamekeeper Hanna to join the Silver Order, but thus far Hanna has kept her neutral allegiance to the folk of Emberwood Village. Still, Flamekeeper Hanna enjoys conversation with Ophelia Reed, and allows the Silver Order emissary to take shelter in the chapel and conduct meetings with adventurers here.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Services</h3>\n<p>Flamekeeper Hanna can cast cleric spells of 3rd level and lower, and knows the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.PurT000000000008] spell and always keeps it prepared. She charges 25 gp for a 1st-level spell, 50 gp for a 2nd-level spell, or 150 gp for a 3rd-level spell, plus the cost of any expensive material components.</p>\n<p>She takes payment in coins, gems, or relics. She uses the money to help fund the caravans that supply Emberwood Village with basics for the townsfolk. Flamekeeper Hanna will occasionally waive these fees to help innocent folk in dire situations, but not adventurers who went looking for treasure and trouble in Drakkenheim.</p>\n<h3>Spell Scrolls</h3>\n<p>\n  Paid in advance, once per day Flamekeeper Hanna can create\n  <em>spell scrolls</em> of any cleric spell she can cast. She charges 75 gp for a 1st level <em>spell scroll</em>, 150 gp for a 2nd-level <em>spell scroll</em>, and 450 gp for a 3rd-level <em>spell scroll</em>, plus the cost of any expensive material components. There's a single exception: a <em>scroll of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]</em> costs 1,000 gp.\n</p>\n\n<br /><br />\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0050_BOOK-Approaching_Emberwood_CMYKCUT.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Watchtower\">Watchtower</h2>\n<p>This fortified stone watchtower is the tallest structure in Emberwood Village, and lies upon the road on the north edge of town. A two-storey wooden house abuts the base. Inside is a small kitchen, a mess hall, and about two dozen bunk beds. The tower has three main levels, one serving as a meeting room, another as armoury, and the final as a private chamber for the watchmaster. Outside the tower the Hooded Lanterns keep a small training yard and a modest stable large enough for six horses. Nearby, a covered wooden bridge crosses the narrow Timberwash stream and leads out of Emberwood Village towards Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>This location once served as the initial outpost for the Hooded Lanterns until they successfully established a base of operations within the city proper, and the remnants of a much larger military camp are scattered about the nearby field. Now, only a small detachment keeps watch in Emberwood Village.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A small force of a dozen Hooded Lantern @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.O3ABqI55Ir1du1Xa]{Scouts} are posted here, with one or two other squads out on patrol in the countryside.</li>\n  <li>Raine Highlash, an @UUID[Actor.02VvEfOHseDs38Jm] with a predatory look about her, serves as watch captain.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.zAumxn18Z0GTvBbL]{Ansom} or @UUID[Actor.Yry1g6heIrVxK7xN] report in here regularly at the behest of the Lord Commander, and use the outpost to meet with mercenaries and adventurers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>“Warm fires, great company, home-cooked meals!

Inscribed on each stone are the legends of primordial gods, and between them rests a stone pedestal adorned with various animal bones, plants, and candles that are lit every night. A crude old hut lies down a dirt path near the shrine, smoke billowing from a hole in the thatched roof chimney, and an odd scent of herbs wafting from within.</p>\n<p>The hut is home to Old Zoya, an elderly human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.K15Yl8JmB5iPircc] who tends the shrine. Many in town wrongfully refer to her as a witch, but hold a deep respect for the ornery mystic. She claims the shrine protects Emberwood Village through these dark times. Zoya holds no love for the Sacred Flame, and keeps faith for the old, true gods.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Services</h3>\n<p>Old Zoya can cast druid spells of 3rd-level and lower, and knows the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.PurT000000000008] spell and always keeps it prepared. She charges 25 gp for a 1st-level spell, 50 gp for a 2nd-level spell, or 150 gp a 3rd-level spell, plus the cost of any expensive material components.</p>\n<p>She takes payment in coins, gems, or relics. She refuses to speak of what she does with the money, and grows impatient with anyone who gets too nosy.</p>\n<h3>Potions of Healing</h3>\n<p>Each week, Zoya brews up 1d6 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potions of Healing} which she sells for 50 gold each. If paid in advance, once per day she can create a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.L887NdWEP5NqHCrQ] for 150 gp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Hendrix Farm\">Hendrix Farm</h2>\n<p>The Hendrix Farm is one of the only occupied farmsteads remaining in Emberwood Village. It was once run by an old human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq] named Elijah Hendrix, until his crops became contaminated, his livestock perished, and his wife grew ill and passed away after the meteor fell. He gave up on farming, and nearly gave up on life as well. However, several years ago, @UUID[Actor.tqJK1mzxPst0xV08] stayed at his farmhouse during her first pilgrimage to Drakkenheim. Her words inspired him with renewed purpose, and he now offers shelter to any future pilgrims of the Falling Fire who are making the trek into Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>The fallow fields are devoid of crops and no longer used for agricultural production. Instead, they are littered with small campfires and tents for the passing pilgrims. The large wooden barn and nearby farmhouse are kept in good repair, though all the farm equipment and ploughs were long ago dismantled for parts.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Actor.fKwswI79J2z7lM0i] and many members of the Falling Fire gather here as their last stop before heading further into the ruins. At any given time there may be as many as fifty @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners} congregating here with their wagons. Though he has been invited to come take the Sacrament himself many times, Farmer Hendrix believes it is his destiny to wait here until the very last pilgrim comes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Eventide Manor\">Eventide Manor</h2>\n<p>This manor house on the south end of town burned down many years ago. It was once owned by a mysterious elven woman who had a child with a local craftsman, but was abandoned after she passed away and the boy was taken by the Amethyst Academy. Since it caught fire, none have come to claim or repair it. Children now tell tales of the strange noises coming from the cellar of the house, and how the charred doors and windows open and close on their own.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Unbeknownst to the folk of Emberwood Village, this house was owned by a former Archmage of the Amethyst Academy. Behind an illusory wall in the cellar protected by a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935] is a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW] used today by members of the Amethyst Academy to come and go from their distant strongholds. Academy members only enter or exit the manor under the effects of an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B] spell, hence the children's rumours.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Caravan Court\">Caravan Court</h2>\n<p>A marketplace has sprung up surrounding the boarded-up water well in the village square. This colourful collection of caravans, wagons, canvas tents, and makeshift stalls is the hub of commerce for adventurers, scavengers, and prospectors looking to make their fortune in Drakkenheim. Dozens of canny merchants have set up shop here to cater to the needs of the factions and explorers.</p>\n<p>Traders and new goods arrive here daily, and the market is constantly abuzz with explorers looking to sell relics and treasures unearthed in Drakkenheim, or buy equipment needed for a dangerous voyage into the city ruins. Amongst the bustle, heavily armed and armored thugs load ponderous wagons with locked and leaden chests filled with delerium shards for trade in distant cities. Activity carries on through the afternoon, but most pack up shortly after sunset to head to the taverns and bars for drinks.</p>\n\n<h3>Marlowe's Provisions</h3>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <p>“Everyone's gotta eat!

Allow characters to\n  take the reigns and plan their route. If for some reason characters don't\n  think to do this on their own, a friendly NPC contact in Emberwood Village or\n  even a faction lieutenant suggests the characters experience the ruins\n  firsthand and prove they can survive the dangers there. It's risky, but\n  there's a chance to make good money!\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Events</h2>\n<p>\n  Use the guidelines throughout this chapter as characters explore the ruins.\n  Finding a delerium deposit in the Cratered Street requires characters\n  successfully <strong>search the ruins</strong> once as described above. Check\n  for random encounters normally, but use these events along the way:\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Approaching Drakkenheim</h2>\n\n<p>\n  If this is the first time the characters are venturing into Drakkenheim, read:\n</p>\n\n<section class=\"read-group\">\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">\n    Nestled within a pine-covered valley, Drakkenheim is a walled metropolis\n    that straddles the wide and sluggish Drann River. A high rocky hill rises\n    above the city, upon which perches Castle Drakken. Below the imposing\n    fortress, cobblestone streets weave around densely-packed stone buildings\n    and slate-shingle spires. The city spills from the outer walls into a ruined\n    urban sprawl.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">\n    The great dome of Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral stands prominently southwest of\n    the castle. At the heart of the city lies the Cosmological Clocktower of\n    Market Square, and to the northwest is the Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst\n    Academy. The soaring obsidian-glass building is broken in half at the\n    middle, but the top still hovers above in defiance of gravity.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">\n    Four bridges reach across the Drann River like desperate limbs; one is\n    covered in massive stone statues of the heroes of old, and another lurches\n    under the weight of the ramshackle homes and other buildings constructed\n    upon its length.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">\n    Billowing clouds of midnight purple and dusky violet mask the sky overhead,\n    casting the city in a dismal gloom. In the rare moments where the clouds\n    part, stray sunbeams scornfully shine upon the city. There hasn't been a\n    clear day in Drakkenheim in fifteen years.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<h3>Entering the Ruins</h3>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">\n  The mist-shrouded countryside gives way to crumbling buildings and twisting\n  mud-filled streets. Entering the desolate city ruins, you pass the bloated\n  corpse of a long-dead horse. The smell of ozone fills the cold air as you walk\n  through the tattered rubble of the Outer City. Once in a while you hear a\n  barking dog, then perhaps a scream carried on the wind.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    If the player characters trigger a random encounter, instead of rolling on\n    the Outer City table, use the Ratling Scavengers or Lost Ones results.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cratered Street</h3>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">\n  This blasted street is filled with small craters.Tiny crystals glow with\n  prismatic light within each.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Characters find this location once they successfully\n    <strong>search the ruins</strong> and score two or more successful check\n    results.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    There are 6 @UUID[Actor.9Ip2Xdb0FDnrWeEh]{Haze Husks} stumbling aimlessly\n    around the craters.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Characters can extract 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) delerium chips worth 10 gp each and 3\n    ([[/r 1d6]]) delerium fragments worth 100 gp each. This takes about five to\n    ten minutes.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Disputed Claims</h3>\n<p>\n  A group of <strong>rival adventurers</strong> arrives on the site as the\n  characters extract the delerium fragments.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    They are a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc], a\n    @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.O3ABqI55Ir1du1Xa], and a\n    @UUID[Actor.8L0mVQGiB3Tbu00H]. Tailor their identities and personalities to\n    appropriately reflect your player characters. This opportunistic group tries\n    to browbeat characters into giving up the claim.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    If characters take too long deciding what to do about the haze husks, or\n    take more than four hours to find the deposit, you may decide the rival\n    adventurers have already claimed the first deposit (there are no haze husks\n    present in this case). When the characters arrive, the rivals are extracting\n    the delerium and gloat over the find. Characters who decide to move on to a\n    second deposit encounter the haze husks as normal.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The rival adventurers have had some minor success so far. They have a\n    @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs], 35 ([[/r 10d6]]) gold,\n    1d6 delerium chips, and their equipment.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Escaping the Ruins</h3>\n<p>\n  Once the characters have found their prize, don't forget to check for random\n  encounters as they leave the city! Only then may they pawn their finds in\n  Emberwood Village.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Character Advancement</h2>\n<p>\n  Once your characters complete their first successful Delerium Hunt, award them\n  sufficient experience to advance them to 3rd level.\n</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h1 class=\"chart-header\">Expeditions Onward</h1>\n      <p>\n        Take note of which faction agents the player characters interacted with\n        during their early interactions into Emberwood Village.Who did they get\n        along with?

The faction lieutenant then\n        offers the characters a mission to one of the locations detailed in\n        chapter 6 - we recommend River or Ansom send characters to the Rat's\n        Nest, and Nathaniel, Ophelia, or Blackjack Mel can send characters to\n        the Chapel of Saint Brenna.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Beyond this point, the paths the characters might take are in their\n        hands.

You'll want to refer to these mechanics throughout the campaign, alongside the appendix sections of\n  this book that detail the rules for Contamination, Delerium, the Random Encounter Tables, and of course, the City Map.\n  Finally, this chapter closes with an introductory exploration adventure: a Delerium Hunt!\n</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">City Overview</h1>\n<p>\n  Drakkenheim was a grandiose capital city famous for its many architectural wonders. The even-handed rule of House von\n  Kessel fostered a vibrant and industrious spirit that welcomed folk throughout the realm and beyond, and the city was\n  an international hub for trade and culture. Nearly a hundred thousand people called Drakkenheim home, and thousands\n  more lived in small villages and hamlets a few days' travel from the city. Only a few hundred people survived the\n  cataclysm that devastated the city, and the folk who lived in the surrounding countryside have abandoned the area for\n  safer regions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The recorded history of Drakkenheim stretches back about six hundred years, but a settlement and fortification have\n  stood here since antiquity. The city was named after its founders, the now-extinct House von Drakken. Four distinct\n  dynasties have ruled the city since, with House von Kessel claiming the throne one hundred and fifty years ago.\n</p>\n<p>Drakkenheim is divided into three main regions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The Outer City</strong>, estates, suburbs, and slums surrounding the city walls.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Inner City</strong>, protected by the City Walls and accessible through five Gates.</li>\n  <li><strong>Castle Drakken</strong>, a palace and military fortification that lies atop a high crag.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The city itself is further divided by the <strong>Drann River</strong>. Common parlance calls the two halves the North\n  Ward and the South Ward.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Streets</h2>\n<p>\n  Five major highways lead to Drakkenheim. The roads transition into the city's main streets: King's Road, Temple Road,\n  Shepherd's Way, Champion's Way, and College Street. Each passes through a correspondingly-named gate, and ranges from\n  twenty to forty feet wide with broad sidewalks along either side. Wrought-iron lamp posts and sewer drains are placed\n  throughout. They converge at Market Square. Elsewhere in the city, the common cobblestone-paved roads are twelve to\n  eighteen feet wide. Most have a narrow two-foot wide brick sidewalk. Sidestreets are often no more than ten feet wide,\n  and in other areas only a narrow alley separates the buildings. In the Outer City slums, many roads are merely\n  gravel-covered or raw dirt, though there are some stone-paved streets.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Buildings</h2>\n<p>\n  Drakkenheim is a city of stone buildings and slate spires. Many in the Inner City may be three or four storeys tall,\n  sometimes taller. Most are tightly packed townhouses built on stone ground levels, although the upper levels are often\n  made from wood, and boast fine glass windows and sturdy chimneys. Wealthier homes even feature indoor plumbing\n  directly connected to the city's water system. Dozens of smaller chapel domes and spires mark distinct boroughs in the\n  city. In contrast, the Outer City is mostly a ramshackle slum consisting of crumbling tenements, wattle and daub\n  cottages, and fieldstone shacks. However, the northern estates and the sections along major roads boast fine\n  construction similar to that of the inner city.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Drann River</h2>\n<p>\n  The Drann River is roughly four hundred feet wide and flows southwest. The water is deep, slow-moving, and thoroughly\n  contaminated. Four stone causeways span the water. Stone quays and piers surround the river within the Inner City.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Contaminated Water. </em></strong>All water in Drakkenheim is contaminated, including the Drann River.\n  Characters who end their turn in contaminated water must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one\n  level of contamination.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">City Walls</h2>\n<p>\n  Stone masonry walls forty feet high and five to ten feet thick separate the Inner City and the Outer City, with\n  entrance via five gates. These fortifications present a major obstacle when exploring the city: the five city gates\n  are occupied by faction forces or monsters, and hostile gargoyles attack any who scale the walls. Refer to the “Walls\n  of Drakkenheim” in <strong>Chapter 7: Inside the Walls of Drakkenheim</strong> for details.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Castle Drakken</h2>\n<p>\n  Atop a high cliff on the north side of town perches Castle Drakken. The fortification and palace is described in\n  chapter 9.\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />"

            "The Haze": {
              "name": "The Haze",
              "text": "<p>\n  The Haze is magical radiation emitted by the vast concentration of delerium in\n  Drakkenheim. It permeates the ruins and extends about two miles outside the\n  walls.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Effects on Characters</h2>\n<p>\n  Creatures do not gain any benefits from finishing a long rest within the Haze.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Creatures may remain in the Haze for up to twenty-four hours before they must\n  finish a long rest to recuperate from exposure to its eldritch energies. For\n  each additional hour spent within the Haze beyond twenty four hours, a\n  creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level\n  of contamination.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most monsters encountered in Drakkenheim possess the\n  <em>fully contaminated</em> trait (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>) and ignore\n  these effects.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Environmental Effects</h2>\n<p>\n  At dawn, the Haze magically manifests mist throughout the ruins. Characters\n  can see normally through the mist up to 150 feet. Vision beyond is lightly\n  obscured, but vision past 300 feet is totally obscured. Any mists dispersed\n  during the day reform ten minutes later.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The mists dampen sunlight. Creatures with\n  <strong>sunlight sensitivity</strong> or similar traits do not suffer these\n  penalties during the day while within the Haze.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The mist disperses shortly after sunset, but the Haze appears as a shifting\n  corona of octarine light shimmering over the city during the night. Floating\n  motes and hazy particles hang over the city streets providing illumination\n  akin to moonlight, and delerium crystals emit a bright glow to a range of five\n  feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The corpses of beasts and humanoid creatures do not rot within the Haze.\n  However, most unattended corpses left in the streets are devoured within a day\n  by ravenous ratlings. Other food and drink spoils after 2d6 days within the\n  Haze.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Effects on Spells</h2>\n<p>\n  The erratic magic of the Haze disrupts many spells cast within it. Any\n  teleportation spell cast by a creature outside the Haze targeting a creature\n  or location within the Haze automatically fails and the spell slot is wasted.\n  Creatures inside the Haze may teleport normally within, but any attempt to\n  leave the Haze via teleportation fails. Telepathic communications or effects\n  such as the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD] spell\n  transmitted from outside the Haze fail to contact a character within it, and\n  vice-versa. Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the Haze,\n  and those created outside the Haze can't enter it. Finally, other divination\n  spells fail to reveal useful information about delerium, the Haze, the origins\n  of the meteor, or any events that occurred within the Haze.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When a character attempts any of the above using a spell or other effect, they\n  must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they take 6d6\n  psychic damage and become incapacitated with madness until they finish a long\n  rest. During this time they speak only in gibberish. A\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk] spell ends\n  this effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ap4dmtshjEbwU3Ts],\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.NXWWWgHtWb7Nv21F], and\n  similar spells or abilities do not provide shelter or protection from the\n  Haze. However, characters may rest within a\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pn4SnsFDvYDiE6rC] spell cast\n  within the Haze.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Deep Haze</h2>\n<p>\n  Certain areas are so suffused by the Haze that mere exposure is extremely\n  dangerous and potentially fatal. Known as the Deep Haze, these areas have the\n  following additional traits:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Deep Haze is instantly recognized by a thick prismatic fog. Characters can\n    see normally through this fog up to 60 feet. Vision beyond is lightly\n    obscured, but vision past 120 feet is totally obscured. If dispersed during\n    the day, the fog reforms one minute later.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Characters entering the Deep Haze must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution\n    saving throw, and again for each full hour spent within. On a failed saving\n    throw, they suffer 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) necrotic damage and gain one level of\n    contamination.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>The Haze map</em></strong> at the back of this book indicates\n  which areas of the city are covered by the Deep Haze. Other locations suffused\n  by the Deep Haze are noted in location descriptions.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Delerium Sludge</h2>\n<p>\n  Gargantuan delerium geodes perspire an opalescent sludge. Characters submerged\n  in delerium sludge make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the start of\n  their turn. They take 42 ([[/r 12d6]]) necrotic damage on a failed saving\n  throw, and half as much on a successful one. In addition, characters who fail\n  the saving throw gain one level of contamination.\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />"

Correspondingly, navigation checks are not\n  required. Characters can locate key adventure sites without much difficulty,\n  as long as they have approximate directions and a general description of their\n  destination. Instead, the random encounter tables include several situations\n  in which the characters might make a wrong turn or become lost.\n</p>\n<h3>Moving through the Streets</h3>\n<p>\n  Ruined buildings and maze-like streets are exceptionally difficult terrain.\n  How fast characters can move on foot depends on their priority:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Fast. </em></strong>At this pace, characters advance one mile\n    per hour. They take the most direct route to their destination and move\n    openly on major streets. Characters cannot use stealth, and make Perception\n    checks with disadvantage. When checking for random encounters (see “Random\n    Encounters” later in this chapter), each character rolls twice and takes the\n    lower result.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Normal. </em></strong>At this pace, characters advance one-half\n    mile per hour. They proceed carefully through the ruins staying vigilant for\n    threats and landmarks. Characters cannot use stealth, but may make\n    Investigation and Perception checks with advantage.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Slow. </em></strong>At this pace, characters advance one-quarter\n    mile per hour to evade hostile threats. They sneak down back alleys and\n    avoid major streets. Characters may use stealth, and make Perception checks\n    normally.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Searching the Ruins</h3>\n<p>\n  Use these guidelines whenever the characters deliberately search for something\n  in the ruins, such as scavenged supplies, lost treasures, unknown locations, a\n  hidden foe, or a safe place to rest. Conducting a good search takes at least\n  one hour; during which the characters may survey an area with up to a ¼ mile\n  diameter. After one hour of searching, each character makes an Investigation\n  or Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 10 for the Outer City, DC 15 for the Inner\n  City). Exceeding the DC by 5 or more grants an additional success.

As normal, generate a random encounter if\n  characters have two or more failed check results while searching for delerium.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Characters searching within a quarter mile of the Crater's Edge receive one\n  automatic additional success due to the rich quantities of delerium found in\n  this exceptionally dangerous region.\n</p>\n<h3>Drakkenheim Sewers</h3>\n<p>\n  The Drakkenheim sewers were a sophisticated engineering marvel. The system\n  combined underground gravity-based aqueducts and drainage canals with\n  carefully placed locks and floodgates to deliver clean and fresh water to the\n  city population and draw away the massive quantities of sewage and wastewater.\n  Major canals run under the city streets, and can be accessed from the surface\n  by numerous maintenance hatches.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After over a decade of disuse, most tunnels are flooded with contaminated\n  water and many other passages have collapsed. Other sections are now monster\n  lairs. As a result, travelling in the sewers is extraordinarily hazardous and\n  ill-advised. However, characters might consider taking the sewers to locate a\n  route under the city walls, or to gain access to hidden underground dungeons\n  such as the cistern (see chapter 7) or the Court of Thieves (see chapter 8).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Sewer Navigation. </em></strong>Handle sewer navigation abstractly\n  using the same mechanics for navigating the streets above, except characters\n  move at half their normal pace through the twisting tunnels. Sewer passages\n  and access points could be almost anywhere in the city, so use the surface map\n  as an approximate guide to track the character's progress. In addition, after\n  each hour spent in the sewers characters must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution\n  saving throw or gain one level of contamination from contact with sewer water.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Searching the Sewers. </em></strong>Just as characters may search\n  the streets, they might search the sewers for hidden entrances to some\n  adventure sites. Other secret locations may be found in this manner. A DC 20\n  check result is needed for success when searching the sewer passages.\n</p>\n<h3>Other Exploration Activities</h3>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Taking a Rest. </em></strong>Before taking a short rest in the\n  ruins, characters may spend one hour locating a safe spot or hiding their\n  campsite. If they do, don't check for random encounters during their rest.\n  Note that the <strong>Haze </strong>(described above) prevents characters from\n  benefiting from a long rest in the city. Characters who attempt to do so\n  anyways check for random encounters each hour.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flying.</em></strong> Flying characters may soar across the city\n  rapidly. At your discretion, they may risk hostile attention from the\n  gargoyles defending the walls or the harpies inhabiting the Inner City.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Vehicles. </em></strong>Land vehicles are largely impractical in\n  the ruins, although characters could use a boat to travel via the river\n  normally (though at your discretion characters may risk attack from aquatic or\n  sewer-dwelling monsters!) Characters moving with a land vehicle or portaging a\n  water vehicle travel ¼ mile per hour. Land and water vehicles can't be hidden\n  without magic, but individual characters might be able to use stealth.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Finding Sustenance. </em></strong>Finding suitable sustenance\n  within Drakkenheim is difficult since most food and water within the city is\n  either spoiled or contaminated. Instead, characters should bring their own\n  supply of food and water from outside the city. Nevertheless, a character who\n  eats or drinks anything found in Drakkenheim that has not been magically\n  purified makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they gain\n  one level of contamination.\n</p>\n<h3>A Combined Approach</h3>\n<p>\n  Drakkenheim is dangerous and unpredictable. There is no such thing as a\n  foolproof plan for safely exploring the ruins. Nevertheless, characters using\n  special resources, spells, magic items, or with a very inventive plan might\n  greatly improve their navigation. For example, characters could use spells\n  such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pRMvmknwLf2tdMTj]\n  together to\n  travel quickly while remaining unseen, or perhaps\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.YBda6nLKjxdT1LbS] helps characters move\n  over the river. If they aren't expending resources, you should call for a few\n  difficult skill checks. On a failure, they stumble into a difficult random\n  encounter with extra complications.\n</p>\n<h3>Escaping the Ruins</h3>\n<p class=\"no-indent\">\n  Characters must use their resources carefully while exploring Drakkenheim, as\n  there is always a chance they'll face a random encounter or two when\n  <em>leaving</em> the ruins as well. At some point during their adventures,\n  characters might be heavily wounded and out of resources deep in the city\n  ruins. As they stagger back to Emberwood Village, they roll up a difficult\n  random encounter. This could be the one that ends it for them! Be lenient the\n  first time this happens, but merciless the second.\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n\n<img style=\"margin-left:-10px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0041_BOOK-EnteringtheSewers_AndreiaUgrai_CMYK_CUT.webp\" alt=\"\" />"

These were places of religious worship, weddings, community gatherings, and funerals, as each stands over a small crypt where common folk interred the cremated remains of the dead. However, many are also the resting place for the mummified bodies of clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame, and some even contain reliquaries for holy artefacts. The Chapel of Saint Brenna holds a particularly valuable relic whose location was unknown until recently: the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.SceT000000000024]. Now three factions seek this relic: the Followers of the Falling Fire, the Knights of the Silver Order, and the Queen's Men.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>In this adventure, characters explore the dungeon crypts under the Chapel of Saint Brenna to recover the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.SceT000000000024]. Complicating matters, at least two other factions have dispatched strike teams of their own to claim the <em>Sceptre</em>. If you wish to really challenge the characters, you could add a third! When the characters arrive, one faction team is already searching the upper level of the chapel, and another rival faction will arrive on the scene later to contest the claim. It's up to the characters to decide how to deal with these faction agents: they could fight them, trick them, sneak past them, or negotiate with them in some way.</p>\n<p>The puzzles in the crypt invite player characters to use their own creativity to develop out-of-the-box solutions, as there is no “correct” way to overcome them. However, if characters rouse the remains of the interred clerics and paladins in the process, they'll have an interesting problem on their hands as the undead will rejuvenate when destroyed unless laid to rest again properly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Adventure Hooks</h2>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>The Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio. </em></strong>Recently, a group of <strong>rival adventurers</strong> found letters and missives in another ruin that indicated the <em>Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio</em> was buried beneath the Chapel of Saint Brenna. Unfortunately, these adventurers disagreed over how to use this information and went their separate ways. They each brought the discovery to the attention of different factions. Now, the race is on to recover the <em>Sceptre</em> first! While each faction could send their own strike team to the chapel, whichever faction has the closest relationship to your party seeks out the characters' aid instead.\n</p>\n<p>A messenger from one of the factions seeks the characters out in Emberwood Village, urgently requesting them to meet with one of the following faction lieutenants:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Flamekeeper @UUID[Actor.1IaDUyBM9G4EEphL] at the Chapel of Saint Ardenna.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.fKwswI79J2z7lM0i] at the Hendrix Farm.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.btuo8mywkRo5g6M9] at the Skull &amp; Sword Taphouse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The lieutenant gets right down to business.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The characters need to act now, as other factions are already sending agents of their own.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p class=\"read-aloud\">Ophelia Reed. “We cannot allow the Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio to fall into the hands of thieves or cultists.

These mephits were originally dispatched by the Amethyst Academy to scout the ruins fifteen years ago, but gave up on their mission and made the undercroft their new home. They quite enjoy their surroundings that are filled with materials and elements similar to their own compositions. They will suffer no trespassers in their “home” unless they are given a suitable gift: a gemstone of some kind. They have little understanding of the wider world, but enjoy inflicting capricious cruelty upon human “fleshies”. However, they are terrified of anyone who wears the garb of the Amethyst Academy, and begin crying and ask for forgiveness from the character.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Winch Chambers\">[4A and 4B] Winch Chambers</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">At the centre of this small round chamber is a stout metal post three feet high and about one foot thick. There is a one-inch diameter cylindrical notch about four inches deep cut just below the topmost edge.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The posts function as winches connected to the Tomb Doors in the levels below. Winch A opens the Tomb Doors marked “A”. Turning Winch “B” opens the Tomb Doors marked “B”.</li>\n  <li>Unfortunately, there are no handles attached to the winches, which makes turning them to open the doors exceptionally difficult.</li>\n  <li>The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.eQNXan0zp279jDtk] borne by the statue in the crematory garden outside functions as a handle.</li>\n  <li>When a lever is set into the post, a character can use an action to turn the winch and open the doors.<strong></strong> A counterweight system unwinds the winches and closes the doors after one round, unless the winch is held in place (requiring an action) or the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.eQNXan0zp279jDtk] is activated.</li>\n  <li>A substitute could be fashioned if the original can't be located. A wooden lever has a fifty percent chance of breaking each round it is in use, but a metal lever works perfectly (but needs to be held in place)</li>\n  <li>\n    A character working with the right tools could jury rig a stopper or mechanism to hold the winches open with one hour of work and a\n    <strong>DC 15 Intelligence</strong> check.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The winch can still be raised without the lever. A character can use an action and make a successful\n    <strong>DC 20 Strength</strong> check, which raises it enough for a person to crawl underneath. This check must be repeated each round thereafter to hold the doors open.\n  </li>\n  <li>If the winch is released, the doors close with a crash, dealing 3d6 bludgeoning damage to anyone underneath them. It takes an action to close the doors safely using the winch.</li>\n  <li>\n    The doors could be held open onced raised. Doing so requires an action and a\n    <strong>DC 23 Strength</strong> check each round.\n  </li>\n  <li>Characters could move a suitably durable object to brace the doors open, but the doors are heavy and could break the brace. Roll a die each round, choosing a larger die for a more durable object (1d4 for a weak one, 1d12 for a strong one, ect). On a one, the bracing object breaks or snaps and the doors slam shut.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As there is only one handle between the two winches, access to the Reliquary Chamber (Area 10) normally requires opening one set of doors with one winch, closing it, then moving the handle to the other winch to open the other set of doors, then repeating the process to allow an escape. This means either splitting the party or creating an improvised solution to open all doors simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Your players might expect there to be a second immovable rod missing somewhere, and will likely spend some time searching for it.

However, the factions still regard the characters as neutral mercenaries at this stage of the campaign. Faction agents clash with adventurers all the time in the ruins, so becoming outright enemies of either faction should only occur if the characters incite serious altercations and violence by keeping the sceptre for themselves.

The first strike team sent won't be ordered to slay the characters, but they will rough them up badly and take the scepter. If this strike team is defeated or killed, the characters might risk further escalation with one of the factions.

Instead of improving her talents, her wish granted her immortality by binding her life and talents to her piano, not unlike the relationship between a lich and its phylactery.

After this point, when a trapped creature looks outside the Black Ivory Inn, they see a time-lost version of Drakkenheim instead of the present-day ruins.</li>\n  <li>Characters trapped within the time loop are visible to outsiders only while they remain inside the Black Ivory Inn; they can't be perceived otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Effects of the Time Loop</h3>\n<p>The loop itself behaves like a pocket dimension or demiplane. The anomaly constantly plays out the last four hours and thirty-three minutes before the meteor struck in a time loop capturing the events from 3:40 PM to 8:13 PM on September 16th.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Characters are instantly killed by the meteor at the end of each loop at 8:13 PM.</li>\n  <li>After the death or incapacitation of the entire party (whether at the end of the loop or by some other means) they awaken again at 3:40 PM.</li>\n  <li>The characters are restored to full hit points and receive the benefits of a long rest. Any bodily damage is restored, no matter how severe. The characters retain whichever items were in their possession the moment they entered the Black Ivory Inn, but lose any items or equipment they picked up since then. As such, items that characters brought with them but used during the previous loop are restored!</li>\n  <li>Characters who consumed any food or drink within the Black Ivory Inn during the previous loop must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, they temporarily lose their awareness of being stuck in a time loop until reminded by someone else what has happened to them.</li>\n  <li>Each time the time loop repeats or the characters are killed, each character must succeed on a DC 5 Intelligence saving throw or gain a random form of indefinite of Drakkenheim Madness.</li>\n  <li>Time continues to pass for those outside the loop. A creature trapped in the loop for over a year of real-world time loses their memories and becomes bound to the loop forever. They die and crumble to dust if the loop ends, and then may only be restored via a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz] spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Escaping the Loop</h3>\n<p>A character may escape the loop via @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz] or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz] but teleportation spells directed outside the demiplane fail. Characters might also be able to convince Miss Charlotte to let them leave.</p>\n<h3>Breaking the Loop</h3>\n<p>\n  The time loop ends if the @UUID[Actor.BezicP0b3wmU2u4p] and the\n  <strong>piano</strong> are both destroyed. When this happens the Black Ivory Inn and its patrons slowly erode into black ash. All that are left behind are the characters, and the five other visitors (or their corpses, if they did not survive the final loop). Little else remains of the Black Ivory Inn save rubble and ruin - it now appears as it should for a building struck by a meteor. There is a path through the rubble to the Smuggler's Warehouse below. The debris can be cleared away to re-open the underground tunnel.\n</p>\n<h3>Key Events</h3>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">“Miss Charlotte is the greatest pianist of all time.”</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The time loop begins at 3:40 PM</li>\n  <li>Miss Charlotte plays all afternoon into the evening.</li>\n  <li>At 7pm she takes a break from playing. She sits at the bar and chats with patrons, enjoying a glass of wine and a small meal for thirty minutes.</li>\n  <li>The meteor strikes at 8:13 PM, shortly after dusk. In this moment, a meteor chunk impales Miss Charlotte, no matter where she is located at that time.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p class=\"read-aloud\">There is a wash of dust and ash, and you open your eyes to thunderous applause as Charlotte finishes her first set.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once inside the Black Ivory Inn, characters see Drakkenheim as it was fifteen years ago, in the late afternoon of September 16, 1111.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Miss Charlotte</h2>\n<p>Miss Charlotte is a willowy woman with slender limbs and delicate fingers. She wears a simple green gown, and keeps her hair tied in a bun behind her head. She gracefully plays the piano in an enraptured trance.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Ideal.</strong> To play music is all I've ever wanted, it's all I've ever had, it's everything I'll ever need, and the only thing I have left. Please don't take that from me.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bond.</strong> Artists ought to be free to share their gifts with the world. I admire any artist who has the same passion and skill for their craft as I do for mine.</li>\n  <li><strong>Flaw</strong>. I cannot bear what has happened, and the truth fills me with rage and anger. Instead, I will surround myself with music and mirth until the end of time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Miss Charlotte and the piano are immune to all damage as long as the abomination has one hit point or more. In addition, as long as the abomination has at least one hit point, when Miss Charlotte fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.</p>\n<p>When Miss Charlotte plays a chord on the piano (as an action), the abomination rejuvenates with all its hit points.</p>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">“I remember you… you caused a bit of trouble last time you were here. Just try to relax and enjoy the music.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Tavern Patrons</h2>\n<p>Most patrons encountered within the Black Ivory Inn are hopelessly lost and cannot comprehend their current predicament. They are dimly aware of what is going on, but have endured so much madness it has crushed their actual will. Tales about meteors and time loops are met with laughter or bewilderment, which quickly turns to outrage and disgust if the player characters pursue it. Even proof such as delerium shards or uncanny foreknowledge fails to rouse them from their stupor.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>There's roughly 35 ([[/r 10d6]]) human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc]{Nobles} enjoying music, coffee, food, and accommodations at the Black Ivory Inn, with a staff of 7 ([[/r 2d6]]) more @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners} who work as cooks, porters, and housekeepers alongside the notable figures below.</li>\n  <li>These people are forever lost to the time loop, and die when it ends. They never leave the inn, nor have any recollection or understanding of the time loop.</li>\n  <li>The tavern patrons defend Miss Charlotte if she's attacked. They can't perceive the @UUID[Actor.BezicP0b3wmU2u4p].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>“Open” Mike Connolly.</em></strong> The owner of the Black Ivory Inn is a rotund human @UUID[Actor.RSVYdtx9l6jQkjiV] with blonde slicked back hair, a curly moustache and a set of round framed glasses, dressed in a red velvet coat. He is often found sitting close to the stage admiring the musicians. Though he knows about the illicit activities happening beneath his bar, he doesn't discuss the smuggler's tunnel openly with anyone he hasn't met before, but mentioning his young nephew Mel sparks his attention. Mike has the key to both the cellar doors and the smuggler's tunnel, which he keeps on a key ring on his belt.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Rogan Blum</em></strong>. The well-dressed bartender of the Black Ivory Inn is a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.13K3XK2A3wwxVKLD]. Rogan will listen to any tale of woe and regret from a paying customer, and his advice seems staggeringly insightful two or three drinks in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Phifer Winters.</em></strong> A young human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq] serves drinks and coffee with a warm smile and a friendly compliment. Though she's often too busy working to chat, she'll excitedly talk about her aspirations to one day sail the Diamond Sea and travel to distant lands.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Reginald Grimes.</em></strong> This human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq] is approaching his seventies, but still cooks in the kitchen of the Black Ivory Inn. He takes great pride in his culinary work and is completely unable to tolerate criticism of his cooking. He deems each meal he makes a work of art.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Smuggler's Ring</h2>\n<p>A group of smugglers.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>3 ([[/r 1d6]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY]{Bandit Captains} and 14 ([[/r 4d6]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN]{Bandits}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Captain Wicket is a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY] who has an old pirate hat and blue coat on. He is holding a meeting for his men about the next job they are doing in the basement meeting room in the Black Ivory Inn. He has three trusted commanders and a gang of thieves who have come to meet him here. He has requested that no one disturb their meeting. Detailed below is his crew:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Left Hand Lila: a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY] with a hook for aright hand</li>\n  <li>Mr. Big: A gnome @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY] with a devilish smirk and a knack for dramatic plans</li>\n  <li>Wind: an albino tiefling @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY] with bright red eyes, black hair and huge horns</li>\n  <li>Ted Oats: a budding criminal with short black hair, eager for this job</li>\n  <li>Fred Oats: the twin brother of Ted with long black hair, defensive of his brother</li>\n</ul>\n\n<br /><br />\n<div class=\"map-frame\">\n  <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/Black_Ivory_Inn_map.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trapped Visitors</h2>\n<p>There are five people who have become trapped here recently whom the characters' actions may jolt back into awareness. Though they have forgotten themselves, they can be roused from their stupor by reminding them of present events.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Osiris Chronolly.</em></strong> A long-bearded and purple-robed Amethyst Academy @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE] who came to the Black Ivory Inn following a long-lost rumour that the legendary musician had gained her talents by making a wish. He, however, begrudgingly refuses any idea that he is trapped in a time loop unless some sort of irrefutable evidence can be placed before him. Once presented with proof, he speculates that breaking the loop will set recent arrivals free, but suspects those who were here when the time loop was created are lost forever.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Aaron Grint.</em></strong> This middle-aged @UUID[Actor.02VvEfOHseDs38Jm] of the Hooded Lanterns used to come to the Black Ivory Inn during his youth, and was a big fan of Miss Charlotte. He sits in a corner with his hood up smoking a pipe. He blissfully believes he has returned to his lost youth and has forgotten the horrors he witnessed in the Civil War. The return of his memories drives him into a rage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Anika Patel.</em></strong> This human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO] of the Silver Order devours meal after meal while enjoying the music. She has forgotten that she came to Drakkenheim to fight with the Silver Order, and now believes her oath is to protect Miss Charlotte. Anika is willing to help, but is bewildered by the idea of a time loop. It takes extreme convincing for her to accept the concept. Regardless, she stands up to quell any violence that breaks out in the tavern.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Balthazar Adamos. </strong></em>This human @UUID[Actor.jWBa5w2c7C1CY899] of the Falling Fire came to the Black Ivory Inn to investigate the haunting music. He doesn't drink, so he's maintained his memories through several loops already, and his inability to escape is driving him mad. Balthazar has now claimed a room upstairs and locked himself inside. He becomes crazed if someone mentions the time loop to him, but is terrified that ending the loop will mean his death. He came to Drakkenheim to participate in the Sacrament of the Falling Fire, and believes if he dies his soul will forever wander in darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Fate Hope. </em></strong>A human @UUID[Actor.RSVYdtx9l6jQkjiV] clad in the colours of the Queen's Men, Fate arrived at the Black Ivory Inn looking for the smugglers tunnel. After talking to a few of the patrons, she sat at the bar to have a drink and lost her memories. She now spends each loop knocking back a few pints at the bar.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-frame\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:250px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0059_BOOK_Card_Box_CMYk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Area Details</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Approach</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">From the outside, the Black Ivory Inn appears perfectly normal. The sounds of beautiful music can be heard from a block away and the lights are all on. The sounds of revelry and clanging glasses are heard within, drawing those who wander by towards the inn. The inn itself is a small square building two storeys tall with a porch that wraps fully around it. It has a sign hanging above the door that reads “Black Ivory Inn, Come for a drink, Stay for the company.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Inn</h2>\n<p data-scroll=\"The Piano Bar\">\n  <strong><em>The Piano Bar. </em></strong>Richly appointed with velvet curtains and gleaming varnished tables, each set with a candle in a glass bowl. Two well-dressed wait staff and the well-groomed bartender smile warmly.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Stage\">\n  <strong><em>Stage.</em></strong> Upon a candlelit stage in the far corner of the room stands a jet black piano with glistening white keys. <strong>Miss Charlotte</strong> is found here playing most of the time.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The piano has AC 15 and 30 hit points. It is immune to non-magical damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-scroll=\"Kitchens and Pantries\">\n  <strong><em>Kitchens and Pantries. </em></strong>Most of the meals served at the Black Ivory Inn were prepared foods purchased from local bakers, farmers, and butchers.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Scullery\">\n  <strong><em>Scullery.</em></strong> Washing rooms for laundry.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Inn Rooms\">\n  <strong><em>Inn Rooms.</em></strong> Several comfortable inn rooms each with two beds, a chest of drawers, a small table, and an armchair. Several also include a wardrobe or baths. A common privy on each floor is kept clean and fresh.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Basement</h2>\n<p data-scroll=\"Storage Cellar\">\n  <strong><em>Storage Cellar. </em></strong>This mundane cellar is stocked with a few kegs of ale, and has a large wall filled with fine wines of various ages and assortments. Most of them are Crownland wines from the north vineyard of Drakkenheim. Many jars and crates of preserved foods and dried fruits and berries can also be found, along with sacks of grains and flour, and a few household tools and appliances. At the back of the cellar is an old oak door with a padlock on it.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Gambling Den\">\n  <strong><em>Gambling Den. </em></strong>This room is clearly appointed for preparing smuggling operations and as a place for secret communication, planning, or illegal gambling to take place. The room is sparse of decorations save for a few round tables and some of the older stools from upstairs. The tables are laid out with decks of cards, bottles of booze, and even a map pinned on the wall that details the underground passages, smugglers' tunnels and sewer systems of Drakkenheim. Currently there is a private meeting happening down here between Captain Wicket and his squad. One of the bandit captains stands at the door to make sure they aren't disturbed as they lay out plans for smuggling a rare painting into Drakkenheim to sell to a fence procuring rare art for a local exhibit. The crew are hostile towards unwanted guests and tell any who come near that they are having a private meeting and they best go back upstairs before they start trouble.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Smugglers Warehouse\">\n  <strong><em>Smuggler's Warehouse.</em></strong> The Smuggler's Warehouse is in disarray. There are smashed crates and a spray of gold coins across the floor. A shelf along the wall has toppled over and splintered along the ground. Along the far wall is an inconspicuous set of thick wooden doors that are locked with a large padlock. In the corner of the room is the @UUID[Actor.BezicP0b3wmU2u4p]. It is a massive mound of flesh occupying the upper corner of the room, with sticky fleshy tendrils clinging to the various walls and surfaces around it. It looks like it's spreading outwards towards the door - it has grown and caked over the smuggler's tunnel doors almost completely, and one can make out bits of debris, wood, and gold that have been enveloped by the spreading horror.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Stuck in the side of the creature is the remnant of a grand piano, and on the front of the creature one can make out a feminine face, twisted in horror, with glowing octarine eyes and a gaping mouth. The abomination has several other eyes and mouths around it that all moan and cry as one approaches. Its' eyes become fixed on anyone who enters the room.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-scroll=\"Underground Tunnel\">\n  <strong><em>Underground Tunnel. </em></strong>The smuggler's tunnel is a long straight tunnel that goes on as far as one can see. It is lined with occasional torches.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A small satchel hanging on the wall has a scroll of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.CAxSzHWizrafT033] and a scroll of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.1nhIxh0DsJsntCfj].</li>\n  <li>The tunnel connects to the Old Town cistern beneath Slaughterstone Square.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>“In the deepest parts of the city, the Haze is as thick as pea soup...if only it tasted like it.”</p>\n  <cite>— Veo Sjena</cite>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Time-Lost Streets</h2>\n<p>A trapped victim exiting the Black Ivory Inn enters into an illusory version of Drakkenheim as it was fifteen years ago. Once victims travel out of line of sight of the Black Ivory Inn, they immediately appear back before the inn again as if the streets themselves looped back around. All the doors and windows of all the buildings seem to open into a crudely rendered room, but when entered, a character appears back in the taproom of the Black Ivory Inn.</p>\n<p>The folk walking the streets are merely phantasms with dim awareness. They repeat only a few short phrases such as “Lovely day today, isn't it.” “Strange thing in the sky, that.” or “I'll be on my way, then…” If attacked or damaged, theydie, and the others scream and run.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h1 class=\"sidebar-title\">Developments</h1>\n      <p>\n        <strong><em>Check out anytime you'd like. </em></strong>With the protean abomination destroyed, the inn returns to the state it was meant to be in. The creature dissolves into nothing but a pile of goo and within it rests a chunk of meteoric iron with 2d4 fragments of delerium embedded in it. The ceiling of the inn has mostly collapsed from the impact and a clear hole in the floor leads directly into the basement where the abomination lay. The inn lies in shambles, another nondescript ruin of Drakkenheim. But, the entrance to the smugglers tunnel is still very much intact, and Open Mike's corpse can be found amongst the bodies of the patrons. The key to the smuggler's tunnel is safely fastened on his belt.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong><em>A Safe Passage. </em></strong>The smuggler's tunnel now lays open to the players. The players can choose to use this tunnel that leads them directly to the cistern below Slaughterstone Square without provoking a random encounter. They come out from an inconspicuous grate in the floor of the cistern that the monsters of Drakkenheim seem to have overlooked. Once there, the sewers function as normal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <em><strong>Thankful Pilgrim. </strong></em>If he survives, the priest is endlessly thankful to be rid of the Black Ivory Inn and to still be alive and offers the party a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.aDHRuUs29SrumWfq] or an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.TZggpdbOYqOCG7mY]. He asks if they would accompany him to Saint Selina's Monastery. He would most like to introduce them to @UUID[Actor.tqJK1mzxPst0xV08] and speak highly of their courageous and heroic deeds. He latches on to the characters, believing them to be the prophesied heroes that the book of Falling Fire spoke of.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong><em>Friendly Factions. </em></strong>The other survivors are all a little dazed from their time spent in the inn, confused and in shock of the grim reality they have just been awoken into. They all thank the characters and agree to speak highly of them to their leaders and commanders. If the characters made enemies of any of the survivors, or if they boldly helped them or rescued them, those stories are brought back to the factions they represented.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>"

They aren't immune to contamination, but they may rest in Drakkenheim normally. Oscar Yoren is working on how to reproduce these results, but his current method requires several years of risky and intense self-exposure to delerium.</p>\n<p>Oscar Yoren and his apprentices are secretive, but not outwardly hostile if characters approach them peacefully. Instead, the apprentices offer to sell the characters potions. They admit characters into the dining room to talk, but not further into the manor. The apprentices do business in a curt yet cordial manner (see “Potion Brewery” below).</p>\n<p>When he meets with the characters personally, Oscar Yoren bluntly demands to know who sent them. He staunchly refuses to work with anyone who admits to working with the Amethyst Academy or the Silver Order, and asks them firmly to leave. Otherwise, he sees an opportunity. He plans to use the characters to recover delerium, monster parts, and arcane reagents for him so he can advance his research, and then conveniently dispose of them once they become troublesome.</p>\n<p>Oscar Yoren uses his research as leverage, revealing some of his discoveries about delerium as proof of his knowledge (see the sidebar on “Oscar Yoren's Research”). In exchange for ensuring his freedom, sparing his life, and making fair payment in coin and delerium, he offers to create @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.AquT000000000001] for the characters. He overstates the efficacy of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.AquT000000000001], but does not reveal its side effects. He scoffs at the idea that anyone else could create the potion. Yoren does not willingly give up his writings or formulas under any circumstances.

The long, thin windows are boarded over from the outside, but light flickers within the first floor. Several chimneys rise up from the slate-shingle rooftop, a light trail of smoke billowing from each. A collapsed small outbuilding, perhaps once a stable or shed, borders the yard. Sweeping around the estate grounds, there are two doors leading into the manor from the back. Both have been nailed shut with rotting planks.</p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">A short cobblestone pathway leads through the yard up to a small set of steps leading to the central double doors. A large, round iron knocker hangs on each. Before the doors is a fountain. The central decorative statue has crumbled away into the basin, which is filled with brackish rainwater and algae. A singular obese toad basks beside the water, croaking loudly.</p>\n</section>\n<ul>\n  <li>There is a secret entrance to the lower level hidden in the bushes. Any physical inspection within five feet discovers it, but it's sealed with an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP] spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Groundskeepers</h3>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">Outside the manor are two hulking figures wearing heavy brown overcoats, and both have hoods drawn up over their bandaged faces. One stands listlessly at the front gate, while the other lumbers in a patrol around the manor grounds.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A pair of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.RenLfmDT2XlbCF4x]{Ogre Zombies} patrol the grounds. One stands at the gate. If approached, they lurch around and growl “What… you… want…” then wait for a reply.</li>\n  <li>The zombies respond to any mention of “potions” by replying “follow… this… way…” and escort characters to the front door. They knock loudly three times, which signals Marco and Gemma to answer the door and talk business.</li>\n  <li>Otherwise, the zombies reply “You… not… welcome… here… go… away…”</li>\n  <li>After issuing the warning, the zombies attack one round later unless they are ordered to stand down by Oscar Yoren or one of his apprentices. They're ordered to cry out loudly when they do, which automatically alerts the manor occupants that something is amiss. The zombies only leave the manor grounds to pursue a foe making ranged attacks against them.</li>\n  <li>The toad is Yoren's @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.bwtkdzavdNHISgp4] familiar, Drovik.

Furniture draped in dust-covered cloth has been pushed aside to make space for two crowded tables set with alembics, burners, distillers, and other equipment for brewing potions. A bubbling cauldron hangs in the fireplace. Strings of herbs dangle from the ceiling, and jars of ingredients are scattered about the shelves alongside racks of empty or half-filled vials. An acrid scent fills the room.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Marco, Bolter, Gemma, and Taryn work here during the day.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Treasure</em></strong>. Enough tools to assemble an herbalist's kit, a poisoner's kit, and alchemical supplies can be scavenged from the equipment here.

A black marble mantelpiece above the fireplace has a framed family portrait mounted above it. Lining the wood-paneled walls are broken wooden cabinets that contain cracked dishes, silverware, and empty candlesticks. Iron chandeliers hang from the dark mahogany ceiling above a long dining table carved from redwood. Chairs surround the table, with a tall and elaborate chair at each end. The remains of several meals lie scattered about the table.</p>\n<p class=\"read-aloud left\" data-scroll=\"Kitchen\"><strong>[6] Kitchen.</strong> The kitchen is well-stocked and kept in good order, suggesting frequent use.

Attached to the ceiling is a ramshackle mechanical construction consisting of a dozen metallic arms with adjustable joints and knobs: some end in clamps, blades, syringes, magnifying glasses, lenses, or lanterns. Shelves in this room are stocked with an assortment of occult tomes, vials of alchemical reagents, sealed jars containing disfigured body parts suspended in vile preserving fluids, and glass bowls holding glowing delerium shards.</p>\n<p>A large writing desk is littered with scrawled diagrams and stacks of notebooks, and other tables are overflowing with an assortment of alchemical equipment.

The process takes some time; weeks, months, years even. I only discovered this by closely observing wild samples near my new home. They do not grow outside the Haze. I wonder if this means there are new delerium deposits in the ruins… perhaps there is more now than when the meteor originally fell.”</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p class=\"read-aloud left\">Notes on using delerium crystals. “Just as one cannot make a mast from a thousand saplings, a thousand small shards of delerium are nothing compared to a single large geode. Bigger crystals contain exponentially more arcane power. Fracturing the rock is a wasteful endeavor, as it causes valuable samples to lose their great magical potential. Delerium crystals and geodes are ideally suited for great spells and ambitious magical constructions. However, it has been difficult to find these specimens in the outer ruins. Nevertheless, small twigs are good for kindling, to set a fire, to keep one warm… and so the small shards make excellent alchemical reagents and arcane inks.”</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p class=\"read-aloud left\">On the alchemical properties of Haze-grown flora. “The warping effects of delerium have caused new plants and animals to flourish in the city. A half-mad straggler returned from Queen's Park bearing a wondrous flower - an eldritch lily. The pollen and petals soak in contamination to fuel its own germination. Combined with other rare ingredients, I believe it may prove an ideal remedy against contamination.”</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p class=\"read-aloud left\"><strong>Aqua expurgo formula.</strong> Oscar Yoren has developed a formula for <em>aqua expurgo</em>, a magical potion that protects against contamination (see Appendix D). However, it requires eldritch lilies from Queen's Park Garden. He needs more samples to refine the formula before he can start producing doses of the potion.</p>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Oscar Yoren's research is extremely valuable. Chief amongst them is his formula for @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.AquT000000000001]. This potent defense against the Haze will permit characters to explore much more dangerous areas in the city. The Hooded Lanterns, Queen's Men, and Amethyst Academy would deeply desire this new potion so they can advance their plans inside Drakkenheim.</p>\n      <p>The player characters themselves can study Oscar Yoren's research. Any character capable of casting 3rd level spells or higher can learn to make @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.AquT000000000001] themselves (see the magic items section for details). However, a key ingredient for the potion is an <em>eldritch lily</em>, which only blooms in Queen's Park. If characters want to create this potion, they'll need to mount an expedition to the Inner City to collect this key ingredient.</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>If the Amethyst Academy obtains the formula, they'll begin producing the potion on a periodic basis. The main constraint is the supply of eldritch lilies. This prevents the Amethyst Academy from manufacturing vast quantities of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.AquT000000000001]. They'll ask characters to obtain samples, and if possible, seeds or full plants. This way they can attempt to cultivate the flower themselves.</li>\n        <li>The Hooded Lanterns might suggest turning over the research to the Amethyst Academy as a possible inroad to an alliance. They're also willing to work with Oscar Yoren and continue providing him with protection and materials.</li>\n        <li>The @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] wants to ensure that these secrets remain known only to her for the time being. She may ask characters to kidnap Oscar Yoren for her so she can force him into making the potion for her own use.</li>\n        <li>The Silver Order is divided over the potion: it's useful, but involves making use of contaminated flora and delerium. They defer to the characters on whether or not to use or destroy it, but don't produce it themselves.</li>\n        <li>The Followers of the Falling Fire possess their own means of guarding against contamination, so they have no interest in the research.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>If Oscar Yoren survives, but was attacked or mistreated by the characters (or later discovers they deceived him), he will plot his revenge against them. He won't act on these plans until he obtains eldritch lilies, and tries to convince characters to bring him more delerium and other resources, citing the needs for it to further his own work. In truth, he starts using these items to conjure demons, create undead, and conspire against the characters.</p>\n      <p>If Oscar Yoren dies, the Amethyst Academy approaches the characters about buying his brain and manuscripts (even if the characters were not working for the Academy originally).</p>\n      <p>If Oscar Yoren is killed and his research is destroyed or abandoned, the formula for creating @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.AquT000000000001] is lost. However, a player character or another group could also develop the formula again later in the campaign by studying samples of eldritch lilies.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <img style=\"position:absolute;margin:auto;left:0;right:0;bottom:-25px;max-width:35px;z-index:51;transform:rotate(60deg)\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0045_BOOK_Delirium_Crystal_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</aside>\n\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0092_BOOK__Oscar_Yoren_Lab_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />"

Decades ago, these were the choice watering holes for lower-class labourers, sweat-soaked craftspeople, and assorted scoundrels who inhabited Drakkenheim. Today, Buckledown Row is a hub for outlaws, outcasts, scavengers, and worse. The taverns are mostly intact, and close enough to the edge of town for a band of rough-and-tumble ruffians to make the trek easy enough, but still far enough into the city to dissuade others from following. Ever since the Queen of Thieves brought the gangs under her influence, the street has been controlled by the Queen's Men: bandits and brigands meet here on neutral ground, join in revelry together, trade with fences and smugglers, and only occasionally slit each other's throats. There's few rules and even less order. Flowing ale and gold tend to calm the most violent disputes, but for anything else the hidden fighting pit is the perfect place to settle feuds, make some bets, and lose a few teeth.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>On the surface, Buckledown Row might appear to be the stronghold for the Queen's Men in Drakkenheim. It's certainly a gathering point for the gangs and a hub for illicit activity, and the characters just might be able to make contact with the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] here. Alternatively, they might just want to crack some skulls in the fighting ring!</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Adventure Hooks</h2>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Rules of Buckledown Row. </strong></em>Characters might hear rumours about Buckledown Row, especially if they frequent the Skull &amp; Sword Taphouse in Emberwood Village. If they have been working with @UUID[Actor.btuo8mywkRo5g6M9], he'll even suggest the characters test their might in the fighting pits. He offers to sponsor them as a fighting team and act as their manager (for an equal cut of the winnings, of course!). If they're interested, he encourages them to travel there with him. He'll be sure to set up a good matchup! Blackjack Mel explains that anyone who proves themselves in the Buckledown Row fighting pit wins the honor to face the Queen of Thieves' personal champion in her secret arena (located in the Court of Thieves). It's the only surefire way to meet the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe], and she's even proclaimed that she'll grant one personal favour to anyone who can defeat her champion. Of course, no one's actually managed to beat them yet...\n</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Interactions</h1>\n<p>The Queen of Thieves makes an appearance in Buckledown Row, usually appearing for a few hours on a Friday or Saturday evening to watch the best fights.</p>\n<p>The bandits that fill the streets and taverns might not notice strangers, but also are not afraid to stab or steal from anyone who seems like they don't belong.</p>\n<p>Asking around the taverns and streets, it's easy to gather that the fighting pits below the taverns are the way people around here get known. Many of the fighters in the pits are renowned legends amongst the gangs. Anyone who can defeat the other fighters gets to take a crack at the Queen's champion in the royal fighting pits. Beat the champion, and you get a private audience with the Queen.</p>\n<p>The five taverns in Buckledown Row are all filled with various gangs of the Queen's Men. Around every corner is gambling, cards, dice, and occasionally people brawling openly in the streets. A body being thrown out a window, or the sound of shattering glass or splintering wood are so common that they become almost part of the backdrop of the place. Everyone here is a little rough around the edges and if you stick out too much you'll draw a lot of unwanted attention.</p>\n<p>Consult the Outlaws and Scoundrels from the Queen's Men Dossier for some of the symbols and characters to fill out the taverns. The gangs all mingle here but usually each gang has a preferred tavern that their leader can be found in, and a few characteristics to help bring any NPCs to life.</p>\n<p>If the party manages to fit in without drawing unwanted attention, the gangs pay them no mind above anyone else. The gangs are gaining so many members that if you are in Buckledown Row, most assume you ought to be there. Discussing other factions, or any plans or adventures that seem suspicious, might arouse the attention of people nearby. Also if the party is acting awkward or nervous, this may draw attention - it may also help their cause to dress in appropriate gang attire or to have symbols of a gang on their gear. Again, the Outlaws and Scoundrels detailed in the Queen's Men Dossier can provide information the party might gather to help them disguise themselves or hatch a plan to fit in. If the party openly approaches a gang leader without invitation, they may gain some attention as well, but most of the leaders are eager to hear out anyone bold enough to approach them and will engage with the party in amused curiosity. Otherwise the gangs accept the characters as more new recruits and try and encourage them with drinking, games, sometimes a fight, or a game of cards. Or maybe trying to push them to join the fighting pits below.</p>\n<br /><br />\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:300px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0061_BOOK_Maps_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Area Details</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Buckledown Row</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">Roughshod fences and makeshift barricades block off this muddy street of ramshackle taverns. Crudely made bridges stretch between the rooftops, and crooked street lamps glow brightly in the mists. Laughter, cheering, and a general uproar echo down the alleys from a motley assortment of thugs, ruffians, cutthroats, and scoundrels who drink, gamble, and traffic down the street. Keen-eyed sharpshooters look down from the lookout posts, and a pair of muscled bruisers stand watch outside the ramparts.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>At any time, 21 ([[/r 6d6]]) @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN]{Bandits} stroll the streets, and 5 ([[/r 2d4]]) @UUID[Actor.RSVYdtx9l6jQkjiV]{Scoundrels} lurk upon the rooftops. A pair of Bugbear @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.J8xjoG4Dxb8WkHtV] are posted at each entrance. They'll drive off anyone who looks like a member of the Hooded Lanterns or the Silver Order, but they let anyone else through.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If conflict with the factions is escalating, 1d4 Queen's Men strike teams might be posted around Buckledown Row in case of trouble.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Wishing Well\">Wishing Well</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">An ancient moss-covered fieldstone well rests on a terrace behind one of the taverns. Upon a skeleton nailed to a gnarled tree nearby is a crudely-painted sign that reads “Make a Wish”. Peering down the well reveals an impenetrable gloom.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Each week, representatives from each of the hundred gangs of the Queen's Men deposit their tribute to the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] here by dropping a marked satchel of gold or gems down the well. Each outfit pays a sum of 100 gold or more, depending on their arrangements with the Queen.</li>\n  <li>The gangs don't know what happens afterwards, but the Queen always knows when someone misses a payment.</li>\n  <li>\n    The bottom of the well is concealed by a permanent @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.nslx2nT3p4lNkmdp] and a silent @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.7p9IuWrSWFgfyQo2] spell, but their magic has been hidden with the arcanist's\n    <em>magic aura</em> spell. Below is a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.rvxGvcUzoQXVNbAu] that collects the tribute.\n  </li>\n  <li>In secret, the Queen of Thieves herself arrives invisibly throughout the week to collect her tribute. She always leaves behind a sack of gold. This “float” is used by the Queen to track down anyone who robs her: since she once possessed the gold, she will <em>scry</em> upon the coins to locate any thief who rips her off.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Sweaty Bugbear\">Sweaty Bugbear</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">This small ramshackle taphouse is little more than a dank hole in the wall. Almost literally. The door is missing and the wall where the entrance was has been blasted away to leave just a gaping hole that people come and go through. No signage seems to exist but in the large window next to the blasted entrance is the cook of the place. There is a smoking grill where a large bugbear named Brian is cooking some charred-looking meat; he is wet with sweat caused by the heat of the grill. Baskerville, the leader of the Howlin' Dogs gang, sits at a table in the corner with cushioned seats, a bottle of mead in hand and talking with some scary-looking thieves. There is a game of knife throwing happening in the back. There also seems to be a gnome in a top hat strapped to the target they are throwing knives at.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The knife throwing thugs are willing to let anyone join. If you hit the gnome, you lose. If you hit between his legs it's 20 points. Between an arm and leg is 10, and between an arm and his head is 30. They also explain that the gnome tried to skim 400gp off a payment to Baskerville and so he's on the board tonight.</li>\n  <li>Baskerville is amused by anyone coming to talk to him and listens to whatever they have to say. However if it doesn't involve smashing, killing, or getting rich, he laughs at the intrusion and waves them away. If anyone in the party looks tough, he challenges them to arm wrestle for fun and wants to bet 20 gold on it.</li>\n  <li>If anyone wants to join the Howlin' Dogs, as long as they have renown with the Queen's Men, Baskerville offers any strong and tough looking characters a place if they can beat his Fighting Pit champion, Bloodhound.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"map-frame\">\n  <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/gm_maps/buckledown_row.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Sneaky McGee\">Sneaky McGee's</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">A large neon-painted sign of a ram skull with swirling designs and patterns inside it is posted on the front of this old building. It's three storeys high and has balconies all along the top two floors, with a large wooden door that has a cobra motif on it. Inside the tavern there are several small private booths with tables and seating for four to six people. At the far end of the tavern is a small stage where some rough looking scoundrels are playing instruments and riling the place up. A long bar along one side has a row of red-velvet-topped stools contrasting against the dark almost black wood of the bar. A dwarf woman behind the bar named Reeda Blackstone is polishing glasses. She is friendly, kind-hearted, and welcoming to any who come through the door. Everyone who orders a drink from her tips her one gold and says “Thank you Reeda.” Above the bar is a wall of swords and daggers, all stuck in place in an array of metal and leather. The entire wall is just thousands of blades. Sitting at the end of the bar is Veronica Venom and her gang.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>People in the tavern will tell you that Reeda may seem nice, but she's a ruthless killer and used to be one of the most notorious assassins in Westemär before she retired. Everyone respects her, and she demands respect.</li>\n  <li>If the characters order anything from Reeda without tipping her a gold piece , or dont say “Thank you Reeda,” she grabs them and asks “Are you new in town honey? You seem lost.” before motioning for Veronica to come over. This usually grabs everyone in the tavern's attention. If the characters don't smooth-talk their way out, there could be blood.</li>\n  <li>Veronica ignores anyone who approaches her that she didn't invite. If she notices anyone who looks stealthy and like they have a killer instinct, she may ask one of her gang members to go invite that character and that character alone over. She offers the character a spot in her gang if they can defeat her champion, Mamba Jones.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>“Never turn up your nose to a good meal in Drakkenheim, you never know what your next one will have to be...”</p>\n  <cite>— Veo Sjena</cite>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Padlock Tavern\">Padlock Tavern</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The door to this tavern is covered top to bottom in keys of various shapes and sizes. Gold, silver, bronze, copper, some rusted, some shining. All manner of keys adorn the door. Upon entering the tavern one can see the walls are covered in padlocks of equally varying shapes and sizes. A bunch of round tables fill the centre of this building. And although two stories tall, there is no upstairs save for a small balcony and a spiral staircase going up to it. A man sits up on the balcony in an animal fur coat with a large purple mohawk. The tavern is filled with leather clad bandits with spike studded armour and chains hanging from all over their gear. There is a lot of hollering and it seems a fight is breaking out every couple minutes somewhere in the place. There is a small corner bar with a shelf of various bottles of alcohol spanning both storeys from floor to ceiling. A long rickety ladder transcends the shelves on a wheeled system so it can slide back and forth across the many types of alcohol. Three goblins work the bar. One on the ladder, the other below catching and tossing bottles, and one making the drinks and sliding them down the bar to whoever catches them. People don't seem to ask questions, the goblins seem to make whatever mix of booze suits them and toss it down the bar to whoever catches it. Occasionally a glass slides right off the bar and smashes on the wall to which everyone in the tavern hollers and cheers.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Blackjack Mel can be found near the end of the bar with a few of his trusted thieves. He has a private booth that he uses to discuss business.</li>\n  <li>Leon the Swine doesnt leave his balcony, but if anyone wants to talk to him they are welcome to come do so. He demands that anyone who speaks to him calls him the Swine Prince. He refers to the characters as his “Little Piggies.”</li>\n  <li>To join the Pins &amp; Clubs all you have to do is kill someone. Leon explains that they're the biggest gang in Drakkenheim. Other gangs claim to be smarter, stronger, braver, more cunning. But no one has the numbers of the Pins &amp; Clubs. So to keep things proper, ya gotta go to one of the other taverns and kill someone from a different gang. Come back with their right hand and Leon will let ya join. He gestures to a box in the corner of the balcony overflowing with right hands.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:350px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0096_Inn_Keeper_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Old Imperial Public House\">Old Imperial Public House</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">This long and large building still stands almost entirely intact and seems in pretty good condition. Its blue-painted wooden exterior still holds up to only moderate chipping. The large sign outside reads “The Old Imperial” with a coat of arms on the door. Inside the tavern is fitted with beautiful hand carved tables and chairs, and an ornately carved maple bar stretches down the length of the house with a massive wall of wines and spirits behind it. There is a raised section to the bar up a few small steps where Rose Carver and her gang sit around a large table and drink. The bar is tended by a large dragonborn named Israel. There are several more heavily clad and armed folk by the bar chatting with Israel.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Israel takes in new recruits for the fighting pits downstairs. If you want to fight you have to register with him. You need a crew, a name, and a catch phrase. The audience pays more when they have a catchy team to cheer for. So make it good. Once you sign up, if you are new, you “gotta do the rounds.” Meaning fight all other champions.</li>\n  <li>Rose Carver is looking for new recruits. She likes people who are strong-willed and cunning in battle. Not brutes or overconfident muscle heads as she calls them, but tough folk looking to make a difference, one way or another.</li>\n  <li>To join you just need to agree to give Rose Carver five percent of any jobs you do under her guidance. If you agree, you get the symbol and join her ranks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Smees Palace\">Smee's Palace</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The largest tap house in Buckledown Row, this large building used to be a popular spot for local musical shows and plays. The large stage at the back of the tavern still stands, and often you can find a group of bards here playing songs or occasionally a play being performed. The place is filled with elegant gold-accented wooden-carved features, and there is a large chandelier with what seems like over one hundred candles. Each table is illuminated by red wax candles in golden candelabras. The place feels the fanciest of the local establishments. The server is a tall elven woman with white hair and piercing hazel eyes named Tilda. She speaks elegantly and softly to any who come to her. Even though she is soft spoken, one can hear her clear as day through the noise of the ongoings of the tavern. Sitting at the table closest to the stage is Christian Lament and his gang.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>There is a staircase behind the bar that leads down to the fighting pits and people are constantly coming and going from below.

Once a royal palace, military fortress, and administrative hub, the stronghold is now a grim monument to madness and horror. Any who wish to discover what ultimately happened to King Ulrich IV or unearth conclusive evidence to prove a royal claim will find what they are seeking here. Those who come bearing the\n  <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em> may even be able seat a new ruler upon the <em>Throne of Drakkenheim</em>, if they can defeat the deadly creatures conjured by the Haze and the former castle guardians left unhinged by its influence.\n</p>\n<p>An unspeakable abomination known as the @UUID[Actor.FaQBcQeboMfO6hOL] has taken root in the throne room. However, its physical form is a mere corporeal manifestation of a multidimensional entity that extends into multiple places and planes at once. Feeding on the powerful magic within the foundations of Castle Drakken, the @UUID[Actor.FaQBcQeboMfO6hOL] anchors the first major dimensional rift opened by the Haze, which slowly draws extraplanar terrors into the mortal world. Eventually the rift will expand, tearing apart the castle and leaving behind a sickening hole in reality.</p>\n\n<h1 data-split-here=\"Overview\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Characters should be at least 11th level before taking on Castle Drakken, and may reach 13th level or higher before defeating all the challenges within. Read this chapter carefully: Castle Drakken is a sprawling and dynamic environment with many interconnected interactions. There is no set order in which characters must progress through the castle! High level characters have many abilities including flight and teleportation, and the following scenarios are designed with these capabilities in mind. Characters lacking these powers may find Castle Drakken significantly more difficult.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Adventure Hooks</h2>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Seize the Throne. </strong></em>The political future of Westemär rests upon successfully reclaiming Castle Drakken. Though their motives differ, both the Hooded Lanterns and the @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] wish to gain entry to the throne room, obtain the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.CroT000000000022], and install a new monarch using the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>. Meanwhile, the Amethyst Academy, the Followers of the Falling Fire, and the Silver Order all understand that supporting a new monarch means they can gain immense influence over what is done about the delerium in Drakkenheim. If you have more than one potential candidate for the throne, you might have a serious political drama on your hands.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Investigate the Dimensional Rift.</em></strong> The dimensional rift signals the dangerous progression of the Haze, but characters might first discover a similar rift within the Inscrutable Tower. In this case, Eldrick Runeweaver may theorize that other such rifts could form within the Haze, especially around areas where structures were infused with powerful magic already. Castle Drakken is such a place, so the possibility of a similar effect happening there simply cannot be ignored.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Treasures of Castle Drakken.</em></strong> The Followers of the Falling Fire and the Silver Order need two great treasures found inside Castle Drakken to achieve their final goals. First is the <em>Diamond of Mount Kadath</em>, the crowning jewel of the royal treasure vault. The other is a <em>Relic of Saint Vitruvio</em>: @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.TheT000000000026]. Though believed to be in the castle chapel or the royal treasure vaults, the relic is now actually in the royal apartments.\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />"

              "text": "<p>Whether ally or enemy, the factions play their best cards now. In addition, players might find unexpected aid among the horrific creatures who inhabit the castle.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Allied Support</h2>\n<p>Even the mightiest player characters will need assistance from one or more factions to overcome the monsters and challenges present in Castle Drakken. Factions only place their full resources behind an expedition to Castle Drakken to allied characters who have achieved the following:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Demonstrated their trustworthiness and full loyalty to the faction's ideals and goals.</li>\n  <li>Acquired the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em> and located a potential heir to the throne.</li>\n  <li>Secured the cathedral and/or the Inscrutable Tower.</li>\n  <li>Defeated at least one other rival faction and/or created an alliance with two other factions.</li>\n  <li>Acquired reliable means to protect themselvesagainst contamination.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Launching a full-scale siege on Castle Drakken is far beyond the capabilities of any faction. Instead, they propose an elite strike team led by the player characters. Before committing their forces, the faction leaders request the characters thoroughly scout the castle grounds and determine what lurks within the palace, especially the throne room and the royal apartments. Each wants to develop a clear strategy, and notes that securing Castle Drakken in a single expedition is unlikely.</p>\n<p>Once characters return from Castle Drakken with a well-developed report that confirms what lies in the throne room, the factions should offer their greatest boons and finest agents to help players put together a team to take the palace. This force could reasonably include a faction leader, one or more faction lieutenants, a group of rival adventurers, and a faction strike team. Many faction leaders can also offer key insight and knowledge about the castle:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    The @UUID[Actor.k1Me7WfCcgKcAFQe] and @UUID[Actor.L0yjx19PnmJgrqVk]{Elias Drexel} intimately know the layout of Castle Drakken, including the location of any secret passages. They can answer questions about the former inhabitants of the castle and provide specific details about how the\n    <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em> are used to crown a new monarch.\n  </li>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.IFRQ1jK41KOQNjGl] can provide characters with excellent information about the magical defenses of Castle Drakken. He can study the nature of the dimensional rift and accurately assess what is required to close it down, given a full report.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.tqJK1mzxPst0xV08] performs powerful divinations to discern the future. Characters may ask her anything about the castle, but she replies in truthful yet cryptic clues in the form of prophetic statements.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Actor.q4jRqiq5PgWcqvxD]{Theodore Marshal} can't offer much information about Castle Drakken, but he commands the finest air force amongst the factions. He can offer characters advice on how to take the castle by the air, noting that there's no reason for the characters to walk in the front gate if they can fly up to the balconies!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Enemy Interlopers</h2>\n<p>Allied faction leaders should warn the player characters that counterstrikes and interference from the other factions are almost certain. When enemy factions discover the player characters are exploring Castle Drakken, they see it as an opportunity to defeat them once and for all. They begin enacting their more dangerous and underhanded schemes, and enemy faction leaders will personally lead an elite strike team into Castle Drakken to confront the player characters.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Neutral Parties</h2>\n<p>The time to remain on the sidelines has passed. If by some chance the characters kept relatively neutral interactions with one or more of the factions, the leaders of those factions should contact the player characters to arrange a meeting once they learn they are successfully exploring Castle Drakken. The faction leader offers their support, but demands their goals be factored into any plans the player characters might have for the future of Drakkenheim. The outcome of this final interaction will determine if that faction emerges as an ally or enemy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Missing Seals</h2>\n<p>\n  By this point in the adventure the player characters should have located the\n  <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em> and learned of their significance. However, if the characters missed any of the seals still lost in the ruins, a group of rival adventurers might find them instead. If enemy faction leaders still possess one or more of the seals, you can have these NPCs reveal this fact during a tense negotiation as a bargaining chip. The players might make a deal, or plot to take the seal by force or stealth. Either way, you should ensure all six seals are “in play” before the player characters head to Castle Drakken.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Royal Steward</h2>\n<p>Johann Eisner was the royal steward of Drakkenheim. As the Haze engulfed the castle, he attempted to rescue Ulrich IV, but failed. He fled to the crypts where he became trapped. Now, his body and mind are fused to the Foundation Pillar in the Monarchal Crypt. As a result, he can now tap into the magic within the castle. He dutifully acts as custodian of this damned place to contain the horrors within. However, the steward has endured this torturous experience for fifteen years. It is only a matter of time before he falters and fully succumbs to madness.</p>\n<p>Initially, the steward attempts to bar characters' entry to the royal palace and drive them out of the castle. Nevertheless, if characters make an earnest attempt to communicate with him, the steward responds cautiously. Once he believes the characters are capable and well-intentioned, the steward implores them to rescue him from the crypts. Then, he shares his knowledge and plans (see “the Eternal Custodian” in the Developments section for details.)</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality.</strong> I pay exceptional attention to the finest details in my work.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ideal.</strong> A loyal steward discreetly manages the affairs of state and household unseen.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bond.</strong> I pledged my life to serve my liege, my homeland, and my family.</li>\n  <li><strong>Flaw.</strong> Others often fail to live up to my exacting standards. I personally perform many tasks I don't trust anyone else to handle properly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The steward's mind inhabits Castle Drakken itself. He has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 16, and a +11 bonus on History checks. He speaks, reads, and understands common plus four other languages, and can see and hear anything within sixty feet of the Foundation Pillar. He has the following additional traits:</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Custodian's Eye. </strong></em>The steward creates an invisible, immobile magical sensor anywhere within Castle Drakken that hovers in the air for one minute. He can see and hear through the sensor as if he was there, and may cast spells as though he were in the sensor's space. The sensor dissipates if it takes any damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Innate Spellcasting.</strong></em> The steward's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). When he casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll 1d6. On a 1, it triggers an @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.tables.RollTable.pPGtKhPFFcHortCT]{Arcane Anomaly}. He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>At will: @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3] (the hand is invisible), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MUO1uYN7JR1hm4dR], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ccduLIvutyNqvkgv].</li>\n  <li>3/day: @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ATo0Eb63TDtnu6iA], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XXUDGFELgoskdOD0], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.HQfd7jJyULIoGxrZ],@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.o9ZCvuD2B1OTcubb].</li>\n  <li>1/day: @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Y7uWUO4yqUN0JKl0], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ERCv7yuRkQ0YjGx6], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.B2kbmgbA2WQR00kx]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When using his magic, the steward may only leave cryptic messages of one or two words.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2>Sealed Fate</h2>\n      <p>\n        At the DM's discretion, characters who possess a signet ring or token of some kind once owned by a member of the royal family (such as the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.QtmVEreNIWEVOoLR] worn by Lenore) can also bypass castle defenses as if the item were a\n        <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em>.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>"

This effect ends if the @UUID[Actor.FaQBcQeboMfO6hOL] in the palace\n  throne room is destroyed. However, if the dimensional rift is not then sealed\n  (see the throne room) the Amalgamation itself rejuvenates 1d10 days later, and\n  the monsters return shortly thereafter.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">[2] Lower Bailey Areas</h2>\n<p>\n  The dusty and gravel-filled lower bailey has a fine bricked road leading\n  through it from the front gate to the bailey gate. The ground is ashen and\n  cracked, delerium clusters jutting from the earth. Check for a random\n  encounter each time the characters enter one of the buildings below:\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[2a] Armoury.</em></strong> This fortified warehouse houses\n  cannons, siege engines, and esoteric weaponry, as well as a massive\n  stockpileof conventional armour and armaments.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[2b] Barracks. </em></strong>In the middle of the bailey is a\n  fortified building with several crenellated parapets and a high steepled roof.\n  Outside are unfurled banners displaying the sigil of the royal guard. The\n  ground floors contain officers quarters, a mess hall, and kitchen, while the\n  upper floors are comfortable if spartan accommodations for the royal guards.\n  The topmost level has private chambers for the guard captain.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[2c] Carriage House. </em></strong>This large garage houses a\n  dozen royal carriages, wagons, and vehicles.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[2d] Servant's Lodge. </em></strong>This bending building housed\n  accomodations for the common castle staff. It also features a large kitchen,\n  bakery, well, and laundry facilities. The adjoining tower serves as a granary\n  and dedicated storehouse for castle provisions including grain and preserved\n  foods.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[2e] Stables. </em></strong>This massive L-shaped stable once\n  sheltered dozens of horses. It is now a charnel house of bones and decaying\n  leather; the noble steeds within were consumed by the castle's monstrous\n  residents long ago. The loft above the stables contained a residence for the\n  master of horses and the royal stablehands. The adjoining tower is the castle\n  aerie, which was roost for the royal giant owls. In addition to a possible\n  random encounter, six\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.MAoCGF5VkQwhmgvI]{Manticores} live here\n  now.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[2f] Workshops. </em></strong>A large outdoor forge, with several\n  anvils and workstations. An adjoining shed contains raw materials: wood, iron\n  ingots, finished nails, and all manner of tools.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[2g] Bailey Gate.</em></strong> The gate passage covers a curved\n  ramp leading to the Upper Bailey.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Prince of Carnage</h2>\n<p>\n  A wingless @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.uZ8NrRenwYZ4qNf6] known as\n  the Prince of Carnage has made the courtyard his territory, its body covered\n  in lacerations and exposed raw muscle. Conjured by the Haze and bound to the\n  castle grounds, the Prince of Carnage is an insane demon who believes himself\n  to be a royal prince. He furiously attacks any who trespass the lower bailey,\n  barring the way to the upper bailey in delusional claim over the ruined realm.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Servant's Passage</h2>\n<p>\n  A prominent set of doors in the basement of the\n  <strong>servant's lodge</strong> opens into a narrow stone passage that leads\n  under the Bailey Gate and connects to the palace proper. The passage isn't\n  concealed: it was used daily by the castle staff to get to work in the palace,\n  especially in the winter. However, the doors of the passage were sealed with\n  an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]. They open for anyone\n  bearing a <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em> or who speaks the password\n  “Giggleshorts”.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Characters interacting with the @UUID[Actor.OH6Ong42U0roAZ6F]{Warp Witches}\n  and @UUID[Actor.WRMeQqdgYSpAR9zx]{Delerium Dregs} found in the castle grounds\n  may be able to learn the password from them.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">[3] Upper Bailey Areas</h2>\n<p>\n  The regal Upper Bailey is a stark contrast to the Lower Bailey. Fields of dead\n  grass, large contaminated pools, dried-out fountains, baroque statuary covered\n  in ash, and twisted trees line a fine brick roadway leading to the palace\n  entrance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[3a] Overlook Tower.</em></strong> The north tower connects to a\n  small exterior doorway large enough for humans to pass through. It allows\n  access via a leisurely (if exhausting) walk down the cliff via a graceful\n  stone staircase that leads to the ravine below. Pillared bannisters, exquisite\n  statues, luscious fountains, and stone benches decorate the many porches,\n  overlooking platforms, and balconies along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[3b] Knight's Tower. </em></strong>This tower manor has small, if\n  comfortable, accommodations for the knights in service to the monarch. Many\n  levels contain several individual rooms, whereas others are whole apartments\n  for particularly favoured champions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>[3c] Castle Gardens. </em></strong>A field large enough to set up\n  a great outdoor tent for garden parties, the gardens contain fountains,\n  statues, hedgerows, and decrepit flowerbeds.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Castle Chapel</h2>\n<p>\n  This small chapel of the Sacred Fire is dedicated to an obscure and ancient\n  saint and lavishly decorated for its size with angelic sculptures. However,\n  the crypts beneath are unfinished, the additions intended as a reliquary for\n  @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.TheT000000000026] left incomplete.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Roll or choose a random encounter the first time characters enter the\n    chapel.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    An altarbox left beside the brazier contains 1d4\n    @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.5m9ErO9In8Uc5yyf]{Potions of Superior Healing}, plus scrolls of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1], and\n    @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz].

These sumptuous rooms\n  have been darkly twisted by eldritch forces; once lively halls shifted into\n  destatured tones and sickly hues. Characters can enter the palace through the\n  main door, the servant's passages, or by flying onto the balconies.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-frame\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:250px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0275_BOOK_Metal_Box_4_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>"

The heart of the citadel is a massive central keep connected to four great round towers via soaring bridges, which rise above two large stone chateaus each bedecked with parapets. The imperial building is topped with slate rooftops of midnight blue and elongated spires sharp like spear points. The outer walls feature immaculate stone moldings, overhanging balconies, flying buttresses, and tall arched windows with intricate stained glass designs. Upon the battlements are leering gargoyles and roosting dragons cast in bronze.</p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">The main entrance is a fortified gate flanked by squat square towers. Engraved into each of the heavy iron double doors is a dragon rampant set with gold filigree. Above is a circular rose window fixed with delicate tracery.

He roosts atop the Stair Tower of the royal palace with his mind awash in nightmares. The dragon now believes the monstrous creatures dwelling in the castle to be its proper inhabitants, and perceives humanoid creatures as trespassers to be destroyed. Minazorond awakes with a thunderous roar that can be heard for miles away, and attacks if intruders approach within one hundred and fifty feet of the royal palace by any means. The dragon does not speak, nor respond to reason or parley. He does not pursue his quarry beyond the castle grounds. However, Minazorond is too large to enter buildings or the palace, and cannot pursue creatures who flee inside.</p>\n<p>Minazorond possesses the additional traits of a @UUID[Actor.NxVKmMdsfKoJEAJP]{Tower Dragons}, and may be rebuked by a creature bearing a <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em> in a similar manner.

The castle rooms are each individually themed around a different pantheon of mythological heroes, gods, and monsters depicted in scenes from their greatest stories. You are encouraged to choose your favourite characters (even those from real-world myth) and place their likenesses throughout the castle art.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Amenities.</em></strong> Running water fountains, grand fireplace hearths, and coal stoves once provided comfort throughout the castle. The pipes and chimneys are now choked with contaminated water and Haze-infused soot.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Artwork.</em></strong> Massive painted murals and framed canvases adorn the walls and ceilings, and lifelike statues of carved marble rest on pedestals in many rooms. However, the once expressive and idealistic fairy-tale scenes now have disturbing undertones, bizarre contrasting colours, distorted features, warped perspectives, and oblique angles.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ceilings.</em></strong> Most rooms and corridors have vaulted ceilings thiryt feet high. All are decorated with frescoes and carved mouldings. Some truly elegant rooms feature a dome painted with a stunning circular panorama.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Doors.</em></strong> These paired doorways of reinforced wood have embossed panels and ornamentations.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Floors. </em></strong>Tiles of marble, porcelain, or stone are laid out in intricate arrangements. Many rooms also have large woven carpets bearing geometric patterns and golden tassels and trim.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Furnishings.</em></strong> These elaborate antiques are upholstered with fine velvet and painted with gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Lighting.</em></strong> Brass and gold chandeliers strung with crystals and kept alight by @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f] illuminate each chamber. The Haze has transformed the once soft and golden firelight into unsettling hues of crimson, purple, and green.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Secret Doors.</em></strong> Castle Drakken contains many secret doors. These may be found with a DC 20 Investigation check. Each wall section rotates on a central axis; pushing them open takes an action and a DC 10 Strength check. They automatically close afterwards.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Walls.</em></strong> Sculpted borders and baseboards in marble, ivory, or painted wood frame the walls. Many feature mascarons and leering faces with draconic designs. The rare areas without windows or paintings often feature intricate patterned tapestries or wallpaper.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Windows. </em></strong>Paned glass windows are decorated with tracery and stained glass, and hung with curtains of silk and sable.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"img-frame\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:250px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0276_BOOK_Royal_Ring_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Looting the Castle</h2>\n<p>The artwork and furnishings in each room of Castle Drakken are extraordinarily valuable. Any given chamber contains 1d6 objects worth 250 gp each and 1d4 objects worth 750 gp each. However, transporting and fencing these items may be a challenge.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Chateau Halls</h2>\n<p>Ceilings in the castle chateau reach a height of forty feet, though the attic above extends the roof twenty feet higher beyond.</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Central Passage\">\n  <strong><em>Central Passage.</em></strong> Artwork and statues in this columned hall depict the past monarchs of Drakkenheim. Most belong to the original ruling family, House von Drakken, with only the most recent ones belonging to House von Kessel. Stairs on either end connected to the chateau basement, beside sets of double doors lead to the palace entrance and the antechamber.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Banquet Hall\">\n  <strong><em>Banquet Hall.</em></strong> This room features two lines of feasting tables set with tablecloths and golden candlesticks. Porcelain plates, silver utensils, and napkins provide table settings to accommodate a hundred people.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Dining Room\">\n  <strong><em>Dining Room.</em></strong> This dining room is richly decorated with far more lavish settings than the banquet hall, as it seats only twenty four important guests.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Drawing Room\">\n  <strong><em>Drawing Room.</em></strong> This well-appointed salon contains several comfortable wingback chairs, settees, and side tables. A delicate cabinet is stocked with exquisite spirits and fine tobacco.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Grand Ballroom\">\n  <strong><em>Grand Ballroom.</em></strong> This splendid long hall has grand mirrors opposite the windows, filling the walls at each end and incorporated into the ceiling, creating the illusion of a vast and almost endless interior space. Gold-painted pillars, glass and silver chandeliers, and flowing curtains inlaid with fine embroidery complete the room. Upholstered benches and dancing statues rest in alcoves on each side of the room. A small platform at one end has a collection of chairs, music stands, and antique stringed instruments.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Hundreds of intangible spirits of long-dead nobles manifest in these chambers, playing out the last masquerade ball held in Castle Drakken. Meanwhile, three dozen @UUID[Actor.9Ip2Xdb0FDnrWeEh]{Haze Husks} carry out their duties as serving staff, bringing spoiled wine and foetid hor'dourves to the “guests”. Characters passing through the chamber are treated like familiar and celebrated guests, and invited to share their heroic tales and partake in the dance. Characters can pass through the chateau unopposed so long as they humor the spirits; but should they shatter the delusions, the spirits angrily vanish save for 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) hostile @UUID[Actor.OH6Ong42U0roAZ6F]{Warp Witches}.</li>\n  <li>Check for a random encounter each time characters pass through the chateau thereafter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Chateau Basement</h2>\n<p data-scroll=\"Kitchen\">\n  <strong><em>Kitchen. </em></strong>This gigantic kitchen could prepare a banquet for hundreds, and contains several ovens, stoves, and large preparation tables. It reeks of offal, but is disturbingly tidy otherwise. Cabinets and shelves with spices, cooking utensils, plates, and spoiled stores line the walls.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    The three renowned castle chefs - Frier, Olivier, and Ramsay - still remain in the kitchen. They have transformed into hideous creatures imbued with magic power (use the game statistic of a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.xvh2UOKv1bh03Gih] but their creature type is aberration). The three chefs despise each other yet feed off their rivalry, and assume anyone entering the kitchen who isn't openly wearing a\n    <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em> is an underling they can boss around. The chefs furiously reprimand intruders for being “late”, order them to get to work, then berate and insult the quality of any tasks performed. They attack if they aren't obeyed.\n  </li>\n  <li>Each time characters enter the kitchen, check for a random encounter. Any creatures that might be encountered are working (poorly) in the kitchen and being abused by the chefs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-scroll=\"Larders\">\n  <strong><em>Larders.</em></strong> These three chambers contained the food supplies for the palace upon and within shelves and containers, almost all of which were eaten or contaminated. One stored dry goods at normal room temperature, but the other two are magically enchanted with temperatures of 40 and -18o fahrenheit.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Basement Storeroom\">\n  <strong><em>Basement Storeroom.</em></strong> These dusty storerooms contain extra furnishings, textiles, and utensils used during parties and galas held in the palace, neatly stacked and cleanly organized. Behind an upturned table is a secret door to a short passage connected to the Dungeon Vaults.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Wine Cellar\">\n  <strong><em>Wine Cellar.</em></strong> Racks containing hundreds of bottles of fine wine and spirits organized in a byzantine fashion line this cellar. One wine rack conceals a secret door opening to a long passage that leads to the <strong><em>Bureaucratic Archives</em></strong> in the Steward's Tower.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Scullery\">\n  <strong><em>Scullery.</em></strong> This room smells of soap, and has large basins for washing laundry connected to taps of running water.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Privvies\">\n  <strong><em>Privvies.</em></strong> This washchamber contains rows of privvies used by castle guests.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Side Entrance\">\n  <strong><em>Side Entrance.</em></strong> These broad steps include a gently sloping ramp that leads outside the palace.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Servants Staircase\">\n  <strong><em>Servants Staircase.</em></strong> This spiral staircase has an integrated dumbwaiter elevator. It leads directly to the lowest level of the royal apartments.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Servants Passage\">\n  <strong><em>Servant's Passage.</em></strong> This door is @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{Arcane Locked} and opened via the servant's password. The narrow tunnel leads to the Servant's Lodge in the Lower Bailey.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Water Spring\">\n  <strong><em>Water Spring.</em></strong> Water flows into this large pool from several narrow pipes connected to the city aqueducts. The once-fresh water is contaminated, inhabited by two @UUID[Actor.JU5DYHnBwwFj4jC3]{Animated Delerium Sludges}.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Canal\">\n  <strong><em>Canal.</em></strong> Water from the cistern pool flows into a downward-sloping canal with a small cleated pier for mooring a small boat or raft. A portcullis bars passage further; the canal terminates at another spring in Queen's Park. The gate opens only for a character bearing a <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em>.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Throne Room Antechamber\">Throne Room Antechamber</h2>\n<p>This ceiling of this magnificent antechamber rises sixty feet overhead, the top bordered by arched clerestory windows that allow natural light into the chamber. Two sets of broad marble steps with pillared banisters wrap around the room and converge at a central columned balcony thirty feet above the ground floor. Golden double doors each etched with the design of a dragon rampant upon a tower are set atop and below the balcony passage below it, and broad landings halfway up each staircase connect to halls heading north and south.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Check for a random encounter each time characters pass through this chamber.</li>\n  <li>The steward uses his spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.o9ZCvuD2B1OTcubb] to prevent characters from entering the throne room.</li>\n  <li>This chamber is the ground level of the central tower, but does not directly connect to the royal apartments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Stair Tower\">Stair Tower</h2>\n<p>A brilliant chandelier extends down the height of this hollow one-hundred-fifty-foot-tall tower. Thousands of glass crystals with frames of silver and gold are arranged in patterns of constellations and stars. A wide and impressive spiral staircase glides up and down the length of the tower lined by a carved balustrade, exiting to the tower roof. There are four landings along the length of the stair: three connected to arched bridgeways. The stairs also descend to a lower level, where the sparkling chandelier light reflects from a large fountain at the tower's base.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The stairs connect to the Ambassador's Tower, the Steward's Tower, and the Royal Apartments, the Antechamber, and the Vaults.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-scroll=\"Dragon Roost\">\n  <strong><em>Dragon Roost.</em></strong> The stairs continue and exit the top of the tower to the tower roof, which is a flat platform surrounded by battlements. @UUID[Actor.SQZPbi2m8N6Dupw4] uses this place as a roost.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"map-frame\">\n  <img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/gm_maps/castle_drakken_towers.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Conservatory Tower\">Conservatory Tower</h2>\n<p>Beyond the tower base, this one-hundred-fifty-foot-tall tower narrows considerably to a width of twenty feet as the spiral staircase makes its way upward.</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Library\">\n  <strong><em>Library.</em></strong> The musty smell of ancient books wafts through this room, lined floor to ceiling with shelves with a sliding ladder rail. This impressive collection includes rare works of poetry, literature, and history. A loft above contains a study where the monarch's children were instructed by a tutor.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Mage Chamber\">\n  <strong><em>Mage's Chamber.</em></strong> An @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{Arcane Locked} door on the middle level opens only for members of the Amethyst Academy. Inside is a private suite inhabited by 4 @UUID[Actor.lAt2j5PaTnH71T5O]{Arcane Wraiths}, the insane remnants of the last Academy representatives posted to Castle Drakken. Amongst their belongings are a rare magic item plus 1d4 rare <em>potions</em> and 1d6 rare <em>spell scrolls</em> of your choice.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Solarium\">\n  <strong><em>Solarium.</em></strong> The topmost level is a fine glass-paned sitting room with perhaps one of the finest views of the landscape north of Drakkenheim. Elegant silver furniture with spiraling design and plush pillows provides a place for quiet relaxation.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Stewards Tower\">Steward's Tower</h2>\n<p>This one-hundred-foot-tall square tower connects to the Stair Tower via an arched and covered bridge. It can be accessed from the outside via the balconies and battlements.</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Private Quarters\">\n  <strong><em>Private Quarters.</em></strong> The top two levels of the tower are the private quarters for the steward and his family, consisting of a drawing room, personal study, and three bedrooms. The furnishing is comparatively modest next to the ostentatious decoration of the rest of the castle.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Stewards Office\">\n  <strong><em>Steward's Office.</em></strong> The walls of this otherwise ordinary room are covered floor to ceiling in cabinets, bookshelves, chests of drawers, and a still-ticking grandfather clock. A massive oak desk covered in heavy tomes and papers dominates the room.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Upon the desk is an unsent letter written in the steward's hand and bearing his seal addressed to Ulrich IV. It contains revealing details about an illegitimate heir to House von Kessel, including their name and possible location. The exact contents are up to you to decide based on how you've arranged the royal succession.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-scroll=\"Bureaucratic Archives\">\n  <strong><em>Bureaucratic Archives.</em></strong> This cramped room has narrow aisles between tall rows of drawer cabinets and shelves. They contain detailed records of the city; including property deeds, noble titles, tax records, construction permits, royal decrees, diaries, succession laws, and years of correspondence and records. Any key information or clues helpful to the characters, factions, or their personal quests could conceivably be found here, but finding any specific document or information kept here would take days of searching, possibly even weeks. However, making a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to find one specific document with a one-hour search by piecing together how the material here is actually organized.\n</p>\n<p>A secret door in the archives leads to a rough tunnel that connects to the wine cellar in the Chateau Kitchen.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\" data-scroll=\"Ambassadors Tower\">Ambassador's Tower</h2>\n<p>This tower is one hundred and twenty feet tall and connects to the Stair Tower via a bridge.</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Reception Chamber\">\n  <strong><em>Reception Chamber.</em></strong> This luxurious lounge served as a meeting area for more informal conversations between dignitaries.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Guest Apartments\">\n  <strong><em>Guest Apartments.</em></strong> The remaining levels of this tower contain several fine suites for important visitors and political hostages of the royal family with private bedrooms and common rooms.\n</p>\n<h3>The Emissary's Entourage</h3>\n<p>A scheming and sauve @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.3o2rQBqpzjIHmrBW] known as the Emissary occupies the Ambassador's Tower with several other devils: two @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.MADGs8pWMVyyFOf1]{Horned Devils} and a bodyguard of 12 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.9ggQBmAKXraOtz7S]{Bearded Devils}. The devils desperately wish to leave the mortal world and return to Hell (without being destroyed in the process). They believe that if they were to acquire mortal souls or a <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em>, their hellish overlord will relent and pull them back to Hell. They tell the following diabolical lies:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“We were summoned here by the will of the throne to receive an important message for our master. We are bound here until one who sits the throne gives us our mission.”</li>\n  <li>“Ulrich IV lives. His horrific transformation may be undone by destroying the corrupted pillar in the crypts, but a powerful guardian protects it now.”</li>\n  <li>“The steward is in fact a powerful lich. He conspired with demons to summon the meteor. He has locked himself in his tower. Do not listen to anything he says.”</li>\n  <li>“The Prince of Carnage is Leonard von Kessel.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Devil's Bargain</h3>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">“Our master is the Lord of Hell. All secrets are known to them. If you offer us your mortal soul or one of the Seals of Drakkenheim, we can contact them. Then, you may ask them three questions, and you will receive a truthful reply in kind.”</p>\n<p>The Lord of Hell possesses true knowledge, and the deal is genuine. Characters could learn about the following:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Identify a royal heir or where proof of lineage may be found.</li>\n  <li>Locate another <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em> or a <em>Relic of Saint Vitruvio</em>.</li>\n  <li>Provide information needed to complete a personal quest.</li>\n  <li>Gain knowledge about one or more new spells in this book.</li>\n  <li>Explain the true origin of the meteor and the effects of the Haze.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  A character who offers their mortal soul withers and dies immediately, and can't be raised unless their soul is freed. If a\n  <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em> is offered to the Emissary, it disappears in a puff of brimstone when placed in her hand, lost in the Lower Planes. Then the devils answer the first three questions they are asked truthfully, and are subsequently transported back to Hell.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Royal Apartments</h2>\n<p>The two-hundred-foot-tall central tower of the palace contains the royal apartments. It is accessible by the Servant's Stair from the Basement Kitchens, or by a bridge from the Stair Tower. The royal apartments are spread over four floors. Each has a similar layout with a central hall and six rooms, connected by a staircase that runs across the floors.</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Attendants Room\">\n  <strong><em>Attendant's Room.</em></strong> These small rooms and closets were used by servants waiting on the royal family, and are connected via the Servant's Stair to the Basement Kitchen. They contain fine shelves and cabinets used to store linens, cleaning supplies, cutlery, a small pantry, wine rack, and a cot for servants working the night shift.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Baths\">\n  <strong><em>Baths.</em></strong> Two rooms in the apartments contain large, elegant porcelain clawfoot bathtubs. Levers beside gold-painted spouts cause water to fill the tub when a stopper is placed over the drain.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Bedchambers\">\n  <strong><em>Bedchambers.</em></strong> There are a dozen bedchambers across the four floors of the royal apartments. Each has a large sumptuous bed with a satin canopy, silk sheets, plush pillows, and soft velvet carpets, and a hearth or heating stove. The carved headboards have gold filigree and embedded pearls. Candelabras, chandeliers, and nightstands are made of gold or silver.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Dining Room2\">\n  <strong><em>Dining Room.</em></strong> The royal family took most meals in this elegant dining room. The carved dining table has a glass top and is a work of art in its own right.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Dressing Rooms\">\n  <strong><em>Dressing Rooms.</em></strong> About half the bedchambers have an adjoining dressing room appointed with broad wardrobes, dressing tables, and large framed mirrors. Lockboxes with wigs, jewellry, trinkets, and rotting makeup are scattered throughout.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Water Closets.</em></strong> Three curious rooms in the apartment floors each contain a porcelain bowl set with a cushioned hoop-shaped seat and attached to a tank of water. Pulling a nearby metal chain causes water from the tank to flood the bowl and carry waste away into the castle plumbing. The water-closet on the penthouse level is plated with gold.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Sitting Room\">\n  <strong><em>Sitting Room.</em></strong> Velvet couches and two great leather wingback chairs flank either side of an impressive fireplace. Thick carpets with intricate designs are laid out beneath, and a square polished marble table with streaks of gold is set in the middle of the room. A warm fire illuminates the room.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Penthouse\">\n  <strong><em>Penthouse.</em></strong> The topmost floor is the private penthouse used by the monarch and ringed by battlements with an impressive view. It includes an impressive bed, and the rest of the level includes its own bathroom, water closet, short hallway, dressing room, and study. The <strong>Regent</strong> (see below) has made this chamber his personal lair, and it's now in a state between lavish and squalor. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.TheT000000000026]{Shield of Sacred Flame} is here.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Royal Study\">\n  <strong><em>Royal Study.</em></strong> This seldom used chamber nevertheless has an impressive desk and bookshelves lined with aspirational reading material.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Rooftop Garden\">\n  <strong><em>Rooftop Garden.</em></strong> The battlements have observational parapets and flower boxes filled with lavenders that housed a royal apiary and falcon's roost. These majestic creatures have been slaughtered, and now eight @UUID[Actor.JOQZAx77IIbznFVO]{Hypnotic Eldritch Blossoms} occupy the flowerbeds. 1d4 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.6oc29m5uzzzb0pk3]{Vrocks} may also be fluttering around the spire.\n</p>\n<p data-scroll=\"Escape Chute\">\n  <strong><em>Escape Chute.</em></strong> The fireplace in the sitting room and the penthouse bedchamber has a false back. When pressed inward and slid upward, it opens into a narrow drop chute with a metal sliding pole. Sliding down the pole leads to the Dungeon Vault.\n</p>\n<h3>The Regent's Retinue</h3>\n<p>A gluttonous @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rUg5JMnKNnZNBAq9] known as the Regent conducts depraved and debauched acts in the royal apartments with his retinue of demons: a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.egsSDYbqoLCelb0J], 1d4 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.OGPHF4sCVOAi87TU], 1d6 @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.6oc29m5uzzzb0pk3]{Vrocks}, and dozens of servile @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.bwtkdzavdNHISgp4]{Quasits}. These creatures can be encountered anywhere in the royal apartments, and relish in transforming the regal appointments into a place of gory grandeur. They have no desire to leave Castle Drakken. Instead, they want to gain control of the dimensional rift to summon more demons. They believe they can accomplish this by stealing mortal souls and drawing power from holy relics. They tell the following demonic lies:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“We were summoned here by the will of the throne, and are bound to keep the castle. Only one who sits upon the throne may discharge us from our servitude.”</li>\n  <li>“Ulrich IV lives. His mind is bound to the disfigured flesh before the throne, and his will alone contains the Haze. If you destroy him, it will consume the world.”</li>\n  <li>“The meteor was in fact a diabolical vessel that crashed here. The devils arrived in Drakkenheim from a portal to Hell in the Crater.”</li>\n  <li>“The Rat Prince is Leonard von Kessel.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Demonic Sacrifice</h3>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">“The king is not strong enough to defeat the Haze on his own. However, we will show you how to help him, but it requires you sacrifice your mortal life... and give up the Relics of Saint Vitruvio.”</p>\n<p>The demons use the guise of civility to lure characters into a trap where they can use them as a living sacrifice or steal one of the <em>Relics of Saint Vitruvio</em> from them. Though they explain the rite will break the power of the @UUID[Actor.FaQBcQeboMfO6hOL], it's a total lie. Instead, the demons gleefully murder any characters who submit to them and use the relic in their profane summoning rites.</p>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;max-width:700px;min-width:400px;margin-top:50px\">\n  <img style=\"width:120%;max-width:unset;margin-left:-100px\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0127_BOOK_Bronze_Dragon__CMYK_CUT.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>“Always wanted to see the inside of Castle Drakkenwhen I was young.

At the very least, this\n  requires removing its leader, routing the rank-and-file members, and driving\n  them out of their stronghold.

How your players might\n  accomplish such dramatic reversals is up to them to attempt and you to\n  adjudicate!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Even in defeat, the factions still possess distant strongholds, fresh\n  recruits, vast resources, and additional allies outside Drakkenheim.\n  Nevertheless, retreating from Drakkenheim sends the faction reeling. Before\n  they can return and exact vengeance, they will need at least a year to\n  regroup, appoint new leaders, and determine a new strategy.

              "text": "<p>\n  Below are a few possible outcomes and suggestions about how a Drakkenheim\n  campaign may end, and the aftermath that follows. Each offers a dramatic\n  conclusion to the campaign, and an epilogue that presents an uncertain future.\n  Not all of these are mutually exclusive, either! Your players could devise an\n  inventive solution that combines several different possibilities.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Restoring the Throne</h2>\n<p>\n  Though the world is indeed threatened by cosmic forces, these issues may seem\n  distant and aloof compared to the pressing political turmoil that presently\n  engulfs the continent. Whoever manages to wrest control of Drakkenheim will\n  assume vast influence, enough to dictate the balance of power. While the Queen\n  of Thieves plots the means to take advantage of this situation for her own\n  gain, the Hooded Lanterns desperately hope they might locate a potential heir\n  to the throne and secure the means to crown them. Who this heir might be is up\n  to you to decide: consult the “Long Lost Heir” section in chapter 2 for\n  details.\n</p>\n<h3>Proving the Claim</h3>\n<p>\n  Finding the heir is one thing; but <em>proving</em> that the claimant has\n  royal lineage is another. An heir might be identified by a broken locket,\n  birthmark, signet ring, or some other document, but this must be substantiated\n  with something from the ruins. There are three places such evidence might be\n  found:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The vaults of Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral.</li>\n  <li>The steward's archives in Castle Drakken.</li>\n  <li>The private office of the Queen of Thieves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  You decide the exact nature of this evidence. It could include a detailed\n  family bible outlining the order of succession, a royal will specificing the\n  next heir, vials of preserved royal blood that can be used in a magic ritual\n  to confirm relation, an unsent letter that grants trueborn status to an\n  illegitimate child, a scandalous document that exposes infidelity, or the\n  other half of a broken locket. Regardless, it should be something tangible and\n  irrefutably authentic. If characters haven't yet found an heir, these\n  documents could also reveal their identity and location.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Faction Support. </strong></em>A claimant to the throne will\n  almost certainly need the support of two or more of the factions to secure the\n  political and military force needed to win over the nobility. This doesn't\n  necessarily have to be the Hooded Lanterns, but they are a safe bet.\n</p>\n<h3>Coronation</h3>\n<p>\n  The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.CroT000000000022] and the\n  <em>Throne of Drakkenheim</em> are more than just political concepts: they're\n  also powerful magic items. However, unlocking the full abilities of these\n  items requires the six <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em> be used to perform a\n  special coronation ritual in Castle Drakken (see chapter 9). Unfortunately,\n  the corruption of the <em>Throne of Drakkenheim</em> by the Haze means that\n  there's a good chance a potential claimant to the throne may die in the\n  process if they aren't strong enough to survive - unless your players make\n  cunning use of protective spells!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Technically speaking, these artefacts aren't actually <em>required</em> for a\n  new monarch to reign over Westemär, but holding those items conclusively\n  places a potential claimant in the seat of political power. A rightful ruler\n  seated upon the <em>Throne of Drakkenheim</em> will be able to unite the\n  nobility of Westemär once more, but one without them will have a much more\n  difficult time commanding the respect and cooperation of the wider nobility.\n</p>\n<h3>New Dynasty</h3>\n<p>\n  Elias Drexel and the Hooded Lanterns believe that restoring both Drakkenheim\n  and the Realm of Westemär <em>requires</em> a scion of House von Kessel to sit\n  on the <em>Throne of Drakkenheim</em>. However, observant characters may\n  notice that at least four other families have ruled Drakkenheim prior to House\n  von Kessel. As such, another noble house could make the claim provided they\n  possess the wealth, political influence, and military might needed to secure\n  power. This family then establishes a new royal dynasty to rule Westemär.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Such a task would require demonstrating <em>some</em> connection to the last\n  dynasty (as per above), the political support of at least three factions, as\n  well as holding the power of the royal treasures. Especially intrepid heroes\n  might not like the idea of a monarchy at all. If your characters have\n  ambitions to set up a new form of government, embrace it, but don't make it\n  easy for them!\n</p>\n<h3>Queen's Castle</h3>\n<p>\n  If the Queen of Thieves successfully obtains the\n  @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.CroT000000000022], she'll use its\n  power to cement her rule over the ruins. If you opted to portray the Queen of\n  Thieves as Katarina von Kessel, she uses her first wish to close the\n  dimensional rift, the second to restore the life of her lost sister, and the\n  final to erase all knowledge of her magical abilities. She then reveals her\n  true identity so she may legitimately rule Drakkenheim. Whether or not\n  Katarina von Kessel is a good ruler is uncertain, but she proves a shrewd\n  politician. Undoubtedly, her political ambitions will not stop with Westemär\n  alone.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Reborn Flames</h2>\n<p>\n  The Knights of the Silver Order insist that destroying all the delerium in\n  Drakkenheim must be done to avert an apocalypse, but whether accomplishing\n  such a task is even possible is uncertain. Conversely, the Followers of the\n  Falling Fire vehemently believe delerium offers the key to salvation, but this\n  divine upheaval will require thousands make pilgrimage to Drakkenheim. Both\n  factions think they can achieve their goalsby resurrecting a legendary\n  harbinger of the Sacred Flame.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Beneath the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio lie the bones of Argonath, an\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ckOF3vQrnjFnZIDU]. Although the wyrm has\n  been dead for over five hundred years, Saint Vitruvio proclaimed that in the\n  city's darkest hour, a faithful soul could cast\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO] on the dragon's remains\n  to bring it back to life. However, a much more powerful gemstone is required\n  for this purpose: either the <em>Diamond of Mount Kadath</em>, a priceless gem\n  located in the royal vault of Castle Drakken, or the\n  <em>pristine delerium geode</em> taken from the Delerium Heart in the Crater.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once resurrected, Argonath only heeds the words of one who bears all the\n  <em>Relics of Saint Vitruvio</em>. Otherwise, he slumbers.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.SaiT000000000027], found in\n    Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.IgnT000000000023], sealed\n    beneath the cathedral catacombs.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.TheT000000000026], found in the\n    royal apartments of Castle Drakken.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.HelT000000000025], located in\n    the crypts of Saint Selina's Monastery\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.items.Item.SceT000000000024], located in\n    the Chapel of Saint Brenna\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Purged with Dragonfire</h3>\n<p>\n  If resurrected by the Silver Order, Argonath helps the knights burn\n  Drakkenheim to the ground. Destroying all the delerium within the ruins is a\n  monumental undertaking, but just might be possible with the power of an\n  ancient gold dragon. Argonath's flames deal radiant damage, not fire damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A suitable climax could see the player characters riding Argonath into the\n  Crater alongside the Knights of the Silver Order, where they battle to destroy\n  the Delerium Heart. If they are successful, the Haze will gradually disappear\n  over the next two decades. The change becomes evident when many monsters grow\n  timid and the mists slowly recede. Smaller pockets of delerium continue to\n  emerge, however, necessitating constant cleanup efforts. The Silver Order\n  staunchly maintains control over the city until the work is done, though other\n  factions such as the Amethyst Academy and the Followers of the Falling Fire\n  will almost certainly continue opposing their efforts. Once every trace of\n  contamination is eradicated, people may return to Drakkenheim to rebuild.\n  Unfortunately, unless a new monarch is firmly established in another city (see\n  “Restoring the Throne” above), the political outcome for Westemär is grim. The\n  nation disintegrates into a dozenwarring provinces long before Drakkenheim\n  itself is restored.\n</p>\n<h3>Darkness and Salvation</h3>\n<p>\n  Should Argonath be resurrected by the Followers of the Falling Fire, the\n  worshipers use the dragon to drive out the Knights of the Silver Order and the\n  Amethyst Academy. Thereafter, Argonath keeps vigil over Drakkenheim,\n  protecting future pilgrims who come to join the Falling Fire. Lucretia Mathias\n  will die a few months before her 100th birthday, but before her death, she\n  writes one final testament. It affirms the deepest shadows are yet to come,\n  but the Sacred Flame will spark again from a moment of utter darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Provided charismatic disciples such as the player characters rise to take her\n  place and lead the Followers of the Falling Fire, the nascent religion\n  spreads. New converts flow into Drakkenheim to take the sacrament - first\n  hundreds, then thousands, then more. The Falling Fire continues to face\n  intense persecution from the mainstream clergy, but the resurrection of\n  Argonath by a group of supposed heretics shakes the foundations of the faith\n  in the eyes of the laity. In time, millions come seeking a place in the new\n  divine order. When these individuals die, their golden delerium soulstones are\n  gathered in the Crater. However, Drakkenheim is never truly rebuilt; the ruins\n  come to be seen as a holy place.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Followers of the Falling Fire do nothing to prevent new delerium\n  formations, and so the Haze spreads unabated. The faithful stay the course as\n  the world slowly descends into chaos over several decades. Sanctified devotees\n  may survive within the Haze, but monsters grow great and terrible as the whole\n  earth is swallowed by the mists. Even mighty Argonath eventually falls. When\n  the world begins shaking apart, the final Follower of the Falling Fire\n  completes the sacrament before a vast assemblage of golden delerium crystals\n  containing millions of righteous souls. In that moment, Lucretia Mathias'\n  prophecies might come to pass, or they might not. Either way, the world\n  undergoes a new apotheosis in a brilliant corona of multicoloured light.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Sequestered City</h2>\n<p>\n  The Amethyst Academy wants to harness the arcane power of delerium, and\n  believes they can contain the dangers involved. Eldrick Runeweaver has\n  designed a monstrously powerful version of the\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jmfu8zj4zjjzUbeh] spell, one large enough\n  to form a containment dome enclosing the entire city. This is a closely\n  guarded secret, and he will not reveal this plan until every piece is in\n  place.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Such a dramatic display of magical power is a major political risk for the\n  Amethyst Academy. They won't carry out this plan without support from a new\n  monarch of Drakkenheim, or at least with sufficient backing from whatever\n  authority remains in Westemär. The archmages claim the barrier is the best\n  hope for eventually restoring Drakkenheim: it will allow the Amethyst Academy\n  to carefully extract the delerium so they can put it to proper use\n  constructing magic items, which they will happily sell to anyone who can\n  afford them. Once all the delerium is quarried, the Amethyst Academy claims\n  they will lower the barrier and help rebuild the city.\n</p>\n<p>The spell requires tremendous arcane power to set in motion and maintain:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    The Inscrutable Tower Nexus acts as the fulcrum of the spell. The\n    Inscrutable Staff is needed to reactivate and control the Nexus for this\n    purpose.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Characters must install a suitable local power source in the Nexus: a\n    <em>pristine delerium geode</em> taken from the Delerium Heart in the\n    Crater. Thereafter, a new delerium crystal must be supplied daily to\n    maintain the spell.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    A special arcane siphon must be installed at the Delerium Heart to channel\n    its power to bolster the spell.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    8 arcane spellcasters who can cast spells of 5th level or higher must\n    participate in the ritual. At least one must be capable of casting 9th level\n    spells.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  Naturally of course, the player characters are called upon to enact these\n  plans and participate in casting the spell, which might prompt a last-ditch\n  sabotage attempt from an enemy faction. Once cast, the spell is indeed\n  powerful enough to halt expansion of the Haze, effectively turning Drakkenheim\n  into a greenhouse where the Amethyst Academy may harvest and study delerium at\n  their sole discretion. Thereafter, only Academy mages and their designated\n  allies are permitted through the barrier. A few scavengers and looters find\n  secret tunnels and hidden means of entry, and occasionally, monsters escape\n  via the river or underground passages. The city remains a dangerous place, but\n  one largely quarantined within the colossal prismatic barrier. However, rather\n  than strip-mine delerium, the Academy carefully cultivates it. The barrier\n  remains indefinitely, because the Academy intentionally allows more delerium\n  to grow within to maintain their supply. The Amethyst Academy uses its\n  newfound wealth and influence to clandestinely reshape the political destiny\n  of the continent, and possibly even unravel the Edicts of Lumen.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Nevertheless, should the prismatic barrier fall through sabotage or\n  negligence, the results would be appropriately catastrophic. The feedback\n  force shatters the Inscrutable Tower and causes the Haze to violently explode\n  outward for hundreds of miles around. The volatile magic greatly accelerates\n  the expansion of the Haze, and the world is destroyed only a few years later.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Anarchy in Drakkenheim</h2>\n<p>\n  In the midst of ongoing conflict, it's possible none rule the ruins save\n  monsters and mayhem. Perhaps several of the plans above fail, no credible heir\n  survives, and the player characters and factions decide that Drakkenheim is\n  best abandoned. A new ruler might decide to establish another city as the\n  capital of Westemär. Unless they possess both political savvy and military\n  strength, Westemär will likely fragment into several smaller realms as a\n  result. Indeed, this is the most likely course unless the player characters\n  intervene, though one that unfolds over decades of intrigue, betrayal, and\n  war.\n</p>\n<p>\n  By that time, the situation in Drakkenheim may become even more dire as the\n  Haze grows larger and larger. In about a decade, containment will become\n  almost impossible when more dimensional rifts and greater horrors begin to\n  awaken within the Crater. A few may callously conclude that the destruction is\n  still centuries away, and so the Haze is a problem for future generations to\n  inherit. Other powerful and wealthy recluses might selfishly plot to save\n  themselves by fleeing to other worlds. Perhaps, a new generation of hopeful\n  heroes may come together and try to save the world before it is too late.\n</p>\n<div class=\"img-frame\">\n  <img style=\"max-width:400px;transform:scaleX(-1)\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/0126_BOOK_Wizard_Portrait_CMYK.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n  <p>Delerium Mage</p>\n</div>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>\n    “The city is not a place people come without purpose.But some people's\n    purpose can only be found here.”\n  </p>\n  <p><cite>— Sebastian Crowe</cite></p>\n</blockquote>"

However, any 5e-compatible monster could conceivably stalk\n  the cursed streets of Drakkenheim as a twisted product of eldritch\n  contamination, or magically conjured from distant netherworlds by the Haze.\n  Use these modifications as inspiration to adapt your favourite monsters from\n  other sources into twisted abominations in Drakkenheim.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Mechanical Features</h2>\n<p>\n  All non-humanoid creatures encountered in Drakkenheim possess the following\n  traits. These do not change the monsters' challenge ratings.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Fully Contaminated.</em></strong> This creature is immune to\n    contamination, and has advantage on saving throws against contaminated\n    spells.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Haze Adaptation.</em></strong> This creature may benefit from a\n    long rest finished within the Haze. It can see twice as far through the Haze\n    mists and Deep Haze fog.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Haze Dependence.</em></strong> This creature gains one level of\n    exhaustion for every twenty four hours it spends outside the Haze. These\n    exhaustion levels cannot be removed while the creature is outside the Haze.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Delerium Healing.</em></strong> As an action, a monster can\n    touch a delerium shard to regain 10 ([[/r 3d6]]) hit points. Once a monster\n    has used a delerium shard in this way, the shard can't be used in this\n    manner again for twenty four hours.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  These benefits do not apply to creatures originating outside the Haze or who\n  are recruited or conjured by the characters, such as familiars and summoned\n  monsters.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Roleplaying Characteristics</h2>\n<p>\n  All monsters inhabiting Drakkenheim are irrevocably gripped by otherworldly\n  madness. Many become predatory and violent as a result, but a few are lucid.\n  However, even these creatures possess an unstable consciousness that drifts\n  between psychosis and psychopathy. They do not understand the origin of their\n  malevolent predilections. All monsters have the following roleplaying\n  characteristics:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Personality Trait.</strong> I'm irritable or outright hostile around\n    humanoid creatures. Logic and reason confuse and frustrate me.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Ideals.</strong> I feel a strange compulsion to contaminate or\n    devour humanoid creatures.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Bonds.</strong> I'm obsessed with delerium crystals and wish to bask\n    in their warm glow.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Flaws.</strong> I have one or more forms of indefinite madness, and\n    often have trouble remembering what I was doing even a few moments ago.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  A creature's reaction to other monsters in the Haze depends on its own nature.\n  It may be ambivalent, avoidant, hostile, or even servile.\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />"

A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.\n</p>\n<p>On a failed save, the creature takes 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage, and is pushed 10 feet and knocked prone.

Often covered in thick fur, their colouration and features vary from hound-like to wolf-like, but all bear sharp teeth and claws. They form hyper-aggressive and predatory warpacks equipped with weapons taken from the many failed military attempts to reclaim the city. These beasts revel in their countless battles with adventurers and the Hooded Lanterns. The garmyr warpacks have made the Inner City their hunting ground, but have been sighted roving the countryside with increasing frequency. They live for the thrill of the hunt, and mock and taunt their prey as they chase them down.

The gargant dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Contaminating Beam.</strong></em> The grotesque gargant magically forces a creature it can see within 60 feet of it to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

However, delerium geodes release a random @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.tables.RollTable.pPGtKhPFFcHortCT]{Arcane Anomaly} when destroyed (see below).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Delerium Hazards</h3>\n<p>\n  When a humanoid creature touches delerium without protective gear (such as gloves or tongs) for the first time on their turn, or ends their turn in bodily contact with delerium, they must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage and gain one level of contamination (see\n  <strong>Appendix C)</strong>.\n</p>\n<h3>Delerium Harvesting</h3>\n<p>Delerium found in Drakkenheim is usually fused into the ground or stone buildings, and may be carefully extracted using handheld mining equipment such as shovels, picks, hammers, and chisels. Consult the table to determine how long it takes characters to harvest a shard. Lacking proper equipment, extraction takes ten times as long. Massive clusters are impossible to extract without heavy equipment or powerful magic.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Uses for Delerium</h2>\n<p>Delerium has vast arcane potential. Beyond trade, crystals are used for several purposes:</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Spell Component. </em></strong>Delerium may be used as an arcane focus or material component for any spell on the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent value to the required cost.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Magic Items. </em></strong>Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Several new magic items are described herein, but any existing magic item described in the Core Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM's discretion, characters who can cast 5th level spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Stable Delerium. </em></strong>The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk contamination when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Delerium Dust. </em></strong>Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ]. Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks for <em>spell scrolls</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Improvised Weapons &amp; Ammunition. </em></strong>Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a sling or fashioned into a makeshift club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, and non-contaminated creatures struck must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed.\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>“The essence of delerium is intoxicating, like looking upon raw power. I swear you can feel it draw you in. A lesser man might be drawn to the contamination, embracing it fully as a gift.”</p>\n  <cite>— Sebastian Crowe</cite>\n  <p> </p>\n  <p>“It's heavy and dangerous like some of the best men I know, including me.”</p>\n  <cite> — Pluto Jackson</cite>\n</blockquote>"

While many monsters and NPCs know these spells, <em>they are not available to player characters at the outset of the campaign</em>. Instead, characters must either study the spell from a found spellbook or scroll, locate a mentor to teach them the spell, or research the spells themselves!</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Learning the Spells</h2>\n<p>Once they've found a spellbook or teacher, a character must spend downtime and gold to master the spell before they may cast it. For each level of the spell, the character must spend two days of downtime and 100 gp practicing the spell. Once complete, the character may prepare the spell, add it to their spellbook, or replace a spell they already know with the new spell, as appropriate for the spellcasting features of their class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Researching New Spells</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.ConT000000000001], @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.ConT000000000002], @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.NeuT000000000006], and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-core.spells.Item.SipT000000000011] are totally undiscovered at the outset of the campaign, and must be researched by the player characters themselves. The spell descriptions outline the prerequisites needed to successfully research the spell. Once these requirements are met, a character must spend downtime and gold to complete the research: for each level of the spell, the character must spend 5 days of downtime and 250 gp. Once complete, the character may prepare the spell, add it to their spellbook, or replace a spell they already know with the new spell, as appropriate for the spellcasting features of their class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Secret Spells</h2>\n<p>In the world of Drakkenheim, several powerful spells found in the Core Rules are significantly rarer than normal: @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.TIoadMIsUKD4edXi], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jccbeBIfLrqEZnDP], @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY], and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]. At the Game Master's option, player characters must obtain knowledge of these spells in the same manner as other spells presented in this book.</p>\n<p>Non-player characters do not have access to these spells unless specifically indicated in their description or game statistics. Furthermore, the material components for these spells are exceptionally scarce and should be treated as consumable magic items of very rare (for 7th and 8th level spells) or legendary rarity (for 9th level spells).</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Contaminated Spells</h2>\n<p>Several spells include the “contaminated” descriptor beside their school of magic. Such spells always require delerium as a material component, and cause the caster to gain contamination when cast, as described in the spell description of each spell. The spellcaster can't prevent or ignore gaining this contamination level by any means, otherwise a contaminated spell simply fails.</p>\n<section class=\"spell\">\n  <h3>Conjure the Deep Haze</h3>\n  <p><span class=\"type\">5th level contaminated conjuration</span></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</li>\n    <li><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</li>\n    <li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a delerium fragment worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)</li>\n    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination.</p>\n  <p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of the Deep Haze on a point you choose within range.

              "text": "<p>Many different people lived in Drakkenheim. The neighbouring countryside and the realms beyond are no less diverse, though humans make up the majority of the population in the current age. In ancient days, the industrious dwarven folk built great underground empires, the alien elves raised mystical towers, while the orcish people constructed monuments and menhirs to honor their old gods. Today, their descendants and those of many other ancestries inhabit the continent, though few would associate their varied biological distinctions with any single nation, culture, or religion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Dwarves</h2>\n<p>Many dwarves tell tales of ancient underground kingdoms that hoarded vast mines of gold and gems and fought great wars miles below the surface. The foundations upon which Drakkenheim were built date back to these times, and traces of dwarven architecture and engineering can still be found in the fortifications, aqueducts, and deep vaults of the city. However, the days of the dwarven realms have long passed, and the dwarven people have no great holds of their own any more. Still, many dwarves dwell in the mountains and keep the traditions of their ancestors: mining, smithing, and engineering. Many more are much less tied to these traditions now, so it is not unusual to see a small number of dwarves in just about any community.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Elves</h2>\n<p>No one knows when elves came to these lands, or exactly how they got here. Even the most ancient among them tell little more than vague myths about their origins. These stories claim that millennia ago, the elves came into this world through fairy realms and shadow gates from a distant and long-lost land.Why the elves left, none can say. Today, the elves live in diaspora. Only a handful of elven families dwell in even the most populous regions. Although rare, they are no longer regarded as strangers to these lands. In fact, half-elves are now much more common than those of pure elven descent. Though elves remember little of their history, they still possess great knowledge of magic. The few elven ruins found across the continent contain mysterious portals and arcane lore. The reason they were abandoned remains unknown.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Halflings</h2>\n<p>These smallfolk often form their own communities within settled lands, just as often as they live alongside the other people of the continent. Many live a rural life, tending farms, orchards, and fishing villages. Dozens of halfling villages surrounded Drakkenheim, the bounty of their fields feeding the city. Though these communities were not outright destroyed when the meteor struck, they have not escaped its devastation. The eldritch contamination spreading from the ruins and the threat of monstrous raiders have forced many smallfolk to abandon their homes. Their once-quaint underhill abodes and welcoming hamlets are now eerie ghost-towns.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Humans</h2>\n<p>Most of the population of the continent are humans, who range in all shapes, sizes, colors, skills, and beliefs. Humans tell countless tales of their origins, and tend to regard wherever they were born as home. They formed many of the great noble and royal houses of the continent, and the endless conflicts between these families have defined the political landscape of the realms. One such family, House von Kessel, ruled Drakkenheim until the meteor and years of civil war ended their regal line.</p>\n<p>Humans have long mingled with other peoples, resulting in half-elves, half-orcs, and half-dragons. Though such people often bear distinct physical traits, such individuals are recognized for their shared human origin. Indeed, humanity has often intentionally sought to enhance their lineages. During antiquity, many powerful sorcerous dynasties infused their bloodlines with the essence of infernal and celestial entities, bequeathing their progeny with an enduring magical legacy. Though these old empires have long since fallen, their descendants have since spread throughout the world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Uncommon Origins</h2>\n<p>Though their populations are sparse, many other peoples inhabit the world of Drakkenheim, including catfolk, dragonborn, gnomes, goblins, orcs, and tieflings. No matter their origin, there is no reason any type of character would be out of place arriving in Drakkenheim. Players should work with the Game Master to invent how their ancestry choice could have a place in Drakkenheim.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />"

            "Realms of the Continent": {
              "name": "Realms of the Continent",
              "text": "<p>\n  The people who inhabit the world of Drakkenheim simply call it “the earth” or\n  “the world”. They live on “the continent” that is divided into several nations\n  which people refer to as “the realms”. The largest and most politically\n  influential of these sovereign states are <strong>Caspia</strong>,\n  <strong>Elyria</strong>, and <strong>Westemär</strong>. Neighbouring each are\n  several petty kingdoms and dozens of city states.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Westemär</h2>\n<p>\n  The Realm of Westemär stretches north from the Drakeclaw and Glimmer\n  Mountains, along the Crystal Coast to northern tundras. The heartland is made\n  up of deep dark forests surrounding wide flowing rivers, interspersed with\n  areas of fertile marshland. The land is prosperous and rich in natural\n  resources: iron, salt, and coal mines, fine timber, and excellent quarries.\n  These industries supported the realm's once-great military strength and built\n  the impressive architecture of its cities. As such, the nobility are\n  distinguished, but materialistic and prideful, in contrast to the hard-working\n  and pragmatic common folk.\n</p>\n<h3>A Broken Realm</h3>\n<p>\n  Drakkenheim was the capital of Westemär and home to the ruling family,\n  <strong>House von Kessel</strong>. After the meteor fell, the two surviving\n  scions of House von Kessel clashed over succession in a brutal civil war that\n  tore the nation apart. After many assassinations, accidents, and disastrous\n  battles, the civil war ended with no clear victor. Most believe House von\n  Kessel is now extinct, and the throne remains abandoned and empty in the ruins\n  of Castle Drakken. The lands surrounding Drakkenheim are now contaminated, and\n  most villages nearby are deserted.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lacking a sovereign ruler, the nobility manages their own domains directly.\n  They remain deeply divided based on which branch of House von Kessel they\n  supported during the civil war. Many grievances remain, and occasional\n  skirmishes occur between the squabbling barons, counts, and dukes. However,\n  after nearly a decade of fighting, their coffers are empty and their blood is\n  spent. Few possess the will or resources to continue these feuds for the time\n  being. Many noble families possess some relation to the royal line, yet none\n  have the political clout or military strength to press a claim upon the throne\n  and reunify the nation.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Elyria</h2>\n<p>\n  The realm of Elyria lies on a large peninsula south of the Drakeclaw\n  Mountains. The land comprises vast rolling prairies and river basins broken up\n  by rocky arid hills and a mountainous coast. Nestled within are pockets of\n  imposing pinewood forests, and great deposits of precious minerals such as\n  gold and silver. Elyrians are known for being kind-hearted and outgoing folk\n  eager to share the bounty of their land. Most live a rural life in small\n  villages along the rivers and coasts. Indeed, the fertile river valleys at the\n  heart of Elyria were an early cradle of civilization, and the countryside is\n  dotted with the ruins of ancient cities.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Holy City of Lumen is the capital of Elyria. The Faith of the Sacred Flame\n  was founded here, and the shining city is the seat of power for the\n  <strong>Divine Matriarch</strong>. The most fervent and orthodox adherents to\n  the faith are found amongst the Elyrian people. Beyond Lumen, there are few\n  large cities save several bustling port towns that are hubs for international\n  trade. The Elyrian navy is amongst the finest in the continent.\n</p>\n<h3>A Rising Theocracy</h3>\n<p>\n  Originally, Elyria was a monarchy, but today, the nation is effectively a\n  theocracy ruled by the Divine Matriarch. As leader of the Faith of the Sacred\n  Flame, the Divine Matriarch has traditionally been regarded as a pillar of\n  wisdom, truth, and justice, so they often mediate difficult political matters.\n  When the Elyrian royal line went extinct, a parliament drawn from the Elyrian\n  nobility determined that the Divine Matriarch would appoint a Lord Regent to\n  lead them. Together, the noble parliament and the Lord Regent would serve as a\n  ruling body for the nation.\n</p>\n<p>\n  However, in recent decades, successive Divine Matriarchs have used this power\n  to select a line of caretaker regents who defer to the Faith on virtually all\n  matters of state. While members of the clergy take vows of poverty that\n  preclude them from holding actual political station, the parliament is now\n  mostly made up of fundementalist nobles staunchly loyal to the religion, and\n  the Lord Regent is almost always a close relative of a prominent High\n  Flamekeeper or the Divine Matriarch. As a result, the Divine Matriarch wields\n  <strong><em>de facto</em></strong> political authority in Elyria.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Caspia</h2>\n<p>\n  The realm of Caspia stretches in an expanse between the Glimmer Mountains and\n  the Diamond Sea. It is a rugged and mediterranean nation, home to a boisterous\n  and affable people led by a constantly squabbling nobility.\n</p>\n<h3>The Kingsmoot</h3>\n<p>\n  Caspians elect their High King once each decade, from candidates put forth by\n  the princes of their noble houses. The valorous deeds and reputation of the\n  noble houses is a major factor in determining the High King. Though Caspian\n  politics are always shifting, especially as the next Kingsmoot draws near, it\n  has stood as a remarkably stable nation. As such, Caspians love to meddle in\n  the politics of Elyria and Westemär. They often intermarry with the nobles of\n  different realms to gain greater clout and influence for the next Kingsmoot.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Wars and Conflicts</h2>\n<p>\n  The realms have been shaped by centuries of war, from Elyrian rebellions\n  against ancient sorcerer-kings, to great battles between rival Caspian\n  princes, and most recently, the civil war that ravaged Westemär.\n</p>\n<p>\n  By law and custom, none with arcane spellcasting powers may hold a noble title\n  within the realms. Instead, the noble houses prize the martial arts. Many\n  fighting traditions have developed: armoured phalanxes, archery, fencing,\n  berserking, and diverse unarmed combat techniques. Duels and trial by combat\n  are a particularly favoured means to settle disputes amongst the nobility with\n  minimal bloodshed. The realms of Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär have each\n  developed their own distinctive styles and practices for such contests.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Travel and Trade</h2>\n<p>\n  Commerce, rather than conflict, defines everyday life for common folk in the\n  realms. Merchant caravels and ships frequently carry cargo across the Diamond\n  Sea from the Caspian port of Jackson's Keep or the independent city-state of\n  Liberio. Other vessels depart from the ports of Drannsmund in Westemär and\n  Angel's Landing in Elyria, and sail the Middle Ocean to the far west. Trade\n  caravans from Geldstadt travel across the Twin Vales to distant lands beyond\n  the steppes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Magical goods and services are bought and sold throughout the continent, but\n  only amongst the wealthy and powerful. High-ranking nobles outfit their\n  favoured knights with magical arms and armour, and rich merchants buy spells\n  and wondrous items to safeguard their valuable mundane wares. The manufacture\n  and sale of arcane commodities is controlled by the Mage Guild, a branch of\n  the <strong>Amethyst Academy</strong>. Under strict edicts recognized across\n  the realms, any mage or trader dealing in magic pays an annual fee to the Mage\n  Guild, and must follow the prices set by the guild.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A few are bold enough to skirt these requirements. As a result, smugglers,\n  hired muscle, and rogues can make their fortune in the illicit trade of\n  enchanted gear and forbidden magic items. This underground black market has\n  only expanded since delerium has become such a valuable and sought-after\n  export.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Free Lands</h2>\n<p>\n  Though the realms boast mighty armies and legal customs, these have little\n  authority outside cities and settled farmlands. Not far off the major trade\n  roads and rivers, the wilderness remains a place ruled by the laws of nature,\n  not the laws of mortals. The dark forest of Achtungwald, the wet bogs of the\n  Elfmire, the massive mountains that separate the realms, the northern tundras,\n  and the arid hills of Elyria are dangerous lands, where dragons, trolls,\n  giants, and monsters keep their lairs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  However, these wild places are also home to many people who do not reside\n  under the control of the realms. Living in small tribes, they keep their old\n  ways and old faiths, led by stout-hearted warriors and druids who embrace the\n  fury of the elements.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Wider World</h2>\n<p>\n  The continent meets the vast Middle Ocean along its western coast. Across this\n  body of water is a distant continent. While bold and well-travelled merchants\n  often make the voyage, few folk in the realms know anything of those antique\n  lands.\n</p>\n<p>\n  East of Westemär are the Twin Vales, nestled between great mountain ranges.\n  Beyond these are expansive steppelands and vast deserts that lead to parts\n  unknown. Off the Crystal Coast, to the north, is the island of Skye, further\n  beyond is the North Pole. South of Caspia is the Diamond Sea; across are\n  realms that often trade with Caspia and Elyria.\n</p>\n\n<hr class=\"decor-line\" />\n\n<br /><br />\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-core/assets/art/Com_Ghostfire_NB_new_fonts.webp\" alt=\"\" />"

              "name": "Magic and Spellcasters",
              "text": "<p>\n  Magic suffuses the world of Drakkenheim, but mortal spellcasters are rare.\n  Only about one in every thousand people can cast spells, and roughly\n  two-thirds of these only ever master cantrips and first-level spells in their\n  entire lifetimes. The few who can work greater magic often wield tremendous\n  personal, social, and political power. Though rare, magic is common currency\n  for nobility, clergy, wealthy merchants, and adventurers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Only a handful of living mortals can cast ninth-level spells. Most are\n  secretive recluses or legendary figures. Harnessing more magical might than\n  most mortals can even comprehend, they often turn their attention away from\n  earthly affairs to contemplate the cosmic order, fighting unseen battles\n  against supernatural foes whose very nature threatens to tear the world\n  asunder.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The common folk regard spellcasters with superstition and awe. There was a\n  time when arcane magic users faced extreme persecution, and echoes of those\n  prejudices remain. Few even understand the difference between sorcerers,\n  warlocks, and wizards — they are collectively referred to as ‘mages'. However,\n  commoners can recognize spellcasters who are clerics of the Sacred Flame or\n  mages of the Amethyst Academy by their symbols and attire. Spellcasters who\n  are not (or do not claim to be) members of these recognized organizations are\n  often mistrusted and feared by commoners.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Arcane Magic</h2>\n<p>\n  The arcane magic of sorcerers and wizards draws upon otherworldly energies.\n  The ability to tap into these forces is reliant on a recessive genetic trait\n  in mortals - such individuals are called <em>mageborn</em>. Signs that a\n  person is mageborn typically emerge in late childhood or early puberty,\n  usually as random displays of wild magic. In some rare cases it does not\n  develop until adulthood. Mortals who lack the mageborn gene cannot become\n  sorcerers or wizards under any circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>\n  By law, the Amethyst Academy takes guardianship over any child born in the\n  realms who manifests magical ability, whether they are a royal heir or\n  commoner. A child who bristles against Academy training — or who was not taken\n  in by them — most often becomes a sorcerer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Bards and warlocks also work arcane magic, but do not necessarily depend on\n  mageborn lineage to do so. Instead, warlocks gain arcane power through pacts\n  with eldritch entities, and bards find supernatural inspiration to harness the\n  Words of Creation. Regardless, many keep their powers secret.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Divine Magic</h2>\n<p>\n  In the world of Drakkenheim, divine spellcasting powers are not granted by\n  gods. Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins learn to cast spells by\n  channeling the supernatural forces of light and shadow that underscore the\n  cosmos. In theory, such powers are attainable by anyone, but in practice only\n  exceptionally gifted individuals master even the lowest-level divine spells.\n  As such, divine spellcasting is viewed as a disciplined and sacred technique\n  attainable only by those with sufficient will and devotion, and only after\n  years of meditation and training. Its practitioners are not considered\n  mageborn.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Violating one's religious tenets will not cause a cleric, druid, or paladin to\n  lose their powers. However, a personal crisis of faith brought on by some\n  discordant change in behaviour and morality could cause an individual to lose\n  their divine spellcasting powers. More often, a cleric, druid, or paladin who\n  commits some grave trespass risks retribution from other members of their\n  religion.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Other Spellcasters</h2>\n<p>\n  There are many rudimentary techniques for casting a small smattering of\n  cantrips and lesser spells, represented by rangers and subclasses or feats\n  that grant minor spellcasting features. Such characters are viewed as merely\n  dabblers, not mageborn.\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>\n    “Warmongers that hide behind divine purpose are still warmongers.

            "Faith and Religions": {
              "name": "Faith and Religions",
              "text": "<p>\n  In the world of Drakkenheim, gods do not physically manifest in the world,\n  intervene in mortal affairs, or speak directly with mortals. Myths and legends\n  passed down from distant eons tell such tales, but these events have not\n  happened in recorded history. Instead, the inspired words of prophets,\n  oracles, and heroes laid the foundations for the world's many religions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Powerful extraplanar entities such as archangels, demon lords, and outsiders\n  exist and interact with mortals. Many extensively meddle in earthly matters,\n  making pacts and offering dark counsel. Some even claim to be gods. When asked\n  questions regarding the true nature of the cosmos or divinity, however, they\n  speak in cryptic riddles.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Sacred Flame</h2>\n<p>\n  This is the dominant religion throughout the realms. Also known as the Divine\n  Light, its teachings and beliefs are tightly woven into the social and\n  political fabric of Caspia, Elyria, Westemär, and their neighbouring domains.\n</p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>\n  Myths about the Sacred Flame have ancient roots, but the contemporary religion\n  began a thousand years ago with the valiant <strong>Saint Tarna</strong>.\n  Although most of her life she was a ruthless warlord, light flickered in her\n  dark heart. Guided by angels, she learned to channel the Sacred Flame and\n  became the first paladin. She took up the cause of righteousness and\n  sacrificed herself to defeat an evil sorcerer-king. After her martyrdom, her\n  disciples spread her teachings and established the Faith of the Sacred Flame.\n</p>\n<h3>Beliefs and Tenets</h3>\n<p>\n  Faithful of the Sacred Flame do not worship a deity. Rather, devotees pray for\n  guidance from a transcendent divine force that they believe is the source of\n  all light and goodness. Symbolized as the Sacred Flame, this brilliant beacon\n  inspires mortals to act with benevolence, honor, and righteousness. The\n  religion brings a message of dutiful hope: even the smallest flame may light\n  the way through the darkest night. The core tenets of the religion are\n  conceptualized as follows:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>The Hearth</strong> spreads compassion. One must nourish the hungry;\n    offer shelter to the cold; and give succour to those who suffer. Spiritual\n    warmth comes when the community is gathered together before the Flame as\n    neighbours.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>The Lantern</strong> illuminates the way of truth. The light reveals\n    what is hidden by darkness, and shows the way to understanding. One should\n    not silence truth, nor speak falsehoods.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>The Torch</strong> displays the duty of all faithful to uphold the\n    cause of justice. One cannot abide when evil stirs; nor stand idle when\n    corruption spreads: callousness and indifference permit selfishness, greed,\n    and hate to multiply.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>The Candle</strong> symbolizes hope and redemption. Show those who\n    are in darkness the light. Offer mercy to the guilty; no shadow is absolute\n    so long as a flickering flame remains.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  Followers of the Sacred Flame believe that when mortals die, the divine light\n  guides righteous spirits to the place where dawn breaks over the Shadowlands.\n  Their luminous souls shine eternally, driving back the endless darkness that\n  threatens all life.\n</p>\n<h3>Holy Sites and Symbols</h3>\n<p>\n  A goblet of fire or a lit candle represents the Sacred Flame in holy symbols.\n  Believers join hands in a circle around a roaring fire and sing hymns during\n  worship rites. The holy text of the faith is called the\n  <em>Song of Fire</em>. Saint Tarna is typically depicted as a silver-haired\n  warrior bearing a longsword. She is often shown in battle against demons and\n  witches, sometimes astride her griffon, Aarak.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär, most towns have at least one chapel devoted\n  to the Sacred Flame. Often at the heart of their communities, these domed\n  sanctuaries are built around a hallowed brazier set alight with a golden\n  @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f]. Major cathedrals to the\n  Sacred Flame are found in large cities, and many are brilliant architectural\n  wonders in their own right, decorated with painted murals, stained-glass\n  windows, and statues depicting the saints and martyrs. The small shrines in\n  most villages are usually simply an awning built over a bonfire pit.\n</p>\n<h3>Religious Hierarchy</h3>\n<p>\n  Ordained priests of the Sacred Flame are known as\n  <strong>Flamekeepers</strong>. These clerics of the Sacred Flame are\n  predominantly women*; they wear flowing vestments of white, yellow, and gold.\n  Flamekeepers take vows of poverty, eschewing all personal possessions and\n  living on the commonwealth of the faith.Chapels and cathedrals of the Sacred\n  Flame are ministered by a Flamekeeper, who is assisted by a few devoted\n  acolytes. Smaller villages rely on lay ministers to keep their shrines. The\n  highest authority amongst the priesthood of the Sacred Fire is the\n  <strong>Divine Matriarch</strong>, who tends the Cathedral of Saint Tarna in\n  the holy city of <strong>Lumen</strong> in the land of Elyria.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em>* Although this represents the formal religious hierarchy, people of any\n    gender identity may become clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame and rise\n    to positions of honor and reverence.</em>\n</p>\n<h3>Clerics of the Sacred Flame</h3>\n<p>\n  Through deep spiritual discipline and steadfast devotion, some faithful may\n  become living vessels for the Sacred Flame. These rare individuals hold the\n  power to channel its light in the earthly realm to work divine magic. As\n  clerics of the Sacred Flame, they become enlightened healers, custodians of\n  truth and knowledge, or fiery beacons of light. However, not every cleric of\n  the Sacred Flame becomes a Flamekeeper or participates in the organization and\n  politics of the religion.\n</p>\n<h3>Paladins of the Sacred Flame</h3>\n<p>\n  Legend claims Saint Tarna was the first paladin. These warriors hold deep\n  reverence amongst the faithful, as only truly virtuous souls can wield the\n  Sacred Flame as she once did. Paladins of the Sacred Flame swear sacred oaths\n  of devotion, redemption, and vigilance. Inspired by Saint Tarna's example,\n  many join knightly orders ordained for righteous purposes. Such companies of\n  holy warriors and their martial retainers embark on quests and crusades to\n  destroy supernatural forces of evil and root out creatures of otherworldly\n  darkness. The most well-known and decorated amongst these militant fellowships\n  are the Knights of the Silver Order.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Other Religions</h2>\n<p>\n  Although many people keep the Flame, there are hundreds of smaller religions\n  with disparate beliefs, doctrines, and practices. Here are some of the most\n  notable.\n</p>\n<h3>The Old Faith</h3>\n<p>\n  This disparate religion is dedicated to a pantheon of primal deities who have\n  whispered to mortals through nature for untold generations, such as primal\n  Nodens, vengeful Kromac, honorable Nuada, and nurturing Danu, but there are\n  countless more. Their beliefs and practices vary widely based on the tenets of\n  the specific patron god, but their myths often surround the elements, the\n  seasons, the land, and ancestor worship. Many such beliefs originated with the\n  ancient orcish and dwarven peoples of the continent. Others are closely\n  connected to mysterious entities who inhabit extraplanar worlds such as\n  Dreamland, the Elemental Chaos, or the Feywild, and are often kept by the\n  elves. Druids are particularly common adherents and priests of the Old Faith,\n  but clerics and paladins of the Old Faith are not unknown.\n</p>\n<h3>Shadow Cults</h3>\n<p>\n  Throughout the ages, various ‘shadow faiths' and heretical sects have emerged\n  surrounding the Sacred Flame, some of which embrace an opposing force called\n  the Exalted Darkness. These cults develop their own mysteries and esoteric\n  practices, or devote themselves to worshipping enigmatic god-like beings such\n  as Morrigan the Phantom Queen, the Night Serpent, the Lord of the Undead, and\n  powerful entities who inhabit the Shadowlands or the Abyss.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some of these chthonic entities seek to devour the light and plunge the world\n  into darkness unending. However, not all of these faiths are evil, with\n  practitioners who view shadow and light as part of a necessary balance.\n  Regardless, followers of the Sacred Flame condemn these beliefs, banishing\n  their rites and practices. In the same manner that deep faith and\n  contemplation leads followers of the Sacred Flame to become clerics and\n  paladins, one may also channel the Shadow itself. Clerics are heralds of\n  twilight, trickery, magic, and death, and paladins often invoke dark oaths to\n  vengeful causes or ambitious conquest. Followers of the Shadow Faith may even\n  become warlocks, embracing dark and fiendish patrons.\n</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>\n    “I am told many a story about the exploits of brave Caspian warriors, and I\n    take them in the same way I do my meals... with a grain of salt.”\n  </p>\n  <cite> — Veo Sjena</cite>\n  <p> </p>\n  <p>\n    “The name breathes life into me.

The realm of fey is sometimes called by different names, such as Tír na\n  nÓg, Wonderland, Avalon, Elfhame, and the Elusive Realm. It is uncertain\n  whether or not these names refer to regions within the realm or are in fact\n  distinct worlds entirely.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>The Elemental Chaos.</em></strong> A primordial place of raw\n  energy and unbridled potential, the individual planes of air, earth, fire, and\n  water are found within its churning storms and burning seas.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Afterworlds</h2>\n<p>\n  The afterworlds are places where mortal souls go when they die.

Most souls pass into the Shadowlands on their\n  way to the afterworlds, but some wander here forever.
