An owlbear, a creature that combines the aggression of a bear with the irascibility of an owl, is already anything but docile. The influence of the Fey Lands has done nothing to bridle these extreme emotions. In fact, the suneater owlbear is more territorial, more grouchy, and more ravenous then its Material Plane counterparts.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Catch the Sun.</strong></em></span><span class=\"None\"> The suneater owlbear can feed on sunlight. It dislocates its huge maw to reveal the photosynthetic pigments specially-adapted to catching the hues of light shed by the Fey Lands’ eternal sunset. One should avoid exposed outcroppings of rock in the Fey Lands; these vantage points are often a suneater owlbear’s dinner table, and suneaters are extremely territorial.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">By comparison, the bright daylight of the Material Plane is a feast, albeit an ephemeral one. The suneater owlbear is used to a constant food supply and the diurnal cycle to which so many Material Plane beasts are adapted leaves a suneater feeling particularly hangry and irritable.</span></p><p><em><strong>Indolent and Iridescent.</strong></em> The term Batesian mimicry comes from the dungeoneer Bates Buttonchop who would disguise himself as a black pudding in order to loot monster-filled crypts. The dungeon natives would avoid Bates’s disguise, having been stung by puddings before, leaving him free to purloin all manner of precious treasures. Suneater owlbears, who’re vulnerable in their darkened caves, use this Batesian mimicry to appear like observers, dangerous eye-tyrants from The Low. This combination of above-ground ferocity and below-ground intimidation has proved quite the survival strategy.</p></div>",
