I just want you to know that this time it is not entirely my fault. My name is Sebastian Crowe, you probably know me as the greatest sorcerer on the continent. If the stories you heard involve a rat problem in Drakkenheim, that was the other Sebastian Crowe. So here is the deal: my friends and I have been working diligently to contain the horrible contamination within Drakkenheim, and have been doing an exceptional job. Now before you congratulate me, I should have you know that some other, not-so-great people thought it would be fun to trade delerium all over the continent. The Haze is spreading, people are dying, and everyone keeps yelling at me to make decisions and it all sounds really important and I'm just not well equipped to deal with such drastic decision making alone! Furthermore, the monsters are getting really, really bad, and I have almost died. Many times. Despite my vast magical powers, I can usually only manage to be in a few places at once, not everywhere. The Academy Directorate seems upset. The Hooded Lanterns seem upset. At this point, I think it's safe to assume that everyone is upset.</p>\n  <p>So, I'm begging you! Whether you are one of those brute warriors from the Isles of Skye or Netherwind, or a great commander from the civil war. Maybe a fancy bard from Caspia, or a lizard-riding ranger from Terene, just come to Drakkenheim, please. We need you! I know you apothecaries are all hiding in your labs mixing poisons, but we have enough issues going on and we need your brains on this matter post-haste.</p>\n  <p>So come to Drakkenheim! The air is toxic, the water is contaminated, and you can't sleep within a few miles of the city, but as the smartest man I ever knew once said “What's the worst that could happen?”</p>\n  <p>Kindly</p>\n  <p><cite>S.C.</cite></p>\n</blockquote>"

class=\"dropcap\"><strong>德拉肯海姆已不复存在</strong>。在那个凄惨的夜晚，一场由陨落星辰组成的骇人风暴摧毁了这座城市，只留下一颗将产生深远影响的陨星。十五年后，德拉肯海姆徒余一片满是断壁残垣的废土，其中满是异界魔法的污染。更广泛世界的政治秩序已经支离破碎，被宗教分裂和逼近的军事冲突撕裂。与此同时，一股阴险的恐怖正从德拉肯海姆的暗影中悄然浮现，侵入了一个对这种噩梦毫无防备的世界。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">使用本书</h1>\n<p><em>塞巴斯蒂安·克劳的德拉肯海姆指南</em>是一本用于在德拉肯海姆世界中创建玩家角色和冒险的设定集。本指南与第五版游戏规则兼容，无论您是参与《德拉肯海姆之墟》的史诗战役，探索其他奇幻世界，还是将这些丰富的内容融入您自己的世界之中，都将找到所需的工具和灵感。</p>\n<p>为了充分利用本指南，您将需要一本第五版的核心规则书。在本书中，粗体文本通常引用生物或非玩家角色的数据卡，而斜体文本则指向特定的法术或魔法物品。本书精心编纂了众多全新的怪物、物品和法术，为您的冒险增添更多可能性。请注意，如果法术名称前带有星号（*），这意味着它是本书独有的内容，在“德拉肯海姆的魔法事务”一章中有详细说明。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">本书中的内容</h2>\n<p><strong>大陆地理志</strong>。本书的这一部分探索了德拉肯海姆周围更广泛的世界。它扩展了关于维斯特玛、卡斯匹亚和伊利瑞亚的知识、人物、历史、角色和地点，这是一个被政治阴谋和魔法师、贵族和神职人员之间的冲突所笼罩的大陆。</p>\n<p><strong>德拉肯海姆角色</strong>。本章提供了一个完整的指南，用于创建准备踏上德拉肯海姆世界冒险的玩家角色。它为核心规则中呈现的每个核心职业提供了新的子职业，特殊的专长允许角色以被扩展的方式使用工具，并引入了药剂师，一个拥有医疗专长和神秘魔法的全新可玩职业。</p>\n<p><strong>德拉肯海姆的魔法事务</strong>。为药剂师和核心职业提供新的法术，以及一系列危险和致命的污染法术，角色可能会冒险施放！此外，本章还呈现了一系列与故事情节相关的强大神器。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">德拉肯海姆的主题</h1>\n<p>在德拉肯海姆的幻想世界里，玩家扮演的角色将自己的个人故事融入一个充满政治阴谋和神秘恐惧的黑暗背景中。以下是支撑德拉肯海姆世界的核心概念：</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">妄质</h2>\n<p>一颗陨星撞击德拉肯海姆，留下了丰富的妄质水晶。这些彩虹般的水晶散布在废墟之中，蕴藏着巨大的魔法潜力，却同时辐射出能引发疯狂和怪物变异的污染能量。虽然这些水晶带来了危险，但它们非常适合于制造魔法物品和强化新的法术。因其超凡的力量，妄质水晶在神秘学圈子和黑市上都极为珍贵。许多勇敢的探矿者不惜一切代价搜集这些水晶碎片，尽管这种神奇的矿石的真正起源仍是一个谜。</p>\n<p>妄质水晶辐射出的能量形成了一种称为“污蔼”的魔法现象。污蔼以其虹彩般的雾气为标志，能够阻止角色在其影响范围内获得长休的收益，并且会逐渐污染在其中停留超过一天的任何人。</p>\n<p><strong>附录D：妄质</strong>中详细介绍了这些水晶的信息。</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n            <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">内容警告</h2>\n            <p>德拉肯海姆描述了一个黑暗奇幻世界。我们建议玩家和主持人在战役开始前开诚布公，讨论他们的底线和禁忌。要进行这样的对谈，请注意，在这个设定中，以下内容是常见的：</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>暴力、谋杀、血腥、残虐、食人和肉体恐怖</li>\n                <li>导致身体畸形和疯狂/精神错乱的退化性突变</li>\n                <li>老鼠、蜘蛛、虫子、恶魔、不死生物、幽魂和其他怪物</li>\n                <li>自然灾害、大量丧生、内战、流离失所的难民</li>\n                <li>道德模糊地带、社会/政治操纵、宗教狂热和军事民族主义</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>本世界不包括露骨的性行为、性侵、种族偏见、系统性种族主义、恐同或跨性别恐惧。任何此类推论都完全是偶然。</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</aside>\n<h3>德拉肯海姆之外的恐怖</h3>\n<p>自陨石坠落之日起，许多人愚昧地认为那座被诅咒的城市中的疯狂与混乱仅限于其废墟之内。然而，他们大错特错。妄质水晶正缓缓地从德拉肯海姆渗透出来，向邻近的城镇乃至遥远的国度扩散。不论是被勘探者成功的偷运到铅衬里的箱子里，还是随着德兰河水流向下游，亦或是被从废墟中逃出的怪物偷走，不是所有的妄质碎片都落入了能够明智利用它们的人手中。即便是最微小的碎片，也足以在一个宁静的小村庄中引发大规模的混乱。很少有人真正理解这些怪异水晶所带来的威胁，更不用说拥有抵御随之而来恐怖的手段或技能了。</p>\n<p>尽管这些恐怖的传说在整个大陆上广为流传，但各个敌对派系对于这些水晶的处理方式——是应该将其摧毁、加以利用还是进行崇拜——意见分歧极大。这些日益激化的分歧正威胁着一场全面战争的爆发。</p>\n<h3>古怪污染</h3>\n<p>在德拉肯海姆的世界中，人物将会遭遇由混乱魔法、异界生物和妄质腐蚀所引起的古怪污染。这种污染使得常规的能力、装备以及用于防护疾病、抵御魔法、抵抗毒素的法术全部失效。它不会自然愈合，也无法用低环法术，例如次级复原术@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]消除。</p>\n<p><strong>附录C：污染</strong>解释了古怪污染的规则以及它可能引起的可怕变异。</p>\n<p>在@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.book.JournalEntry.drakscgd03chapte]中介绍的众多新玩家选项，以及@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.book.JournalEntry.drakscgd04chapte]中包含的法术，为角色们提供了防护和克服污染的手段，或者利用它来对付敌人的策略。</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n            <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">受污染的玩家选项</h2>\n            <p>污染法术、叛道法师、污染结社德鲁伊、污霭狂怒者野蛮人和妄质之魂术士在一次性冒险、短期遭遇，或者设定在德拉肯海姆之外的冒险中可能会显得过于强大。在这种情况下，我们建议游戏主持人在允许玩家角色使用这些选项之前，仔细考虑如何平衡他们的游戏活动。</p>\n            <p>此外，如果您正在进行德拉肯海姆之墟战役，游戏主持人可能会要求玩家角色在完成个人任务或对戏剧性事件做出反应后，才能选择这些特定的子职业。这意味着角色可能需要先以不同的子职业进行升级，然后在活动中适当的时机，通过重新训练来选择这些受污染的选项之一。</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</aside>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">冲突之境</h2>\n<p>十五年前，德拉肯海姆的覆灭将世界推向了混乱，但冲突的萌芽早已悄然生根。居住在德拉肯海姆的人们，充斥着缺陷与过错。大陆上的贵族阶层不断谋划着扩大他们的权力、财富与影响。许多人梦想着坐上国王的宝座，而他们的君主则抱有征服帝国的野心。他们运用的政治策略包括结成政治婚姻、展示军事威慑、利用经济优势、施行诽谤与诋毁、运用巧计和进行暗杀。</p>\n<p>因此，大陆的政治格局是在摇摇欲坠的联盟、激烈的争端、尖锐的竞争和深仇旧恨之上建立的。和平只是在笨拙的谈判条约和武力报复的威胁下暂时维持，或者在交战双方需要时间恢复、重组军力和补充国库时才会出现。</p>\n<p>人类行为并非总是遵循逻辑，某些历史性的灾难正是由于糟糕的决策引发。掌权者很少能够放下彼此的分歧，共同面对威胁；即便在共同的威胁面前，也很难实现合作。许多人在道德观和对世界未来的愿景上存在根本性的分歧。然而，在大多数情况下，他们只是不愿与他人分享权力。在这些团体必须为了生存而合作的绝境中，一旦威胁消退，他们便会争先恐后地超越对方，或是寻找方法从危机中获得长期的优势。</p>\n<h3>维斯特玛</h3>\n<p>维斯特玛正处在当前冲突的前线，因为德拉肯海姆曾是其帝国首都。当这座城市遭到毁灭时，乌尔里希四世国王及其直系后裔均告失踪。虽然普遍认为他们已经遇难，但他们的确切命运至今仍是一个谜。国王两位幸存的兄弟之间长期的分歧最终使得国家深陷一场持续了十年的内战之中。命运的残酷讽刺在于，这场战争最终夺去了国王兄弟及其子嗣的生命。如今，维斯特玛的政治秩序已经四分五裂。面对王位空缺，各地的贵族纷纷采取行动，或是试图建立自己的小型王国，或是直接角逐王位。</p>\n<p>同时，德拉肯海姆城已成为一片荒芜的废墟，成为了各种奇异生物、不死怪物和异界恶魔的栖息之地。</p>\n<h3>伊利瑞亚</h3>\n<p>沿着生息河的肥沃山谷得到滋养，伊利瑞亚半岛成为了大陆上人类文明的摇篮。在远古时期，暴政的巫王在这片土地上建立了血腥的奥法王朝，他们以魔法至上的理念统治着大陆上的其他民族和国家。一种新兴的宗教激发了人民挣脱压迫者枷锁的勇气，这一转变标志着现代时代的开端，也见证了这片土地作为伊利瑞亚国家的救赎与复兴。</p>\n<p>今日，伊利瑞亚成为了天火信众的核心地区。在其君主制一百年前被废除之后，现在实际上由@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5]——该信仰的领袖——所领导。由于这个宗教在整个大陆上拥有深远的影响力，伊利瑞亚的力量不仅限于其国界之内，通过其骑士团的军事实力以及众多圣火守护者的建议与劝导，对其他国家产生了深刻影响。</p>\n<h3>卡斯匹亚</h3>\n<p>骄傲的卡斯匹亚，由六个相互敌对的家族构成，它们均是伟大创始人雷克斯·卡斯匹安的后代。这些家族拥有大陆上最杰出的战士和怪物猎手，他们不断地通过比赛和较量来确认哪个家族最为强大。卡斯匹亚是一个以战争、胜利和鲜血为基础的国家；在这里，战斗和战利品的价值远超过魔法或宗教。</p>\n<p>尽管卡斯匹亚是一个充满争议和频繁爆发内部冲突的国家，但它们在面对更大威胁时能够团结一心，没有任何外敌能够成功地侵略或击败卡斯匹亚。</p>\n<p>每十年，卡斯匹亚通过比赛和投票选出一位至高王。在被称为“选王会”的选举中，六大家族都会展示他们的最伟大成就、胜利和战利品，以期赢得卡斯匹亚接下来十年的统治权。<strong>维纳斯·乔普林二世</strong>在过去的三十年里一直担任这一职务，成为该国历史上任期最长的至高王。</p>\n<h3>炉明法令</h3>\n<p>所有大陆国家都是炉明法令的签署成员，这份协议是在数十年的血腥冲突之后签订的一个里程碑。它确立了贵族统治者、神圣之火的神职人员以及紫晶学院的奥术施法者之间的权力均衡。根据炉明法令，奥术施法者不得持有贵族头衔。虽然炉明法令没有将魔法视为非法，但它对教授魔法的人和提供魔法服务的人施加了限制。</p>\n<p>炉明法令通过体现所有签约方的共同政治意志，为大陆带来了和平与稳定。但是，这份庞大的文件存在诸多缺陷、疏漏和漏洞。许多人试图规避或公然违反这些限制，而不会引发另一场灾难性的战争。然而，最近的灾难已经对炉明法令的稳固性提出了挑战，它可能无法再长期阻止冲突的再次爆发。</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n            <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">德拉肯海姆的派系</h2>\n            <p>在德拉肯海姆的废墟之上，五大派系展开了激烈的争夺，每个派系都试图控制废墟及其内部发现的珍稀物质——妄质。这些派系的特工遍布大陆，不仅寻求招募新的英雄加入他们的行列，还在努力搜集额外资源，以支持他们在这座曾经繁华都市的废墟中作战的部队。</p>\n            <h3>覆影明灯</h3>\n            <p>他们的正式名称为“第四非正式首都光复远征军”，以夺回首都为目标，是一支由内战老兵和旧德拉肯海姆城市守卫残余组成的非正规军队。由冷酷的<strong>艾利亚斯·德雷克希尔总司令</strong>领导。他们发动了一场游击战，对抗盘踞在首都中的怪物、盗匪和拾荒者。每个人都发誓用生命来重建德拉肯海姆，并光复维斯特玛王国。</p>\n            <h3>女王的弟兄们</h3>\n            <p>“女王的弟兄们”是数百个土匪、亡命徒和无赖帮派组成的松散联盟，他们都效忠于神秘的盗贼女王。这些道德败坏之徒捕猎被吸引到这座城市的朝圣者、探矿者和探索者，打劫和勒索冒险家，将妄质走私给遥远土地上声名狼藉的客户，还掠夺城市中留下的美妙宝藏和财富。盗贼女王梦想着在废墟的无政府状态和混乱中建立一个有影响力的强大犯罪帝国，并随时密谋着对付其他派系。</p>\n            <h3>白银骑士团</h3>\n            <p>白银骑士团是一个由宣誓的圣武士和虔诚战士们组成的组织，他们发誓要与超自然的邪恶、黑暗的魔法和异界的入侵者作斗争。探险骑士们常常以小团体或队伍的形式在王国中旅行，并信仰主流宗教神圣之火。然而，白银骑士团最近集结起来，整个骑士团都被派往德拉肯海姆，任务是摧毁那里扎根的邪恶魔法。</p>\n            <h3>天火信众</h3>\n            <p>“天火信众”是神圣之火的分裂教派。他们相信陨星指向神圣的预言，认为妄质是一种神圣的馈赠，这些神圣的石头将会在更大的黑暗面前提供救赎。预言者<strong>卢克雷蒂亚·马西亚斯</strong>激发了大批虔诚的信徒现在还是踏上了前往达肯海姆的危险朝圣之旅，以期在神圣的蓝图中占据自己的一席之地。尽管他们的信仰基于神圣之火的教义，但由于对妄质的亵渎崇拜，他们被主流教士们标记为疯狂的异端。</p>\n            <h3>紫晶学院</h3>\n            <p>紫晶学院是一所为术士和法师们开办的魔法学校，它的学生们在偏远的城堡和僻静的大学中研习魔法。在一位强大的大法师组成的神秘集团的领导下，学院还经营着一个富有进取心的法师公会，掌控着魔法物品的制造，并暗中经营着颇具影响力的奥法帮派，为整个大陆的贵族们提供奥法咨询服务。</p>\n            <p>根据法律，紫晶学院对大陆上展现魔法能力的任何孩子负有监护责任，无论他们是皇室继承人还是平民。他们教导这些年轻的魔法师学习魔法，通过纪律严明的教育，大多数人成为法师。一个反抗学院训练的孩子，或者偶然没有被学院收养并在没有学术指导的情况下发展自己的魔法的孩子，通常成为术士。</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</aside>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">神秘魔法</h2>\n<p>在德拉肯海姆世界中，混乱的异界力量支撑着宇宙。魔法的真实本质只被其凡人居民模糊地理解，其中的奥术施法者极为罕见。每千人中仅有一人能施展魔法，而其中大多数一生仅能掌握戏法和一环法术。</p>\n<p>普通人不习惯怪物，也不理解魔法。怪物存在，但普通民众见到它们会颤抖不已。位面宇宙学是神秘而无法知晓的，但智者们仍然发展出许多相互矛盾（且极其不正确）的理论。</p>\n<h3>魔法血脉者</h3>\n<p>在德拉肯海姆世界里，术士和法师的奥术魔法源自于异界位面的能量。能够驾驭这股力量的关键，依赖于凡人体内隐性遗传特征；拥有此特质的个体被称作魔法血脉者。魔法血脉者往往会将他们的魔法才能遗传给下一代，尽管这种遗传并非绝对。这种基因有时会在几代人之后才显现，或者在没有魔法背景的家族中意外出现。通常，一个人是魔法血脉者的迹象会在儿童时期首次显现，表现为随机的狂野魔法显现，而到了少年时期，他们的施法能力则会完全展现出来。虽然有记录表明，某些个体直到成年后才开发出这种特质，但这类案例极为罕见。</p>\n<p>在德拉肯海姆，术士和法师之间的区别主要在于他们的教育和训练方式；他们力量的根源实际上是一致的。不具备魔法血脉基因的普通人无法成为术士或法师。</p>\n<aside

<p>邪术师通过与异界宗主达成契约来掌握魔法，尽管任性的妖精、恶毒的邪魔和专制的巨龙不会轻易地分享他们的力量。然而，这条途径仍然是非魔法血脉者获取强大奥术力量的主要方式之一。虽然邪术师本人可能不具备魔法血脉，但他们往往会生出拥有魔法血脉的后代。接受魔能契约的过程会在他们体内留下一种微妙的奥术污染，这种污染在后代中显露，有时会导致出现带有异界特质的后代，如提夫林。反之，术士和法师有时并不会将自己的魔法天赋传递给后代。在这种情况下，他们的子女可能会通过寻求异界契约来重新获得魔法力量。</p>\n            <p>吟游诗人如何利用他们的音乐魔法，至今仍是一个谜。在所有奥术施法者中，他们的魔法既罕见又充满神秘。</p>\n            <p>药剂师通过融合科学与秘术知识创造出魔法效果，他们并非必须是魔法血脉者。</p>\n            <p>除此之外，还有多种魔法技术，其中一些允许施法者施放少量简单的法术和咒语，这些施法者以游侠为代表，或是那些提供施法特性的子职和专长。这些施法者通常不属于魔法血脉，因为他们依赖于使用物质成分和技巧来触发周遭环境中潜在的魔法力量，而非直接与异界能量建立联系。法师们常将这类施法者视作业余爱好者。</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</aside>\n<h2

class=\"dropcap\">尽管在其海岸之外有遥远的土地，但德拉肯海姆世界中的冒险发生在大陆内部。这些土地曾经被奥法王朝统治，如今由几个独立的国家组成。通过共同的历史、信仰、贸易和条约连接在一起，这些领域可能是坚定的盟友，但同样经常是激烈的敌人。</p>\n<p>德拉肯海姆世界没有名字：其居民简单地称之为“世界”或“大陆”。反过来，大陆本身没有名字，只是被称为“大陆”。在日常谈话中，大多数人谈论大陆是一个由不同国度组成的地方。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">大陆的历史</h1>\n<p>这个世界的远古历史已然湮没，早期历史更多沉浸于神话与传说之中，而非确凿的事实。人类并不真正了解自己的起源，不同的文化和宗教背景下诞生了各种各样截然不同的创世故事。信奉神圣之火的人们认为，这个世界是从光明与阴影的分离中诞生的，所有凡人的宿命都是在黑暗的世界中寻找光明。而先古信仰则叙述了一场围绕着原始神灵家族的争斗，这些神灵塑造了世界并播撒了生命的种子。深究宇宙奥秘的秘术法师们则推测，这个世界可能是混沌之中机械齿轮的产物，幻象转化为现实，或是其他更为奇异的理论所造就。</p>\n<p>此处所记载的事件，应被视为在此历史背景下，历史学家们之间的主流叙述，而不必然代表完整的真相。尽管许多人可能对过去的某些事件持有自己的坚定看法，但这些故事总是会因叙述者的视角而有所不同。细节可能被有意略去，或因疏忽而遗失，甚至随着时间的流逝而消逝。即便是如龙和恶魔这样古老且不朽的生物，在被询问关于人类起源的问题时，也常常避而不谈，顶多只提供些许反复无常的猜测和模糊的解释。</p>\n<p>尽管如此，这些重大的历史事件已经塑造了当今大陆的政治格局、冲突纠葛以及文化风貌。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">魔法起源</h2>\n<p>自古以来，便有些许罕见之人天生具备施展奥术魔法的能力。相传，这种魔法源自于与那些早于世界伟大文明，且已被遗忘的古老异界实体所缔结的原始契约。由于这些奥术契约的影响，古代邪术师们受到了某种污染，其后裔很可能天生就具备术士的天赋，并将这股魔法力量传承给了他们的子嗣。然而，这种遗传下来的魔法力量，并不伴随着邪术师们通过契约所获得的控制力。当那些低语魔法之源秘密的神秘存在沉默无声时，魔法便变成了一种野性且难以驯服的力量，使得一代又一代的术士们天生就拥有着超凡脱俗且混乱的力量。大多数人都在努力控制自己的能力，因此魔法常常被恐惧、迷信和敬畏所包围。</p>\n<p>随着时光流逝，一些决心坚定的术士开始寻找新的方法来稳定他们的魔法力量。出于对自身可能对社区构成的威胁的恐惧，这些施法者选择自我放逐至荒野。他们中的一些人深入山脉，另一些人则深入森林，还有些人漫步于沙漠与冻土之上。这些早期的术士通过与精之国度及元素混沌的能量接触，并寻求古神的智慧，与自然界建立了深厚的联系。当他们放弃奥术魔法的追求时，他们开始揭开德鲁伊魔法的原初之秘。然而，直至今日，德鲁伊们依旧谨慎地守护着他们的秘密。德鲁伊魔法的最初实践者们发现，即使是那些未曾拥有魔法血脉的人，也能够驾驭元素之力，尽管这需要通过多年的训练以培养出的坚强精神意志来实现。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">巫王的崛起</h2>\n<p>与此同时，其他魔法血脉者观察到，他们的术士能力不仅能传给他们的孩子，他们能施展的法术也能被传承下去。这些足智多谋的魔法血脉家族渴望更大的力量，因此寻求有利的配对。伟大的王朝因此崛起，其后裔能够施展如灼热射线、火球术和火墙术等法术，而另一个王朝则拥有如闪电束、风墙术和连锁闪电等力量。然而，这是一个不完美的过程，大多数术士仍然被他们的狂野魔法所困扰。</p>\n<p>几年之后，在龙爪山脉的南部阴影下，八大术士家族的首领找到了一种完美的方法，以驯服长久以来困扰他们家族的混乱魔法。通过将他们的血脉与龙的血脉结合，他们发现自己能够不仅增强，还能精炼流淌于血脉中的魔法力量。尽管这个过程需要经过几代人的精心匹配，但最终，他们的后代所拥有的天生奥术力量达到了无与伦比的境界。这些孩子们从出生开始就充满了电光火石般的能量与魔法之火，在少年时期便能够施展出他们的曾祖辈一生都难以掌握的强大法术。其中一些人仅凭一句轻语便可让整支军队服从其意志，而另一些人则能在瞬间将整个军队化作灰烬。</p>\n<p>这些自负而鲁莽的年轻人，认为既然他们的血统已经赋予了他们如此强大的天赋与掌控力，他们便无需耐心或遵循纪律。他们从长辈手中夺取了权力，认为自己有资格这么做。这批杰出的施法者开始发动毁灭性的魔法战争以征服整个大陆，这些战争在大地上留下了不可磨灭的疤痕。由于奥术施法能力是一种遗传特征，这些新兴的法师领主及其亲信将政治与魔法的力量传承给了他们的后代。如此，奥法王朝便就此诞生。</p>\n<p>虽然历史记载中将奥法王朝的统治者称作巫王，但在他们自己的时代，他们自诩为神，并据此统治着臣民。出于对潜在对手崛起、可能拥有匹敌之力的担忧，巫王们压制了对古神的崇拜，嫉妒地守护着奥术知识的秘密，并要求其他施法者臣服于他们，成为他们的附庸。对于那些不具备奥术力量的人，他们则将其视作不过是劳工和财产。随着时间的流逝，为了维护自己对权力的控制，他们不惜与邪恶生物缔结黑暗契约。世界上诸多强大的魔法物品在此时被创造，宏伟的纪念碑拔地而起，而那些可怕的暴君们则用鲜血和魔法铸就了他们的邪恶帝国。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">巫王的陨落</h2>\n<p>在奥法王朝最黑暗的日子里，圣塔尔娜，一位为巫王效力的军师领袖背弃了他们的邪恶道路，在天使的召唤下归向正义的成为了第一位圣武士。她击杀了巫王乌尔班五世，并与他的继承人泽安德十三世战斗了十二年。她最终牺牲生命，击败了他的恶魔军队。尽管泽安德的继任者卡尔斯特里克七世折磨并处决了许多圣塔尔娜的追随者，但他们未能压制她的神圣教义。神圣之火的牧师和圣武士将一种新的希望与光明的宗教传播给了长期被压迫、渴望自由与正义的人民。</p>\n<p>虽然巫王的统治并没有随着圣塔尔娜的征战立即结束，但她的事迹确实引领了奥法王朝的衰落。实际上，巫王们在经历了几年的魔法驱动的近亲繁殖后，变成了颓废放纵的暴君。在三百多年的叛乱、动荡和冲突中，曾经牢牢掌握在巫王手中的领土脱离了他们的帝国，赢得了来之不易的独立。梦魇之城诺克斯陷落于神圣之火信仰，重生为圣城炉明，巫王的最后一人逃离了大陆，前往遥远的土地。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">猎巫行动</h2>\n<p>随着巫王的铁腕统治画上句点，那些天生具备奥术施法能力的人们，开始面临来自现如今广泛传播的神圣之火信仰的剧烈歧视。直至今日，奥术魔法依旧被看作是一种不可预测的威胁，众多普通民众将拥有魔法血脉的孩子视为一种恐怖的诅咒。尽管如此，部分贵族家族仍旧保留着自巫王时代以来的领土和血统遗产。这些贵族家族通过运用他们的魔法力量，在政治、经济、以及社会各方面为自己谋求利益，这极大地激怒了他们的宗教信徒。</p>\n<p>在第四年的末期，圣主母慈悲一世支持了一连串针对魔法血脉者的残酷迫害，声称这样的措施是为了确保奥法王朝永远不会复返而必须采取的。不论贵族还是普通家庭，都被逐出家园，他们的财产和土地被没收，有的父母甚至在发现自己孩子拥有魔法能力时，亲手将其杀害。</p>\n<p>作为对此的回应，一个由术士组成的地下组织应运而生，其宗旨是将年轻的魔法血脉者从他们充满敌意的社区中救出。这些法师成为了现代紫晶学院的先驱，他们在隐秘的堡垒和秘密学校中工作，致力于保护其他魔法血脉者，并守护奥术魔法的知识。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">炉明法令</h2>\n<p>随着时间的推移，紫晶学院通过为贵族提供秘密的魔法服务、秘法咨询、制作魔法传家宝、用奥术守护保护他们的城堡，以及教授他们的继承人魔法，从而在贵族中获得了盟友。当神圣之火的信徒发现了这些计划时，一系列新的残酷的审查和复仇的巫师猎杀活动开始了。圣主母正义七世特别为追捕紫晶学院及其领导者而圣洗了白银骑士团。几年以来，圣武士和术士之间的暗影冲突演变成了公开的战争，这场战争是在那些支持神圣之火信仰的贵族家族和那些支持紫晶学院的贵族家族之间进行的。</p>\n<p>四十年的血腥冲突以炉明法令的签订而结束。这一具有里程碑意义的条约在三百年前颁布，停止了宗教派系对奥术魔法的血腥镇压。该协议建立了法师、宗教信仰和贵族在整个大陆之间的新权力平衡，这一平衡持续至今。</p>\n<section

Myths and legends passed down from distant eons past tell such tales, but such events have not occurred in recorded history. Instead, the inspired words of prophets, oracles, mystics, and heroes laid the foundations for the world's many religions. Today, those faiths form the foundation for the culture and customs found throughout the continent.</p>\n<p>Powerful extraplanar entities such as archangels, demon lords, and outsiders do exist, but only occasionally interact with mortals. They meddle in earthly matters by making magical pacts, sharing arcane knowledge, and offering dark counsel, but rarely reveal their true motives or origins. Some even claim to be gods. When asked questions regarding the true nature of the cosmos or divinity, however, angels and demons alike speak in cryptic riddles.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Faith of the Sacred Flame</h1>\n<p>“The Faith” is the dominant religion throughout the continent. Most humans are adherents to the Faith or were raised within its influence, though how strongly they hold their convictions varies greatly. Also known as the Divine Light, its teachings and beliefs are tightly woven into the social and political fabric of Caspia, Elyria, Westemär, and their neighboring domains.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Background</h2>\n<p>Myths about the Sacred Flame have ancient roots, but the contemporary religion began a thousand years ago with the valiant Saint Tarna. Today, the story of Saint Tarna is told and retold through religious texts, poetry, songs, and depicted in statues and paintings. Everyone living in the continent has heard some version of the tale.</p>\n<p>During the twilight of the Arcane Empire, a wicked woman known as Tarna the Terror served Sorcerer-King Ulban V. Although most of her life she was a vicious warlord and dark champion who led brutal wars and indulged in wanton vices, a glimmer of light flickered within her dark heart. She slew Ulban rather than carry out his genocidal will though she knew it would mean her own life. Ulban's heir, Xandor XIII, banished her to the pits of the Dungeons of Nox to fight and die against his monstrous pets for his entertainment. Though grievously wounded several times over, none of Xandor's monstrosities could slay Tarna, and she escaped his dungeon.</p>\n<p>Tarna fled south, seeking refuge in the Witherbleach Desert. There she believed the hidden ancient druids of the Old Gods might tend her injuries. She searched for days and nights for them to no avail. Finally, as she lay dying upon the cracked and dry earth, Tarna saw a golden comet streaking through the night sky. Emboldened by faith, she pressed on in spite of her wounds. She followed the comet to a sacred place deep in the Pale Tooth Mountains. There, she met the archangels Gabriella and Michael, who healed her body and shared with her many sacred truths. The Angels told her that she had been chosen, and that despite the darkness she had spread through the world, she would be reborn as an instrument of the Sacred Flame. In her, all mortals would know that light may still shine through the darkest night, and that no one is beyond redemption. Swearing a sacred oath to tear down darkness and injustice before the angels, she was imbued with the Divine Light of the Sacred Flame. That night, she became the First Paladin.</p>\n<p>Taking up the mantle of warlord once more, but this time for the cause of righteousness, Tarna fought for twelve years against Sorcerer-King Xandor XIII. She taught others to wield the Divine Light, and they became paladins and clerics in turn. Eventually, Tarna gave her life to defeat an arch-demon summoned by Xandor XIII. Her catastrophic sacrifice set forth a burst of holy power which banished the demon and the Spire of Nox along with it.</p>\n<p>After Tarna's death, one of her esoteric followers known only to history as the Mystic Theurge penned the<em> Song of Fire,</em> the first holy text of a new religion. Meanwhile, the sorcerer-kings tried to suppress the burgeoning faith the First Paladin inspired, but met their match in the divine might of the new clerics, monks, and paladins of the Sacred Flame. Preaching a message of hope, redemption, and justice for the oppressed, the Sacred Flame set alight a wave of rebellions and revolutions which dispelled the darkness of the Arcane Empire.</p>\n<p>The faith spread like wildfire to all corners of the continent. As the empire fractured into disparate realms around the third century, the burgeoning faith began to organize into a formal religion. The first Divine Matriarch was chosen to lead the Flamekeepers. These women would be the custodians of Tarna's legacy, charged with leading the faithful for generations to come. The clergy laid its roots in the City of Nox, transforming the wretched metropolis into Lumen, City of Light, the holy capital of the Sacred Flame. Today, faith in the Sacred Flame unites the great nations of the continent.</p>\n<h3>Beliefs and Tenets</h3>\n<p>Faithful of the Sacred Flame do not worship a god; devotees pray for guidance from a transcendent divine force which they believe is the source of all light and goodness. Symbolized as the Sacred Flame, this brilliant beacon inspires mortals to act with benevolence, honor, and righteousness. The religion brings a message of dutiful hope: even the smallest flame may light the way through the darkest night. The core tenets of the religion are conceptualized as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The Hearth</strong> spreads compassion. One must nourish the hungry, offer shelter from the cold, and give succor to those who suffer. Spiritual warmth glows brightly when the community is gathered together before the Flame as neighbors.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Lantern</strong> illuminates the way of truth. The light reveals what is hidden by darkness, and shows the way to understanding. One should not silence truth, nor speak falsehoods.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Torch</strong> displays the duty of all faithful to uphold the cause of justice. One cannot abide when evil stirs, nor stand idle when corruption spreads: callousness and indifference permit selfishness, greed, and hate to multiply.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Candle</strong> symbolizes hope and redemption. Show those who are in darkness the light. Offer mercy to the guilty; no shadow is absolute so long as a flickering flame remains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Followers of the Sacred Flame believe that the universe emerged through the separation of light and shadow in equal measure, out of which came the elements which formed the world. They teach that mortals struggle to be righteous because they are incomplete beings of light and shadow. When mortals die, their souls pass into the Shadowlands and wander until their spirits become whole — either light or shadow. The religion claims the Sacred Flame guides the soul to the place where dawn breaks over the Shadowlands. There, their spirits join the Divine Light. This congregation of brilliant souls is a beacon of hope and compassion for all mortals. Manifest in the sun and stars, the Divine Light drives back the chaos and darkness of the cosmos and allows future life to flourish.</p>\n<p>However, spirits heavy with sin, guilt, regret, and hate do not follow the light. These souls are drawn into the most terrible place in the Shadowlands, the Abyss. There, they become demons who spread darkness. As so many mortals have failed to follow the Divine Light, gradually shadows and demons have darkened this world. After all, a roaring flame shines through the night only so long as it has fuel to burn. Nothing is needed for the shadows to reign save the absence of light. The light must be sustained lest the universe fall to shadow unending.</p>\n<p>The faith does not have an open-minded view toward other religions, and teaches that the Old Gods are not divine. Instead, the official doctrine of the faith describes these beings as primeval demons, pointing to the web of associations between these so-called gods, fiendish creatures, and wicked fey. Followers of the Sacred Flame typically believe people who keep the Old Gods are misguided at best, and dangerous cultists at worst.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light sayings-of-the-faith\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Common Sayings of the Faith</h2>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“Flame be with you.”</strong></em>\n        <br />Wishing another a fond farewell and good luck.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“Your flame casts too long a shadow.”</strong></em>\n        <br />Indicates that someone is acting in a self-righteous manner which could hurt others.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“Fire burn it.”</strong></em><br />\n        Vain exclamation expressing anger, surprise, or frustration (used in the same manner as the modern phrase “damn it”)\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“The smallest light burns brightly in the deepest darkness.”</strong></em>\n        <br />A reminder to the faithful that no matter how hopeless the situation has become, small actions and faith can change the world.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em><strong>“Do not confuse the glimmer of gold for the spark of the Sacred Flame.”</strong></em>\n        <br />A warning to followers of the Sacred Flame to shy away from greed.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light passages song-of-fire\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Passages from the Song of Fire</h2>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">“And so Saint Tarna spoke, raising her blade before the throng ‘Let evil flee before righteousness; let the innocent live in peace. Let the day come when none need fear or live in ignorance.

She is often shown in battle against demons, sorcerers, and witches, sometimes astride her griffon, Aarak.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Chapels and Holy Sites</h2>\n<p>In Caspia, Elyria, Westemär, and the Eastern Vales, most towns have at least one chapel devoted to the Sacred Flame. Often at the heart of their communities, these domed sanctuaries are built around a hallowed brazier set alight with a golden @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f]. It is considered a grave omen if a chapel's flame goes out.</p>\n<p>Major cathedrals to the Sacred Flame are found in large cities, and many are brilliant architectural wonders in their own right, decorated with painted murals, stained-glass windows, and statues depicting the saints and martyrs. Such buildings house impressive altars with stone basins and use magical oils to fuel their impressive central flames which endlessly burn day and night. In addition to this major cathedral, bigger towns and cities usually have one chapel for every five hundred people who reside there.</p>\n<p>The small shrines in most villages are usually simple bonfire pits decorated with stone slabs. Such shrines are the largest worship buildings found dedicated to the Sacred Flame in the Isles of Skye, Terene, and Netherwind.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Rites and Worship</h2>\n<p>During rites of worship the Faith's believers join hands in a circle around a roaring fire and sing hymns. Flamekeepers and their acolytes lead these gatherings, calling or reciting passages from scripture, and the faithful respond as a chorus. Larger congregations will stand to form several concentric rings around massive bonfires or the great braziers which burn in the chapels and cathedrals of the Sacred Flame. Many rituals are held at sunset, so the sight of a burning fire as the sun sets against the night can remind worshipers of how the Sacred Flame holds darkness at bay. These nightly rituals conclude with worshipers lighting candles or small lanterns from the central brazier as they depart home, which symbolize the hope all must carry within themselves.</p>\n<p>Most worshipers plan a pilgrimage to the Holy City of Lumen at least once in their lives.</p>\n<p>It is custom to cremate the dead. Rather than cemeteries, which are typically rare, the faithful create a crematory garden with scattering plots near most chapels, usually watched over by statues of Saint Tarna and other martyrs. Ashes and bone fragments are gathered and kept in an ossuary beneath a church or cathedral. Skulls are typically preserved so that Flamekeepers may commune with the dead when needed. However, followers of the Sacred Flame believe that the bodies of clerics and paladins should be preserved after their deaths, should the spirits of these noble warriors need their earthly bodies again. As such, many cathedrals and chapels lie atop large catacombs where the remains of these holy figures are kept.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religious Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>The clergy of the Faith of the Sacred Flame is tightly organized:</p>\n<h3>Flamekeepers</h3>\n<p>Ordained priests of the Sacred Flame are known as @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers}. These clerics of the Sacred Flame are predominantly women; they wear flowing vestments of white, yellow, and gold. Flamekeepers take vows of poverty, eschewing all personal possessions and living on the commonwealth of the faith. Most chapels of the Sacred Flame are ministered by a Flamekeeper.</p>\n<p>In the past century, some Flamekeepers have started accepting tithes of coin in exchange for their divine spellcasting services. Ostensibly, the funds are used to support their communities and provide a modest lifestyle for the clergy. However, this matter has become increasingly controversial since Saint Tarna gave her divine blessings freely to any who sought her out in earnest need. Detractors argue the practice makes the ministry no different from the mercantile mages of the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:row\">\n  <div><img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/121-pg19-high-flamekeeper-irma-cmyk.webp\" title=\"High Flamekeeper Irma\" /></div>\n  <div><img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/122-pg19-flamekeeper-cmyk.webp\" title=\"Flamekeeper\" /></div>\n  <div><img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/123-pg19-acolyte-cmyk.webp\" title=\"Acolyte\" /></div>\n</div>\n<h3>High Flamekeeper</h3>\n<p>A High Flamekeeper is appointed to lead congregations in major cities, or train new Flamekeepers in monasteries. Others are assigned to knightly orders, noble houses, and other holy missions of great importance. This rank is only bestowed to devout clerics of the Sacred Flame who can cast spells of 5th level or higher, and who have served as Flamekeepers for at least ten years.</p>\n<p>At any given time, one third of the High Flamekeepers remain in Lumen, forming a group known as the Inner Flame. The Inner Flame is responsible for managing the administrative functions of the church as a whole, and appoints both High Flamekeepers and Flamekeepers to their positions. The positions are constantly shifting in response to the different callings of individual clerics.</p>\n<h3>Acolytes</h3>\n<p>Those with aptitude to cast divine spells may join the clergy a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolytes}. Many gather in remote monasteries to practice and meditate on their divine spellcasting abilities. Once they can master cantrips and 1st-level divine spells, they are sent to assist other Flamekeepers in chapels and cathedrals. Once they demonstrate the ability to cast the spells @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8dzaICjGy6mTUaUr] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f], an acolyte must complete a special test involving a pilgrimage to Lumen and weeks of fasting. Then they rise into the rank of Flamekeeper.</p>\n<h3>Pyre Priests</h3>\n<p>While most Flamekeepers are women, anyone capable of casting divine spells can join the clergy as a Pyre Priest. These ministers may have great influence and renown within the clergy, but can never be nominated to higher office. They serve many important functions as dignitaries, guardians, scribes, and aiding religious rites.</p>\n<h3>Lay Ministry</h3>\n<p>Smaller villages rely on lay ministers to keep their shrines, lead rites and prayers, and teach the faith, but these individuals rarely have actual divine spellcasting powers.</p>\n<h3>Divine Matriarch</h3>\n<p>The highest authority amongst the priesthood of the Sacred Flame is the<strong> Divine Matriarch</strong>, who tends Saint Tarna's Cathedral located within the holy city of<strong> Lumen</strong>.</p>\n<p>The current Divine Matriarch is Mercy V. She has held the position for two decades since the assassination of her predecessor, Courage IX. She is described in detail in the gazetteer entry for Elyria.</p>\n<p>The Divine Matriarch is chosen by the Circle of Flame, a synod consisting of 139 High Flamekeepers drawn from every major city on the continent. Once confirmed by the synod, the Divine Matriarch serves their term for life, and takes up a new name representing one of the virtues of Saint Tarna, such as Justice, Humility, Truth, Charity, or Faith.</p>\n<h3>Clerics of the Sacred Flame</h3>\n<p>Through deep spiritual discipline and steadfast devotion, some faithful may become living vessels for the Sacred Flame. These rare individuals hold the power to channel its light in the earthly realm to work divine magic. As clerics of the Sacred Flame, they become enlightened healers, custodians of truth and knowledge, or fiery beacons of light. However, not every cleric of the Sacred Flame becomes a Flamekeeper or participates in the organization and politics of the religion.</p>\n<h3>Monks of the Sacred Flame</h3>\n<p>Many monasteries have been erected throughout the continent, often close to holy sites, or places of religious importance. Monks who tend to these shrines and monasteries have meditated on the Sacred Flame, acquiring the ability to channel limited divine powers through their body and mind. Although not outright divine spellcasters, the traditions of monks of the Sacred Flame date back to the Arcane Empire, when devoted worshipers who channeled the Flame through martial practice fought against the sorcerer-kings.</p>\n<h3>Paladins of the Sacred Flame</h3>\n<p>Legend claims Saint Tarna was the First Paladin. These warriors hold deep reverence amongst the faithful, as only truly virtuous souls can wield the Sacred Flame as she once did. Paladins of the Sacred Flame swear sacred oaths of devotion, redemption, and vigilance. Inspired by Saint Tarna's example, many join knightly orders ordained for righteous purposes and relinquish any noble titles or land claims. Such companies of holy warriors and their martial retainers embark on quests and crusades to destroy supernatural forces of evil and root out creatures of otherworldly darkness. The most well-known and decorated amongst these militant fellowships are the Knights of the Silver Order.</p>\n<h3>Other Spellcasters and the Faith</h3>\n<p>One of Saint Tarna's foremost disciples was mageborn. Known as the Mystic Theurge, she learned to channel the Divine Light of the Sacred Flame through her arcane magic. The Mystic Theurge wrote the<em> Song of Fire</em>, the holy text of the Sacred Flame which chronicles Tarna's life and deeds. The fact that the Mystic Theurge was mageborn is greatly suppressed within the faith.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Shadow Cults</h2>\n<p>Throughout the ages, various so-called “shadow faiths” and heretical sects have emerged surrounding the Sacred Flame, some of which embrace an opposing force, alternatively called the Darkness or Shadow. These cults develop their own mysteries and esoteric practices. They sometimes devote themselves to worshiping enigmatic god-like beings such as the Phantom Queen, the Night Serpent, the Lord of the Undead, and powerful entities who inhabit the Shadowlands or the Abyss.</p>\n<p>Some of these chthonic entities seek to devour the light and plunge the world into darkness unending. However, not all of these faiths are evil, with practitioners who view shadow and light as part of a necessary balance. Regardless, followers of the Sacred Flame condemn these beliefs, banishing their rites and practices. In the same manner that deep faith and contemplation leads followers of the Sacred Flame to become clerics and paladins, one may also channel the Shadow itself. Clerics are heralds of twilight, trickery, magic, and death, and paladins often invoke dark oaths to vengeful causes or ambitious conquest. Followers of the Shadow Faith may even become warlocks, embracing dark and fiendish patrons.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Falling Fire</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/124-pg20-falling-fire-trinket-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/124-pg20-falling-fire-trinket-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>The Followers of the Falling Fire are a religious sect of the Sacred Flame who believe the meteor that struck Drakkenheim signaled a heavenly prophecy, and consider Delerium a holy sacrament. Called to pilgrimage by the prescient testament of their leader,<strong> Lucretia Mathias</strong>, zealous masses of devout commonfolk now journey to the crater's edge to take their place in a divine plan.</p>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias was once a prominent High Flamekeeper who read omens in the night sky, and was regarded as one of the most learned and wise amongst the clergy. She channeled immense divine power, and invoked miracles which have not been witnessed in a generation. A decade before the meteor destroyed Drakkenheim, she beheld a vision of a falling star which would arrive on earth and signal a great upheaval for the faithful. Despite her reputation, her visions were dismissed as an apocalyptic fantasy and largely suppressed at the time.</p>\n<p>Following the assassination of Divine Matriarch Courage IX twenty years ago, many considered Lucretia Mathias to be her most likely replacement. Already one of the most senior High Flamekeepers at the age of seventy, her appointment seemed inevitable when she was nominated alongside the relatively unknown and much younger Esmeralda Poe. However, Lucretia Mathias lacked any connection to the Elyrian nobility, and her open proclamations and criticisms of them had rendered her extremely unpopular. In an unexpected upset, the Circle of Flame elected Esmeralda Poe, who became @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5], the youngest Flamekeeper to assume the position.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Lucretia Mathias retreated from public life to contemplate the cosmos and await the falling star. Her visions proved true; right down to the hour. However, even Lucretia did not expect the actual destruction the meteor would cause, nor did she anticipate it would strike her birthplace, Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>She spent several years after the meteor struck contemplating the heavens and several strange stones recovered from the city. Her conclusion was dire indeed: the world stands on the precipice of darkness unending. Yet, within delerium, she saw the spark of salvation. Though the stones are the stuff of chaos, black charcoal and midnight oil may fuel a great flame. Perhaps if taken up by righteous souls, the crystals might become an earthly vessel for the Sacred Flame itself. Rather than fall to all-consuming shadows, she prophesied a New Age of Heroes which could meet the coming night. Lucretia spoke widely about her beliefs and discoveries, and her fiery sermons galvanized a throng of loyal supporters who proselytized her new creed across Elyria, Westemär, and Caspia. As her support grew, she resolved to make a pilgrimage to the crater itself to confirm her revelations.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/060-pg20-delerium-trinket-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/060-pg20-delerium-trinket-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Meanwhile, the mainstream clergy reacted to delerium with disgust and horror. When Lucretia returned from her pilgrimage bearing a delerium crystal embedded in her body, Mercy V declared her a heretic. Lucretia was defrocked and excommunicated. However, she refused to be silenced. Escaping Elyria, she expanded her original writings and published them as the<em> Testament of the Falling Fire</em>. This religious essay proclaimed a radical new doctrine for the faith, and called upon all devout believers to make pilgrimage to the Crater in Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>Only a handful of devoted acolytes made the difficult journey at first. The numbers have grown recently, and in the last year, hundreds have traveled to Drakkenheim to heed Lucretia Mathias's call. Those who finish their pilgrimage partake in a controversial rite known as the Sacrament of the Falling Fire. They take refuge in Saint Selina's Abbey, guiding new arrivals to the crater. Meanwhile, they collect delerium. They do so not for greed or power, but a supposed holy purpose, for they regard the strange stones as “sacred charcoal” from which the light of the Sacred Flame may take earthly spark.</p>\n<p>Most Followers of the Falling Fire are devout commoners who have given up their homes and former livelihoods to make pilgrimage to Drakkenheim. Others are former clergy who have broken from the mainstream faith. Lucretia Mathias's proclamations are dramatic, but underscoring her writing is a scathing criticism of the religious ministry itself which promises a return to the core values of the religion. Even before the meteor struck, many faithful in Westemär were developing suspicions and contempt for the Elyrian-dominated priesthood, which they increasingly saw as decadent and dimmed by political ambition.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light passages\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h2 class=\"sidebar-light\">Passages from the Testament of the Falling Fire</h2>\n      <p class=\"pull-quote\">\n        <em>“One day soon, we will near the end of our world<br />— an age where great heroes will be needed.

These worshipers' beliefs and practices vary widely based on the tenets of their patron god, but myths often surround the elements, seasons, land, and ancestor worship. Many such beliefs originated with the ancient peoples of the Continent, such as the dwarves. Others are closely connected to mysterious entities who inhabit extraplanar worlds such as Dreamland or the Faerie Otherworlds, and are often kept by the elves.</p>\n<p>The pantheon of the Old Gods forms an interrelated family, yet the stories and myths of the Old Gods make varying claims as to how exactly the gods relate to one another. At least half of the Old Gods claim to be the ones who made the world and all life upon it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Background</h2>\n<p>Legends, myths, and devotion to the Old Gods transcend recorded history. Ancient stories tell of them walking the world, drawing mortals into their schemes and conflicts. The worship of the Old Gods rose to prominence alongside sorcery, as the first druids sought the wisdom of the gods to harness magic.</p>\n<p>However, during the rise of the Arcane Empire, the sorcerer-kings positioned themselves as gods, above the old pantheon. They drove the druids deeper into the wilderness, and expelled temples and shrines to the Old Gods from any city they ruled. During the darkest days under the sorcerer-kings, many commonfolk came to believe the Old Gods had abandoned them for some unknown trespass. Since then, the organized religion of the Sacred Flame has swept the settled lands and cities of the continent. However, there are still a few who remember the old ways.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Beliefs and Tenets</h2>\n<p>Amongst those who keep the Old Faiths, the exact nature of their beliefs and tenets vary based on the gods they follow. Indeed, the notion of the “Old Faith” is a moniker given by the Faith of the Sacred Flame, and those who worship the Old Gods do not see themselves as part of a singular religion. Indeed, even two communities worshiping the same Old God might have extremely different rites, practices, and beliefs.</p>\n<p>Regardless, several practices are common among those who keep the Old Gods. Shrines and temples are often built in remote and wild places, among cairn stones, faerie rings, ancient trees, and other natural landmarks. Worshipers often make offerings to the Old Gods, such as a bowl of herbs, bones, or blood. Animal and even human sacrifices are not unheard of, as well as rituals where worshipers mark or scar their bodies. Many times, rituals are performed in accordance with the seasons or celestial movements, such as during an equinox or full moon.</p>\n<p>Followers of the Old Gods do not necessarily believe there is balance in nature, or seek any notion of harmony. Their rites and rituals are appeasements to their gods to spare them from nature's uncaring brutality, and a grim reminder of the animal in every human heart.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religious Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>The Old Gods do not form a tightly organized religion — there is no central authority. Conclaves and communes in remote areas spring up around the worship of one of the Old Gods.</p>\n<p>Tapping into the fundamental forces of the cosmos to work divine powers is a path which requires tremendous will, dedication, and faith, but also knowledge of ancient rites, prayers, and rituals. The followers of the Old Gods take passing down these rites very seriously, and often a cleric, druid, or paladin of the Old Gods has a mentor or instructor. Later in life, such individuals bear the burden of passing on their traditions, and many seek out a young acolyte or apprentice to instruct in their ways.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>“I hear Druids live in the desert. Sounds<br />incredibly uncomfortable.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Clerics and Druids</h3>\n<p>Druids were the foremost amongst the priests of the Old Gods. Today, druids are most often associated with Arwyn, Danu, Kromac, Nodens, and occasionally Morrigan. Clerics can be found dedicated to all of the Old Gods.</p>\n<h3>Monks</h3>\n<p>Secret shrines and communes devoted to the Old Gods can be found throughout the continent where people come to dedicate their lives to the god. These devoted monks can be found representing just about any of the Old Gods, but the most notable monasteries are ones to Danu, Dian Cheht, Lugh, and Ogham.</p>\n<h3>Paladins</h3>\n<p>Paladins devoted to the Old Gods are exceptionally rare; a paladin devoted to an Old God may know of only one other person who keeps the same oath and traditions as them, likely the person who taught them. Alternatively, a circle of druids may choose a new initiate or warrior to become a paladin to defend their grove as champion.</p>\n<p>Paladins who keep the Old Faiths tend to follow Lugh or Nuada, but paladins dedicated to Dian Cheht and Gaibhne are not unheard of.</p>\n<h3>Warlocks</h3>\n<p>Warlocks are known to take the Old Gods as their otherworldly patrons, especially Arwyn, Morrigan, Ogham, Phantasia, and Shegorach.</p>\n<section class=\"sidebar-table-wrapper roll-table-wrapper\" style=\"padding:25px\">\n  <h2>Old Gods</h2>\n  <table data-title=\"Old Gods\">\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th>Deity</th>\n        <th>Typical Alignments</th>\n        <th>Associated Animals</th>\n        <th>Symbols</th>\n        <th>Weaponry</th>\n        <th>Portfolio</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Arwyn the Moon Hunter</td>\n        <td>CG, CN</td>\n        <td>Stag, deer, faun, elk, moose</td>\n        <td>Crescent moon, stars</td>\n        <td>Spear, longbow</td>\n        <td>Hunting, rangers</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Danu, Mother Earth</td>\n        <td>NG, LN</td>\n        <td>Elephants, cattle, butterflies, doves, bears</td>\n        <td>Cornucopia, bushel of grain, fruits</td>\n        <td>Sickle</td>\n        <td>Natural life, fertility, animals</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Dian Cheht the Healer</td>\n        <td>LG, LN</td>\n        <td>Snakes</td>\n        <td>A rod with a coiled snake</td>\n        <td>Dart, dagger</td>\n        <td>Medicine, healing, poison</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Gaibhne the Smith</td>\n        <td>LN</td>\n        <td>Moles, groundhogs, beavers, gophers</td>\n        <td>Anvils, hammers, volcanoes</td>\n        <td>Warhammer</td>\n        <td>Craft, masonry, stone, earth, forges and smithing</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Kromac the Ravager</td>\n        <td>CN, CE</td>\n        <td>Wolves, lions, boars</td>\n        <td>Fangs, claws, teeth, fur</td>\n        <td>Battleaxe</td>\n        <td>Slaughter, feasting, beasts, monsters</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Lugh the Sun</td>\n        <td>NG, N</td>\n        <td>Eagles</td>\n        <td>The sun, a bonfire</td>\n        <td>Morningstar</td>\n        <td>Agriculture, fields, harvest, community, leadership, fire</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Morrigan the Witch</td>\n        <td>N, LE, NE, CE</td>\n        <td>Ravens, spiders</td>\n        <td>Skulls, spellbooks, pentagrams</td>\n        <td>Flail, whip</td>\n        <td>Fate, death, sorcerous magic, warlocks</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Nodens the Tempest</td>\n        <td>CN, CE</td>\n        <td>Krakens, sharks, dragon turtles</td>\n        <td>Crashing waves, a shipwreck, coral, lightning bolts</td>\n        <td>Trident, spear</td>\n        <td>Storms, sea, water, monsters of the deep</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Nuada the Silver Handed</td>\n        <td>LG, NG, LN</td>\n        <td>Horses, hounds</td>\n        <td>A silver hand, sword, a banner</td>\n        <td>Shortsword, longsword, lance</td>\n        <td>War, justice</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Ogham the Sage</td>\n        <td>LG, LN, LE</td>\n        <td>Owls, foxes</td>\n        <td>Eyes, octagrams, stone tablets</td>\n        <td>Quarterstaff</td>\n        <td>Arcane magic, wizardry, knowledge, science</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Phantasia the Dreamer</td>\n        <td>CG, CN, CE</td>\n        <td>Cats, fireflies, swans, and songbirds</td>\n        <td>Clouds, paintbrushes, harps, bells</td>\n        <td>Shortbow</td>\n        <td>Sleep, dreams, nightmares, imagination, creativity, music, art</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Shegorach the Trickster</td>\n        <td>CG, CN, CE</td>\n        <td>Racoons, rats, and rabbits</td>\n        <td>Dice, bones, masks, diamonds</td>\n        <td>Mace (a jester's stick)</td>\n        <td>Mischief, luck, deception, mockery, laughter, revelry, wine</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</section>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Arwyn the Moon Hunter</h2>\n<p>Arwyn stalks the fey realms and edges of dreams, hunting monsters and nightmares. She is the sister of Phantasia, the daughter of Danu, and fierce enemy of Kromac. She is often depicted as a woman carrying a longbow with legs like a faun and silvery antlers. In most artwork she is surrounded by stars and the moon. Her eyes appear as starry pools of night and her bow is said to fire pure starlight. They sometimes call the moon the Eye of Arwyn.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Many who worship Arwyn adorn their heads with crowns of antlers and paint their faces with deer's blood. Places of worship tend to be found in wooded groves and are often seeded with plants that attract deer and stags. Oftentimes carvings of moons and stars can be found upon shrines to Arwyn, and worshipers attend midnight gatherings on nights lit by the full moon.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>A common ritual for Arwyn's faithful is to slay a deer on the eve of the spring solstice. Practitioners will feast on the meat of the deer, create garments from its pelt, and splash its blood upon a holy site. This is meant to bring good hunts and safe travels for hunters through the remainder of the year. A superstition is that no hunter should attempt to hunt under the new moon, as Arwyn slumbers during this time, and it is bad luck to hunt without her watchful eye.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Danu, Mother Earth</h2>\n<p>Adherents of the Old Gods believe that all life sprang from her creation, though varying myths attribute Gaibhne, Lugh, Nodens, and Kromac as both her consorts and children. Danu is sometimes depicted as a being with the face of an elephant, four arms, each clutching one of the elements, and large butterfly-like wings. Some depictions differ and instead show this god as having a face similar to a cow or even depicted as a motherly bear. Many believe the planet is Danu in her true form, and that the center of the earth is her glowing heart that warms all things.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>The worship of Danu often surrounds harvests, birthdays, marriages, and family gatherings. Shrines to Danu are often found in places with flourishing edible plant life, such as fruits, grains, corn, nuts, and legumes. Other shrines boast impressive gardens filled with all manner of fragrant flowers to attract the butterflies sacred to Danu. Even hardworking farmers who follow the Sacred Flame might have a small token or keepsake of Danu as a good luck charm.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>At the changing of the season, worshipers of Danu conduct a seance in the fields of their community. They bring flowers which represent the season and pray for prosperity. Often communities will gather on the edge of their farms and gardens, and hold the changing of seasons as a collective event. It is common for midwives to recite poems and chants to Danu during childbirth.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Dian Cheht the Healer</h2>\n<p>Dian Cheht is usually depicted as a serpent-headed figure. Other appearances depict more human elements with only an ophidian nose and eyes. A few show a full snake-like head upon a human body. Some simply represent the god as a serpent formed in a circle eating its own tail which represents the endless cycle of life and death.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>A few notable apothecaries on the continent pay tribute to Dian Cheht for guidance in their practices. Dian Cheht's druids often practice healing magic, and have been well known to help those in need. A druid of Dian Cheht is easily identifiable; more often than not they keep snakes as pets, often coiled around them everywhere they go.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>Rituals invoking Dian Cheht often involve invocations performed when healing another. However, the rituals of Dian Cheht are no mere superstitions, but rather sound practices couched in mysticism.</p>\n<p>The ritual most commonly associated with Dian Cheht occurs when a family member or close friend has fallen ill. Loved ones of the sick or wounded fast for two days, then drink an ounce of snake blood to tap into the wisdom of the Old God.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Gaibhne the Smith</h2>\n<p>Many dwarven legends claim the dwarves were fashioned in the forge of the deep earth by Gaibhne in the primordial days of the earth itself. Aided by the dwarves and giants he meticulously crafted, Gaibhne is also the mason who laid the very foundations of the earth itself. His followers say it was a wedding gift to Danu, so she might pour her heart into it and fill it with life. Myths surrounding the two gods often position them as mother and father to all life.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Effigies to Gaibhne hang in many blacksmiths' workshops. Even ones who do not worship the Old Gods often have a motif of a beaver or gopher somewhere in their shops. Many smiths believe it is good luck to keep these animals in your view when you are smithing. More devout worshipers have been known to keep beaver tails or gopher pelts on their belts while they work.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>Dwarves have often paid tribute to Gaibhne whenever they enter a mine to offer them safe passage and a prosperous haul. They will sprinkle crushed iron dust on themselves and burn the tip of their left ring finger, showing their devotion to the forge and flame. You can always tell a dwarven worshiper of Gaibhne by the blackened finger on their left hand.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Kromac the Ravager</h2>\n<p>Kromac is the Beastfather and Ravager. He brought monsters into the world; lycanthropes are his chosen children. He is fierce enemies with Arwyn, as he wishes to take the moon for himself. He is depicted as a giant wolf or sometimes a hybrid wolf-man. In art he is usually depicted bathed in blood, lighted by a silvery full moon. It is believed that each full moon is an offering from the cosmos to Kromac, who slowly devours the moon bite by bite until a new one is formed.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Those who worship Kromac often adorn themselves with animal furs and paint blood on their face whenever heading into battle or setting off on a dangerous task. The animal blood and hides bring them closer to their god. The more animalistic one can be, the closer they are to Kromac.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>Many worshipers hold a seance on the eve of a brutal battle. Warriors who worship the Beastfather often howl at moons or sit around fires growling and imitating beasts while druids splash them with boar or bear blood. The warriors drink blood from the head of the beast or from the skulls of rivals they have slain.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lugh the Sun</h2>\n<p>The light of the world stems from Lugh. Embodied as the sun itself, Lugh and Danu are the sustainers of all life. Some organizations of the old pantheon place Lugh as the head of the gods. He is depicted as either simply the sun itself, or sometimes an otherworldly being of light with six feathered wings and one hundred eyes.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Lugh's faithful often keep shrines atop open hilltops where the sun can easily shine down upon it. Many keep stringed together eagle feathers in their homes and keep symbols of a blazing red sun upon their mantles.</p>\n<p>Worship of Lugh is considered especially blasphemous amongst the Faith of the Sacred Flame, who view the Old God as a perverse personification of light and fire.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>Every year on the longest day, worshipers will dance around their shrines and drink honeyed mead and eat fresh fruits in a joyous celebration of the sun and all it offers. Often, they infuse their drinks with herbs and wild mushrooms and strip themselves of all clothes and belongings and bask in the sun to be one with Lugh.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\"><p>“Magic is similar to worship and rituals in a lot of ways, only ours actually has specific purposes and outcomes, this is all just hearsay and random acts for no reason at all.”</p></blockquote>\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/001-pg-25-12-gods-symbols-cmyk.webp\" class=\"text-center\" />\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Morrigan the Witch</h2>\n<p>Morrigan pulls the strands of fate and measures the length of each mortal life. She is the Crone-Goddess and the Mother-Witch. Sister to Danu, Morrigan wove magic into the fabric of the world itself. She is depicted as a woman with a mane of feathers, raven-like wings sprouting from her back, and her hands are formed into clawed talons. She is often accompanied by ravens. Alternatively, Morrigan is occasionally portrayed as a half-woman, half-spider with many red eyes upon her head and long spindly limbs. The Mother-Witch is sometimes conflated with various demonic and shadowy entities.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Those who worship Morrigan often do so in hopes of prolonging their life, learning occult secrets, and appeasing her desires in exchange for her blessing. Worshipers are superstitious about killing spiders, and instead will welcome the presence of a spider in their home as a protector and guardian. They tend to keep ravens and will wear raven feathers in their hair or on their caps.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>When someone is fearful they have reached the end of their life, or that fate is playing a cruel hand for them, they often cut their palms and spill their blood into a boiling pot filled with raven feathers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Nodens the Tempest</h2>\n<p>Nodens claims all water as his domain. His worshipers insist that it is by his doing that all life came to be, and that Danu is his rightful bride. Nodens controls the seas and weather, and is often depicted as an ancient tentacle-bearded king wearing an eyepatch. He carries a spear or trident and rides upon a fearsome and foul-tempered giant seahorse. Two great gulls perch on his shoulders, one whispering the knowledge of the deep, the other the fate of every sailor.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/031-pg26-shells-for-tempest-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/031-pg26-shells-for-tempest-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Sailors still utter prayers to Nodens lest he send storms to take their ships during their voyages. Sea captains, pirates, sailors, and fishermen often wear a shark's tooth around their neck whenever they set out to sea. They believe the tooth disguises them as a sea-dwelling creature and helps them avoid Nodens' wrath.</p>\n<p>More devout worshipers believe it must be the tooth of a shark you yourself have caught and slain, otherwise Nodens will see through your disguise and sink your ship into the sea. These seafaring folk commonly tattoo krakens or tentacles upon their body in honor of Nodens. Their homes often have seashells or dried starfish as decorations.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>The night before a sailor sets out to the sea, they bathe naked in the waters they plan to sail, allowing the ocean to gain their scent and know them. The sailor will adorn their bedchamber with seashells and other aquatic treasures. Dinner is a small cup of water from the sea and fresh fish, often raw.</p>\n<p>When they arrive safely after a voyage, the sailor must soak their clothes in vinegar for a day to rid it of the sea, and not take any of Nodens' domain with them onto land.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Nuada the Silver-Handed</h2>\n<p>Nuada is a valiant warrior-goddess. She is depicted as a golden-haired figure with large, feathered wings wearing shimmering silver armor. She brandishes a flashing blue blade, and carries a feather-emblazoned shield. She rides a pegasus and leads a host of valkyries into battle against giants, demons, and trolls. Her followers identify angels as members of her warhost.</p>\n<p>Scholars have pointed out the striking similarities between Nuada and Saint Tarna. Indeed, there are heretical claims which suggest Saint Tarna is an entirely mythological figure inspired by tales of Nuada, or even propose the blasphemous idea that the entire Faith of the Sacred Flame is a greatly distorted cult of Nuada.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Many paladins and warriors devoted to the Old Gods worship Nuada and strive to be courageous and ruthless like her. Knights devoted to Nuada often incorporate a pegasus into their heraldry. Often these warriors have a horse or war hound they keep as a pet; the companion is treated as a sacred blessing. Sometimes worshipers have been known to feed their hounds better than they themselves eat, as each of these creatures represents a part of Nuada, and to treat these animals with respect ensures your survival in your battles.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>When one of Nuada's faithful dies in battle, they are placed in a boat with pegasus wings painted on the sides. Their horse or hound, if they survived their companion, is humanely slain in a somber ceremony and placed in the boat alongside them, and their blood used to cover the body of the deceased. They are then sent out towards the setting sun, which is a gate to the Shadowlands. It is believed that there Nuada appears and carries her warrior and their trusted animal into the next life.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Ogham the Sage</h2>\n<p>Some speculate the first warlock pacts were made to Ogham, who granted them otherworldly powers of the cosmos. As the keeper of all secrets and god of knowledge, Ogham is depicted as a wizened man with a third eye on his forehead and an endless beard, woven with clay braids counting every event that has ever occurred. Alternatively, he is thought to be a floating eye soaring through space with swirling motes of energy surrounding his alien form, observing all of existence, time, and space at once. Ogham is also sometimes depicted as a hybrid human-owl creature carrying a stack of stone tablets said to contain the ultimate truth of all things.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Ogham's followers believe owls to be good omens; to hear an owl at night is a sign of good luck in the day ahead. Foxes are also a sign of good fortune. It is said that if you ever find a fox in the wild you must follow it, as they are the guides of destiny and knowledge, and where they go is the correct path of your destiny.</p>\n<p>Amongst the mages of the Amethyst Academy, there are a handful who are faithful to Ogham. Wizards devoted to Ogham will often keep owl familiars.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>The most important sacrifice a worshiper of Ogham can make is to put out one of their own eyes. Every priest and druid of Ogham performs this rite, and it is customary for elders to eventually blind themselves so they may see the spiritual world of knowledge more fully.</p>\n<p>Ogham's most zealous followers despise books, viewing them as impermanent and soft repositories of knowledge — they are inappropriate vessels for writing. Instead, they etch records on stone tablets, and raise great stone monoliths to record their learning and legends.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Phantasia the Dreamer</h2>\n<p>Phantasia dreams of all the things that never were. It is said that she knows the desires of every mortal. Rather than knowing all that has happened, Phantasia knows all that could have been, but was not. Phantasia sees all the possibilities laid before each person like an eternal web of choices and consequences.</p>\n<p>She sends dreams to sleepers to fulfill their needs, spur their creativity, or teach them lessons and guide them, but she also sends nightmares to taunt and torment those who have been led astray. She is the ultimate muse, inspiring painters, poets, and musicians to create masterpieces, and bringing invention and innovation to mages, smiths, and apothecaries. It is believed that all major innovations are because of her will and design.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<p>Dreamcatchers are often placed in the windows of worshipers of Phantasia to help draw in good dreams and protect sleepers from nightmares. Sprigs of lavender are placed on windowsills, as the scent is believed to aid the sleeper's spirit in transcending to Dreamland, and also ensures their soul is not lost there during the night. Cats are often kept as pets by worshipers of Phantasia, and worshipers must allow them to sleep upon the bed to ward off nightmares and evil spirits.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>If a worshiper is suffering from nightmares, they must capture a firefly in a jar and place it next to their bed, chew on lavender root, and place the chewed root under their pillow as they sleep. This will ensure the nightmares are warded off by the firefly and absorbed into the root instead. In the morning, after bad dreams have gone, the root is to be planted in the forest or a garden where the bad dreams become new lavender plants.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Shegorach the Trickster</h2>\n<p>Shegorach's worshipers claim that he created life as the greatest joke of all, so that he could be endlessly entertained by mortal suffering and struggles. He is also a god of luck, revelry, and wine. Depictions of this god change depending on where you go and whom you talk to. Some have represented him as a large fat beast with rat-like features, others have depicted him as a grim jester laughing, or a masked entity with many limbs. Shegorach is often equated with He Who Laughs Last, a demonic figure.</p>\n<h3>Worship</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/025-pg27-strange-mask-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/025-pg27-strange-mask-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>People who worship Shegorach see signs and omens in the presence of raccoons or rabbits. Whenever one of these creatures crosses the path of a worshiper, they believe Shegorach has brought them good luck. However, having rats in your home is a sign that Shegorach is upset with your deeds and you must appease him by placing coins, some fresh bones, or delectable treats on an altar outside your door.</p>\n<h3>Ritual</h3>\n<p>A common practice among the Trickster's worshipers is to adorn themselves with strange masks on the eve of autumn's harvest. Some devout have even been known to try to trick others by releasing rats into their homes, and then stealing the coins or food placed out to appease the god.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\"><p>“Okay, you got me. Phantasia seems interesting. But just because I have a firefly in a jar next to my bed, you shouldn't read too much into it.”</p></blockquote>"

class=\"dropcap\">紫晶学院是大陆上唯一致力于奥术魔法的研究机构和教育组织，也是全世界最重要的机构。尽管其公开目的是教导年轻的术士和法师魔法，但学院远不止是一个隐秘的巫术和魔法寄宿学校。紫晶学院运营着一个充满活力的法师公会，控制着魔法商品的制造，通过尖端实验开发新的魔法实践，并策划一个有影响力的奥术联盟。这个独家联盟为大陆的贵族提供魔法咨询。</p>\n<p>紫晶学院的每个成员都是奥术施法者。被普通人视为不可接近，这些巫师们却极具影响力和财富。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">隐秘起源</h2>\n<p>紫晶学院大约在 5 年初期，最初作为一个秘密网络成立，旨在寻找和保护那些拥有魔法天赋的儿童，以免他们受到神圣之火支持者的迫害。魔法师们运用预言魔法发现这些天赋异禀的孩子，将他们从充满恐惧和偏见的家园中救出，并在隐秘的堡垒与遥远的城堡里对他们进行培训，使他们能够练习并精确控制自己的魔法力量。</p>\n<p>随着时间的推移，这所学校逐渐演变成一个独立的秘密结社。为了躲避捕杀巫师的白银骑士团，法师们隐匿于一个无人能见的学府之中，分享彼此的智慧。他们深入研究奥术知识和宇宙奥秘，从而发展出现代巫术的实践方法。紫晶学院的众多创始人之一是前巫王的追随者的后代，他们继承了曾经仅限于强权统治者所独享的丰富魔法知识。这些巫王们是魔法界的先驱，他们限制魔法研究的原因是担心其他人的反抗，宁愿将力量只在自己的血脉之中传承。而现在，这些知识得以在紫晶学院中得到进一步的发展与研究。学院的其他创始成员还包括精灵，他们带来了自己古老且至今未被人类所知的魔法艺术。因此，紫晶学院成为了奥术法术实践的摇篮。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">法令约束</h2>\n<p>在秘密运作了数年后，紫晶学院在签署了炉明法令后正式获得了认可。炉明法令赋予紫晶学院广泛的保护、完全的自治权和经济优势，但也要求学院遵守严格的商业中立和政治不干涉标准。</p>\n<p>自从有了这些法令，学院的魔法师们可以在不受教会或国家压迫的情况下施展魔法，尽管该组织仍然保持着隐蔽，越来越多地将注意力转向大陆事务和超自然事件。尽管紫晶学院公开遵守炉明法令，但近年来一些人声称魔法师们暗中绕过了限制，无视禁止黑暗魔法实践的条款。其他人怀疑这些法师们正在编织一个奥术阴谋，控制商业并影响政治，同时避开神圣之火的愤怒。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">魔法教育</h2>\n<p>当紫晶学院确认一名孩子拥有魔法血脉时，他们便会派遣身穿紫色长袍的使者，在孩子约六岁时将其带走。这些孩子，无论出身于皇室还是平民家庭，均成为学院的学生及受护者。学院通常会向其家庭提供一笔财礼或补助作为补偿。对于普通出身的孩子而言，获得加入紫晶学院的邀请，意味着他们将从平淡无奇的乡村生活中脱颖而出，进入一个充满魔法、财富与声望的全新世界。这些年幼的术士和法师在学院宿舍中成长，接受魔法训练，并在成年后加入法师公会。他们接受的教育独一无二，覆盖艺术、历史、数学、语言、科学和哲学等多个领域。</p>\n<p>直至十岁，学生们将经历心理与身体的双重训练，以帮助他们控制并集中魔法力量。一旦他们驯服了与生俱来的狂野魔法，便开始深入学习法术。这些年轻魔法师在为期十年的课程中，需达到严格的标准，接受严格导师的指导。</p>\n<p>虽然有些学生在学业结束后会离开，追寻个人兴趣，但更多人会在紫晶学院的层级体系中找到自己的位置。那些能够在这个错综复杂且竞争激烈的组织中找到立足之地的人，将享受被魔法奇迹环绕的奢华生活。</p>\n<p>尽管他们可能对一位在偏远落后地区教授侄子几个简单咒语的乡间老魔法师视而不见，紫晶学院仍全力以赴地控制魔法教育。学院热切地收藏着大量的法术书，并将神秘的魔法知识封存于仅对成员开放的秘密图书馆中。学院领导层认为，一旦有机会，其他人会以鲁莽和不负责任的方式使用魔法。虽然他们的核心使命——培养年轻魔法师——确保了新一代施法者能够发展技能，但同时也使学生们倾向于遵循学院的意识形态原则。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">奥术经营</h2>\n<p>富有的贵族和关系网广泛的军阀委托魔法师为他们的士兵制作魔法武器，并为他们的领地设置奥术结界。此外，紫晶学院还提供有关魔法事务的咨询。根据习俗和条约，紫晶学院会指派一位大师级法师作为宫廷魔法师，服务于统治的君主和高级封臣。宫廷魔法师利用他们的魔法协助贵族，同时也作为学院利益的情报员和说客。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">秘密行动</h2>\n<p>紫晶学院以极端的秘密性进行业务，特别是在与外人打交道时。他们经常通过魔法传递的信息（使用@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD]{短讯术}）或安排秘密会面（通常使用@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ePhRKHXRE7l1sEoQ]{投影术}）。一个秘密的@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{传送阵}网络连接着他们偏远的要塞，每一个都受到强大的奥术结界的保护。这种广泛使用的魔法传送和通讯使得紫晶学院的操作范围远远超过任何其他组织，尽管魔法师的数量相对较少。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">妄质的发现</h2>\n<p>紫晶学院的法师们是首批发现妄质巨大魔法潜能的人。他们持续的研究旨在全面记录妄质的超自然特性和未知危险，并进一步开发利用这些水晶制造魔法武器和奥术机械的方法。他们采购大量妄质以供其深奥实验和奇异工业之用。学院通常通过各种灰色市场来源获取妄质，而不是冒险让自己的成员在德拉肯海姆的废墟中冒生命危险。魔法师们雇佣雇佣兵执行特定的回收操作，并且只在罕见的情况下派遣自己的小型勘查队前往德拉肯海姆。</p>\n<p>妄质贸易之所以如此广泛，主要是因为这些水晶对学院来说极其宝贵，使得妄质水晶成为了一种实际上的货币。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">隐秘学校</h2>\n<p>紫晶学院并非仅限于某一地点。学院自称运营着八所魔法学校，每所学校均是一座独立的要塞。其中一些地点广为人知，它们的详细介绍可在大陆地理志的相应章节中找到。</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>东部山谷的悖论城堡</li>\n    <li>利比里奥的谜境金字塔</li>\n    <li>栖云岛的星极观测站</li>\n    <li>维斯特玛现已失落的德拉肯海姆莫测之塔</li>\n</ul>\n<p>每处地点都配备了受严密保护的@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{传送阵}，但它们仅为能施放 5 环法术的学院魔法师所知。</p>\n<p>其他要塞的位置则是被严格保密的。有传闻称，其中一个隐藏在北极附近的冰山之下，另一个则位于中海底部，被一个巨大的玻璃穹顶所覆盖。还有一个建在月球上。最后一个据说是一个无固定位置的移动堡垒。关于其本质的描述各异：有的说它是建造在一只巨大飞行鲸背上的魔法村庄，而其他说法则是它是一个被迷雾笼罩、行走在巨大鸟类腿上的庄园。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">学院等级制度</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/022-pg29-delerium-artefact-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Delerium Scepter\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/022-pg29-delerium-artefact-cmyk.webp')\">\n<p>大多数学院的魔法师都是法师。然而，吟游诗人、术士和邪术师经常出现在他们之中。成员们穿着带有金银细节的紫色长袍。许多人携带各种奥术工具：法杖、魔杖和法师书。他们在显眼的地方佩戴学院的象征。</p>\n<p><strong>学院戒指。</strong>紫晶学院的每位成员都佩戴着一套由奇异奥术金属制成的戒指。佩戴的戒指数量对应于他们能施放的最高等级法术。这些被称为学院戒指的魔法物品，用以标识一位施法者为学院的毕业生，并常常允许进入学院的要塞。五枚或更多的戒指套装作为储存法术的@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.9cIlRtKDtDXQtElf]{戒指}使用。每增加一枚戒指，就可以额外储存一个环级的法术，有些戒指套装还允许控制一个@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.z85EsGS2GVWj46qE]{构装盾卫}。然而，每套戒指都是为特定的个体制作的，只有那个人才能与这套戒指同调。</p>\n<h3>抚养者</h3>\n<p>被学院收养但尚未开始学徒生涯的孩子们。</p>\n<h3>学徒</h3>\n<p>学徒是正在学习 1 环和 2 环奥术法术的受训魔法师。一旦他们掌握了 2 环法术，便开始他们的“行者年”，在这一年里，他们作为一名大师级魔法师的助手工作。完成后，学徒们毕业并被邀请成为紫晶学院的正式成员。典型的学徒期需要八到十年。</p>\n<h3>工会魔法师</h3>\n<p>这些是学院的普通魔法师，能够施放至少 3 环法术，尽管一些新成员只能施放 2 环法术。大多数工会魔法师在紫晶学院担任研究员和工匠。很少有学院成员能够达到工会魔法师以上的等级。</p>\n<h3>大师级魔法师</h3>\n<p>当学院成员展现出施放 5 环法术的能力时，他们就会被授予大师级魔法师的称号。虽然一些真正杰出的个体可以在年轻时就达到这一等级，但对大多数人来说，达到这一点代表了一生的成就和专注的学习。因此，大师级魔法师负责指导学徒、领导奥术研究和制造项目，以及作为紫晶学院的使者。</p>\n<h3>宗师</h3>\n<p>这些是能够施放 9 环法术的强大术士、邪术师和法师。他们领导紫晶学院最重要的项目，并且能够接触到学院提供的几乎所有法术和资源。在整个世界上，宗师只有少数：除了学院理事会的八名成员外，现存的宗师不超过二十人。</p>\n<p>在理事会出现空缺的罕见情况下，大师级法师们可以提名三位宗师供剩余的理事会考虑。由于理事会必须一致选择三名提名者中的一位加入他们，空缺的位置可能需要数十年才能填补。</p>\n<p>在著名的宗师法师中，有埃德瑞克·符文织者。作为现存最杰出的防护系法师，埃德瑞克·符文织者（人类@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]{大法师}）是目前被提名为理事会候选人的三名提名者之一。他目前与他最优秀的学生川流（提夫林@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]{法师}）一起，领导着学院对德拉肯海姆废墟的探险，希望他在那里的成功能够确保他在学院领导层中的位置。</p>\n<h3>理事会</h3>\n<p>理事会由八位异常强大的大法师组成。他们隐居于自己设计的秘密要塞中，这些极度隐秘的人物很少介入学院的日常事务。许多学院的魔法师都不知道他们的名字，只有少数高层成员曾亲自见过他们。</p>\n<p>理事会成员之间甚至很少在物理层面上相遇。有传言说，每当他们需要作为一个整体会面时，他们会通过投影术 project image 在月球上的一处石圈集合。在其他所有时间，他们通过@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD]{短讯术 }，@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.kSPRpeIx3w3nihrF]{托梦术}，以及@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uAwtVZkiSTyP6ORB]{拉瑞心灵联结}沟通。</p>\n<p>理事会成员包括：</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>阿德里安娜·莫德拉，德拉肯海姆的大法师（在该城市被毁后，被认为失踪或死亡，她的位置在过去 15 年中一直未被填补。)</li>\n    <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.C7yUf1r825NkN7TO]{白玉}，利比里奥的大法师</li>\n    <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.yH95IKEHmI023u7g]{“紫外之曜”安玛兰希斯}，月亮上的大法师</li>\n    <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.z2dBmn3c6S9Sg11X]{拉塞亚·夜风}，东部山谷的大法师</li>\n    <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.rJ05Zzvm3G17rQjX]{金盏花·湖生}，卡斯匹亚的大法师</li>\n    <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ggBl9pLVIGPL49rz]{半影}，泰瑞尼的大法师</li>\n    <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.edFqywMzmWglHpE1]{“上古”谢尔·沃卡}，伊利瑞亚的大法师</li>\n    <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ZUhQYvVymk4PgNu6]{星天·尽览}，栖云的大法师</li>\n</ul>\n<p>大多数紫晶学院的成员相信，如果有的话，学院理事会中很少有人是人类，甚至是凡人，因为几位理事自数百年前紫晶学院成立以来就一直担任着他们的职位，包括谢尔·沃卡、星天和安玛兰希斯。然而，这些理事是如何延长他们的寿命的，成了魔法师们之间广泛的猜测和传言的主题，从反复使用@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.h830iyqParFleNqR]{克隆术}、恶魔契约，到亵渎的不死变形。的确，这些说法可能有一定的真实性。理事会的个别成员在大陆地理志中有所描述。</p>\n<p>这些大法师既是同事也是激烈的竞争对手。理事会中没有单一的领导者。相反，他们的拜占庭式规则赋予每位大法师对整个紫晶学院的全部执行权力，但也能否决任何其他理事会成员的决议。实际上，这意味着理事会在大多数重大决策上必须达成一致意见。想象一下，你站在一个房间里，周围有其他七位法师：你可以施展任何你想要的法术，但任何其他人都可能反制你的法术，而第三个人则用破坏性的法术回应，以消灭你们俩。同时，第四个人用他们自己的防护法术插手，等等。</p>\n<p>理事会在达成共识的过程中通常显得异常缓慢。与此同时，各位成员利用自己可调动的个人权力和资源，努力增强对其他大法师的个人影响力及魔法实力。这些大法师之间的相互阴谋和策划，远超过他们对任何外人的算计。每一位都深知，若他们中的任一人能够掌控紫晶学院，便将获得类似巫王所拥有的强大力量。</p>\n<h3>宫廷魔法师</h3>\n<p>统治大陆的强大贵族家族得到紫晶学院指派的宫廷魔法师的服务。根据炉明法令的条款，每位拥有伯爵或更高级别的贵族都有权享受一位常驻宫廷魔法师的服务，而那些能够支付他们薪酬的较低级别贵族也可以雇佣宫廷魔法师。</p>\n<p>在众多贵族家庭中，拥有魔法血脉的孩子常被视为极大的幸运。虽然这些孩子无法继承家族的地位与头衔，但从地位最低的男爵到最具影响力的公爵夫人，无一例外，他们都会毫不犹豫地将他们的魔法血脉后代送往紫晶学院接受奥术教育。当这些年轻魔法师完成他们的训练后，大部分人将担任自家宫廷魔法师的职位。这样，紫晶学院与贵族之间建立了紧密的联系。贵族家庭得到了一位忠诚的施法者，作为奥术顾问和密友，而紫晶学院则与贵族的政治势力紧密相连。通过这种方式，魔法血脉者既能享受贵族的奢侈生活，又拥有施展魔法的自由，许多这样的魔法血脉者通过冒险活动帮助推进他们亲属的目标。</p>\n<p>然而，这种做法遭到了神圣之火的批评，他们声称这种家族联系让紫晶学院能够通过血缘关系对贵族施加不当影响。他们怀疑紫晶学院已经非常擅长把自己定位为贵族子女的精英毕业学校。怀疑的圣火守护者表示，大多数宫廷魔法师回到家族后，已经被深度灌输了学院的教义，愿意利用自己的魔法影响他们的父母、兄弟姐妹和堂兄弟妹，以推动学院的政治议程。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">学院之外的魔法师</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/112-pg31-malfeasant-mage-deidrick-mors-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Malfeasant wizard Deidrick Mors\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/112-pg31-malfeasant-mage-deidrick-mors-cmyk.webp')\">\n<p>尽管紫袍法师们希望情况并非如此，但在学院的等级制度之外，存在着几个魔法师团体。</p>\n<h3>野生魔法师</h3>\n<p>这个术语用来描述那些在学院机构之外发展自己施法能力的奥术施法者。然而，这样的个体极为罕见。他们通常是邪术师或术士，因为除了紫晶学院之外，很少有人拥有传授法师知识和资源。</p>\n<h3>叛道魔法师</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.N3EN4LBizqZknF1e]{叛道}魔法师是指那些使用法术犯下罪行（如谋杀或抢劫）、执行亵渎法术（如炉明法令中的咒术条款所定义的）或背叛紫晶学院的施法者（如泄露其秘密、窃取魔法物品或密谋背叛理事会）。他们被学院驱逐，并在任何受炉明法令约束的国家中被判处死刑。学院通常只派遣自己的代理人去处理可能持有学院财产或宝贵研究的叛道法师；大多数被白银骑士团或雇佣兵追捕。从历史上看，捕获逃亡的叛道魔法师是学院和白银骑士团合作的少数几个例子之一。</p>"

大陆国家通用的语言，包括卡斯匹亚、伊利瑞亚和维斯特玛。这种语言是旧语言演变为区域方言的结果，但大陆上的大多数人不论在哪里出生，都可以很好地交流。</p>\n<p><strong>古米底语：</strong> 在巫王统治时期使用的古老语言。今天很少有人说这种语言，但在古老的文献和记录中经常可以找到。</p>\n<p><strong>北地语：</strong> 在冥风冻原北部地区常见的语言，经常被矮人、巨人和山民使用。</p>\n<p><strong>古精灵语：</strong> 古精灵使用的语言。</p>\n<p><strong>精类语：</strong> 侏儒、地精和精类生物使用的语言。</p>\n<p><strong>龙语：</strong> 这是龙族流传的一种古老语言。尽管它偶尔出现在奥术文献之中，但真龙们发现凡人试图发音此语言时显得笨拙且令人不悦。凡人需谨慎：企图用龙语恭维真龙远非明智之举，这些威严的生物已知会对那些试图在其面前使用龙语的非龙族生物施以致命的惩罚。</p>\n<p>天界、元素和邪魔有各自的语言，但大陆人民除了在最神秘的情境下外，通常不使用这些语言。智者、学者和侍僧偶尔会在奥术或宗教文献中使用这些语言，但这些语言的魔法属性使得凡人难以正确地表达它们。</p>\n<p>来自异界的生物以一种凡人难以理解的方式进行交流，他们的信息只能通过令人陷入疯狂的低语、生动的幻觉以及其他令人不适的感知方式被捕捉。尽管这些生物拥有自己令人不安的语言和文字，但在没有魔法的辅助下，世间任何凡人都无法理解或发出这些神秘语言。</p>\n<h2

这个节日在每年的第一周和最后一周庆祝，导致了为期两周的仪式、宗教集会和圣祭，以纪念圣塔尔纳的殉道。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">星辰和季节</h2>\n<p>整个大陆的季节与地球北半球的季节相匹配，尽管在大陆的最南端，气候变得更趋向于热带。</p>\n<p>大陆上的居民明白，他们居住在一个绕着炽烈太阳旋转的球体上，并且他们的世界被几颗行星伴随。夜空中悬挂着一轮蓝白相间的孤月，它每个月都会经历从满月到新月的不同变化阶段。传说中，紫晶学院的一些伟大法师曾一度或两度探访这些神秘之地，但他们所发现的，仅成为了荒诞故事和猜想的焦点，真相寥寥无几。</p>\n<p>暴虐的巫王在古代以自己的名字命名了许多行星和星星，并在星座中看到了自己的事迹。在此后的岁月中，当地传统为一些星星赋予了新的名称。也许最著名的天体是塔尔娜彗星，每433年在夜空中出现一道金色光迹。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">贸易和货币</h2>\n<p>如果有一样东西在大陆国家之间流动得比血还要频繁，那就是黄金。在整个大陆的城市和城镇，各种产业和经济生产领域都形成了伟大的行会，从面包师、铁匠和皮匠到裁缝、皮革工和车匠。</p>\n<p>商人们通过陆上商队和海上帆船交换各种香料、丝绸和奢侈品。大陆国家铸造自己的金、银、铜币。贸易在整个大陆茂盛，尤其是通过中海周围的水路。大陆地理志记录了各个地区之间流动的主要进口和出口物品。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">教育</h2>\n<p>民众通常自行教育孩子，有时还会组织非正式的社区学习小组。在成长的过程中，孩子们往往会学习到父母的行当和技能——对于大多数农村社区的居民而言，这意味着农业。而在那些设有行会和贸易协会的城市地区，孩子们大约在十岁时有机会成为学徒，此后他们的教育将完全聚焦于掌握具体的手艺。</p>\n<p>贵族家庭则会为孩子聘请私人家教。例如，伊利瑞亚的领主们经常邀请圣火守护者来教授他们的孩子历史和宗教知识。维斯特玛的公爵及其夫人则会请他们的宫廷魔法师安排地理、哲学、科学、数学和语言等课程，而军械大师负责传授战争艺术。卡斯匹亚的王子们则以支付高昂费用，让他们的继承人接受著名冒险家的培训而著称。</p>\n<p>尽管存在一些提供高等教育的世俗机构，如维斯特玛的古桥大学和卡斯匹亚的莱托学院，但大部分高等教育机会还是集中在神圣之火教堂和紫晶学院的奥术学府之中。</p>\n<aside

<p>在德拉肯海姆的世界中，高级NPC和施法者异常罕见。大多数人是隐居的隐士或秘密社团和隐居神职团体的成员。然而，其他人在教堂、圣职人员、法师工会和宫廷中担任重要职位。尽管他们数量稀少，这些人仍然对社会产生深远影响。</p>\n            <p>寻找盟友施法者的玩家角色在大多数大城镇中很容易找到能施放3环或4环法术的人。通常是在照料神圣之火教堂圣火守护者，或者是紫晶学院的法师在当地执行任务。</p>\n            <p>与能施放5环或6环法术的人建立联系只有在最大的城市才可能。这些个体通常是领导神圣之火大教堂的高阶圣火守护者。紫晶学院还任命法师和术士担任强大的公爵、公爵夫人和小贵族的宫廷魔法师。</p>\n            <p>能施放7环或8级环术的非玩家角色只在世界中扮演重要角色时遇到，忙于重大事件和具有戏剧性意义的任务。这样的NPC可能只能通过声望良好的玩家角色付出相当努力才能寻找到。</p>\n

class=\"standard-h2\">犯罪与惩罚</h2>\n<p>在德拉肯海姆的大陆上，法律似乎更偏向于保护那些强大和富有的人，而非确保公正和平等。普通人如果被指控犯罪，他们可以预料到的是快速而不公的审判，几乎没有机会为自己辩护；而只有权势和财富的拥有者才能享受到刑事审判的特权。实际上，许多法律专家的时间都花在处理民事或商业纠纷上，比如合同争议、土地争端和财产问题，而不是真正的犯罪行为。</p>\n<p>城市的警卫和民兵的主要职责是维持秩序，而不是调查犯罪。当有危险的逃犯在逃、强盗在道路上活动、黑暗巫师施法，或者有怪物威胁社区时，当地的官员通常会依赖赏金猎人、冒险者或骑士团来处理。</p>\n<p>对于犯了罪的普通人，常见的惩罚包括被打、鞭打和戴上颈手枷。小偷或骗子可能会被切手或割舌，而杀人犯或更严重的罪犯则会被处死。监狱主要用来关押等待审判或执行的囚犯，或作为关押政治犯的地方。尽管许多城堡都有牢房和地牢，但是并没有专门为了大规模关押普通人而建造的监狱。</p>\n<p>贵族很少因为对普通人犯下的罪行而受到惩罚，最多可能是支付一点罚金或赔偿——即使是犯了杀人罪。如果贵族犯罪影响到了其他贵族，他们可能会面临审判，严重的罪行可能会导致失去地位或被流放，但很少会被处死。然而，通过贿赂和政治影响，许多人都能避免受到惩罚。</p>\n<h3>魔法与法律</h3>\n<img

<p><strong>伊利瑞亚决斗：</strong> 伊利瑞亚决斗是力量和战斗技巧的证明。每位参与者必须选择一种他们选择的近战武器。使用奥术法术和外界干预都是非法的。许多人指出，这种特定的决斗风格完全是为了迫使魔法师按照白银骑士团的条件来战斗。值得注意的是，虽然不允许使用奥术法术，但伊利瑞亚风格并未提及神术法术。</p>\n            <p><strong>卡斯匹亚决斗：</strong> 卡斯匹亚决斗是决斗风格中最不具侵略性的。虽然这似乎与他们的传统习俗相悖，但卡斯匹亚人非常喜欢决斗，以至于他们发展出了一种减少卡斯匹亚骑士死亡数量的方法，使他们的决斗成为一种比赛形式。最常见的选项是，双方参与者必须去猎杀怪物并带回头颅（或类似的战利品），或者双方参与者必须面对类似的怪物，如巨魔，看看哪位骑士更快地击败对手。前者通常是决斗家族之间的选择，并涉及整个狩猎队伍，而后者是当两位卡斯匹亚骑士试图证明谁是更有能力的战士时提出的选项。</p>\n

After a mysterious meteor devastated the capital city of Drakkenheim fifteen years ago, the nation descended into a decade of bloody civil war. The surviving siblings of King Ulrich IV fought bitterly for the throne, but the brutal matter cost both their lives. The Civil War ended with no real victor, and no clear inheritor to the royal titles of House von Kessel.</p>\n<p>Ravaged by conflict, the once-great nation is now fracturing into disparate smaller realms. Worse, the otherworldly contamination left behind by the falling star is slowly spreading into the surrounding lands, bringing madness and monsters to the unprepared towns and villages of Westemär. As curious mages and profit-seeking smugglers ferry delerium from the ruins of Drakkenheim to distant lands, grim veterans of the Civil War fight to retake the capital and rebuild the realm. Meanwhile, a grave religious schism has broken out amongst the common folk driven by the apocalyptic proclamations of Lucretia Mathias. No nation on the continent is in greater need for heroes, and now Westemär has become the stage upon which greater conflicts affecting the entire continent are taking shape.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Encompassing the northwestern quarter of the continent, Westemär is a rugged land of deep forests and slow, wide rivers broken up by small areas of rolling pasture and farmland. It has a moderate climate with snowy winters and warm summers, and it rains constantly in the spring and fall. The region is rich in natural resources: logging and lumber are the backbone of many villages and towns, but others lie along vast deposits of iron, copper, and coal which feed the industry of Westemär's cities. The Crystal Coast takes its name from the rich salt mines along its rocky northern shores, and fine quarries throughout Westemär built the nation's many castles and fortresses. Veins of gold and silver are found within the mountainous regions to the south, though the dwarven communities in the Glimmer Mountains have long asserted their independence and make claim to the richest veins.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Approximately 8 million people dwell in Westemär. Most of the population inhabit rural villages, and only about 600,000 people live in cities and large towns.</p>\n<p>Most people living in Westemär are humans who value hard work and pragmatism. Many simply want to put the turmoil of the last ten years behind them, and are exhausted from the conflicts gripping their lands. Young people either bitterly resent the prosperity their parents enjoyed during the unrestrictive rule of the late Ulrich IV, or fight furiously to restore a glorious kingdom they've only ever known through stories told to them by their grandparents. Tieflings form several noble houses and are commonly encountered in larger cities, and see opportunity in the hard times of the nation. There are several halfling communities in the eastern areas of Westemär who have suffered greatly from the civil war and eldritch contamination placing great strain upon their harvests. The dwarven holds of the Glimmer Mountains and Ironhelm Ridge traditionally consider themselves self-governing city states, but look to prospecting delerium in Drakkenheim as a new avenue for industry as their old mines run dry.</p>\n<p>Small enclaves of elves once inhabited the southwestern regions, but these communities were annihilated during the conquests of Vladimir von Drakken. Most of the surviving elves fled to the Isles of Skye; only a handful of elves remain in Westemär today.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>Drakkenheim was the capital of Westemär until it was destroyed fifteen years ago. Today, the nation has no true capital.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Government</h2>\n<p>Before the meteor struck, Westemär was a feudal monarchy in which rule typically passed to the firstborn child. The most recent ruler, Ulrich IV of House von Kessel, inherited a period of relative political stability. He was able to pursue leisurely interests in architecture, education, and carnal affairs instead of politics and warfare. He married a Caspian princess of House Jones, Lenore, and had three children: Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza. Ulrich IV was ten years into his reign when the meteor struck Drakkenheim. Nothing has been seen or heard of the royal couple or their children since.</p>\n<p>In Westemär, the ruling monarch holds the title of king or queen and rules for life. Dukes ruling each province swear oaths of fealty to their monarch, and in turn hold lesser lords as their vassals. Generations of nobles have formed a web of familial connections and political alliances, and so dynastic rule has shifted several times. The monarch would mediate the many inevitable grievances which emerged between dukedoms, and from time-to-time petty wars and skirmishes have broken out between two noble houses over land ownership or other disputes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, succession in Westemär has seldom been a clean matter as each monarch reinvents the rules. While traditionally they would pass the crown to their designated heir — most often their eldest living offspring, regardless of gender — more than half the time the crown has not passed directly from parent to child. Illegitimate children, remarriage, children from multiple marriages, sibling rivalry, and the interconnected relationships between other noble houses mean that following the death of a monarch, there are usually several potential claimants who emerge. A stark light was cast upon these long-simmering issues when the royal family was lost in Drakkenheim. Though the fate of his direct heirs is unknown, Ulrich IV was survived by his younger siblings Mannfred and Cecilia, neither of whom were in Drakkenheim on that fateful day. The two initially cooperated to determine their brother's fate and attempted retaking the city of Drakkenheim through military force. When these efforts failed, a feud broke out between the two over who should claim the throne. The Civil War would be the downfall of House von Kessel: neither Mannfred, Cecilia, nor their own children survived the conflict.</p>\n<p>Lacking any clear and credible claimant to support, the nobles who sided with the divided branches of House von Kessel eventually laid down their arms and returned to their domains to lick their wounds.</p>\n<p>Today, the realm is disintegrating, and the ruling nobles now largely operate their provinces as independent domains. They owe no fealty to any monarch. Most are simply trying to hold onto their own wealth and power, a far more feasible goal for the time being than trying to conquer their rivals or unite the nation again.</p>\n<h3>Noble Ranks</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>King or Queen.</em></strong> The monarch of Westemär.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Duke or Duchess.</em></strong> Vassals only to the monarch, each rule one of Westemär's provinces, and usually from one of the provincial capitals.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Count or Countess.</em></strong> A middle noble rank who holds a county as their domain.

Thus, most dukes are served by a court mage and appoint their own steward to manage their affairs.</p>\n<h3>Seals of Westemär</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/153-house-von-kesel-heraldry-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/153-house-von-kesel-heraldry-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Each of the members of the Royal Council bear one of the<em> Seals of Westemär</em> as their badge of office. These powerful magic items aid each official in running the affairs of state. While Lord Commander Elias Drexel still holds his badge, the remaining seals are lost in the ruins of Drakkenheim, alongside the<em> Crown of Westemär.</em></p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>It has been several centuries since the Faith of the Sacred Flame spread to all corners of Westemär. Every major city in the nation has a large and impressive cathedral devoted to the faith, tended by a high-ranking @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] and throng of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolytes} All throughout the countryside are monasteries for the clergy to live and worship, and smaller chapels are the heart of rural communities. Even the tiniest villages in Westemär keep small shrines and bonfire pits ministered by a devout member of the community.</p>\n<p>However, the folk of Westemär are more modest and moderate in their faith compared to their neighbors in Elyria. Still, many nobles seek council from Flamekeepers. Furthermore, Flamekeepers are highly influential amongst the common folk, acting as important community leaders and elders.</p>\n<p>Although most people in Westemär follow the Sacred Flame, amongst the three great nations of the continent, Westemär has the largest number of people who still keep the Old Faith. The laws and people of Westemär are mostly tolerant towards these ancient beliefs, and major shrines to the Old Gods are openly displayed outside several large cities, including one to Nodens near Drannsmund, another to Morrigan outside Drakkenheim, and several great cairns near Heilig.</p>\n<p>Recently, however, Westemär has become the hotbed for a budding religious schism in the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Renegade preachers and zealous faithful heed the teachings of Lucretia Mathias and the Followers of the Falling Fire. Many prominent High Flamekeepers in major cities in Westemär have turned their backs on the Divine Matriarch, urging their flocks to take up the cause of the Falling Fire.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Military</h2>\n<p>Westemär has a feudal military structure. During wartime, a noble lord calls upon their vassals to muster an army. These vassals respond by assembling a mixed force drawn from their household guard, knights sworn to their services, and levies drawn up from either volunteer or conscripted commonfolk who dwell in their domains.</p>\n<p>The Civil War saw the formation of numerous mercenary companies as the noble houses exhausted their own local armies. Though the war has ended, the dukes and duchesses of Westemär keep mercenary regiments such as the Steelfang Company and the Achtungwald Irregulars on retainer to bolster the security of their domains.</p>\n<p>The most well-known military outfit in Westemär, and the only thing resembling any sort of national armed force, is the 4th Provisional Regiment to Reclaim the Capital, also known as the Hooded Lanterns.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<p>The nobility of Westemär has a long and favorable association with the Amethyst Academy. Prior to the Edicts of Lumen, House von Drakken staunchly protected mages and mageborn. Many noble houses in Westemär have mageborn lineages, and so there was considerable resistance to the idea of disinheriting their scions when the Edicts were drawn up.</p>\n<p>Agents from the Amethyst Academy operate small compounds in Drannsmund, Altbruke, and Geldstadt; mage towers throughout the land serve as important outposts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trade</h2>\n<p>Thanks to its rich natural resources, Westemär is a hub for craftspeople and industry. Guilds devoted to every major skill and trade flourish in its cities. Merchants come to Westemär to purchase fine manufactured goods in exchange for Elyrian textiles and Caspian spices.</p>\n<p>Trade by land usually proceeds from Leuchten to Elyria, Caspia, and the Free City, or from Drakkenheim towards the Eastern Vale. Naval shipping flows from Drannsmund to the Isles of Skye and other distant ports in far continents.</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Exports</strong>: Salt, silver, iron, copper, coal, furs, manufactured goods, honey, mead, maple syrup.</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Imports</strong>: Silk, textiles, spices, wine.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History</h1>\n<p>Westemär takes its name from a bastardization of its former name. Under the sorcerer-kings, the land was referred to as the Western Marches, opposite the Eastern Vales. As the old tongue of the Arcane Empire faded and regional dialects took hold, the term degenerated into the name it is known by today.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Conquest of Vladimir von Drakken</h2>\n<p>After the fall of the sorcerer-kings' empire, the lands which eventually became Westemär became a collection of small domains and kingdoms. Indeed, the original borders between these old realms roughly correspond to the provinces which currently make up the nation. Each submitted or capitulated to Vladimir von Drakken, the founder of the nation, during his conquests in the 7th century.</p>\n<p>Vladimir von Drakken's violent campaign did not hesitate to put every advantage on the table. Ruler of an ancient noble house with roots stretching back to the sorcerer-kings, House von Drakken had a mageborn lineage mingled with draconic ancestry. Vladimir von Drakken himself was no mage, but was known as a ruthless, unrivaled swordsman. During his lifetime, rumors persisted that the man drank and bathed in the blood of his slain foes. Striking a bargain between several dragons and his own mageborn siblings, Vladimir von Drakken commanded a devastating combination of conventional military supported by arcane might and dragonfire.</p>\n<p>After three decades of warfare, Vladimir von Drakken's burgeoning kingdom was shaping up to become a despotic empire in its own right as he prepared invasions into Caspia and Elyria. That was until his own estranged daughter, Carmen von Drakken, returned from years of exile alongside a band of plucky adventurers. Carmen challenged her father's might and put an end to the nascent tyrant in a climactic battle above the spires of Castle Drakken.</p>\n<p>Taking up her father's crown, Carmen von Drakken appointed her adventuring companions to the highest offices and noble houses of the nation, thus cementing her own fifty-year rule. During this time, Carmen tended the growing pains of the young nation, and is remembered as a healer and uniter who tore down the merciless ways of her father. Though she rejected Vladimir's original dream of a new continent-spanning empire, Carmen laid her father to rest with the full honors as the founder of the nation, and few histories today record the full scope of the bloody atrocities Vladimir von Drakken committed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Dynastic Upheaval</h2>\n<p>Generations later, the legacy of Vladimir von Drakken was reignited when Carmen's great-great-grandson, Albrecht von Drakken, launched an invasion of Caspia. He used the power of the<em> Crown of Westemär</em> to bind dragons to his service like his ancestors did. However, he was unprepared to face the skillful Caspian dragonslayers, and Albrecht was beheaded on the battlefield. Having disposed of his own siblings in a bid for the throne, House von Drakken was left greatly weakened and shortly collapsed. This set off a series of succession crises in which rule passed rapidly between several short-lived dynasties. Multiple families and rulers seized the throne during this period, but only two houses from this tumultuous time held the throne for more than a decade and are recognized as legitimate rulers in the eyes of history. The others are regarded as pretenders.</p>\n<p>House von Kessel ultimately secured the throne through a combination of careful diplomacy, key military victories over their rival houses, and claiming a spurious connection to House von Drakken through a distant cousin of a cadet branch. The first monarch of this new dynasty was Helena I, who brought many progressive reforms into Westemär during her long rule and steered the nation through a devastating plague. House von Kessel ruled Westemär from the capital of Drakkenheim for 150 years, until that woeful eve when an eldritch star fell upon the city.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Destruction of Drakkenheim</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/126-pg44-cecilia-and-manfred-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Cecilia and Mannfred von Kessel\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/126-pg44-cecilia-and-manfred-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Fifteen years ago, an otherworldly meteor shower destroyed the capital city of Drakkenheim. King Ulrich IV, as well as his son and principal heir, were presumed killed in the disaster, leaving the nation without a ruler or clear successor.</p>\n<p>However, many members of the royal household were not in Drakkenheim when the meteor struck, including the king's younger siblings, Mannfred and Cecilia von Kessel. The two spent vast sums commissioning the clergy of the Sacred Flame and the mages of the Amethyst Academy to use divination magic to discern what happened, but to no avail. They nearly bankrupted themselves by launching multiple large-scale military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of which failed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Westemär Civil War</h2>\n<p>Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further efforts to retake Drakkenheim were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown and relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim, arguing there was no conclusive evidence which confirmed their brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided over the issue, and a civil war ensued which raged for nearly a decade.</p>\n<p>As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal. Cecilia von Kessel herself died unexpectedly only a few days later, leaving behind no heirs of her own. Lacking a clear successor, the Civil War ended with a whimper.</p>\n<p>Now, only a dim hope remains that the realm can be rebuilt and the nation restored. Gathering what little support he could muster amongst the nobility, Lord Commander Elias Drexel has launched a foray into Drakkenheim in a desperate final bid to retake the capital.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<p>Here are but a few of the powerful organizations and groups operating in Westemär.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Hooded Lanterns</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/127-hooded-lantern-ranger-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Hooded Lantern Ranger\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/127-hooded-lantern-ranger-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns are an irregular military regiment formed to reclaim the ruins of Drakkenheim. Their guerilla forces are drawn up from remnants of the Westemär military, veterans of the bloody Civil War, and brave volunteers who wish to restore the nation. The Hooded Lanterns' primary objective is to drive out the monsters that now inhabit Drakkenheim, hoping to rebuild the city. In the process, they search for any evidence, documents, or records left behind in the vaults of the city which might reveal a possible heir to the throne of Westemär.</p>\n<p>While the bulk of the Hooded Lanterns' forces are operating in Drakkenheim, soldiers from the regiment can be found throughout Westemär on important support, logistics, and recruitment missions. The contamination around Drakkenheim means the regiment relies entirely on food and water stores shipped to their strongholds, and they constantly need fresh recruits to replace their fallen. It's common to find several patriotic Hooded Lanterns in the taverns and market squares throughout the nation, trying to stoke national pride from able-bodied people to join their cause in Drakkenheim.</p>\n<h3>Lord Commander Elias Drexel</h3>\n<p>The leader of the Hooded Lanterns is<strong> Lord Commander Elias Drexel</strong>. He is a large, gruff man in his early fifties. He is well-built and imposing, with a grim frown on his wide, angular face. His harsh features are framed with a thick mustache, side chops, and a mane of long braided brown hair. He is often garbed in chainmail with heavy leather gloves and boots, worn under a fur-lined dark green cloak and iron pauldrons, upon which is firmly clasped the<em> Lord Commander's Badge.</em></p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I seldom take time for niceties and pleasantries. I prefer people to be direct and to the point.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I am loyal to my soldiers and expect the same in return. I do not often trust outsiders, but if they show their worth, I will treat them like my own.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My past is wrought with bloodshed and loss; and I feel intense guilt for every warrior who has died under my command. I seek redemption by staying true to what the Hooded Lanterns represent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I avoid talking about my past failures, and if it comes up I am quick to anger.\n</p>\n<p>Elias Drexel leads the Hooded Lanterns' mission to reclaim Drakkenheim and uncover a worthy successor to the throne of Westemär. He would love to have the financial support of House von Baden, but has a complicated relationship with Ludwig von Fritz, as the two were bitter foes during the Civil War. The Lord Commander receives moderate support from House Kleinkessel and the rulers of Geldstadt and Altbruke in his mission.</p>\n<p>The Lord Commander orchestrated the original failed incursions into Drakkenheim before the Civil War broke out, and during the war itself, he fought for Mannfred von Kessel. However, when Mannfred made it clear he no longer intended to retake Drakkenheim after the war, Elias Drexel secretly seethed over the lives lost there in vain. The Lord Commander joined the plot to assassinate Mannfred and his heirs, but did not expect Cecilia von Kessel to die soon after. Now, Drexel believes strongly it is his duty to make amends for the mistakes he caused. At the time he believed he was doing the right thing, but since the apparent end of the von Kessel line, he was left with nothing to fight for. The Hooded Lanterns represent a new purpose for Drexel, and a way to right the wrongs of his past.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Followers of the Falling Fire</h2>\n<p>The annihilation of Drakkenheim set off a serious religious schism within the faith of the Sacred Flame. A new sect has emerged known as the Followers of the Falling Fire, led by the charismatic words of Lucretia Mathias. The beliefs and practices of the Followers of the Falling Fire are described in the Gods and Religion section above.</p>\n<p>Most of the Followers of the Falling Fire are devout commonfolk distraught by the state of the world, fearful of the magic and monsters haunting their lands, and disillusioned by what they perceive as gross hypocrisies within the mainstream clergy of the Sacred Flame. Others are pilgrims from distant lands whose hearts have been stirred by the writings of Lucretia Mathias. Many among them see the Divine Matriarch not as the spiritual figurehead of their shared faith, but a foreign ruler trying to seize control of their nation by manipulating the tenets of the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias's hopeful and resolute message has given them a sacred purpose: Through humble actions and unwavering faith, one can find redemption and even change the world. It is a message that speaks to the despair and uncertainty of their times; that the smallest light burns brightly against the deepest darkness. Now, they travel the roads of Westemär towards Drakkenheim to take part in the Sacrament of the Falling Fire.</p>\n<p>Several prominent Flamekeepers in Westemär have joined the cause as well, and argue convincingly about the finer theological matters proposed by Lucretia Mathias with their congregations and fellow clergy. A few minor nobles have relinquished their domains to take the pilgrimage, but most higher-ranking nobles have avoided taking sides on the issue thus far.</p>\n<p>Demonstrations led by the Followers of the Falling Fire are held in city squares and outside chapels, and have led to violent altercations with mainline devotees of the Sacred Flame. The Followers of the Falling Fire often come into outright conflict with traveling Knights of the Silver Order dispatched from Elyria. Nevertheless, the Followers of the Falling Fire are determined, and their numbers are quickly swelling. Many more devout faithful will need to discover their fate in Drakkenheim to meet the coming darkness.</p>\n<h3>Lucretia Mathias</h3>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias is a powerful cleric of the Sacred Flame. Ever since she prophesied the meteor which destroyed Drakkenheim, her words and writing have galvanized the Followers of the Falling Fire. As she has been branded a fugitive and heretic by the Faith of the Sacred Flame, she currently takes refuge in the ruins of Drakkenheim with her most true-hearted and unswerving followers.</p>\n<p>Lucretia is a thin and aged woman in her early nineties. She has piercing eyes and pursed lips. She has long graying black hair often kept in a coiled bun beneath a linen shawl. She wears simple gray robes, and clutches a heavy leather-bound tome that contains the writings of her faiths and beliefs. A glowing golden crystal dangles from a silver chain around her neck. A soft glow in her chest can be seen through her robes from the delerium shard she has embedded into her heart. She is a mighty cleric of the Sacred Flame, and is among the few mortals alive in the world who can cast spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY]. She regards her divine spellcasting as a gift granted for sacred purposes, and only invokes such powerful magic to advance the cause of the Falling Fire.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I offer kindness and guidance to all who seek it, encouraging them towards the path of the Falling Fire. All who are lost simply need the guidance of the light to find their way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Faith is the highest calling. Through faith, the Sacred Flame shall light our glowing hearts as one, and carry us through the night into a new age.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I have seen the end of all things, but also the righteous path that we must follow to become the light when the darkness comes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> Others are not ready to know the full truths revealed to me. It can only be known fully by taking the Sacrament, otherwise they will never understand.\n</p>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias fervently works to convert others to believe the message and practices of the Falling Fire. She urges her followers to abandon their worldly lives and possessions, and make a devout pilgrimage to the ruins of Drakkenheim. Many die making the dangerous trek. However, those who reach the Crater's Edge partake in a controversial ritual known as the<em> Sacrament of the Falling Fire.</em> At the culmination of the ritual, believers impale a delerium crystal into their hearts. Those who survive are spiritually transformed and physically empowered, rendered immune to eldritch contamination and able to survive in the corrupted ruins of Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>Lucretia Mathias has prophesied that hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of devoted followers will need to complete the pilgrimage to fulfill her prophecy. Once they do, the Sacred Flame will set alight every righteous mortal heart.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Queen's Men</h2>\n<p>The Queen's Men are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands, outlaws, and scoundrels, all owing fealty to the enigmatic Queen of Thieves. As Westemär now lacks any sort of a unified legal authority, criminal activities are able to operate with near-impunity and plunder the wealth of the nation. These rogues stalk the highways near Drakkenheim, robbing and extorting supply caravans, pilgrims, prospectors, and adventurers drawn to the city. The Queen's Men operate an extensive smuggling network who traffic delerium from the ruins of Drakkenheim through ports such as Drannsmund to disreputable clients in distant lands.</p>\n<h3>The Queen of Thieves</h3>\n<p>The Queen of Thieves is a scheming mastermind. She exerts control over a burgeoning criminal empire through manipulation, blackmail, and bribery, weaving a tangled conspiracy of sabotage and subterfuge against her enemies. So long as anarchy and lawlessness reign in Westemär, so shall the Queen of Thieves.</p>\n<p>The true identity of the Queen of Thieves is a mystery, for she wears many faces. She is known for her legendary ability to change her appearance at-will. Nevertheless, her most infamous persona is a masked swashbuckler dressed in a red and black leather coat, matching pants and cape, with a wide-brimmed red hat.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong><em></em> Information is my favorite form of currency. I speak with sly confidence, and like to flaunt my wealth in conversation by revealing the secrets I've stolen about others.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Payday comes from preparation, and I'm always two steps ahead. The truth can be more deadly than any blade, but it's all the more effective when you throw in a little twist.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I keep my friends close, and my enemies closer. If I can turn my foes to profitable purpose before I dispose of them, so much the better.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I trust no one, not even my closest allies… and anyone who would trust me is a fool. I'm a turncoat by nature, and I'm ready to meet any backstabbers with a betrayal of my own.\n</p>\n<p>None know where the diabolical schemes of the Queen of Thieves will lead, nor her true aim or agenda. Most believe she is little more than a ruthless criminal overlord who wants to seize power in wake of the devastation across Westemär, and style herself as the ruler of a bandit kingdom. Other rumors whisper she is a long-lost mageborn heir to the throne of Westemär, attempting to regain control of her broken kingdom. There are even stories that tell that she is not human at all, and in fact a creature from another plane musing at the folly of man and toying with mortal minds. Some suggest that there is no Queen of Thieves at all, but rather a fairytale brewed up by several canny outlaw bosses to foster fearful unity amongst their ranks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House von Baden</h2>\n<p>House von Baden rules Drannsmund, a position their family has held for generations. As such, their domains include the shores of Ash Bay and stretch halfway up the Crystal Coast. The foremost figures of the noble house are the Duke of Drannsmund himself, and his daughter, Verona von Baden.</p>\n<h3>Duke Valentin von Baden</h3>\n<p>A finely-dressed male human @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.OcJoakgBoM6FdYTj], Duke von Baden is a stately man in his mid-forties. After spending his youth adventuring among pirates in the Middle Sea, Valentin took up the mantle of the Duke of Drannsmund when his father and elder brother were slain in the early attempts to reclaim Drakkenheim. Now a shrewd admiral and diplomat, Duke von Baden chose discretion during the Civil War, remaining neutral throughout the conflict despite repeated entreaties from both sides of House von Kessel.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong><em></em> I conduct myself with professional savvy and charm, addressing others with their formal titles and proper names. I pepper my speech with nautical references and naval terminology.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><em></em> A good business sense, fair exchange, and mutual profit set the sails for a good relationship, whether in life, love, or politics.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><em></em> I must be a safe harbor to my city, its ships, and its people. Under my leadership, I will shelter them from the storm facing our times.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><em></em> Just as one must sail carefully on uncharted waters, one should regard new allies and situations carefully. It is better to remain distant and impartial, keeping along shallow waters, lest you become caught up in an unseen tempest far from shore.\n</p>\n<p>Duke von Baden now wrestles heavily on whether or not he should forbid the trade and export of delerium within his city. However, that could compromise his ambitions. Since he remained staunchly neutral during the Civil War, he has cold relationships with the other dukes and nobles. Valentin increasingly believes Drannsmund is best positioned as an independent city-state: a northern rival to the independent Liberio.</p>\n<h3>Lady Verona von Baden</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/064-pg47-verona-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Lady Verona von Baden\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/064-pg47-verona-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>The presumptive heir to House von Baden, Verona von Baden is a cunning human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.13K3XK2A3wwxVKLD] with many connections spread throughout Westemär. She is an athletic woman in her early twenties with wide brown eyes, tightly curled black hair, and soft features. She is known as having a good eye for money and is well-versed in politics and trade. She is responsible for many of the diplomatic arrangements, political discussions, and negotiations with other cities and rulers. Verona von Baden is often dressed in a white button up with a brown leather vest, dark trousers, and swashbuckling boots. She carries a shimmering rapier with an ornate golden hilt with an engraving of her family crest upon it. Like her father, she is an avid sailor and ship captain. Her own caravel is known as the<em> Rose of Thorns</em>, a ship built from rosewood with an ornate carved bouquet as its figurehead, white sails, and armed with canons. She has been at the helm of many sea battles, and her swift ship is known and feared by many.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong><em></em> I am a careful listener and observer, knowing what to say to make people around me feel at ease, and get what I need out of them. Kindness is a master manipulator.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Money can't buy you happiness, but the more of it you have, the less you need to worry. Having strong allies and good cash flow is the recipe for a happy life.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I am the best negotiator and smartest leader this city has ever had, and will prove myself invaluable to the people and my father.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> My overconfidence and desire to do things myself has seen me in over my head on multiple occasions, whether it be with a pirate's sword to my throat, a political debate, or captured by otherworldly monsters.\n</p>\n<p>Verona Von Baden has positioned herself as an incredible leader, both in naval expeditions and battles, but also in political debates and trade. She hopes to not only claim the duchy of Drannsmund after her father steps down, but prove to the people of the city her value as their leader. In doing so, she believes that if no successor is found to rule Westemär, her connections and alliances will ensure she will be the most obvious choice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House von Fritz</h2>\n<p>House von Fritz rules Todesfeld, and claims the lands around the Elfmire, the Achtungwald, and the Drann River as their domain. The family have been longtime rivals to House von Baden.</p>\n<h3>Duke Ludwig von Fritz</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/047-pg48-ludwig-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Duke Ludwig von Fritz\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/047-pg48-ludwig-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>The current head of the household is @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.VTx18xWVIM8oKeor], a cantankerous and covetous<strong> noble</strong> miser. The decrepit man is suffering from long-term delerium contamination, made worse by his reliance on an utter quack of a doctor who uses the duke to test his own tinctures.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I don't care for pleasantries and care even less for appearances, even my own. I speak openly about my thoughts, and can't resist the opportunity to belittle others' deeds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><em></em> I am tremendously pleased that the Civil War ultimately destroyed House von Kessel. Now, I can carve out the Marshlands as a petty kingdom of my own.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond</em></strong><em>.</em> I seethe over the destruction wrought upon Todesfeld as a result of the Civil War — not because of what has happened to the people of the city, mind you, but what it has done to my fortune ever since.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw</em></strong><em>.</em> There is nothing anyone can do to earn my respect or admiration other than money and power.\n</p>\n<p>Duke von Fritz's wife died several years ago of delerium contamination after the Todesfeld Dam broke. His eight children run their own estates, preferring to have as little contact as possible with their father. He eagerly took arms against Mannfred von Kessel during the Civil War. He eyes the port of Drannsmund and the city of Leuchten, and has begun eagerly purchasing weapons and armor from the Amethyst Academy hoping to increase his military prowess.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Kleinkessel</h2>\n<p>House Kleinkessel is a cadet branch of House von Kessel. The household formed shortly after Helena I took the throne to separate the royal household from their extended family in matters of succession. Nevertheless, the Kleinkessels have perhaps one of the stronger claims to the throne of Westemär since they can trace their ancestry back to Helena I. In fact, when the main House von Kessel line ended during the Civil War, they took up the royal family's ancestral castle in Kesselholm.</p>\n<h3>Constance Kleinkessel</h3>\n<p>Today, the ruler of House Kleinkessel is Countess @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.t23Lo6cg9BwL9yOU].

She has gleaming emerald eyes, crimson red lips, a flushed round face, and a small pointed nose. Her jet-black hair is tied up into braids and woven into an intricate headpiece set with pearls. She wears a scarlet gown and is dripping with jewelry. Her painted fingernails are sharpened into points. She often meets guests for dinner, where she licks her lips and runs her fingers on the edge of a cup of red wine.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I could eat you up. I fill my speech with macabre innuendo which mix dining, physical intimacy, and slaughter.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> The living must be made to serve the dead. When my plans come to fruition, mortals will be divided into cattle and corpses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I am bound by bonds of blood to serve dark masters and vampiric overlords, but one day I will take it all for myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I can't ever resist a good meal… would you like to stay for dinner?\n</p>\n<p>Constance Kleinkessel herself is in fact the sister of Helena I. Originally known as Camilla von Kessel, she has passed through a series of identities to hide her vampiric nature. Every few decades, she marries a hapless nobleman, slowly draining his life force so that he appears to expire from old age. Shortly thereafter, her so-called daughter inherits the estate and the cycle continues.</p>\n<p>During the Civil War, Constance Kleinkessel used her vampiric abilities to manipulate and scheme alongside Cecilia von Kessel and Lord Commander Elias Drexel to plot the murder of Mannfred von Kessel. She had planned to follow through and murder her co-conspirators, but the subsequent death of Cecilia von Kessel was an unexpected development: she had been planning to target Cecelia's future children with her replacement scheme to seize the throne of Westemär.</p>\n<p>Since undead creatures are not immune to the effects of delerium contamination, Constance Kleinkessel has also worked closely with her doctor, the malfeasant wizard Deidrick Mors, to experiment with new ways delerium can create augmented vampires.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“If there was a secret organization of vampires working in the shadows, the Academy and I would have uncovered it by now. So I wouldn't put too much weight into rumors.”</blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Steelfang Mercenary Company</h2>\n<p>Under the employ of Constance Kleinkessel is an infamous mercenary regiment: the Steelfangs. The unit consists of nearly fifty<strong> Steelfang mercenaries</strong>.

He has a mane of long, red, unkempt hair with a beard to match. He wears animal furs and a thick brown leather belt that holds up several daggers and two large axes. He speaks in a loud, boisterous, grizzled voice, and cares little for manners or etiquette. He swears and spits when he talks, and speaks his mind to just about everyone.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I'll tell you how it is and then some. Don't expect honeyed words and a helping hand from me. You're more likely to get a swift insult and an axe in the back.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Life is what you make of it.

The vampires secretly scheme to seize control of Westemär so they might dominate the living, keeping mortals like cattle for feeding.</p>\n        <p>However, few among them know the ultimate mastermind coordinating the efforts of the Night Court. Perhaps it is none other than Vladimir von Drakken himself, whose broken and cursed body has lain buried in a secret tomb for centuries since his daughter's betrayal, waiting for the day his undead form is fully restored.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</article>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">The Achtungwald</h2>\n<p>The largest forest in Westemär engulfs the heartland of the realm. Its edges begin on the Crystal Coast and stretch eastward towards Drakkenheim. The Drann River flows through its western side, bordering the northern reaches of the forest. This deep black forest is known for its towering trees of cedar, fir, and pines, with pockets of oak, maple, and other deciduous trees. The grasslands around Geldstadt and the Glimmerwash River separate it from the Kesselwald and the Brachenwald. A forest road connects Altbruke and Geldstadt, and allows travel south to Todesfeld and Leuchten. Although this highway passes through the peaceful forest town of Tierhaven, most travelers avoid this route, preferring to take the longer roads which circle the heart of the forest along the Drann River.</p>\n<p>In ancient days, druids conducted blood-rites beneath the full moon in the Achtungwald, and the forest is still a place where shapeshifters, fey, and otherworldly tricksters dwell. In the remote thickets of the darkest wood, one may even find ley lines and faery crossings into other realms.</p>\n<h3>Trethysia, the Forest Serpent</h3>\n<p>This @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GP8JMSDugRxuLOD2] dwelling in the Achtungwald is an elusive creature who has occupied the deepest and darkest center of the woods for hundreds of years. Trethysia narrowly avoided being drawn into the wars of House von Drakken, and has skillfully escaped countless Caspian dragonslayers. The dragon is a capable illusionist and can tap into the primal energies of the forest, and uses these powers to deceive and trick their foes and hunters. Now, they are quite content to live in solitude. There is an ancient ruined elven village in the heart of the forest that is said to be the dragon's home now, but from time to time the dragon is seen flying over the forests on raids, snatching livestock from the smaller farmsteads. However, Trethysia generally avoids direct confrontation with humans.</p>\n<p>Still, many a campfire story tells of the great elven treasures the dragon hoards inside those ancient ruins, and there are still those who remember Trethysia's treachery on the outskirts of Schaffburg, or the damage they did to the walls of Altbruke.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Elvenmire Wetlands</h2>\n<p>This great marsh formed at the drainage basin of the Drakeclaw Mountains, where hundreds of small streams collect into a sluggish wetland. Tall reeds, weeping trees, and rocky outcroppings jut out from shallow lakes and deep muddy fens.</p>\n<p>The wetland takes its name from the numerous ruins found throughout the marsh, many attributed to the ancient elves. There are slender towers which extend deep into the earth and are flooded by the marsh waters. Travelers wonder whether or not the elves originally constructed these ruins underground or if they are larger structures which sank into the bog. Many ruins consist of a plinth poking above the surface with a hatch which opens into a great chimney or shaft heading downward. However, the elves live here no longer; only their vengeful ghosts remain. Keening wails can be heard on nights of the new moon.</p>\n<p>The Elvenmire is also home to many wild creatures and beasts who haunt the misty wetlands. Rumors of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.OBujQLLPSmlJiZnL]{ghouls}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ZHAFrnCwCz17dmLc]{trolls}, and many other foul creatures have given the swamp a reputation for being a dangerous place to travel through.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Drakeclaw Mountains</h2>\n<p>The sharp-edged and blackened Drakeclaw Mountains are a volcanically active range. The ruthless and brutal environment has little vegetation, steep and dangerous slopes, and constant rockfalls, earth tremors, and magma flows. There are few roads and passes through the mountain, and most travelers make their way to Elyria from Westemär in the wide valley between the Drakeclaw and Glimmer Mountains instead.</p>\n<p>The greatest peak of the Drakeclaw Mountains is the terrible Dragon's Maw, a colossal volcano. Its destructive eruptions have caused devastation throughout Elyria and Westemär throughout history, sending cinder, smoke, and ash out into the lands for hundreds of miles. Thankfully, such catastrophic events have only occurred twice in the past thousand years.</p>\n<p>In ancient days, the mountains were populated by countless red dragons, including the very ones which made the first blood-pacts with the sorcerer-kings of old. Today, the Caspian Scalebreaker Legion have driven out many of the old dragons, but some still slumber here.</p>\n<h3>Vulmungoth, Doom of the Mountain</h3>\n<p>This @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.vFeFRlF2FOgf2HIL] resides in the caldera of the Dragon's Maw. The dragon has lived here since before recorded history, and spends decades at a time slumbering.</p>\n<p>Vulmungoth rarely stirs in their lair. The caldera is so inhospitable, most would-be dragon slayers die scaling the volcano. Still, they emerge every century or so to slake their vast appetite, flying down into Elyria to consume mortals and their livestock. Their waking always follows great eruptions from the Dragon's Maw, and many towns and villages are destroyed. Thus, the locals living south of the Drakeclaws grow up with well-made plans for their evacuation and escape should the dragon return. During their last rampage, the dragon descended upon Holy Lumen in a horrible encounter that almost saw Saint Tarna's Cathedral destroyed.</p>\n<p>Vulmungoth is the last surviving dragon who was a part of the ancient Blood Pact, where the sorcerer-kings melded their bloodlines with draconic magic. Today many sorcerers and dragonborn can trace their distant ancestry to Vulmungoth.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the fall of the sorcerer-kings, a group of monks of the Sacred Flame attempted to ascend the Dragon's Maw and destroy Vulmungoth for their ties to the Arcane Empire. The dragon devoured most of them. Only a small handful of monks made it off the mountains. The resounding defeat ended the organized attempts by Elyria to defeat the Doom of the Mountain.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Glimmer Mountains</h2>\n<p>The Glimmer Mountains rest along the south east of Westemär, separating the nation from Caspia. This large stretch of great snow-capped mountains is home to the tallest summits on the continent. On a sunny day, the icy peaks shine and gleam in the light, which may be why they have their name, but a more likely reason is the large deposits of silver, gold, coal, and gemstones. When the dwarves first returned to the surface, they built some of their first citadels along the peaks. While few remain occupied today, many dwarven communities remain in the foothills.</p>\n<h3>Ruins of Glitter Peak</h3>\n<p>The most glorious and famous dwarven keep was built on Glitter Peak — a massive stone-carved city protruding from the pinnacle of what was once the tallest mountain in the world. If the dwarves ever had anything resembling a true empire, Glitter Peak was certainly its capital. The city was home to thousands, and was said to descend deep through the mountain and miles into the earth below. Brilliant dwarven engineering constructed a vast network of pipelines, levers, and tunnels that established wondrous water-based lifts stretching down the mountain, which allowed the dwarves to easily haul mined ores from dizzying heights. Dwarven greybeards tell how the entire side of the mountain was carved out to house foundries, workshops, and homes. Even the lower valley was part of this great dwarven realm, which fought bitterly to maintain its independence against the Arcane Empire.</p>\n<p>Today, however, the great dwarven city lies in ruin. Glitter Peak collapsed in a massive landslide which destroyed the city over a thousand years ago. Accounts differ on what exactly caused the disaster. Many claim dwarves grew greedy, and hollowed out the mountainside to a point where it could not sustain its own weight. Others believe the city was destroyed by a magical earthquake conjured by a vengeful sorcerer-king. Either way, since the city's destruction, the dwarves no longer live high in the mountain, and instead keep to the lower valley and foothills. Others moved to communities spread throughout the continent and adopted more traditional lifestyles as smiths or masons. The ruins of Glitter Peak now stand as a grim reminder to the dwarven people of their lost glory. Who can say what untold treasures and wonders of dwarven engineering lie buried beneath the mountain?</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Drann River</h2>\n<p>The Drann River has been essential to trade, travel, and agriculture in Westemär. This long wide river meanders through the heartland of the nation. Its headwaters begin at Lake Dray, and it collects from a network of tributaries that cross Westemär. In many places, the river is hundreds of feet wide, large enough for small ships to travel along it usually carrying goods downstream from the inner regions of Westemär towards Ash Bay.</p>\n<p>Now, however, for all of its length from Drakkenheim to Drannsmund, the river is contaminated with delerium. The farms and villages that rely on the river for irrigation are slowly dying, as their populations are stricken with sickness and corruption they cannot understand, let alone cure. Fresh water still flows into the river from many smaller tributaries, preventing a complete collapse of agriculture in the heartland of Westemär, for now. Still, it is only a matter of time before the spreading corruption from Drakkenheim makes everyday life in Westemär a desperate struggle for survival.</p>\n<p>Strange stories and rumors emerge weekly of odd occurrences along the farms and small communities along the Drann River. Misshapen monsters, mutated wildlife, trees moving in odd and unusual ways, grass becoming pale and brittle, farm animals dying of old age only a few years into their life, and strange motes of unnatural colors and hues drifting over the land are common sightings. Wealthy families have moved further inland from the river, but most have nowhere else to go. Beholden to their family plots, these poor folk are increasingly falling ill and losing their minds dwelling along the contaminated river.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Ash Bay</h2>\n<p>Ash Bay forms where the Drann River empties into the ocean. As such, a well-known saying in Westemär claims that “all that is Westemär flows to Ash Bay”. Indeed, the bay is the nation's epicenter for fishing and ocean trade. Ash Bay houses the port city of Drannsmund and the fishing village of Ashshaffen, along with countless smaller villages and fishing ports.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to anyone is the fact that Ash Bay now harbors the largest concentration of delerium anywhere on the continent outside of Drakkenheim. Deep beneath the bay around the wreck of the<em> Empress Geraldine</em>, an otherworldly octarine reef formed by delerium crystals is slowly growing. Indeed, the contaminated Drann River has been constantly carrying fragments and small chunks of delerium downstream.</p>\n<p>As the saying goes, so too has the contamination, haze, and madness of Drakkenheim seeped into the waters of Ash Bay. This corrupted reef has begun to warp and change much of the sea life in the area. Below the surface of the waters, something sinister is gaining sentience and plotting its domination over the people of Ash Bay.</p>\n<h3>The Duchess</h3>\n<p>This horrific monstrosity is larger than a whale. It has a long, serpentine body bristling with sleek fins, undulating barbed tentacles, and rubbery purple-black flesh. It writhes through the waves with unearthly grace despite its bulk, and seeping from the flaps and vents within its skin come secretions of a thick, oozing oil which shimmers with prismatic hues. The monstrosity has a gigantic fanged maw which it holds agape. Seaweed, fish entrails, and slime dribble from between its sharp teeth, and its bulbous eyes glow with octarine light. It has adorned its brow with fishing nets, coral, sea debris, and delerium crystals, as if wearing a coronet and jewelry. As you look upon its form, you feel a slight headache, a buzzing in your ear, and a pressing in your chest; as if the psychic presence of this otherworldly creature has conjured up the crushing pressure of the abyssal depths.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ewmEdvGsruhwPxSQ] is a contaminated sea monster that haunts the shores of Ash Bay (see @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.book.JournalEntry.drakscgd05append] for its game statistics and those of its minions). The creature originally made its home in the sewer cisterns of Drakkenheim. However, as @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ewmEdvGsruhwPxSQ] matured and grew larger, it departed the cursed city via the Drann River in search of more plentiful prey and fresh thralls, bringing a new wave of contamination to Ash Bay. It deliberately destroyed the<em> Empress Geraldine</em> just off the coast of Drannsmund; the merchant vessel was transporting a vast hoard of delerium to the far continent. The Duchess has slowly tended the new reef of delerium coral flourishing around the shipwreck, transforming it into a personal underwater palace.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> “What horrific condition afflicts the land-dwellers! How awful must it be that you cannot live and languish in the wonderful sea… such a terrible curse which keeps you bound to the land…”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> “My magic will weaken the curse which holds you to the land, so you might swim through the waves of my court, and be welcomed as one of my loyal subjects! Perhaps you will be worthy enough to become one of my valiant Knights!”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><em></em> “Come see the wondrous treasures of my Grotto! Gaze upon the opalescent, prismatic beauty of my prized coral… you may hold it in your hands, for a while, if you wish…”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> “I abhor the land, and will never set scale or fin upon it.”\n</p>\n<p>The Duchess has powerful and otherworldly psychic powers. They can communicate telepathically, read the thoughts of mortals, and turn mortals into its contaminated thralls. It makes deceptive offers that appeal to characters' deepest desires, manipulating them into embracing contamination. Those under its control slowly mutate, taking on horrific aquatic features.</p>\n<p>The Duchess has seized control over the population of Ashshaffen, where it summons its worshipers at the Salt Cove Shrine, an underground cavern beneath the ruined chapel in town. The monster is now slowly spreading its tendrils of influence over Drannsmund.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the creature has dispatched one of its more capable thralls to the Starwatch Lighthouse. There, the Duchess hopes to open a dimensional rift so she can conjure other beings like itself, styling itself no longer as a duchess — but an empress.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Starwatch Lighthouse</h2>\n<p>A few hundred meters from the cliffs of the Crystal Coast along Ash Bay rests an ancient and mysterious lighthouse made from shimmering greenish-blue stone. The locals call it “the lighthouse,” but there is no shining beacon at its pinnacle. It consists of two soaring towers which rise from a central dome, built upon a massive pillar of rock which juts out from the ocean. A small bridge joins the two spires at the very top, where the pillars end in rounded rooftops. Though worn by time and the elements, the outer facade is entirely smooth. Not a single window is found along the height of the building, and there is no apparent entrance from the ground floor. None know who keeps it, though legend claims it is an elven ruin. Today, nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out. Perhaps the entire construction is solid rock, a great edifice built by forgotten elves for an unknown purpose.</p>\n<p>This lighthouse has been the subject of many local legends and superstitions, attributing it both to ancient and forgotten worshipers of Nodens or Phantasia. In truth, the Ash Bay lighthouse is an elven ruin, built in bygone times before the elves lost their memories. It magically anchors the energies of several convergent ley lines and thin places in the region. Inside the great dome at the base of the tower is one of the fabled Elfgates where the elven nomads arrived in this world.</p>\n<p>The elf-tower is a colossal structure. The rocky island off the coast itself is about one hundred feet tall, and the building rises to a height of three hundred feet above it. There is no obvious entrance from the ground floor outside: the only way in is via the small stone doors found on either end of the bridge connecting the two towers.</p>\n<p>The massive towers are full of strange and hidden chambers. Some have a recognizable purpose: stone plinths used for elven meditative trances, common rooms, and magical fonts that conjure fresh water and a nutritious thin broth. Other chambers are strange workshops, ritual rooms, and scrying chambers where erratic arcane runes glimmer through the air in an unknown elven script, but whose meaning hints at dire warnings. Another chamber is a great archive, where every book is a blank slate of glass and strange metal. Runes glimmer upon the surface before the reader, but whatever knowledge or messages that were here are now lost. The runes only display gibberish.</p>\n<p>At the base of the lighthouse rests the Elfgate itself, a huge circular pool of alien liquid, powered by stone arches that channel arcane energy from embedded delerium crystals. These stones did not come from Drakkenheim: the elves brought them here from their unknown home. Unfortunately, those who knew the techniques used to activate the Elfgate are long gone and unremembered. However, there is indeed a lone occupant here:</p>\n<h3>Valtar Banemoon</h3>\n<p>Floating gemstones orbit about the head of this ancient and wispy elf @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]; their magic has sustained him for thousands of years. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.X1Uzv8VQYvPIKjLd] is the hermetic lighthouse keeper, and has not left the lighthouse in millennia. He knows little of the world beyond, and even less about how he got here.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I haven't spoken to anyone in… well, ever. If I got the chance, I would love to know everything about them and their world.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><em></em> I remember a time when many elves were here, and have dim visions of them passing through a faery-gate, anguished and tired, refugees from an unknown cataclysm which destroyed our world. I know not what has happened to them, but I hope beyond hope they are safe and thriving.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I was charged to protect and guard this place, but why I cannot recall…. What was lost, that wondrous place… Acadia. The name is the only thing I can remember, and I hold on to that memory dearly.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><em></em> The pang of missing memory is palpable. I struggle to remember anything.\n</p>\n<p>Valtar Banemoon has never had any visitors, and is uneasy about leaving his post. He knows that he was born on another world and traveled to this earth, but remembers nothing else of that time. If convinced to leave the lighthouse and enter the world, though, perhaps it may be possible to unlock his memory and learn the great mystery of the elven people.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Crystal Coast</h2>\n<p>The Crystal Coast takes its name for the many salt deposits along its shores, which have been an important industry for Westemär. Stretching from Ashshaffen to Heilig, this coast is made of rocky beaches, cold ocean air, and consistent storms and rain. It is known to be one of the colder stretches of land in Westemär, and a rather dreary place to live. Still, the coast is dotted with small fishing communities and settlements. Many of Nodens's faithful gather at stone circles built along the stormy seaside to pay tribute to the god of storms and sea.</p>\n<p>Recently, many fishing boats and sailors have been vanishing after setting out from the Crystal Coast. Storms of oddly-colored lightning and booming thunder have been reported, and rumors of ghost ships and strange monstrosities lurking in the depths have begun to spread throughout the coast. Some believe Nodens is upset with the people of Westemär for one reason or another, and people are growing wary of sending their loved ones out to sea when the skies aren't perfectly clear.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Drannsmund</h2>\n\n<img class=\"float-right region-symbol\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/147-pg53-von-badenbrooch-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/147-pg53-von-badenbrooch-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the Bay Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 43,000</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duke Valentin von Baden</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance</strong>: Neutral</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Harbor District, Shipyards,<br />Major Commercial Hub, International Trade,<br />Crabs, Pearls</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Built where the wide mouth of the Drann River opens into Ash Bay, the bustling harbor of Drannsmund is filled with countless ships, galleons, and trade caravels.

Sailors, merchants, and all manner of travelers from far and wide bargain around elegant shopping arcades and share in a lively cultural life.

Even before the fall of Drakkenheim, the city was an important economic hub. Drannsmund has benefited considerably despite the hardships facing the nation as a whole thanks to its geographic position, powerful fleet, and the shrewd, level-headed rule of House von Baden. The people of Drannsmund are beginning to think of their city as a potential new capital for Westemär, or perhaps even the heart of an independent nation of their own.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the city is not without its problems. After running through the corrupted ruins of Drakkenheim for fifteen years, the waters of the Drann River have become thoroughly contaminated, and the once-prosperous fishing around Ash Bay is starting to fail. Ocean-bound trade still thrives largely in part because Drannsmund is now the ideal place for smugglers and prospectors to bring delerium harvested from Drakkenheim. The strange stones move through Drannsmund to markets in distant lands and far continents, where it may fetch prices even beyond those offered by the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<p>While House von Baden has profited greatly from taxing this trade, smugglers and malfeasant mages making black market deals for delerium have spurred increased crime and violence in the streets. Meanwhile, monsters and other horrors are beginning to take root beneath the harbor and sewers of Drannsmund, and a thick mist swirling with prismatic motes now looms over Ash Bay. If it one day rolls in upon the port city, Drannsmund may face the same fate as Drakkenheim.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Baden Castle.</em></strong> Perched upon a rocky cliff overlooking the city and the bay, this estate of House von Baden is less a fortification and more a palatial manor. Here, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.D9e4W6lbpJ7qzIqP] holds court. The estate looms over Ash Bay with massive balconies decorated with stone carved statues and gargoyles. The brick building with its bright blue roof and white trim surrounding the windows and doors can be seen from anywhere in Drannsmund.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Harbor and Shipyards.</em></strong> Harbormaster Dogberry oversees the daily operations of the port, keeping meticulous records of every ship and its cargo. Though he feels himself a man of great importance to House von Baden, he has never personally met the duke.\n</p>\n<p>The shipyard is often filled with large sailing ships, travelers from the Isles of Skye, trade boats from Elyria, and even some from across the ocean. There is never a quiet moment amongst the sprawling docks and harbor.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Saint Jordana's Cathedral.</em></strong> High Flamekeeper Marselle recently converted to the Falling Fire and is now at odds with the other Flamekeepers who manage the smaller chapels throughout Drannsmund. With her conversion, a number of her congregation have begun to set out on pilgrimages of their own, and slowly the Followers of the Falling Fire are becoming much more commonplace in Drannsmund than previously suspected.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Shrine of Nodens.</em></strong> On the edge of the cliff overlooking Ash Bay is a small shrine to Nodens. The statue of the god is adorned with seashells and starfish. Fish guts are placed daily upon the shoulders of the statue to attract gulls to perch and feast. Bogdan Strangewayes, an old hermit and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.K15Yl8JmB5iPircc]{druid} of the Old Faith lives in a small shack nearby. He tends to the shrine daily and performs ancient rituals to appease Nodens and prevent the Old God from sweeping Drannsmund in to the ocean.<strong><em></em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Tower of Storms.</em></strong> On the eastern end of the city is a small rocky peninsula where a tall tower stands overlooking the bay. Court mage to House von Baden, master wizard Sundar Stormgale, a blue dragonborn<strong> mage</strong>, uses his evocation magic to operate the tower as a beacon for ships to make it into harbor safely during storms. The wizened dragonborn has a wispy white beard and wrinkled face. He wears uniquely-crafted spectacles and flowing purple robes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Kraken Manor Hotel.</em></strong> While Drannsmund is home to many seedy sailors' taverns, flophouses, and hostels, those preferring finer accommodations seek out this prestigious establishment. Wealthy merchants, nobles, and Academy mages often stay in its fine private suites and dine together each evening in the luxurious lounge. The double doors at the entrance have carvings of a large @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.kVg37NlPcACAzjCT] upon them, with two of its tentacles protruding as handles. The lobby has a great painted ceiling showing two krakens embracing one another. The lounge features paintings of nautical themes, ship battles, and stormy ocean waters decorating the walls and a grand staircase leading to the suites splits like waves upon a massive statue of a kraken carved out of marble.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Todesfeld</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the Marshlands Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 38,000</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duke Ludwig von Fritz</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Cecilia von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Todesfeld Dam, Major Industrial Hub, Workshops, Factories, Coal Mines</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Across the flat marshlands you spot the great and monstrous thing which is the City of Todesfeld. The partially-flooded city is built where the Drann River meets the Elfmire. A huge array of watermills surrounds the ramshackle city of workshops, collieries, blast furnaces, rolling mills. The high chimneys pour out thick, black soot which shape the skyline.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>All manner of mills, workshops, and water pumps fill the city of Todesfeld with the constant thrum of industry. Here, rich coals extracted from mud-slick mine shafts fuel dozens of smelters, foundries, and forges constructing steel weapons and equipment, and their spindly chimneys spew black smoke across the city.</p>\n<p>Todesfeld is a grimy and grim city decaying from within from pollution and ravages brought on during the Civil War. The humid heat and smog make it hard to breathe, the noise is constant, dirt and filth coat the city, and the wafting smells of industry, sweat, rotting wood, and moss-covered concrete fill the air. Most people living in Todesfeld walk the streets carrying lanterns to see through the thick industrial fog, and wear large coats pulled up around their mouths and noses.</p>\n<p>Todesfeld was once the site of a great stone dam built across the Drann River, which powered water mills used by the industries of the city. However, during the Civil War, an irregular mercenary company was dispatched to blast apart the dam and sabotage the city's production. Hundreds were killed in the aftermath, and the city has not fully recovered. Waters still fill the streets in the low parts of the city and streets have wooden boardwalks so residents do not get stuck in the mud. Many houses lie in ruin, and newer homes are built on stilts to avoid the knee-deep water that fills a large portion of the city, while older buildings have been reinforced with concrete foundations. Locals know not to drink the water of the Drann since it flows directly down river from Drakkenheim. Most attempt to avoid touching it at all costs. Contamination and eldritch creatures lurk in the backstreets and slums of Todesfeld.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ruins of Todesfeld Dam.</em></strong> The crumbling dam is now mostly submerged in the waters of the Drann River, as are the lower river banks of the city, and over a dozen riverside homes. The stone and concrete structure was once the pride of Todesfeld, and much of the residential district was along the riverbanks. The city still hasn't fully recovered from the tragic destruction to some degree. The dam was never rebuilt and the crumbling stone wall now sits as a monument to the catastrophic outcome of the Civil War of Westemär and the impact it had on the cities it touched.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Coal Mines.</em></strong> Duke Ludwig has ordered the continued operation of his many coal mines just outside Todesfeld proper. The flooding of the city caused many mine shafts to fill with contaminated water, and those that are still open are damp caverns filled with thick mud, contaminated fumes, and are prone to collapse. Despite this, the coal has kept flowing and the duke seems uncaring for the many miners who lose their lives trapped in the mines. Workers are forced to run water pumps around the clock to drain the mines so operations can continue. Still, the normally hazardous mines have become even more dangerous since the flooding, but many rely on them to make their livings and feed their families, and so work continues all the same.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Saint Rosalind's Cathedral.</em></strong> On a hill surrounded by flood waters on Smoke Street sits an austere cathedral to the Sacred Flame. The cathedral is tended by High Flamekeeper Irma, an elderly woman who has served as Todesfeld's High Flamekeeper for fifty years. She was thankful when the flood waters did not take the cathedral, and she was able to keep the brazier burning for those seeking aid and guidance during those dreary times. However, the cathedral did not go completely unscathed, for the lower crypts underneath are now flooded with contaminated water. Delerium has seeped into the dead that rest there, reanimating them as undead horrors. No longer fit to battle them herself, and unwilling to risk the lives of her acolytes, Irma sealed the doors to the lower crypts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Taverns.</em></strong> Several well-known taverns are frequent stops for travelers and locals alike in the city, but few stay more than a night in Todesfeld. The Gavel and Gauntlet on Chisel Street is free of most of the muck and decay of the low town, and is a well-appointed tap house frequented by many travelers and locals of higher class. The Drowning Cat and Smoke Street Flophouse in Low Town are just above the water level and are popular stops for workers after a long day.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Castle Sodden</em></strong><em>.</em> The manor of House von Fritz, this dilapidated castle clings to the only bit of solid rock in the muck and mud surrounding it. According to legend, the castle has sunk into the swamp at least three times. The entire building leans noticeably to the left as one approaches and the entire interior is slightly skewed, with chandeliers, book cases, drapes, and tablecloths all tilting mildly to one direction. Walking the halls gives one a sense of unease due to the uneven floors. The tallest tower of the castle is off-limits due to it being completely collapsed within.\n</p>\n<p>The area surrounding the castle is filled with tufts of tall reeds protruding occasionally from the swampy mud, and is filled with flies and mosquitoes. A wooden boardwalk leads to the castle from Todesfeld. One step off the crude and warped boardwalk will find travelers knee deep in sticky, suctioning mud. A single lantern hangs outside the massive doors to the castle so one can find their way through the mist.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Leuchten</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right region-symbol\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/128-pg54-von-kessel-heraldry-final-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/128-pg54-von-kessel-heraldry-final-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the Gap</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> Approximately 10,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Baron Boris the Bold, a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Cecilia von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Impressive Fortifications, Siege Workshops</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>A great fortress-city rises up in the flat valley flanked by the Drakeclaw Mountains to the west and the Glimmer Mountains to the east.

Inside the city proper are all manner of arsenals, stockpiles, workshops, and barracks.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the city has faced more sieges over its history than perhaps any other city on the continent, and certainly within Westemär. Despite its impressive defenses, it has fallen twice — though never to a direct assault. When Albrecht von Drakken died in battle amidst his failed invasion of Caspia, the Scalebreakers broke against the walls and guns of Leuchten in their retaliatory attack. During the Mage Wars, the city was briefly captured thanks to a forged document, and fell again thanks to adventurous mercenaries during a minor conflict between Westemär and Liberio.</p>\n<p>Given the strategic importance of Leuchten, the city does not have an ancestral noble house as its traditional ruler. Rather, the monarchs of Westemär have typically assigned title and authority to one of their top military figures, or, as is more often the case, a problematic royal sibling who needs a distant but seemingly important assignment far away from the politics of the capital. It was previously under the rule of Cecilia von Kessel, but since her death the city is now controlled by her former general, Baron Boris the Bold.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Geldstadt</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of Achtungwald Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 20,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duchess Ursula von Syndow</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Mannfred von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Gold Mines, Orchards, Opera House, Cultural Hub</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Throughout the city of Geldstadt, twinkling orange-red street lamps line the cobblestone roads as they weave between townhomes adorned with plush purple curtains.

The city was once well-situated along prime trade routes from southern nations sending goods to the capital of Drakkenheim or towards the Eastern Vales. The walled city is well-known for its elegant urban architecture, and home to many exotic specialist craftspeople catering to affluent tastes, such as artists, sculptors, jewelers, toymakers, and tinkers. Most notably, the city is home to several galleries, hotels, theaters, and an opera house, giving it a vibrant cultural life.</p>\n<p>During the early days of this thriving town, all of the gold, jewels, and other wealth flowing from the mines in Glitter Peak first passed through Geldstadt. Due to the rich deposits within the mountains, the Glitterwash River made for excellent gold panning as well.</p>\n<p>However, Geldstadt is not without its issues. Its rulers have struggled to maintain their desired standard of perfection within the nearby towns and villages along the forest, especially when collecting taxes and levies. Since the fall of Drakkenheim, Duchess Ursula von Syndow has been hesitant to admit that her coffers are running low. Trade has dwindled considerably as few goods travel through the city towards Drakkenheim anymore. The city is starting to show its cracks to those who look closely enough, and the dangers and horrors of Drakkenheim are creeping ever closer to their doorstep.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Altbruke</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the River Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 18,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duke Malcador Engelhart</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Mannfred von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Altbruke University, Printing Presses, Coffee Houses</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Straddling a wide expanse of the Drann River is a great curved causeway of stone.

The smell of coffee and newsprint fills the air.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>Thanks to the presence of its prestigious university, Altbruke sports a highly-educated and well-read population, even amongst the low-born people who inhabit the city. As a result, it is a hotbed for new philosophies and political ideas. Most recently, the topic of “alternative systems of governance,” a strange notion known as “democracy,” and “representation of the people” have become popular topics amongst the student body, much to the consternation of Duke Malcador Engelhart.</p>\n<p>The city was captured during the Civil War of Westemär, during which the university was heavily damaged and the famous bridge nearly collapsed. Duke Malcador was able to maintain control and suffered minor losses, and has spent the years since repairing and modernizing the northern side of the city. The new construction and fixed architecture are regarded as some of the most beautiful buildings constructed in Westemär.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Altbruke University.</em></strong> Administered by Headmaster Reginald Montgomery, Altbruke University is made up of three large rectangular buildings framing a central domed building that stands in the center. The buildings red brick with slate roofs, and main building features large white pillars that flank the main entrance. Across the street stands an impressive library built to match the construction of the university.\n</p>\n<p>The study at the University is entirely dedicated to conventional study of philosophy, literature, natural science, history, and mathematics. Arcane instruction is expressly forbidden; under the Edicts of Lumen only the Amethyst Academy may operate a mage school. Representatives from the Amethyst Academy regularly audit the collections and curriculum of the university to ensure no tome of magical lore has fallen into its stacks. Nevertheless, many apothecaries attend Altbruke University to study medicine and anatomy, while secretly pursuing occult research on their own.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Heilig</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of the North Province</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 17,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Duchess Sophia von Schneesturm</p>\n<p><strong>Civil War Allegiance:</strong> Mannfred von Kessel</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Copper, Gemstones, Rugged Land, Temples to the Old Faith</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Heilig looms dauntingly along the northern coast of Westemär.

Now ruled by a distant relation, Countess Constance Kleinkessel, the town has grown drearier.

Lumber mills frequent the landscape and woodcarvers are a popular profession, and often logs are sent down the Drann River to the other cities throughout Westemär. Lately, no one has been leaving their homes at night. Reports of wolf attacks, large bats, and a strange glow coming from the lower windows of the castle have been the source of much of the gossip in the town.

The vast obsidian structure is hundreds of feet tall, and housed vast repositories of magical lore, incomplete magical experiments, hidden vaults containing unspeakable extraplanar entities, and powerful magic items sheltered from the world at large. When the meteor struck Drakkenheim, a huge chunk sheared straight through the middle of the tower. However, the Inscrutable Tower still stands. The topmost half of the tower still floats in place in defiance of gravity, leaving a gaping hole between the upper and lower floors of the tower.\n</p>\n<p>Many great mages were lost or killed that day — including the former Archmage of Drakkenheim, Adrianna Modera. Her position on the Academy Directorate has remained vacant ever since. The Academy desperately wishes to discover her ultimate fate, and recover her research. However, the Academy's own arcane wards were scrambled by the erratic magic left behind in Drakkenheim, frustrating any attempt to enter or observe the tower using teleportation or divination magic.

A paddling of ducks wanders across the dirt streets past a simple trading post. A marketplace springs up around the well at the center of town, but the traveler will find nary any shops, or even an inn for respite. Most visitors are homesteaders from outlying farms bringing wagons of grain to the mill along the brook, and the blacksmith spends his days making nails and horseshoes, not swords and chainmail.

Home to the Holy City of Lumen, the spark of the Sacred Flame was lit here. Indeed, the people of Elyria claim civilization itself was born in the fertile river valley between the fiery Drakeclaw Mountains and the Witherbleach Desert. There, along the lush banks of the Vita River, humanity laid the first foundations of its cities. For many, the story of Elyria is the story of humanity itself, for in these lands human beings have performed their greatest deeds and their most enduring cruelties. In ancient days, the lands of modern-day Elyria made up the core of the mighty Arcane Empire. Lumen was once called Nox, where its despotic rulers dominated the people of the continent.</p>\n<p>However, today Elyrians have purged the blood-soaked legacy of the Arcane Empire with the fire of faith. They do not claim to be the successors of that horrific regime. Instead, Elyrians regard themselves as the descendants of righteous revolutionaries who threw off the shackles of tyranny, brought justice to the oppressed, and seized control of their own destiny.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Elyria occupies a wide peninsula; the east coast meets the Middle Sea, and the western coast lies along the ocean. The heartland of Elyria stretches along the Vita River, where fertile flood plains and grassy prairies are broken up by arid hills and a mountainous coast. Nestled within are pockets of pinewood forests and orchards of olive trees. It has a diverse temperate climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. As such, agriculture thrives in Elyria. Beyond bountiful harvests of grain and maize, orchards, vineyards, pastures, and ranches form the core industries in most communities. The coasts are rich with a wide range of marine fishing. Furthermore, Elyrians often cultivate large crops used for textiles, such as cotton, and several communities keep colonies of silkworms. The land becomes a dry rocky desert towards the southern end of the peninsula, where the Pale Tooth mountains mark a firm border around the Southern Reaches.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Elyria is the most populous nation on the Continent, home to nearly 14 million people. The nation boasts many of the largest cities in the known world, but the vast majority of its people live in rural villages along the coasts and the Vita River.</p>\n<p>Humans make up most of the population in Elyria. As the Faith of the Sacred Flame took root here, many people with arcane ancestries, such as elves and tieflings, opted to leave Elyria for other lands more welcoming to them.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>Lumen, formerly called Nox, is the capital city of Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Government</h2>\n<p>Elyria is a theocracy in all regards but name. For generations, the Faith of the Sacred Flame has influenced almost every aspect of culture, society, and law throughout the nation. However, Elyria itself was born out of a league of city-states, emerging as a feudal monarchy with absolute primogeniture. The Divine Matriarch would traditionally crown the monarch of Elyria and offer the ruler close counsel, and so the faith and government have always been closely entwined. As leader of the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the Divine Matriarch has traditionally been regarded as a pillar of wisdom, truth, and justice, and historically is often called upon to mediate difficult political matters.</p>\n<p>Yet any remaining semblance of separation between church and state began to rapidly dissolve over a century ago, when the royal line of Elyria went extinct following the death of the last true Elyrian monarch, King Marcus Zachary II. In its place, a parliament was assembled from the ninety-nine most powerful and influential Elyrian lords, and the Divine Matriarch would choose one amongst their number to act as Lord Regent every six years. Together, the noble parliament and the Lord Regent would serve as a ruling body for the nation. The Lord Regent would act in place of a hereditary monarch, but only wear the<em> Crown of Elyria</em> when it was deemed necessary by the consensus of the Parliament of Lords.</p>\n<p>Today, while the current @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5] is not officially the head of the state, few decisions are made without her blessing and direct counsel. Many predecessors to Mercy V have used their power to select a line of caretaker regents who defer to the Faith on virtually all matters of state. While members of the clergy take vows of poverty that preclude them from holding actual political station, the parliament is now mostly made up of fundamentalist nobles staunchly loyal to the religion, and the Lord Regent is almost always a close relative of a prominent High Flamekeeper or the Divine Matriarch. Indeed, the current Lord Regent, Polonius Reed is no exception. As a result, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5] wields de facto political authority in Elyria.</p>\n<h3>Noble Ranks</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Lord Regent.</strong> As Elyria no longer has a true monarchy, the Lord Regent holds the highest office in their stead. Technically, the Lord Regent is selected from amongst the most powerful dukes and duchesses of Elyria.</li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Duke or Duchess.</em></strong> The dukes and duchesses of Elyria are often descended from the rulers of the original city-states of the Elyrian League.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Earls.</em></strong> Vassals of Elyrian dukes with holdings over country manors and estates in smaller towns and settlements.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Gentry.</em></strong><em></em> Elyria has a large number of urban nobles who are quite wealthy, but who do not have large land claims of their own.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Elyrian Cabinet</h3>\n<p>The Elyrian Royal Council was reorganized into the Cabinet after the establishment of the Parliament of Lords. It consists of the following individuals:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5]</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.r3vkm5QcTHpVp87P]</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.vpjLiSZqbJ1sIA5S]</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.edFqywMzmWglHpE1]{Archmage Xel'vohca the Ancient}</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.gPHQ4Uk24kPluaAf]</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.aoWNtpr7Zfrw2UMk]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the past, the Divine Matriarch would appoint a High Flamekeeper to sit on this council as the representative of the Faith, but since the assassination of her predecessor, Mercy V has been directly on the Cabinet. Similarly, the role of Master Commander was filled by the High Paladin of the Silver Order.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>The Faith of the Sacred Flame began in Elyria, and its capital, Lumen, is the holy city of the religion. As a result, the Faith's most deeply orthodox adherents are found in Elyria. Even the few Elyrians who do not follow the Sacred Flame are very familiar with its beliefs, tenets, and myths.</p>\n<p>Professing faith openly is a major facet of Elyrian culture. People speak prayers and give thanks to the Sacred Flame throughout their day, and offer blessings to their friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Children grow up hearing the tales of Saint Tarna's deeds, and Flamekeepers teach youths to read and write using passages from the<em> Song of Fire.</em> Elyrian residences place emphasis on having a roaring hearth, bonfire pit, or fireplace which acts as a household altar to the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<p>The annual calendar is planned around the high holy days of the religion, and devout Elyrians attend services and hymns at their chapels regularly. Important civic events and gatherings, such as weddings, funerals, and other celebrations are often held within chapels and ministered by a local @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT] or @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]. People hold clamorous outdoor receptions in the evenings with wine and roasts, where they sing and dance before sparkling flames.</p>\n<p>Small settlements which might only feature a modest shrine to the Sacred Flame in another nation frequently have splendid chapels in Elyria, and cathedral domes define city skylines. Monasteries where the clergy dwell are spread throughout the countryside, and the diligent, masterful craftwork often taken up by the monks and priests form an important part of the Elyrian economy.</p>\n<p>In Elyria, having a family member amongst the clergy is both highly regarded and extremely prestigious — an important political and social asset. Daughters of Elyrian nobility often grow up with intense pressure from their families to foster their devotion and study scripture in the hopes they might be able to channel the divine powers of the Sacred Flame. The few who do are encouraged to take up a position as a Flamekeeper in the clergy, even though the vows of poverty associated with the religious hierarchy means disavowing their noble inheritance and lifestyle.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“Do you like the Sacred Flame? You're going to love Elyria! Do you not like the Sacred Flame? Best pretend you do. Flame be with you... and so forth.”</blockquote>\n<h3>Other Faiths</h3>\n<p>Not surprisingly, the worship of the Old Gods has been almost entirely expelled from the heartlands of Elyria, with barely a stone left upon their ancient shrines. Many who live in Lumen and other large cities are not tolerant of other religious beliefs at all. Most mistakenly think those who follow the old gods are dangerous cultists who traffic with capricious fey and evil fiends.</p>\n<p>The few stalwart worshipers of the Old Gods who dwell in Elyrian cities generally keep their beliefs secret, because they know they risk violence from their superstitious neighbors for having a different religion. While the laws of Elyria do not expressly prohibit people from having their own private beliefs and maintaining personal altars in their own homes, they also do not protect those who hold such beliefs from discrimination, harassment, and assault, especially when in public. Indeed, temples to the Old Gods are not permitted within Elyrian towns and cities, and the public display of holy symbols and religious rituals of the Old Gods are also banned. Offenders can be fined, flogged, have their property seized, and ultimately be banished or executed for flouting the blasphemy law common in most Elyrian cities. However, the reach of such laws diminishes towards the southern coast and deserts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Military</h2>\n<p>Although the Divine Matriarch has great power, commanding the conventional military forces of Elyria is not within her direct authority. Elyria still retains a largely feudal military structure — lords and other nobles form their own armies drawn from local levies. The Divine Matriarch relies on the loyalty of these lords when they require a large army.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/115-pg62-silver-order-paladin-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Silver Order paladin\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/115-pg62-silver-order-paladin-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<h3>Knightly Orders</h3>\n<p>The Faith of the Sacred Flame sponsors several anointed knightly orders. Perhaps the most famous is the Silver Order. These knightly orders are the militant arm of the Faith, and not formally a part of the Elyrian military forces.</p>\n<h3>Navy</h3>\n<p>Elyria boasts the mightiest navy of any power on the continent. These ships, known as the Sapphire Fleet, allowed Elyria to dominate trade and travel within the Middle Sea and surrounding waters for many years. Indeed, their merchant fleets were the first to trade with distant lands in far continents. While Westemär and Caspia have since established their own ocean trade routes and naval fleets, neither come close to rivaling the Sapphire Fleet of Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<p>Arcane magic is not common in Elyria. The Amethyst Academy maintains few outposts here, and the nobility rarely seek court mages. Instead, it is customary for each household to sponsor their own @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] as close counsel in a similar role to a court mage.</p>\n<p>The Archmage of Elyria is @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.edFqywMzmWglHpE1]. A member of the Academy Directorate, the ancient mage spends most of his time seculded within his secret sanctum deep below Lumen, and uses their intermediaries at the Violet Embassy in Lumen when dialog between the Faith and the Academy is necessary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trade</h2>\n<p>Elyria is a fertile land, but must focus on less perishable goods for international trade. As such, its textile industry dominates commerce with other nations, especially cotton and silk. Elyrian wine competes against Caspian wine for the finest in the continent.</p>\n<p>Trade by land usually proceeds from Michael's Gate to Liberio, and from there into either Westemär or Caspia. The bulk of Elyrian trade happens via water through the Middle Sea, giving the nation direct access to most Caspian ports, while many other merchant ships sail through the straits of the Middle Sea to trade with cities in Terene and Orleone.</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Exports</strong>: Wine, oils, silk, cotton, textiles, pottery</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Imports</strong>: Salt, iron, coal, spices</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History</h1>\n<p>Elyria was once the heart of the sorcerer-kings' Arcane Empire, which they ruled from the Nightmare City of Nox. The imposing obsidian obelisk known as the Spire of Nox loomed over the wretched metropolis, built by Sorcerer-Queen Nahmar when she sealed the Blood Pact with diabolical fiends.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Fires of Liberty</h2>\n<p>After centuries under the yoke of the sorcerer-kings, hope for salvation was sparked when Saint Tarna renounced her wicked ways and became the First Paladin. She took up arms against the sorcerer-kings, and through her deeds the Spire of Nox was torn down. Saint Tarna's sacrifice inspired the dispossessed common folk toiling under the tyranny of the sorcerer-kings to throw off their bonds and rise up in rebellion. However, the rule of the sorcerer-kings did not immediately come to an end during Saint Tarna's lifetime.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, her disciples spread her message of justice, but more importantly, they taught others to invoke the divine magic of the Sacred Flame. Though individuals with the will and devotion needed to master this power are rare, these new clerics and paladins provided the divine strength needed to meet the arcane might of the sorcerer-kings head-on. After three centuries of rebellion and resistance, and through the blood of countless martyrs, the vast Arcane Empire crumbled.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">League of City-States</h2>\n<p>The collapse of the Arcane Empire was a period marred by war and conflict. The rebellion that had joined together to overthrow the sorcerer-kings collapsed into political posturing amongst rival factions and city-states. The vassals, cities, and people ruled by the sorcerer-kings had too long been lorded over by a distant supreme power, and were loath to hand over control of their newly-found freedom to anyone else. The lands of modern-day Elyria were amongst the last to be free of the sorcerer-kings, and in the immediate aftermath became a loose coalition of city-states along the Vita River and the coast of the Middle Sea.</p>\n<p>While each city-state was independently governed, the leaders of these cities would meet every few years at a summit to discuss their shared interests, alliances, and trade. Acknowledging the sibling-like bonds between their cities, they called themselves Elyria's League, named after the slain daughter of Saint Tarna. The League would later be known as simply the Elyrian League, and its people Elyrians.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Unification Under House Ava</h2>\n<p>During the middle of the fifth century, House Ava, one of Elyria's many noble houses, rose to prominence amongst the League. Lady Bernadette Ava conceived a scheme to unite the city-states of the Elyrian League not through conquest and bloodshed, but by the bonds of blood and family. Using carefully arranged marriages between her children and the nobles of the other Elyrian city-states, Lady Bernadette positioned her grandchildren as the inheritors of vast swaths of land and titles. However, each would still owe fealty to the head of the family.</p>\n<p>Though Lady Bernadette did not live to see her plan come full circle, House Ava cemented itself as the political power in the peninsula, and city-states of Elyria emerged as a united nation. What was once the Elyrian League was now simply Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Extinction of House Ava</h2>\n<p>Over the centuries, House Ava's intermarriages transformed the royal family into several cadet branches. Although the name “House Ava” gradually went extinct, the rule has passed mostly peacefully through 26 different households since the time of Lady Bernadette Ava. House Zachary was the last to claim any clearly discernible connection to House Ava. Unfortunately, the family tree had grown so tangled amongst the various lines that when King Marcus Zachary II died in the year 1001 without a direct heir, there was no clear successor to the throne.</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch attempt to avoid a civil war, the Elyrian nobility turned to the Faith of the Sacred Flame and consulted Divine Matriarch Humility III for guidance. After days of meditation and contemplation upon the Flame, Humility III decreed that an oligarchic Parliament of Lords would lead the affairs of the state, forming the governmental order which persists to this day.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Rising Theocracy</h2>\n<p>With the offices of the Divine Matriarch and the Lord Regent now intrinsically linked, a new political order settled into place across Elyria. Noble houses all sought increased influence and more profound connections to the Faith of the Sacred Flame — if a noble house could hold the Regency, and have a family member as the Divine Matriarch, it meant that their family had ultimate control in all decisions of faith and state. The first household to achieve this level of political control was House Eden, who managed to place a member of their household in both positions twice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Assassination of<br />Divine Matriarch Courage IX</h2>\n<p>Dissatisfied and disillusioned with the growing influence of the Sacred Flame over their government, several noble houses formed their own underground organization that conspired to overthrow the power of the Divine Matriarch. After years of planning, during a celebration in Saint Tarna's Cathedral, Divine Matriarch Courage IX was publicly assassinated to send a message to separate the Faith and the nobles once more. Unfortunately, the plot backfired. The commonfolk of Elyria were enraged, and the conspirators were outed and brought to trial before the nobility loyal to the Faith. The purported mastermind of the conspiracy, Lady Desmonda of House Windsor, and her allies in House Kellogg and House Sawyer were found guilty by a jury of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers}. After they were publicly executed, their surviving family members were stripped of their lands and titles and banished from Elyria.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath, the position of the Divine Matriarch remained vacant for four years, until finally the synod was reconvened and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5] elected to the position.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/129-pg64-sacred-flame-crest-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Crest of the Sacred Flame\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/129-pg64-sacred-flame-crest-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Faith of the Sacred Flame</h2>\n<p>As explained throughout this section, the organized clergy of the Faith of the Sacred Flame is the most influential political and social faction in Elyria. Consult the Gods and Religion section for more details on the religion itself.</p>\n<h3>Divine Matriarch Mercy V</h3>\n<p>No one living in the world today has shaped the political destiny of the continent through their words and actions more than @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5]. The responsibility and gravity of these decisions weighs heavily upon her. Now twenty years into her tenure, she was the youngest ever to assume the office. Nevertheless, she wields incredible divine power.</p>\n<p>Before taking up the position as the head of the Sacred Flame, Mercy V was named Esmeralda Poe. As youngest scion of House Poe, she was groomed from a young age to take up the mantle of a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] by her father, Lord Balthazar Poe. Remarkably gifted with the Divine Light, she could channel the holy magic of the Sacred Flame from the age of ten. Nevertheless, her election to the office over the experienced miracle-worker Lucretia Mathias was a shocking upset.</p>\n<p>Mercy V speaks with warm wisdom and fiery conviction, and holds each syllable of every hymn, prayer, or text of the Sacred Flame in her memory. A tall and slender woman in her late forties, Mercy V has long, wavy black hair and a striking gaze. Her garb consists of ornate flowing white robes with golden trim and embroidered with golden filigree. The symbol of the Sacred Flame is emblazoned prominently upon the robes. She carries a long scepter of white-gold, and wears a large frilled collar that looks like golden flames flickering around her head.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> Though I know every word of our holy texts, I do not use them in my speech except when I am conducting prayers or rituals. To speak them otherwise is to use these words in vain. If others cite the<em> Song of Fire</em> against me, I remind them devils can quote scripture too.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> The Sacred Flame is the guiding light of the world, which will lead us to truth and righteousness. It is my role to help others follow its holy beacon, a narrow path we must all walk together. The more good we put into the world, the brighter the road ahead becomes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My office comes with great responsibility, and the power I hold is a burden, not a privilege. I understand now that sometimes one must step through shadows in their quest towards the light, but I shall bring justice to those consumed by darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> The ancient words of the saints and martyrs are absolute and incontrovertible. I have disdain for those who try to reinterpret ancient truths which have stood the test of time with new ideas.\n</p>\n<p>The cosmic disaster, civil war, and religious schism raging in Westemär have been pressing challenges for the Divine Matriarch. It was Mercy V who declared delerium an unholy blight and dispatched the Silver Order to Drakkenheim, and she who decided to expel Lucretia Mathias for blasphemy. She knows full well that her proclamations are slowly leading the continent down the path of outright war. Others in the Faith might be eager to make war against the Amethyst Academy, or transform Elyria into a holy empire by conquering Westemär, but Mercy V takes no joy from either prospect. For her, these decisions were made from necessity. The righteous path runs narrow, and she stands resolute to do what must be done to protect the faithful and the world.</p>\n<p>Mercy V was more surprised than anyone when she won the position of Divine Matriarch over Lucretia Mathias, as she had been a longtime admirer of the prophetic cleric. When the meteor fell upon Drakkenheim, Mercy V earnestly believed in Lucretia Mathias's vision. It was not until the stories of the unspeakable horrors from that place first emerged, and Lucretia Mathias returned with an eldritch stone embedded within her, that the Divine Matriarch grasped the darkness which had taken root in the world.</p>\n<p>Mercy V is horrified by how far Lucretia has taken the Falling Fire, and is convinced it must be the work of demonic possession or some kind of otherworldly malevolence controlling her. The Divine Matriarch would like to see Lucretia Mathias captured so she can have her repent and renounce the Falling Fire. Theologically, however, she does find the prophecies and arguments of Lucretia Mathias compelling. She often questions how, if their positions had been swapped, things may have gone differently. However, she knows in her heart that no good can come from the delerium.</p>\n<p>As for the Amethyst Academy, the Divine Matriarch has no trust for the Directorate. She believes they are merely waiting for their best opportunity to convince the nobility to dissolve the Edicts of Lumen. She fears that too many power-hungry nobles will be easily swayed by the prospect of delerium-forged weapons, and that the terrible arcane might of such blasphemous magic will overpower those who stand against it.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Divine Matriarch weeps for the fate of Westemär. If none can rise to the task of ruling it with truth and righteousness, she sees saving that nation as another burden she must bear for the good of all.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Silver Order</h2>\n<p>The Silver Order is an elite church-sanctioned regiment of paladins and ordained knights oath-sworn to combat supernatural evils, otherworldly incursions, and dark magic, founded several centuries ago as a militant arm of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. These knights and paladins act by the decree of the Divine Matriarch to defend the faithful from demons and monsters, and are called up as witch-hunters when wayward mages dabble in forbidden arcana. Their holy missions transcend sovereign borders, but the order is headquartered in Michael's Gate. The chronicle of the Silver Order records countless heroic missions which have prevented a dire threat from growing into a far greater crisis.</p>\n<p>Though they usually operate as individual questing knights or in small warrior-companies, occasionally they are deployed as a regiment. Members of the Silver Order have been traditionally drawn from all peoples and all levels of society. Nobles and commoners alike are found within the order, and one's station in life does not reflect one's position in the Silver Order.</p>\n<p>Elyrians laud the esteemed members of the order as heroes. However, in their role as witch-hunters and mage-slayers, the Silver Order was complicit in the persecution and oppression of arcane spellcasters. To this day, the issue remains a deep stain on the order's honor, as many observed that the injustices and persecution visited upon spellcasters stand in stark contrast against the tenets of the faith of the Sacred Flame, a faith which calls out for justice for the oppressed. Nevertheless, nobles and common folk in Elyria are staunch supporters of the Silver Order, and many argue that the knights' deeds were indeed justified. After all, decisive action is necessary to defend the innocent and the faithful from wicked sorcerers who sought to dominate others with magical might, or cut down foul warlocks who spread wickedness through demonology and necromancy.</p>\n<p>However, as Elyria slides deeper into theocratic rule, these knights are increasingly entangled in state affairs. Paladins of the Silver Order have been deployed on inquisitional crusades against heretics, heathens, and other political enemies of the Sacred Flame. Unfortunately, the distinction between an enemy of the Sacred Flame and an enemy of the state is not entirely clear anymore.</p>\n<p>These concerns have been thrown into sharp focus ever since the Divine Matriarch dispatched a regiment of Silver Order @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{knights} and their retainers to the ruins of Drakkenheim to root out and destroy delerium at its source. Though led by the righteous paladin Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal, the nobles of Westemär and Caspia alike worry the Order's presence in Drakkenheim is an invasive ploy by Elyria to wrest control of Westemär, rather than a valiant expedition to purify the city of eldritch contamination.</p>\n<h3>Knightly Ranks</h3>\n<p>The Silver Order has several ranks:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>High Paladin.</em></strong> The commander-in-chief of the entire Silver Order is always a paladin.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Knight-Captain.</em></strong> These paladins of the Sacred Flame are amongst the greatest heroes in the world today. There are ten in the order, but each commands a company between thirty and one hundred<strong> Silver Order Knights</strong> and the retainers serving under them.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Silver Order Knight.</em></strong> Not every warrior in the Silver Order is a paladin, but each strives to emulate Saint Tarna's valiant example. Nevertheless, many knights of the Silver Order take up a sacred oath. Paladins are revered figures in the Faith of the Sacred Flame, as the founder of the faith was herself a paladin.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Soldier-at-Arms</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> Each Silver Order Knight leads a small squad of ten rank-and-file warriors. This forms the basic unit of the Silver Order, and typically these groups travel the world on righteous quests and holy missions. Assisting them are a large collection of squires, grooms, and retainers.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>High Paladin Uriel Radley</h3>\n<p><strong>Uriel Radley</strong> is a lanky but incredibly fit man. He has wispy, unkempt, dirty-blonde hair that falls down just past his shoulders, and he keeps a blonde trimmed beard and mustache. The man has a prominent chin and dark sunken eyes of piercing sky blue. His angular jaw and thick brow give him a stern and brooding appearance. He is often found wearing his shimmering full plate armor with a large waving blue and white cape, and a matching large tower shield both emblazoned with the symbol of the Sacred Flame. His left pauldron is in the shape of a large griffon head; highlights of gold and white decorate the armor.</p>\n<p>His warhammer, aptly named The Judge, is renowned for its many battles, and passed down amongst the High Paladins. It is a massive silver warhammer with a white hilt filigreed with gold with a head shaped like a griffon.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I do not suffer those who turn their backs on the faith or seek evil ends. I speak sternly and directly, often quoting scripture to guide my words.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I am judgment, I am the flame, and those who spend their days writhing in the shadows should fear the light I bring. I am staunchly loyal to my people, I will defend innocence with my life, and I will vanquish evil and deliver swift judgment to the fiends and monsters of this world.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My role as the leader of the Silver Order is something I take very seriously. Elyria needs me, and I will stop at nothing to do right by the Sacred Flame, the Divine Matriarch, and the legacy of Saint Tarna.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I see the world in absolute terms. You are either on the side of righteousness and good, or you are on a path to evil. If I cannot alter that path, then you receive my final judgment.\n</p>\n<p>Uriel Radley is a stoic commander known to be brutal in battle, but fiercely loyal to his people. He very much wants to be remembered like the great saints of legend. Not for fame or glory, but for upholding his oath to the Sacred Flame above all else and protecting Elyria and the continent from the evils seeping out of the shadows. The tales of spreading corruption and otherworldly horror has planted the idea in his head that it is his duty to see these problems solved, with him and his soldiers at the heart of that resolution.</p>\n<p>Uriel sent his best friend and protégé , Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal to Drakkenheim. He imagines that the skilled captain might one day take his place as High Paladin once he retires from the role.</p>\n<p>Uriel despises arcane magic and sees mageborn as problematic at best. Though he is a righteous man, and upholds the values of the Edicts of Lumen to the letter, Uriel dreams of the day he can unleash the Judge upon the members of the Directorate of the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<h3>Knight-Captain Gloria Hackfield</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/078-pg66-gloria-hackfield-edit-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Knight-Captain Gloria Hackfield\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/078-pg66-gloria-hackfield-edit-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Gloria is a young @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.JxXafxg0qnMZSHZH] who made the rank of Knight-Captain early in her career, and has been a strong leader since. She has long blonde hair often worn in a tight ponytail and narrowed green eyes. Her round face and pleasant demeanor give her an air of kindness that can be disarming to many at first, but the kind exterior hides her cunning and strength that comes out any time she speaks.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I do my best to be welcoming and kind to those I speak with, but I speak loud and firmly to hold the attention of those around me and I know how to command a room.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> It is our duty as knights of the Silver Order to uphold the tenets of our faith and help those in need. We go where we must and do everything we can to spark the Sacred Flame in the hearts of those we aid.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> The world can be a dark place, and I joined the Silver Order to help bring a little more light into it. It is my sworn duty to provide a light to those wandering the darkness, and help them find their way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I assume the best in everyone, and believe that everyone has good in them.\n</p>\n<p>Gloria is extremely proud of her position as Knight-Captain and wants very much to give the Silver Order a good reputation amongst those devout to the Sacred Flame, but even more importantly, those who are not. She sees good deeds, acts of kindness, and helping those in need as an important job for the Silver Order as every person they help is more likely to look to the Silver Order with kind regards, and in turn, become more open to the ideals of the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Amethyst Academy</h2>\n<p>Mageborn are born to Elyrian families no less than any other nation. However, the fears and superstitions surrounding arcane spellcasters run deep throughout Elyria, especially in rural and fundamentalist communities. As such, the Amethyst Academy takes its role as guardian of mageborn children extremely seriously in Elyria.</p>\n<p>When its emissaries travel the towns and villages of Elyria to collect mageborn children from their families, they often visit the nearby chapel to speak with the local @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] to ensure safe passage and peaceful dealings in the process. These wards are always taken to Paradox Castle in the Eastern Vales for their studies, as the Amethyst Academy does not maintain a major stronghold in Elyria proper. Instead, Academy leaders and representatives conduct their business from the Violet Embassy in Lumen.</p>\n<h3>Xel'vohca the Ancient</h3>\n<p>Xel'vohca the Ancient is one of the eight Amethyst Academy Directors, and the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6] of Elyria. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf]{Academy Director Lich} has held his position since the Amethyst Academy was founded, and was among the principal architects of the Edicts of Lumen. Indeed, since the time the Edicts were being drafted, the Divine Matriarchs have known about his undead nature, though they must tolerate this uncomfortable truth under the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Even still, Xel'vocha's undead nature is not immediately apparent; aside from the High Paladin and the Divine Matriarch, the other members of the Elyrian Cabinet are not aware Xel'vohca is a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.bfh29vIEoGzI240e]. Upon first meeting he appears as an old man in an ornate wheelchair of strange metal, attended by his personal @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.sSs3hSzkKBMNBgTs]. He has drooping jowls, sallow skin, sunken octarine eyes, wispy white hair, and an expression of deep sadness upon his face. He wears a simple purple robe and carries a glass-encased delerium orb. Except to incant his magic, Xel'vohca no longer speaks and relies on telepathy to communicate.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Personality Trait.</strong><strong><em></em></strong> I communicate telepathically in strained and long-winded streams of consciousness, my mind constantly burdened with centuries of thoughts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Magic can do great things. Terrible things, but great things indeed. We must wield it with responsibility, but wield it we must.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong><strong><em></em></strong> I was there when the first warlocks made their ancient pacts. The burden of the original sin of magic rests upon me, and I will steward the inheritors of the arcane until the last sun goes out at the end of eternity. I think of all mages as my children, and the sorcerer-kings were my wayward sons and daughters. I cannot repeat those mistakes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><em></em> Though my undead heart no longer beats, it pains me to feed my phylactery and sustain myself. The memories of these stolen souls haunts me, so I only do so rarely. As a result, my body has greatly atrophied, and now I fear my mind is slipping into madness as well.\n</p>\n<p>Xel'vohca was both the first warlock and the first @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.bfh29vIEoGzI240e]. Far from an evil creature, Xel'vohca has spent thousands of years facing the consequences of the choices he made in life. He is older than recorded history, and was vizier to many of the sorcerer-kings, though he was unable to stop their tyranny. His existence has often been spent trying to make amends for the failures of his past, but this task grows ever harder as new conflicts arise. The destruction of Drakkenheim and the spread of delerium have posed a major challenge to Xel'vohca. Amongst the Directorate, Xel'vohca alone harbors grave doubts about whether using delerium is a good idea, but is the first to admit that he himself is deeply tempted by its power.</p>\n<p>Today, Xel'vohca keeps his tomb deep within a section of the Dungeons of Nox. This personal mausoleum has been his lair for thousands of years, and he is loath to give up the comforts of his long-established home. Many of the traps and monsters roaming the dungeons are Xel'vocha's designs to keep intrepid heroes out of his business — and far away from the more dangerous artifacts and creations of the sorcerer-kings, which Xel'vohca safeguards from the world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Reed</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/148-pg67-house-reed-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/148-pg67-house-reed-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>House Reed's ancestral home is the city of Gabriella's<br />Landing, the anchorage for the Sapphire Fleet. The house rose to prominence through shipbuilding, and while its warships and admirals are well known, the Reeds' true power are their mercantile fleet. After funding trading vessels which sail the Middle Sea for generations, House Reed has emerged as one of the wealthiest noble houses in the nation. However, that has not always translated into political influence — until recently.</p>\n<p>Delerium taken from Drakkenheim has increasingly found its way to many ports, and the forward-thinking Divine Matriarch has considered the possibility of the stones traveling far abroad through ocean trade. When Mercy V named Polonius Reed as Lord Regent, the head of the noble house quickly authorized Elyrian ships to engage in privateering. In particular, he encouraged Elyrian captains to target pirates and merchant vessels known to be dealing in delerium, and the coffers of the Faith help pay the bounties.</p>\n<h3>Lord Regent Polonius Reed</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.r3vkm5QcTHpVp87P] is the most prominent figure amongst the Elyrian nobility, and sits at the head of the Parliament of Lords. Though a distant second to the authority and influence of the Divine Matriarch, he nonetheless holds much sway over the military and economic decisions of the nation.</p>\n<p>Polonius is a burly man in his early sixties. The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc]{noble} has a round, full face with a thick beard and short black hair combed over his balding head. His shaggy eyebrows highlight his deep-set, dark brown eyes. He dresses in exquisite silk Elyrian jackets, complete with a frilled ruff, puffed sleeves, and gold filigree. He is a clever and persistent man who carries himself with an air of importance.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I relish in a good heated discussion. I find the skills of diplomacy and debate are best honed with an old-fashioned argument.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I can argue any point convincingly, regardless of its truth. Feelings are more powerful than facts when it comes to politics.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> Elyria needs strong leaders — such as myself — if it is to remain the greatest power in the continent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I am bull-headed when someone refuses to see my point, and refuse to admit I'm wrong. I must always have the last word in any argument.\n</p>\n<p>House Reed has strived for years to pave a clear path for one of their daughters to possibly become the next Divine Matriarch. Now, they have a promising prospect in the Lord Regent's daughter, High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed. Ophelia is currently attached to the Silver Order's deployment in Drakkenheim, and the Lord Regent hopes that should his daughter successfully aid in the purging of the city and bringing Lucretia Mathias to account, House Reed will be well positioned to take both the regency and the Divine Matriarchy in the years to come.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Eden</h2>\n<p>House Eden was once regarded as the most powerful family in Elyria. Over the past century, three separate Divine Matriarchs have been members of House Eden, at least a dozen High Flamekeepers, and two Lords Regents. If any has come close to establishing a new monarchical line in Elyria, it has been House Eden. However, their fortunes fell considerably after the assassination of Divine Matriarch Courage IX, who had been a scion of their household.</p>\n<p>Outwardly, the house holds deeply fundamentalist views regarding the Faith, and is zealous to the extreme. They believe their righteousness begets prosperity, and have used their position to funnel vast amounts of coin collected by the Faith into their family vaults. Their methods have never crossed the line of theft, however: instead, previous High Flamekeepers and Divine Matriarchs have openly gifted indulgences and land to the family as “blessings upon their faithful service” and other such contrivances. They use these funds to build lavish, castle-like cathedrals on their estates, filled with expensive art, sculpture, and gold decorations.</p>\n<h3>Claudia Eden</h3>\n<p>Claudia is a delicate @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] woman in her mid-fifties. She has sunken features and a small, narrow face framed by flowing silver hair. She often wears a wide-brimmed brightly-colored hat and matching dress. She adorns herself with pearls, rings, jewels, and other finery. She speaks with a soothing, honeyed voice and often carries an air of elegance and false kindness.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I present myself as a woman of importance, and speak from a position of power. One must know how to sound like a queen if one is to be treated as such.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> The House of Eden deserves to be the most powerful house in Elyria and so I represent it at all times as if it always has been, and always will be.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I must see the House of Eden rise to power again, and reclaim itself as the leading family of Elyria.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I am quick to denounce the sins of others, but will never examine my own actions.\n</p>\n<p>Claudia is desperately working on rebuilding her house's connections in Elyria. She would eventually like to see one of her daughters become Divine Matriarch, but none have mustered up the dedication and faith to become clerics of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.n9pJzTDsAwQxJVRl]. In moments of fragile faith, she contemplates other magical means to get back the power she craves. In the meantime, she is working diligently to manipulate her way back on to the Cabinet. She talks sweetly to everyone she meets, but is just as likely to scheme against them if it means putting her family's name in a position of greater power in Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Poe</h2>\n<p>When Esmeralda Poe became Mercy V, the youngest ever Divine Matriarch, it elevated House Poe to a position with recognition they had never believed possible. The father of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5], Balthazar Poe, had only just won a seat for his household on the Parliament of Lords, and had nearly bankrupt the house in the effort by impressing the Faith of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.n9pJzTDsAwQxJVRl] with great tithes and donations.</p>\n<p>After Balthazar Poe passed away four years ago, his eldest daughter, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.CWoozRR4mouoAsIR], took up his title and position.</p>\n<h3>Gwenavere Poe</h3>\n<p>Gwenavere is the older sister of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5]. She is a wispy @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] woman in her early fifties who often wears colorful gowns and opulent headdresses. She carries many symbols of the Sacred Flame at all times to present herself as a devout worshiper of the faith, though she could never muster up the patience and will to cast divine spells as a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]. She is exceptionally proud to have her sister as the Divine Matriarch, and everyone in Elyria knows it. She holds the title of her kin over everyone's head and uses it as a justification for her to be treated as though she were royalty.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I take every opportunity to mention my sister, her importance to the nation of Elyria, and in turn express my own importance.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Position, wealth, and power are all that matter in this world. If you can have your grip on all three there is nothing stopping you from achieving anything you want.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> It's wonderful that my sister is the Divine Matriarch, but it means that our family will need to fight all the harder to hold on to everything we've gained.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> Though I was raised to follow the Sacred Flame from a young age, I don't care for the religion. I find the whole matter boring and tedious.\n</p>\n<p>Gwenavere desires nothing more than to help maintain her family's newfound power, and grow her own importance within Elyria. She is a cunning and manipulative woman who will take any and every opportunity to undermine and deface anyone who speaks ill of the Divine Matriarch, and will use her public image to ruin anyone who attempts to get in the way of her family and their name.</p>\n<p>For all this, Mercy V does not get along well with her sister. The Divine Matriarch finds the way her sister flaunts her status arrogant and unpleasant, and Gwenavere herself finds her sister's great faith tiresome and overbearing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Elyrian Cabinet</h2>\n<p>These two lords occupy high office in the Parliament of Lords:</p>\n<h3>Secretary General Orlando Timmins</h3>\n<p>Earl Orlando Timmins is a slight @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq] man with gold-yellow skin, well-dressed in a black-and-white silk tunic. He wears a heavy leather satchel overflowing with paper records and ledgers, and carries the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.items.Item.ZfeLZHUilhXsVhYH].</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I am soft-spoken, polite, and analytical, so others often ignore me. I keep my records with meticulous detail; nothing is unaccounted.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong><em></em> I believe the Sacred Flame can lead us to progressive enlightenment, so long as our rulers do not keep us wallowing in the dark. We cannot forget how the Faith compels us to act with integrity and compassion in all things.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> There are few moderate and open-minded leaders amongst our nobility today. We need such people to reverse Elyria's slow slide into theocracy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I hesitate to speak my mind or tell others uncomfortable truths, as I fear their anger, scorn, or retribution. My fears often cloud my reason.\n</p>\n<p>The Secretary General is privy to all manner of sensitive information, so often the role is filled by a trustworthy and capable scion who lacks greater political ambitions. House Timmins is an Elyrian noble family known mostly for moneylending, but who have seldom been power-players in Elyria. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.r3vkm5QcTHpVp87P] choose Orlando Timmins for this reason, but is quickly growing tired of the Earl's honest work.</p>\n<h3>Grand Ambassador Beatrice Atwood</h3>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Ruler of Michael's Gate</em></p>\n<p>Duchess Beatrice Atwood is a human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] in her late twenties. She has dark brown hair done up in a bun at the back of her head. Her face is sharp and angular with a thin nose, pointed chin, pursed lips and narrow eyes. She often wears a long gray skirt, a white blouse, and a black overcoat. She is a stern negotiator and exceptionally clever. She often dresses for her role as grand Ambassador, opting for neutral tones and smart fashion rather than anything overbearing or ostentatious.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I am a forceful conversationalist and hardline negotiator. In an argument, I never let others get a word in edgewise. Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Elyria is the greatest nation in the world. Our foes are envious of our mighty nation, and often hypocrites who seek one-sided concessions from us at every turn.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I have two young children. Recently, I have noticed strange occurrences and happenings around my estates, and I'm greatly concerned they might be mageborn.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong><em></em> The other people of the world should think and act more like Elyrians, and we have little to learn from their faithless ways.\n</p>\n<p>Beatrice has ruled Michael's Gate for the past six years. Previously she was in training to become a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.JxXafxg0qnMZSHZH], and showed potential as both a cunning warrior, and clever diplomat. Now, with two young children to take care of, and the responsibility of ruling Michael's Gate, she has set aside her warrior days.</p>\n<p>Her new life of politics and leadership are no less fraught with conflict, however.</p>\n<p>Recently her two children have begun to cause strange sights and sounds around her home with no reasonable explanation. Beatrice is concerned they may be developing mageborn qualities. Terrified of facing this possibility, she has greatly ignored the signs and kept her concerns a secret. Unbeknownst to Duchess Atwood, the mages of the Amethyst Academy have already determined her toddlers are mageborn. Once they reach the age of six, the purple-robed mages will come to take them off to Paradox Castle.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/019-pg69-elyrian-cabinet-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Lord Regent Polonius Reed and Secretary General Orlando Timmins\" />\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Gold Coast</h2>\n<p>The Gold Coast rests along the eastern side of Elyria facing the Middle Sea, taking its name from the golden sands and beautiful sunrise that shines upon the waters in the early morning. It is regarded as the most hospitable area heading south towards the Witherbleach Desert. Several small cities and communities are spread along this coast, and many farming communities and spice mines occupy the rather arid landscape.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Crimson Coast</h2>\n<p>The Crimson Coast occupies the long western end of Elyria. The stunning red sunsets paint the waters in beautiful hues of pinks, oranges, and purples, and the entire coastline glows with red light that illuminates the hills and farmland like a wildfire.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Vita River</h2>\n<p>The Vita is the longest river in Elyria, which runs from Michael's Gate, through Lumen, and into the ocean. The river is the lifeblood of the otherwise arid lands in the shadow of the Drakeclaw Mountains. Most of the population of Elyria dwells within a few miles of its banks, which also functions as a prominent route for trade and travel from the east to the west of the nation. The river is one of the widest and longest in the whole continent, rivaled only by the Torvista river in Terene, the Woodrun River in the Eastern Vales, and the Drann River in Westemär. The rich blue water and freshwater fish are common traits of the large river. Several smaller streams feed the Vita from the runoff of the Drakeclaw Mountains and hydrate the land, allowing the lush fields and great farming communities that make up the heart of Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Hearthland Valley</h2>\n<p>The Hearthland is characterized by its fertile golden fields of grain and corn, which stretch along either side of the great Vita River. The Faith of the Sacred Flame speaks of these lands as the cradle of all civilization, as many believe the valley was the first settled land on the continent, and that all life sprang from the great river.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Southern Reach</h2>\n<p>The Southern Reaches encompass the furthest latitudes of the Elyrian peninsula, stretching along the southwestern edge of the continent. The Pale Tooth Mountains collect rainstorms blowing in from the ocean, and shield these lands from the harsh dry heat of the Witherbleach Desert, creating a lush tropical coastline. These idyllic lands have yellow sandy beaches, flowing rivers, humid forests, and large stretches of grassland. The many small towns speckled along the coast are known for having incredibly beautiful ocean-facing villas, enchanting beaches, and warm weather year-round.</p>\n<p>About a million people live in the Southern Reach — almost all are human with small amounts of dwarves, elves, arcane ancestries, and smallfolk.</p>\n<p>The Southern Reaches are the frontier of Elyria. Ostensibly, Elyria makes claim to the whole region as part of the Elyrian nation; but in fact, the Southern Reaches are wholly independent of Elyria. Separated by the desert and mountains, Elyrian forces face the same geographical problems controlling this region as the sorcerer-kings of old. While a great deal of trade and travel does occur, the people here owe no fealty or obligation to Elyria.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the people of the Southern Reaches have close cultural ties to their neighbors, and many try to ingratiate themselves with Elyrian politics and society. However, the region has deep traditions associated with the worship of the Old Gods Lugh, Nuada, Danu, and Gaibhne — deities with overlapping portfolios and occasionally similar rites to the Faith of the Sacred Flame. As such, when the Faith of the Sacred Flame spread into this region, several hybrid faiths emerged which combined the teachings of Saint Tarna, the ideals of the Sacred Flame, and the myths and legends of the Old Gods.</p>\n<p>The strange mix of beliefs in the Southern Reaches has often raised the concern and ire of the Divine Matriarchs of the Sacred Flame, as these practices and theologies are considered deeply heretical to the mainstream clergy. Some have even branded the priests and monks of the Temple of the Sun as cultists worshiping forbidden gods and plotting against the Faith.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Witherbleach Desert</h2>\n<p>The Witherbleach Desert spans south of the Hearthland all the way to the Pale Tooth Mountains and makes up a majority of the landscape of Elyria.</p>\n<p>The rocky desert is largely flat, and is made up of white cracked earth for miles in all directions. Small plants and occasional trees grow from the ground, but they are all pale and bleach white, like frail bony hands jutting out of the earth. Even more consistent are the sun-bleached bones of various animals, and occasionally people, who have not survived the harsh desert landscape. Vents of sulfur spew out from the cracked earth in some places, and oil pools occasionally form on the surface. The fumes from the oil and sulfur cause the entire desert to have an acrid, unsettling smell. Occasional clusters of rocky white chalk hills offer some shelter, and sometimes house small cave systems with underground aquifers. Many of these are inhabited by strange and dangerous desert creatures.</p>\n<p>There are no Elyrian cities within the desert itself, and is deemed by most to be inhospitable. This is not so, however. Generations of nomads have thrived in the dry desert, carving out their own way of life. Among them is a circle of Druids of Lugh, but no one is exactly sure where specifically they call home.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, devout worshipers of the Sacred Flame will make a pilgrimage across the desert. They follow the footsteps of Saint Tarna by heading towards the Pale Tooth Mountains. Few return from these pilgrimages.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Pale Tooth Mountains</h2>\n<p>The Pale Tooth are a long ridge of tall, steep, white mountains, filled with abundant chalky limestone deposits, which paint the mountainsides a pale hue. Many of them are so steep that it is nearly a sheer cliff to reach the summit, where many mountains end in flat plateaus. From a distance, the mountains appear to many as a row of crooked white teeth jutting out of the sands of the desert.</p>\n<p>Deep within mountains is said to be the place where Saint Tarna met the archangels Michael and Gabriella. There, the great warrior swore a sacred oath and became the First Paladin. However, none since Saint Tarna herself have found this sacred place.</p>\n<p>Today, the range of mountains is home to several dragons, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SOin81NWijHRvXFK]{stone giants}, and several independent communities based around the worship of Danu, Gaibhne, Nuada, Shegorach, and many of the other Old Gods.</p>\n<h3>Opularis the Wise</h3>\n<p>Greatest among the dragons of the Pale Tooth Mountains is @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.2tQ3PzGOgtptN4Ze], an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SNT0JNVSngUTsj4m]. The scholarly dragon keeps a great library within the ruins of an ancient monastery. They are said to be the most welcoming of all the known dragons of the continent. Several grandmaster wizards of the Amethyst Academy meet Opularis for games of chess and afternoon tea, and once every century, the dragon takes on a mortal apprentice.</p>\n<p>However, Academy professors are quick to warn headstrong pupils about seeking the dragon's mentorship: Opularis does not teach amateurs, beginners, or raw talents. The dragon has been known to slay any would-be student who cannot impress them by casting three different spells of 6th level or higher.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/061-pg70-opularis-the-wise-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Opularis the Wise\" />\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lumen</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of Elyria</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 250,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Divine Matriarch Mercy V</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Holy City of the Faith of the Sacred Flame</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>The shining metropolis of Lumen stands like a beacon in the night. Travelers from miles away can see the glimmering light of Lumen like a flaming beacon on the horizon. The glow ignites the faith in the hearts of travelers. The central cathedral of Saint Tarna stands above the smaller chapels and shrines which spring from amongst the tightly-packed streets. Incense and woodsmoke waft through the stone streets while the constant melody of hymns and chanting echoes throughout the city.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>Lumen is the capital of Elyria, and the holy city for the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Drinking deep from the waters of the Vita River, the teeming city is one of the largest cities on the continent. All throughout the bustling streets of sandstone buildings the smell of incense and woodsmoke drifts through the air. Chants, hymns, and bells fill the city at all hours of the day and night as throngs of devoted worshipers of the Sacred Flame fill the countless chapels and cathedrals, carrying out acts of prayer and worship. The sacred chapel fires remain alight continuously and every street is generously illuminated by lampposts. The city glows like a beacon in the darkness.</p>\n<p>The people of Lumen have grown accustomed to the brightness, and many work from dusk to dawn. There are many superstitions surrounding putting out the lights in Lumen; every room of every building is constantly lit through the night.</p>\n<p>As the holy city for the Faith of the Sacred Flame, Lumen is the greatest destination for pilgrimage in the known world. Many devout worshipers of the Sacred Flame plan on making at least one journey to the holy city during their lifetimes. As a result, the city is bursting with foreign travelers from around the globe, all united by their faith in the light. There are countless inns and hostels in the city, catering to pilgrims both princely and penniless.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Saint Tarna's Cathedral.</em></strong> Lumen has countless chapels to the Sacred Flame, but all are dwarfed by the majesty and splendor of Saint Tarna's Cathedral. The massive spired golden dome rises on a high bluff over the city, and features an immaculate decorated facade with marble statuary. Inside, it is painted floor-to-ceiling with frescoes and tall arch windows set with stained glass murals depicting Tarna's life and deeds. Thousands of worshipers can gather in the colossal building, all standing around the great altar whereupon is set a tremendous everburning bonfire. The impressive catacombs and reliquary house many of the great relics of Saint Tarna herself, though not a single one of her bones.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Matriarchal Palace.</em></strong> Off the same plaza as Saint Tarna's Cathedral is a sprawling monastery complex where hundreds of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolytes}s, and other clergy dwell and carry out the administrative work of the Faith. The most important resident is the Divine Matriarch herself, so powerful wards protect the palace and an elite detachment of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.JxXafxg0qnMZSHZH]{Silver Order Paladins} patrol the grounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Violet Embassy.</em></strong> This small manor near the Matriarchal Palace is one of the few strongholds of the Amethyst Academy. Officially, the property is leased to the Academy by the Faith. Here, a few liaisons from the Amethyst Academy Directorate are posted to confer with Elyrian diplomats and provide arcane magical services.\n</p>\n<p>Both the Directorate and the Divine Matriarch protect themselves with such potent magical wards that it often impairs their ability to contact one another via magic. While the mages here think their role quite important, the truth is the opposite. The Directorate and the Divine Matriarch try to avoid talking to each other unless absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Dungeons of Nox.</em></strong> The lasting legacy of the sorcerer-kings runs deep into the earth. Once, Lumen was known by another name: Nox, City of Night, the ancient capital of the Arcane Empire. Indeed, the Matriarchal Palace is built upon the foundations of the grand palace of Sorcerer-Queen Nahmar, and Saint Tarna's Cathedral stands atop the place where the Spire of Nox once stood.\n</p>\n<p>Beneath the catacombs and sewers of Lumen, the holy city is built upon the dungeon of the sorcerer-kings. All manner of blasphemous chambers filled with dark magics remain buried within to this day, for the sorcerer-kings had many secrets.</p>\n<p>From time to time, one of these forgotten tombs bursts open, allowing a horror from a bygone age to creep up into the streets of Lumen. This is why the streets are always lit: to give such monsters no place to hide. Even the smallest shadow, a tiny blot of inky darkness is enough place for such demons to dwell.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Gabriella's Landing</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 48,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Lord Polonius Reed</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Great Shipyard of the Elyrian Navy</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>Gabriella's Landing stretches far into the Middle Sea on wooden docks and stilts along the bays. The northern stretch is made up of lavish manors with large balconies and winding staircases all overlooking the crystal waters. The harbor below caters to the constant flow of trade ships and fishing boats coming and going from the city, and houses a massive fleet of Elyrian warships with azure sails known as the Sapphire Fleet. The city smells of sand and the sea, while the warm climate and sandy streets cause billows of dust to blow through the sandstone buildings and through the bustling fresh market.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>As the southernmost major city in Elyria, Gabriella's Landing is one of the most arid cities in the nation. Found along the banks of a small river that feeds into the Middle Sea, Gabriella's Landing is an essential hub for sea trade. A third of the city is built on piers and docks stretching out into the sea. Warehouses, trade ships, mills, and shops fill the lower harbor. The bustling city is made up of flat-roofed sandstone houses with open balconies and windows. The dusty streets below are filled with constant movement.</p>\n<p>The steep coastline north of the great sprawling docks and watermills is made up of several noble houses. Here, winding stairs connect the closely-packed estates, separated by lavish balconies and gardens looking out over the Middle Sea. The Reed Estate sits at the end on a small peninsula and has a stunning view of the entire city.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Sapphire Shipyard.</em></strong> The fortified cradle of the Elyrian Navy, this sophisticated complex of drydocks, armories, workshops, and warehouses is an industrial marvel. An ingenious system of interconnected canals forms an assembly line to build new vessels in stages by specialized shipbuilders: nearly a hundred ships are being constructed, overhauled, or repaired at any given time. The operation is overseen by House Reed, who brag the Sapphire Shipyard launches more new ships to sea in a month than Liberio's harbor can build in a year. The shipyard employs nearly a quarter of the adults living in Gabriella's Landing. However, Lord Polonius Reed goes to great lengths to downplay the fact that the harbor was designed by commissioning the mages of the Amethyst Academy, and must regularly purchase replacement components for the main assembly line machinery from them.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Lucant's Vigil</h2>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 20,000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Claudia Eden</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Monuments to Saint Tarna, Farming, Ocean Trade</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>A colossal granite statue of Saint Tarna stands where the Vita River empties into a cliff-ringed bay at the ocean's edge.

The city is made up of small stone buildings with a moderate port side market. Just outside the city proper are sprawling farmlands where hundreds of farms bring in produce and meats.</p>\n<p>The city is known for a great 200-foot-tall statue of Saint Tarna clutching her shimmering blade high in the air.

The secretive guests at this place are usually red-robed figures sporting lavish jewelry and bearing arcane implements. Their faces are painted with vibrant markings, and they have bizarre hairstyles such as mohawks, spikes, and top-knots.

The lands of Elyria are filled with dangerous deserts, political intrigue, and interesting locations to be explored by adventurers. A campaign in Elyria might explore themes such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Aiding the Divine Matriarch in acts of faith or holy quests.</li>\n  <li>Defending Michael's Gate from foreign invasion.</li>\n  <li>Traversing the Witherbleach Desert to follow the path of Saint Tarna.</li>\n  <li>Protecting trade ships from Gabriella's Landing from pirates of the Middle Sea.</li>\n  <li>Meeting the great dragon Opularis the Wise.</li>\n  <li>Exploring the Dungeons of Nox beneath Lumen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Adventure Hooks</h2>\n<p>Below are some specific adventures that might occur around Elyria to use as small quests, or expand into entire campaigns.</p>\n<h3>Lights Out</h3>\n<p>Recently, an irreverent wizard of the Amethyst Academy, visiting the city of Lumen as an envoy, was trying to get a good night's sleep amidst the city's endless bright lights. The wizard foolishly shrouded the windows of their room using a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.S7VbUetIfVT7B6Eq] spell, blocking out the light of Lumen. Unfortunately, their chambers harbored secret tunnels to the Dungeons of Nox. In the dark of night, a demonic spirit has possessed the wizard. Now the contaminated mage is plunging deep in the dungeons below Lumen, releasing more horrors into the holy city. Who knows what horrific creations of the sorcerer-kings they have unleashed?</p>\n<h3>Tarna's Footsteps</h3>\n<p>Hoping to heal the schism between the Falling Fire and the Sacred Flame, a devoted @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] wants to make a pilgrimage to the Pale Tooth Mountains in search of the place where Saint Tarna met the legendary Archangels. Many have attempted this throughout history, but none have been successful. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] has received a vision that they think will guide them. The Flamekeeper could be an NPC or a player themselves.</p>\n<h3>Quench the Flame</h3>\n<p>The political situation on the continent has reached a boiling point. Unable to negotiate with the self-righteous Divine Matriarch Mercy V, the player characters are drawn into a grand conspiracy to assassinate her. Their co-conspirators could include the Amethyst Academy, who seek to use the opportunity to weaken the Edicts of Lumen; members of the Elyrian nobility, who hope to free their nation from the clutches of theocracy; or even the Followers of the Falling Fire, who believe the death of the Divine Matriarch will be the shock which spurs others to take up their faith instead. However, to avoid causing a continent-spanning war in the aftermath, they'll need to pin the blame on a rival faction in the process… and make sure they have positioned an appropriate candidate to occupy the office afterwards!</p>\n<h3>Mage Hunt</h3>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy approaches the player characters with information that they have divined the location of several mageborn children in Elyria. With the recent turmoil coming out of Drakkenheim, mageborn are facing greater suspicion in Elyria, and Academy mages are unwelcome in many parts of Elyria. The Amethyst Academy needs the player characters to locate these mageborn children and bring them back to the Academy under the right of guardianship of the Edicts of Lumen.</p>\n<p>During the adventure, one of the families will be heartbroken by the news, and will do everything they can to keep their child. Another family will be horrified, and will do everything they can to murder their child.</p>\n<h3>Class in Session</h3>\n<p>The great blue dragon Opularis is taking on new mageborn students. Seeking to be those pupils, the player characters travel to the lair of Opularis hidden somewhere in the Pale Tooth Mountains. Though they might not be able to impress the dragon with their magic, the dragon decides not to slay them. Opularis instead offers them three tasks to prove themselves worthy of their teachings — but if they fail, the dragon will devour them. The tasks often include slaying one of Opularis's great enemies, finding a unique magic item worthy of his horde from the Isles of Skye, and obtaining a lost spellbook the dragon loaned to a member of the Academy Directorate.</p>\n<h3>Congregation of Conspiracy</h3>\n<p>The player characters are swept up in the convergence of faith and politics that define Elyria. They might be members of the clergy, knights of the Silver Order, or the vassals of Elyrian nobility. Regardless, their goal is to secure the offices of both the Divine Matriarch and the Lord Regent, so they can decide the destiny of Elyria.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Rumors</h2>\n<p>These rumors might help spur creative quests and goals for your party to explore.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The druids of the Witherbleach Desert know of a secret dwarven treasure vault buried in the Pale Tooth Mountains.</li>\n  <li>They say on some nights angels visit the statue of Saint Tarna in Lucant's Vigil.</li>\n  <li>Gabriella's Landing is actually completely run by pirates.</li>\n  <li>Lucant's Vigil has been dealing with delerium from Drannsmund and people are starting to fall ill.</li>\n  <li>There is an entrance to the Dungeons of Nox from one of the taverns in Lumen, and many of the patrons are members of a cult of Nox.</li>\n  <li>The scavengers in the eastern end of the desert were once clerics of the Sacred Flame who were banished when they discovered a blasphemous truth.</li>\n  <li>Visitors to the city of Lumen are warned that it is bad luck to try to block out the Light of Lumen — even if you're trying to get a good night's sleep!</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/03-dd-dcgd-lumen-city-map-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Lumen Map\" />"

Their culture and politics drive their prideful scions to seek adventure throughout the world, and meddle endlessly in the affairs of other nations. Every nation on the continent has warred against Caspia at least once in their history, and every Caspian house had gone to war with each other countless times. However, since becoming a united realm, Caspia has never fallen to foreign invasion, and in spite of these numerous conflicts, the realm has remained remarkably stable over the years thanks to its unique succession rules.</p>\n<p>Every decade, the six Great Houses elect a reigning monarch via a contest known as the Kingsmoot. This important tradition decides the High King of Caspia. Over the past thirty years, the prominent House Joplin has consistently won the Kingsmoot, and High King Venus Joplin has enjoyed a long rule. Yet, as the next Kingsmoot nears, the other Great Houses scheme and plan to unseat House Joplin and establish their own family as the ruling dynasty.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Overview</h1>\n<p>Extending along the eastern coast of the Middle Sea, Caspia is a subtropical land where wild grass and foliage cling to wide red rocky knolls. The dry plains are speckled with column-like rock formations and bordered by large spanning mountain ranges in the north. The climate of Caspia ranges from arid to humid. The northern cusp of Caspia is home to decent farmland for ranches and vineyards, and the semitropical coastal regions to the south are a rich source of fine spices such as cloves, pepper, and saffron. There are only a few large forests, which include pine and spruce in the north but more tropical species emerge in the south. Many Caspian towns tend vast orchards of either fruit or citrus depending on their latitudes. During antiquity, Caspia was a rich source of tin and home to many bronzeworkers. Today, Caspia must import most of its iron and steel.</p>\n<p>The most populated cities are sprawling places filled with single-story limestone abodes. Caspia is frequently rocked by tremors and earthquakes, so only the castles and keeps of the most prominent houses reach a second or third story. Traveling south, the center of Caspia leads to more barren landscapes and rocky badlands, and the famous Caspian Canyon until making its way to the tropical jungles to the south.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Population</h2>\n<p>Amongst the three great powers of the continent, Caspia is the most sparsely populated, with only 5 million people living within its borders. Most dwell in the coastal regions along the Middle Sea or towards the northwestern regions which border Elyria and Westemär.</p>\n<p>Caspia is comprised mostly of humans, who make up all of the six Great Houses of its nobility. However, several halfling communities exist along the northern area between the Glimmer Mountains and the Rust Edge Mountains. Dwarves from the Glimmer Mountains commonly travel through Caspia, and half-elves and tieflings make their homes in most port cities. Uncommon folk with anthropomorphic lineages dwell mostly towards the southern borders with Terene and Orleone.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Capital</h2>\n<p>Caspia does not have a true capital city — the seat of power lies at the Tower of Swords. There, the High King of Caspia holds court, and the Kingsmoot meets here to choose the next ruler.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Government</h2>\n<p>Six Great Houses rule Caspia. The head of each household holds the title of Prince-Elector, and all their heirs style themselves as princes or princesses. Each household has complete authority over the laws and jurisdiction of their individual lands. These six houses are in fact each distantly related, for all descend from the six children of Rex Caspian, founder of the nation. As fitting for a nation ruled by headstrong siblings, these factious nobles have long struggled to form a united government, and often make war against each other for frivolous reasons. A tradition known as the Kingsmoot was established as a means to end the petty warring between the six major houses of Caspia by choosing a High King to mediate disputes between the houses, make the final decision on any matter affecting the nation as a whole, and wear the<em> Crown of Caspia</em>.</p>\n<p>The Kingsmoot is both an election and a competition. By custom and law, it is held no later than ten years to the day after the coronation of the most recent High King, or should the High King die in office, immediately after their funeral. One candidate for the throne is put forward by each of the six Great Houses, and the reigning High King must abdicate the throne to the winner of the contest. However, the current High King can retain the throne if they are both chosen to represent their own house again and their House wins the Kingsmoot</p>\n<p>Each of the six Great Houses may submit two votes in the Kingsmoot. One vote is discretionary, but the households cannot vote for their own candidate. The other vote is decided by each household making a bet or challenge placed at the conclusion of the previous Kingsmoot. These challenges represent a goal each house can strive towards over the next decade, although most commonly, the houses will issue a challenge they might have the upper hand accomplishing to secure a guaranteed vote for themselves. Traditional challenges include assembling the largest military force, procuring the most treasure, securing the strongest foreign alliances through marriage, building the greatest castle, wielding the finest magical weapons, having the most impressive muscles, and slaying the most dragons or other notable monsters.</p>\n<p>A household must win a plurality of votes to win the Kingsmoot. While smaller houses of notable renown within Caspia may compete, they are not permitted to vote. As such, the Kingsmoot has always been won by a Great House. Given that only twelve votes are cast, two-way and three-way ties are extremely common. In this case, a Caspian duel decides the next High King. Under the terms of the duel, each candidate chooses four retainers to accompany them on a quest. Each candidate has one week to seek out and slay the largest and most terrible monster they can find, and return with a trophy. The other houses then decide which candidate has made the most impressive kill, and declare them High King.</p>\n<p>House Joplin are great dragonslayers, and they most often use this skill to win tiebreakers. This tactic has made them the winner of 17 of the 34 Kingsmoots.</p>\n<p>The current High King of Caspia is Venus Joplin II, who has been the reigning monarch for the last three decades.</p>\n<h3>Noble Ranks</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>High King.</em></strong> The monarch of Caspia. This title is used regardless of gender.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Prince-Elector or Princess-Elector.</em></strong> The elder of a Great House, given the right to cast a vote or issue a challenge during the Kingsmoot. Only six individuals hold this title in Caspia, and each bear one of the<em> Six Swords of Caspia</em>.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Prince and Princess.</em></strong> This title is used by both scions and direct family members of the Great Houses.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong><em>Marquis or Marquess.</em></strong> The rank held by landed noble families who may submit a candidate to the Kingsmoot, but who cannot vote in the contest. All are vassals of one of the six Great Houses.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Royal Council</h3>\n<p>Once the Kingsmoot is over, the High King must receive five envoys from each of the noble houses to act on their council to help manage the realm, but can then appoint as many other nobles to their council as they wish. The High King can invent any office or title for these councilors as suits their whims. While many High Kings establish a Master of War or an Admiral of Ships, other administrative functions are assigned more haphazardly to niche roles, such as the Potions Inspector General or the Lord Commander of Field Sports. As a result, the High Kings of Caspia are known to assemble massive entourages, making the court a rowdy place of nobles gathered from across the nation.</p>\n<p>The Kingsmoot is administered and overseen by representatives of the Amethyst Academy and the Faith of the Sacred Flame to ensure legitimacy, fair dealing, and sportsmanlike conduct in the proceedings. The gnomish @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6] @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.rJ05Zzvm3G17rQjX] and the human @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.SKQBy61pf7d1N7ww] are the current Kingsmoot administrators.</p>\n<p>Each representative also joins the Caspian Royal Council. As a member of the Amethyst Academy Directorate, Marigold has held her current position since the Kingsmoot was established, and the event is one of the few times the otherwise elusive figure makes a public appearance. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.SKQBy61pf7d1N7ww] has been recently elected from House Jones of Caspia after spending twelve years abroad in Elyria training under the Divine Matriarch.</p>\n<h3>Seals of Caspia</h3>\n<p>The Edicts of Lumen prompted the Caspian Houses to organize the Kingsmoot to decide who would wear the<em> Crown of Caspia</em> gifted to them. As such, the Seals of Caspia are six swords and a crown. Each of the Great Houses holds one of the swords, which are unsheathed in the coronation ritual of the High King. The High King usually wields both the sword of their house, and wears the<em> Crown of Caspia</em>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“My dear partner Pluto once compared the Drakkenheim crater to the Caspian Canyon saying it wasn't as impressive. Sounds like a typical Caspian answer to basically anything if you ask me.”</blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Religion</h2>\n<p>Caspians are known as a largely irreverent people. Nevertheless, the Faith of the Sacred Flame is the most common religion throughout Caspia. Though Caspian dedication to the Sacred Flame is less than that of Westemär and very much Elyria, most major cities house a chapel or cathedral to the Faith. Devout noblewomen often travel to Elyria to train as a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers}, many Caspians see this as another possible avenue to add clout and renown to their house's name.</p>\n<p>Caspians tend to think of the Old Gods as ghost stories, and many Caspians speak of them as if they were demons or evil monsters. One Caspian legend claims that great heroes of House Jackson, Joplin, and Jones fought against and slew Kromac, Nodens, and Morrigan, which caused the Old Gods to run away from Caspia in fear of meeting the same fate. These Caspians are heroes in old tales used to impress upon young Caspian children the importance of strength and courage. Many point out, correctly, that the timeline given by these tales makes no sense, as the Caspian houses today did not exist at the time when the stories are said to occur. Facts often make for boring stories, however.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Military</h2>\n<p>Each notable house of Caspia has its own army. The size of these forces, their fighting styles, and equipment differ from house to house. Nevertheless, each Great House boasts about their soldiers and what they deem to be most valuable. The combined might of Caspia far outstrips the militaries of any other nation. However, this apparent strength is counterbalanced by the uncooperative nature of the Great Houses themselves. Still, when Caspia has faced invasion from Westemär, Elyria, or Terene, the Great Houses' armies have readily united and have proven to be an incredibly resilient and unstoppable force. The competitive nature of the Caspian Houses has also encouraged diversification amongst the household armies to cover a wide range of martial doctrines, as each house wants to be different from the others, and train their armies to be the best at something the others are not.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Magic</h2>\n<p>By tradition, a court mage of the Amethyst Academy serves each of the Great Houses. However, the Amethyst Academy does not have a major stronghold in Caspia, instead operating through a variety of outposts or traveling from the Enigma Ziggurat in the neighboring city-state of Liberio.</p>\n<p>Caspians are fascinated with art and music, and love when bards tell stories and sing songs of their deeds. Noble houses often recruit a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.R3nChOQBH2LSU2NY]{minstrel} or herald, and it is a mark of prestige to have a bard with true magical talents on your household staff.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trade</h2>\n<p>Geographically, Caspia lies in the center of the Continent along the Middle Sea, and as such the nation is the crossroads for international trade. Goods flow through Caspia from Elyria and Westemär to Terene and Orleone, and Caspian spices are often used as a medium of exchange for cargo passing between these places. Such trade progresses by both land and sea, as most of the Six Great Houses make their estates on coastal ports.</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Exports:</strong> Tin, bronze, spices, wines</p>\n<p><strong>Principal Imports:</strong> Iron, steel, coal, silk, textiles.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">History</h1>\n<p>Like their neighboring nations, the lands of Caspia were once part of the sorcerer-kings' Arcane Empire for hundreds of years. When the arcane tyrants' rule ended, the now-free settlements along the coast of the Middle Sea became a collection of squabbling city-states. Each controlled a small patch of land or a network of smaller towns, and a few became military powers in their own right.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Founding of Caspia</h2>\n<p>After the fall of the sorcerer-kings, countless wars were fought for control of modern-day Caspia. Few would-be conquerors could secure the entire region until a powerful warlord known as Kristoff Karn brought the Eastern Vales under his rule. Not content to claim that region alone, Karn moved south to invade the lands around the Middle Sea.</p>\n<p>He met his match in the mighty Rex Caspian. Although this renowned warrior did not have any noble ancestry, he united the city-states of the Middle Sea to fend off Karn's armies. After years of war, Karn's resources and troops were exhausted, and the two warlords met to negotiate a truce. The men had not met personally before, but inexplicably came away from their parley as friends, seeing much of themselves in one another. They agreed to lay down their arms and recognized the sovereignty of each other's lands.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Six Houses</h2>\n<p>Although infamous for his promiscuity and countless partners, Rex Caspian married Cordelia Karn. The two sired six children: Jackson, Jones, Joplin, John, Jagger, and Joyce. Rex ruled over his kingdom for many years, until during a sporting display he rashly decided to wrestle a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.nZthq6WHLhcdu3te] with his bare hands. The old king was turned to stone while holding the beast in a headlock. The petrified body of Rex Caspian still stands as a statue in the center of the Rex Colosseum, clutching the gorgon in place. Though mages and apothecaries offered to reverse the curse many times, Rex Caspian's six children instead decided to let their father remain as a “glorious symbol” while they promptly divided his kingdom amongst themselves. Each formed one of the six houses of Caspia, fracturing their father's empire into six warring kingdoms.</p>\n<p>The decision to leave their father as a stone statue and go their separate ways was the last thing all six of Rex Caspian's children could ever agree upon, and their descendants carried this rich tradition onward for generations. The houses would go to war to prove they had a better army, stronger knights, or any reason imaginable. Occasionally, the houses collaborated but quickly fell back to sibling-like infighting. During the renowned Battle of Skulls, House Jones and House Joyce united to defeat a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.K4vsSlHqbBAHUDHY] that was tormenting the outskirts of their lands. Upon defeating the hydra, both houses wanted to adorn their throne with the skulls of the beast, but could not agree which house would get five skulls, and which would get four. Appropriately, the resulting war lasted nine years.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Establishing the Kingsmoot</h2>\n<p>The Caspian houses were deeply divided over the place of magic in their laws and realms during the Mage Wars. When Divine Matriarch Humility III called each of the Great Houses to negotiate the Edicts of Lumen, another war almost started over which house would represent the nation of Caspia as a whole. It was only prevented by the suggestion from the newly-formed Academy Directorate that all the higher nobles of each nation could attend the summit and sign the treaty.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the fact that Caspia was simultaneously a singular and divided nation was a vexing problem during the peace talks, as the Faith of the Sacred Flame and the Amethyst Academy planned to offer each realm a magical crown as a gesture of goodwill. The clerics and wizards of the time knew it would be foolish to give each of the Caspian Houses their own crown, especially ones which could grant them a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]. Instead, they forged six mighty blades, one for each House, and a single crown, which they announced could be worn by whoever was the singular inheritor of Rex Caspian's legacy — so long as the matter could be decided peacefully within ten years.</p>\n<p>Naturally, with their usual solution of making war on one another off the table, the Caspians were unable to decide upon who should wear the crown. Each house presented their case for their house ruling over Caspia as a whole. The Jacksons argued that since they had recently slain a gang of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ZHAFrnCwCz17dmLc]{trolls} that were stealing livestock, that their house deserved the crown. House Jones argued that their military was the largest and strongest. House John argued their castle was the largest and most well decorated. Each house put forward their case, and in challenging one another to meet the prestige of their own deeds, the Caspians found their way. They each agreed to issue a challenge to all the others, and whichever house won the most challenges would become High King for the next decade. Arcturus Jagger became the first to claim the crown as the High King of Caspia, and the Kingsmoot was born.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">War of the Sword</h2>\n<p>There was once a Caspian prince who was also a famous bard, Prince-Elector Oberon Joplin. This warrior-poet was a peerless swordsman, perhaps the greatest duelist of the age in any continental style. Oberon was also known for his outstanding performances and even possessed magical talents, though he was not mageborn. In the year 971, the well-loved Caspian prince won the Kingsmoot and was to be crowned High King of Caspia. However, this was met with great opposition from the Faith of the Sacred Flame and many nobles in Westemär and Elyria, who claimed the man's magical abilities were irrefutable evidence that he was mageborn.</p>\n<p>Under the Edicts of Lumen, Divine Matriarch Temperance IV invoked the Articles of Umbrage to call the High King to trial in Lumen. Prior to the final judgment, rumors spread amongst the Elyrian nobility the scheme was an elaborate ruse by the Academy to seat a mageborn on a royal throne. As a result, the assembled nobles and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{Flamekeepers} rejected the testimony from the Academy Directorate, which claimed Oberon was not mageborn. The Divine Matriarch proclaimed that House Joplin must disinherit Oberon and renounce the throne. Oberon refused, and the Great Houses stood united behind their king and stormed back to Caspia.</p>\n<p>The continent braced for war, but in a last-ditch attempt at peace, a year later an Elyrian delegation visited the High King led by the High Paladin of the Silver Order at the time, Miranda Crake. Unfortunately, a fierce row broke out during the talks, and Oberon Joplin challenged Miranda Crake to a duel. The fight would be his last. The High King died at the feet of the High Paladin.</p>\n<p>House Joplin reacted with rage to the death of their liege, and diplomatic relations spiraled out of control. The result was the War of the Sword, which raged for twenty years. The war was characterized by duels between Elyrian knights and Caspian Princes. The war raged on until the death of Divine Matriarch Temperance IV, when a Caspian Flamekeeper, Ganymede Joyce, was chosen as her successor and became Divine Matriarch Charity VII.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/caspian-warriors-final-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Factions and Figures</h1>\n<p>Some of Caspia's prominent groups and figures include:</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Joplin</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/154-house-joplin-heraldry-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/154-house-joplin-heraldry-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>House Joplin is considered the foremost amongst the Great Houses, having won the Kingsmoot seventeen times since it was established. The head of the household, Venus Joplin II, sits upon the throne in the Tower of Swords as the High King. She has ruled in this position for over thirty years, while the Joplin estates are looked after by her daughter, Magellan Joplin. They proudly boast the largest army, featuring large regiments of halberd wielding infantry. Their tactical combat acumen and polearm mastery is unmatched throughout Caspia.</p>\n<h3>High King Venus Joplin II</h3>\n<p><strong>Venus Joplin</strong> is an imposing woman in her late fifties. She has broad shoulders, a square face with defined features, and black pixie cut hair. She has almond shaped brown eyes and narrow lips. She wears a thick breastplate with open arms to accentuate her muscular strength. Her cape is emblazoned with the crest of her house, and she wears a circlet with a single sapphire gem placed in the center.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I let my actions speak for me, and am a woman of few words. I know my house's worth, and I treat each Caspian as their house demands. Which means some I speak to as equals, and some I speak to as inferiors. Mostly inferiors.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I am always the strongest and bravest person in the room. To say you are a great warrior is one thing, to be one takes guts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> House Joplin is the strongest Caspian house; the evidence is in the history books. I will hold the title of High King until I die, and on that day, my daughter will take my place.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I do not care for the petty squabbles of my fellow houses. I am rude and demeaning to the other Caspian Houses when I feel they are not living up to my expectations of what a Caspian house should be, which is basically always.\n</p>\n<p>Venus has held tightly to the role of High King for nearly three decades, and does not plan on relinquishing her title at the next Kingsmoot. Although she is well-loved by her people, and spoken of highly in tales and songs of her incredible victories, great monster hunts, and amazing arena duels, the other houses often dislike her, or are intimidated by her. She often enjoys this fact and revels in being the greatest Caspian warrior since Rex himself.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Jackson</h2>\n<p>House Jackson rules their domain from the port city of Jackson's Keep. They are renowned as great monster slayers and take pride in the many trophies collected by their scions. The current head of the household is @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.WW7N5lqY7azWsXFi]. His children, Pluto and Eris, are both renowned warriors and Sol pushes them to perform great heroic deeds in hopes of winning votes for the upcoming Kingsmoot. Sol has even sent his son Pluto to the city of Drakkenheim in Westemär in hopes of having house Jackson be at the heart of resolving the conflicts and issues of the fractured nation.</p>\n<p>House Jackson is the only house to have never won a single Kingsmoot, and they are the laughing stock of the other houses as a result. Sol is determined to be the first Jackson to take the position as High King of Caspia. Nevertheless, House Jackson has a capable army skilled in swordplay and javelin-throwing.</p>\n<h3>Prince-Elector Sol Jackson</h3>\n<p>Sol is a ninety-year-old barrel-chested @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.OcJoakgBoM6FdYTj] who is almost always wearing his shining decorated armor. He wears a red cape with several small motifs of his family's crest upon it, and he sports a great white beard and slicked back hair. He is tall and muscular, sporting an envious physique for a man half his age. He speaks in a booming voice, and often spouts tales of glorious battle and exaggerated monster hunts.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I take every opportunity to speak of my great deeds and the deeds of my house. People need to know that although the Jacksons have yet to win a Kingsmoot, we are still one of the strongest houses in Caspia.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Every Jackson needs to know three things: how to swing a sword, when to swing a sword, and how to tell everyone how good you are at swinging a sword.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My family is important to me. I push them to do great deeds to achieve glory for our house.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I often talk over people and completely ignore what they say. I much prefer the sound of my own voice anyways.\n</p>\n<p>Sol is a boisterous and proud man who will never say a bad thing about his house or his family. He spends most of his time bragging about their deeds and ensuring everyone around him knows how great the Jacksons are. In truth, the upcoming Kingsmoot has Sol on edge. His house has never won a single Kingsmoot and at ninety years old, his time is running short for him to claim being the first Jackson to ever take the throne of the High King. Since he started swinging a sword, Sol determined himself destined to be the first Jackson on the throne, and wants that title more than anything. If he does not win the upcoming Kingsmoot, he doubts he has another decade left in him.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Jones</h2>\n<p>House Jones resides in the coastal city of Jonestown. However, they do not focus their attention on ships and naval combat. Instead, the family is renowned for their great horse breeding facilities, and they fancy themselves the greatest equestrians on the continent. They spend years mastering horseback archery, jousting, and riding skills, and Prince-Elector Saturn Jones has never lost a horse race or a jousting match.</p>\n<p>House Jones has held the title of High King more than any other house except House Joplin. However, even when not seated on the throne of the Tower of Swords, House Jones is extremely active in domestic and international politics. They entertain nobles from Westemär and Elyria on a regular basis, and always ensure their scions marry members of prominent foreign families. As a result, House Jones also has some of the strongest alliances and ties to the nobility of the other nations. In fact, the late Queen Lenore of Drakkenheim was a member of House Jones, and her marriage solidified strong ties between Westemär and Caspia for a time. Since her apparent death after the destruction of Drakkenheim, House Jones is attempting to recuperate their alliances and maintain a grip on their position. They see an opportunity to vastly expand their holdings now that Westemär is falling apart.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the household has been able to maintain a highly influential position within Caspia due to the recent appointment of a House Jones scion to the position of High Flamekeeper of Caspia.</p>\n<h3>High Flamekeeper Elara Jones</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/108-pg78-flamekeeper-elara-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"High Flamekeeper Elara Jones\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/108-pg78-flamekeeper-elara-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Elara Jones is an anomaly in her family: the household is not normally known for being particularly faithful or zealous. However, Elara nonetheless found herself called to the faith at a young age, and departed her household as a teenager. She returned years later as a devout warrior-priest of the Sacred Flame having spent many years in Elyria under the mentorship of the Divine Matriarch. Now in her early thirties, she has retired from adventure, and taken up the mantle as High @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83] for the High King of Caspia. However, thanks to her new station, she has now become entangled in the politics which drove her to leave Caspia in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I speak slowly and calmly to ensure I am understood. I often feel like Caspians yell and shout like wild animals, so a firm but soft voice often puts them in their place.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Strength is one thing, but having a good head on your shoulders and knowing how to use it will take you much further in Caspia than you might expect.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I live by the tenets of the Sacred Flame, which I hold in higher regard than my household. Still, as both a noble Caspian and High Flamekeeper, I am burdened with many responsibilities, and must uphold my obligations to the faith, the crown, and my house.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I sometimes talk down to Caspian men when I find their pig-headed nature exhausting or absurd.\n</p>\n<p>Elara uses her words of wisdom to sway @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.MhYZLI3KuAvBvckv] towards a righteous course, and also towards favorable outcomes for her family in political matters. Long has the High King contemplated invading Westemär now that the kingdom is weakened, and it has been Elara's urgings that have prevented that from happening.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House John</h2>\n<p>The seat of House John is located in Bladeshatter Bay at the sprawling coastal town of Port John. Their navy is well known in the Middle Sea for being more deadly and vile than the many pirates who pillage the trade ships through those waters. They have the strongest fleet of any Caspian house, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.Z1A6dTGPWiBhvIRh] is a famous naval captain, swashbuckler, and strategist.</p>\n<p>House John is sometimes looked down on from the other Caspian houses, as Neptune John is not actually a direct descendant of Rex Caspian. House John has a history of mageborn children, and even several half-elves, tieflings, and dragonborn in their bloodline. Since the Edicts of Lumen require noble houses to disinherit their mageborn children, it came as a great tragedy when an entire generation of House John's heirs all turned out to be mageborn. Since none could inherit the household lands and titles, a bastard child of a lesser Caspian house was adopted into House John and chosen to inherit the family estates.</p>\n<p>The mageborn trait was so strong in House John's bloodline that when the Edicts of Lumen were first presented, House John was the strongest opposing voice. They were instrumental in shaping the final document, and only agreed to sign it after they themselves established the practice of allowing noble mageborn to take up positions as court mages for their own households. Today, the true descendants of John Caspian still live, but all are mageborn members of the Amethyst Academy.</p>\n<h3>Prince-Elector Neptune John</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/024-pg79-neptune-john-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Prince-Elector Neptune John\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/024-pg79-neptune-john-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Neptune is a middle-aged man with a bushy blonde beard and a bald head. This @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.fsPruAIDOg4tVrgb] has a burly build, and unlike many of the Caspian Princes, rarely wears armor. Instead, he is known for sailing the Middle Sea in his leather tricorn hat, a sea-swept beige tunic, and a large belt with a silver skull for a buckle. He has tattoos covering his arms and back detailing every monster he has claimed to have slain, including a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.kVg37NlPcACAzjCT]{kraken}, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ijsfYEDqSuwQXwNN]{dragon turtle}, and most important to him, a great white sperm whale who devoured his original crew. Neptune is known to be a ruthless commander in combat, and takes endless joy in downing pirate ships and plundering them of their stolen goods. He is often accompanied by a pet ferret he calls Pip.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I use naval jargon and sailing analogies whenever I talk. I curse often, and have little mind for manners.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Go where the wind takes ye, and always be ready to fight for what ye believe in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> I may not be a trueborn scion of House John, but I was brought into this family all the same. I have proven myself my own brand of warrior. No one can take my title, or my victories away from me. I'm still waiting for a thank-you from Joplin for keeping the Middle Sea safe for our people.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> If anyone mentions my bloodline as not being a true heir to the throne of Caspia, I'll stick 'em with my saber a few times to show them my Caspian ways.\n</p>\n<p>Neptune John wants to win the next Kingsmoot to stir the pot of Caspian royalty, and rub it in the face of the other houses for thinking low of him. Most Caspians are loud and proud with their shining armor and big swords, and not used to seeing a tattooed pirate amongst their people. Currently Neptune has been detailing plans to slay the great Leviathan of the South Ocean, which would surely claim him some votes in the Kingsmoot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Jagger</h2>\n<p>House Jagger's holdings are nestled at the end of the Great Caspian Canyon along the River of Rust, in the small city of Jagger's Ford. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.7jq0hUNSM2WuY0rQ] rules over the city from his cliffside castle. Surrounded by badlands, their estates are quite a bit rougher and rugged than other Caspian cities. House Jagger maintains a smaller army than the other houses, but one no less mighty, for their wyvern-riders are the envy of Caspia. For generations, the Jaggers have hunted the Caspian Canyon for @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.7198siHjPJf8g0cG]{wyvern} nests. After collecting and hatching their eggs, the Jaggers raise and train the creatures to use as mounts. The powerful air force of wyvern-riding @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{knights} has been instrumental in many Caspian wars.</p>\n<p>As rulers of the southernmost regions of Caspia, House Jagger has fought constant battles and wars with the people of Terene over the borders between their lands. Caspians often see the jungles as a wild land filled with monsters, and venture forth on hunting expeditions. However, the Terene locals do not want Caspian @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO] stomping through their lands slaying their creatures, and so violence between the two is common.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“In Caspia, I'm pretty sure they think violence is the answer. Even when no one asked a question.”</blockquote>\n<h3>Prince-Elector Mars Jagger</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/003-pg80-mars-jagger-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Prince-Elector Mars Jagger\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/003-pg80-mars-jagger-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Mars is a slender @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.OcJoakgBoM6FdYTj] with black hair and a prominent thick unibrow across his furrowed brow, a thick black mustache that covers his mouth, and thick sideburns. He is often clad in black half-plate that he and all the wyvern-riders wear, as well as a black helm with a red crest.</p>\n<p>Mars is rarely far from Duke, his black-and-red @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.7198siHjPJf8g0cG]{wyvern}. There are many famous stories involving Mars and his uniquely colored wyvern rampaging over their enemies. Mars is almost inseparable from the beast, and many say he loves it more than his own children.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I speak in a biting, strong tone, and often use analogies of battle and blood to make my points.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> True friends stab you in the front. Honesty is harsh, but in the end it's the best way.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> To fly through the air and feel, for a brief time, what it's like to be free, is the most incredible feeling any man can have. We wyvern-riders will always be the freest, and most glorious of the Caspians. The others could never understand.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I talk to my wyvern and love it more than anything else and would die to protect it.\n</p>\n<p>Mars is less concerned with the Kingsmoot than he is building up his military strength. He has a growing vendetta against the people of Terene, and is often jealous of their @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.tbmsZEATC9dMthtF]{Clawstrider Rangers}. He is focusing all his energy training more wyvern-riders to push into the neighboring lands to capture and tame the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.pLzSh4dA517Tn73E]{giant lizards} of the jungle. His goal is to build a force of both mounted ground and aerial troops that puts all other Caspian houses to shame.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">House Joyce</h2>\n<p>House Joyce's domains stretch out along the coast of the Middle Sea; the family makes their home in Joyce Harbor. The household is the only Caspian Great House who prominently professes their faith in the Sacred Flame — the family built the largest cathedral to the Faith in Caspia. Scions of the household often become clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame, and the family is relied upon to bring healing and divine magic to many Caspian battles. They wish to see the Sacred Flame shine its light more strongly within Caspia.</p>\n<p>Due to their close ties to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, they have a strong relationship with Elyria. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.fsD7ghTqT9USMag3] frequently travels to Lumen to meet with the Divine Matriarch. However, she hasn't been back since Elara Jones was appointed High Flamekeeper of Caspia, and the development has strained the political ambitions of House Joyce, who in the past could reliably arrange one of their scions to the position.</p>\n<h3>Princess-Elector Persephone Joyce</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/107-pg82-persephone-joyce-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" title=\"Princess-Elector Persephone Joyce\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/107-pg82-persephone-joyce-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>Persephone Joyce is a middle-aged @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc] woman who wears white robes similar in fashion to those seen within the clergy of the Sacred Flame, but greatly embellished with gaudy Caspian baubles. She often wears gold jewelry to contrast her white attire and mimic the colors worn by the Divine Matriarch. Persephone fancies herself very in tune with the teachings of the religion, and she attends the cathedral in Joyce Harbor every day.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I offer guidance and wisdom with my words, and aid those who would turn away from the Sacred Flame by gently pushing them in the right direction towards the light.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Caspians should take their inspiration more readily from righteous figures like Saint Tarna, not uncouth warlords like Rex Caspian.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> My faith has proven a valuable ally to me and I believe that as long as I work under the guidance of the Flame, I will always be moving in the right direction.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I believe the Sacred Flame guides my every choice, and so I rarely question the wisdom of my actions.\n</p>\n<p>Persephone is aiming to take the seat of High King in the next Kingsmoot, tear down the Rex Colosseum, and construct a great cathedral in its place. She dreams of turning the Tower of Swords into a holy site of worship, and sparking the Sacred Flame throughout all of Caspia. She has wild ambitions this would unite Caspia and Elyria as a unified force, and fancifully imagines her and the Divine Matriarch as two pillars of the Faith working together to spread truth and justice to the continent.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Scalebreaker Legion</h2>\n<p>Part mercenary company, part monster-hunting lodge, and part adventuring guild, the Scalebreaker Legion is a prestigious paramilitary organization in Caspia which stands apart from the noble houses. The Scalebreakers count amongst their ranks some of the greatest monster hunters the world has ever known, and are specifically trained in the art of hunting and killing dragons. Rising in its ranks is among the highest honors in Caspia for warriors who do not belong directly to one of the six Great Houses, and the legion has been instrumental in protecting the realms of Caspia from dragons and other monsters, but also from foreign invasions.</p>\n<p>The Scalebreaker Legion has existed in some form in Caspia even before the nation itself, but rose to modern prominence when they defeated the invading forces of Albrecht von Drakken in the year 822. During the Dragonfall War, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.TH3oHGAPZbWHSM3H]{Scalebreaker Knights} slew the House von Drakken dragons and routed their armies, and Commander Bernard of the Scalebreakers<strong></strong> presented the head of Albrecht von Drakken himself to High King Andromeda Jones<strong></strong> at the Tower of Swords.</p>\n<h3>Scalebreaker Commander Callisto</h3>\n<p>Commander Callisto, a male @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.TH3oHGAPZbWHSM3H], has looked after the Dragon Vault for thirty years as the head of the Scalebreaker Legion. He himself is noted for having slain the children of Amarodial “Bitterheart” the Black Dragon of the Eastern Vales when they ventured over the mountains into Caspian territory. That was some time ago, and now, over the age of seventy, Commander Callisto has retired from the battlefield and helps train new recruits. He is a strict commander who expects the best from his knights, and constantly reminds them that if they think he is too harsh, they will be sorely disappointed with how a dragon treats them.</p>\n<p>Callisto has short gray hair and keeps a gray stubble beard. He has an eyepatch over his left eye and three scars across his face — a memento from one of his earliest battles. Commander Callisto wears the same armor into battle each and every time, complete with its many burn marks, dents, and holes from draconic teeth and claws. He is missing his left arm after having lost it to a red dragon on the Drakeclaw Mountains years ago. Despite his injury he returned with the head of the dragon in tow. Anyone who has made a comment about his missing arm is thrown into the training pit with the commander, who challenges them to beat him in a duel. The Scalebreaker Commander remains undefeated.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I am a stern man with a lot of wisdom from experience. I speak harshly and honestly. In battle there is no place for niceties.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> I train the best, because anything less won't survive long enough to learn better.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> The Scalebreakers are one of the most important forces in all of Caspia, we may not be nobles or High Kings, but you can bet on your life that they know they need us when the monsters of this world come crawling out of their holes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I am incapable of relaxing. I have been on my guard my whole life and constantly in battles. I don't know if I am capable of settling down.\n</p>\n<p>Callisto has a long-standing rivalry with the black dragon Amarodial, who dwells in the Eastern Vales. He has faced the dragon several times and the two are well aware of one another. Since they are separated by the Rust Edge Mountains, their battles have subsided for many years. Still, Commander Callisto dreams of facing the dragon once more. If he is to die, he would rather it be in the jaws of that treacherous beast than lying in a bed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Amethyst Academy</h2>\n<p>Although no stronghold of the Amethyst Academy exists in Caspia, the cheerful @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.rJ05Zzvm3G17rQjX] has operated as the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6] of Caspia since the Kingsmoot was established. She was eager to take the position and has happily seen over magical dealings in the nation since. Many High Kings have spoken highly of Marigold and expressed that her counsel is always highly regarded.</p>\n<h3>Marigold Kettleborn</h3>\n<p>Marigold is an @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf], and possibly the most mysterious of them all. This two-and-a-half foot gnomish woman is about as wide as she is tall. She has curled yellow hair that falls about her round rosy face. She is always beaming with a large smile, red dimpled cheeks, and an abundance of chins. She has a round nose and big bright eyes; one is green, the other is a strange crimson red. She carries a short staff made of iron laced with golden swirls.</p>\n<p>Marigold wears a wide-brimmed, pointed, purple hat and a well-fitted purple Academy tunic. She is always a delight to be around and many Caspians admire her optimistic attitude and overt friendliness.</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> I speak in excited and friendly tones and am always looking for an opportunity to help out. No one suspects a jovial gnome!\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> Tricking mortals is so easy, you just need to smile and nod and occasionally throw in a mild request and a quick illusion and you can bend them to your will.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Bond.</em></strong> No one suspects the truth of my presence here, and I will continue to play this role and pull the strings of the Amethyst Academy as I see fit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I am reckless and care little for those around me. My friendly facade is merely another illusion.\n</p>\n<p>Marigold is a master of illusions and has been known to occasionally pull pranks and small jests on the High Kings of Caspia, and even the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf]{Academy Directors}. Behind closed doors, Marigold has been heard muttering in deep whispers of unknown languages to herself. She vanishes every night when her duties are done, and even goes weeks or months without communicating with the other Academy Directors. She has spoken briefly of her walking castle, but no one is sure what she refers to, and assume it is another jest.</p>\n<p>Marigold has been working in secret to study how delerium affects illusion magic. She hopes to create a means of making illusion spells function like summoning spells — conjuring up an illusion and infusing it with delerium to give it form and make it real. If she can master this new advancement, she will be able to create any object, reshape landscapes, manifest riches and items, and reshape reality in ways hitherto unheard of.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“I thought some of my professors were bad, but my brief encounters with the Directorate have been at their best, unpleasant”</blockquote>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Locations and Landmarks</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Trogrowth Forest</h2>\n<p>The largest forest in Caspia is infamously lousy with @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ZHAFrnCwCz17dmLc]{trolls}. The willows and gnarled root trees stretch up from marshy lakes and rivers, and large stretches of the forest are swamps. Though many warn of the dangers within, such words are merely a challenge to the ears of most Caspian princes. The thick mists and damp air make for an uncomfortable hunt, but Caspians hoping to prove themselves as warriors, monster slayers, or Scalebreakers will venture in nonetheless. Beyond trolls, the forest is known for giant snakes, colossal man-eating toads, two-headed @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8aCTKP5qaBPFOqxM]{crocodiles}, and massive demonic insects.</p>\n<p>Many a Caspian will boast with pride about the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.ZHAFrnCwCz17dmLc]{trolls} they killed in Trogrowth, but the number of the monsters never seem to dwindle. Local legend tells of a magic portal deep within the forest which leads to a vast underground city where trolls and other shadow fey dwell, but the Caspians do not venture far enough to prove these claims.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Great Caspian Canyon</h2>\n<p>This canyon stretches from the base of the Rust Edge Mountains down the center of Caspia towards the Jungles of Terene. The beautiful Vermillion Falls flow from the mountains down into the canyon and are the largest waterfalls in the world. The River of Rust that flows through the canyon gets its name from the red earth of the mountains and the canyon, which causes the river to take on a rust like color.</p>\n<p>The canyon has a large population of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.7198siHjPJf8g0cG]{wyverns}, which Caspians have both hunted for sport and tamed for mounts.</p>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/016-pg83-rex-colosseum-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Cities and Settlements</h1>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Tower of Swords</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Capital of Caspia</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 2,725 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.MhYZLI3KuAvBvckv]</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Arena Battles, Political Center of Caspia,<br />the Kingsmoot</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>In the midst of the Caspian plains, resting beside the River of Blood is a massive stone tower built to resemble a colossal sword with its blade plunged into the earth. It reaches hundreds of feet into the air, and a chain-powered lift operates an elevator which runs up the furrow of the blade. There, the court of the High King is built into the crossguard of the stone weapon, with stained glass windows like jewels decorating a hilt.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p>The Tower of Swords is the tallest structure in Caspia, and located in the heart of the nation. It is the seat of the High King of Caspia and the place where each Kingsmoot is decided. After a new High King is elected, the new monarch and their immediate family and retainers take up residence in the apartments built into the pommel of the blade-tower, where the yawning windows and stone balconies look out in every direction across Caspia.</p>\n<p>The High King holds court in the Great Hall located in the crossguard of the blade. There stand statues of the six children of Rex Caspian, as well as a central statue of Rex himself with an inscription that reads “May our swords shatter the will of those who rise against the might of Caspia.” Beneath the tower is a crypt of sorts, but no bodies are held there. Instead, the chosen blade or weapon representing each High King is hung upon the wall or placed on display on tables throughout the mausoleum. A small village has sprung up around the tower, providing lodgings for royal visitors and the household staff.</p>\n<p>No Caspians constructed the Tower of Swords, and the structure supposedly dates before even the time of the Arcane Empire. Caspians tell a story that it is in fact a titan's blade. The fearsome creature planned to devour the people of the earth, but when the primordial monster saw the warriors of Caspia, he was so intimidated by their might he dropped his sword and fled. As with most Caspian stories, the details and timeline of events become extremely incongruent the more one thinks it through. Most Caspians get quite angry if you mention this.</p>\n<h3>Rex Colosseum</h3>\n<p>Constructed beside the Tower of Swords is a large oval-shaped arena that can accommodate nearly ten thousand spectators. The outer facade is decorated with bas-relief carvings depicting horrific monsters being slain by Caspian warriors. Inside is a sandy fighting pit with barred gates facing each cardinal direction. Standing in the middle of the pit is the petrified statue of Rex Caspian, still holding the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.nZthq6WHLhcdu3te] that petrified him in his grip. The supernatural creature is still alive, but has been unable to free itself for hundreds of years. Those fighting in the arena must be careful to avoid the petrifying fumes it belches forth.</p>\n<p>Beneath the arena is a sprawling labyrinth of chambers, with ready-rooms for @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.fsPruAIDOg4tVrgb]{Gladiators}, a forge and smithy to maintain weapons and armor, a hot spring bath to relax between fights, and copious stores of meat and beer. The lower levels house various pens where animals and monsters are kept to await combat. The High King pays well for new creatures that offer unique fighting opportunities, and some adventurers make their entire careers as monster-wranglers for the arena.</p>\n<h3>The Troll's Head</h3>\n<p>For those traveling to the Tower of Swords or Rex Colosseum, they can find accommodations at the Troll's Head tavern and inn. Both gladiators and spectators all come to the Troll's Head to enjoy a pint of ale and enjoy stories of great victories and bitter losses. The tavern has the mummified head of a troll on a stake outside acting as a signpost for the tavern.</p>\n<p>Comet Smith, a member of a smaller Caspian house, runs the inn, which is actually the manor house of his family. He loves to share stories and gossip with guests, especially telling newcomers about the troll outside who tried to kill him when he was in the Trogrowth forest on a hunt. His story changes slightly every time he tells it, getting more and more heroic as time passes.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right region-symbol\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/152-house-jackson-heraldry-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/152-house-jackson-heraldry-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Jackson's Keep</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>Home of House Jackson</em></p>\n<p><strong>Population:</strong> 10,500 people</p>\n<p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Prince-Elector Sol Jackson</p>\n<p><strong>Known For:</strong> Fishing, Jackson Knights, Caspian Smithing, Trade</p>\n<article>\n  <blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n      <div class=\"inner-wrapper\"><p>The blue rooftops of Jackson's Keep stand in stark contrast to the rich red soils of the surrounding landscape.

Its prime waterfront location has meant that it is the most popular port for imported goods coming from Elyria. Its inns and taverns serve some of the best fish in all of Caspia.</p>\n<h3>Castle Jackson</h3>\n<p>The Jackson's Keep Castle is a high perched structure atop the nearby hills. It's made of white stone with blue roofed towers and great flags waving in the wind. The castle has three towers, a central keep, and two outer walls, one around the keep proper, and one surrounding the noble houses that lay on the hillside just outside the castle. These houses are occupied by all who bear the name Jackson.</p>\n<p>Currently Sol Jackson, renowned warrior and monster slayer, sits on the throne of Jackson's Keep.

The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.R3nChOQBH2LSU2NY]{minstrels} and heralds who accompany Caspian nobility often attend Lento College.</p>\n<p>Due to the Edicts of Lumen, the school is strictly prohibited from teaching magic. Rufus Stonewall, an Amethyst Academy academic, is positioned at the college to oversee the teachings of these Caspian artists. His specific task is to observe and see if any students possess magical potential as bards, and to send them to an Academy school to further train their arcane skills. Many of these bards return to Caspia to finish their artistic training and hone their Academy-learned magic skills.

Dragon Vault, or simply “The Vault,” as the Scalebreakers call it, is a massive fortification built into the side of the imposing Rust Edge Mountains. The Vault is an intimidating structure with two large dragon statues that can be seen from miles away flanking a large stone door. The door is etched with carvings of heavily armored knights fending off an army of dragons.</p>\n<p>Outside the Vault doors is a walled-off camp with training pits, blacksmiths, watch towers, and other minor fortifications and amenities. Inside, the Vault is a war room, a command post, a bunker, and a deep catacomb. The catacomb is a massive hollowed-out cavern below the mountain where dead Scalebreakers are brought when they die. Their bodies are burned on a pyre made from the bones of every monster they themselves slew. The ashes remain atop these piles of bones as a testament to the deeds of that knight.

class=\"standard-h1\">总括</h1>\n<p>山谷得名于其地理位置和景观：大陆的东部边缘由山谷和平原组成，点缀着绿色的小山丘和郁郁葱葱的绿地。东部山谷曾被一个残暴的暴君简短地称为卡恩斯瑞克，但如今生活在山谷中的人们都不再以那个名字来称呼自己的家园。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">人口</h2>\n<p>大约有两百万人居住在东部山谷，主要分布在散落的小村庄和城镇中。该地区仅有几座城市，但大多数是一个文化和血统多元的大熔炉。东部山谷是大陆上半身人数量最多的地区，坐落在翠绿的小山丘和广阔的田野之间。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">首都</h2>\n<p>其他国家的人通常将布莱诺港视为东部山谷的非官方首都，这是由于它的坚固位置以及作为跨越恩德海洋的贸易路线的终点地位。尽管如此，东部山谷自豪地成为一个由小社区和城市组成的自由联盟。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">政府</h2>\n<p>尽管在过去，山谷曾被几位统治者宣称所有权，但如今东部山谷没有统一的政府。大多数定居点是完全独立的，尽管有一些是该地区较大城市的附庸。自从卡恩的倒台以来，这种非官方安排对山谷的居民效果良好，当地人相信这成功地使山谷免受大陆其他地区所面临的政治动荡困扰。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">军事</h2>\n<p>过去，东部山谷曾在强大的军阀领导下组建了庞大的军队，但如今他们的军事力量主要集中在保卫自己的土地上。@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.8cHD1s9vFBVMds0L]{艾丝特·利文斯顿}与邻国组织了防御盟约，并拥有一支体面的海军。除此之外，各镇依赖志愿军、雇佣兵和地方民兵来保护自己。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">宗教</h2>\n<p>东部山谷的宗教信仰极为多元。在东部山谷，人们公开崇拜古神。山谷中一个热门的教派将阿尔温、莫瑞甘和梵塔西亚视为智慧三姐妹的三位一体，而半身人社区是少数公开供奉谢戈拉克的地方之一。</p>\n<p>除了崇拜古神外，神圣之火信仰在这里根深蒂固。然而，东部山谷的@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{圣火守护者}在地理上与炉明的教会等级系统相去甚远，其中许多人从未前往伊利瑞亚，也很少与其他地区的同行交流。因此，山谷是多个不同派别的信仰的发源地，其中包括试图调和神圣之火和古神的非正统信仰。这些信仰将圣塔尔娜与女神努阿达相提并论，并讲述了神圣之火是由欧格姆、鲁格和盖布尼创造的，旨在用知识和光明的信标保护世界。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">魔法</h2>\n<p>紫晶学院在东部山谷的悖论城堡设立了其最重要的青年魔法师学院。因此，东部山谷的人们对奥术魔法早已习以为常，紫袍法师更是经常被看到护送新生前往城堡。除了与大国的距离和山谷温和的政治氛围外，学院在这里可以更隐秘和自治地运作。</p>\n<p>由于在炉明法令颁布时东部山谷缺乏统一的统治者，不清楚条约是否真正适用于整个地区，因为谈判中仅有布莱诺港代表参与。尽管如此，东部山谷在精神上大多遵守法令，即使不总是严格遵循字面规定，以免激起好战的邻国的愤怒。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">历史</h1>\n<p>山谷曾是奥法王朝的东部边境。在曾受巫王统治的土地中，东部山谷是第一个摆脱其控制的地方。女巫王凯斯特拉利亚八世在位期间大大削弱了王朝的军队和财富，随后不得不召回前往东部山谷强制执行她统治的许多士兵，以确保王朝的核心地区。山谷的人民抓住了这个反抗的机会，推翻并杀死了她的总督和臣民。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">约翰·托兰国王时代</h2>\n<p>当巫王的统治离开山谷时，一个名叫约翰·托兰的人试图将这个地区打造成一个以他的家族为核心的王国。虽然并非出色的军事统治者，托兰家族利用他们的影响力和财富，确立自己为山谷居民的宝贵盟友。他的儿子约翰·托兰二世继承王位，成为东部山谷的第一位国王。</p>\n<p>不幸的是，约翰二世证明自己并非出色的领导者。他认为阴冷的布莱诺港不适合作为王国的首都。他耗尽父亲的财宝，在第二姐妹湖畔建造了一座宏伟的宫殿城堡作为权力中心，无视建筑师和顾问的警告在那里建造是愚蠢的劝告。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">怒心之怒</h2>\n<p>在城堡竣工后，约翰·托兰二世面临着无数问题。春水水位导致南部阴影沼泽地的许多土地变成沼泽，他不惜花费更多财富来防止托兰要塞沉入或坍塌到泥沼中。更糟糕的是，约翰·托兰二世未意识到远古黑龙@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.FbVTWCeJ0b5UeOfK]{怒心阿玛洛迪尔}居住在阴影沼泽中，将这座城堡视为一位微不足道的凡人国王送给它们的绝妙新巢穴。</p>\n<p>这条巨龙决心摧毁约翰·托兰的王国，夺取城堡为己有。它们赶走了托兰的军队，并在他躲在房间里时将这位自封为国王的人杀死。废墟多年来逐渐沉入沼泽，尽管怒心阿玛洛迪尔仍然居住在那里，身旁堆满了宝藏。东部山谷的居民从未试图重新夺回废墟，也没有再在第二姐妹湖之间建立任何城镇或城市。</p>\n<h3>暴君卡恩</h3>\n<p>在约翰·托兰二世去世多年后，克里斯托弗·卡恩成为布莱诺港的统治者。他通过大量流血和无情手段夺取了城市的控制权，随后组建了一个由雇佣兵和嗜血凶手组成的军队，帮助他征服山谷。这支军队围攻了东部山谷的北部城市，杀死了他们的领袖，并掠夺了周围的村庄。卡恩给予任何有能力的人们两个选择：加入他的征服行动或死在他无情的军队手下，因此他的军队壮大起来。</p>\n<p>最终，卡恩的贪婪使他盯上了南方的土地，但在雷克斯·卡斯匹安领导下的联合战士遭到了顽强的抵抗。战争陷入僵局后，两位军阀同意进行会谈。他们离开会面时已成为快速的朋友，并同意承认彼此王国的主权。卡恩回到布莱诺港统治卡恩斯雷克，而雷克斯·卡斯匹安统一了卡斯匹亚的土地。</p>\n<p>然而，卡恩作为暴君统治这片土地，十二年来使大部分王国陷入饥荒和干旱。在一场瘟疫席卷布莱诺港的严冬后，他的士兵们背叛了他。卡恩被拖出城堡，在他试图逃跑时，布莱诺港的骑士和贵族们用石头砸死了他。他们将他的肢解尸体悬挂在城堡墙上以惩戒示众。</p>\n<h3>持久和平</h3>\n<p>山谷人民对卡恩的去世感到高兴，自那以后从未有明显的统治者取代他。在卡恩统治结束后，山谷的人民对任何声称拥有这片土地所有权的统治者、国王或领主都极为警惕。多年来，东部山谷陷入了一种常态，彼此相互制衡。山谷众多市镇的领袖害怕越界，以免招致整个地区的愤怒。迄今为止，这种默契的制度对山谷产生了积极影响，这片土地在这种潜规则下繁荣发展。</p>\n<h1

class=\"standard-h2\">宗教</h2>\n<p>栖云岛的居民相信古神仍以物质存在漫步在他们的土地上。人们对所有古神怀有极大的崇敬，讲述着他们的英雄是如何与神一起战斗，有时甚至反对神。沿海散布着向深渊之诺登斯致敬的突出石柱，德鲁伊们公开领导他们的社区进行向克罗马克的血祭。法师和药剂师进行仪式，以从莫瑞甘、欧格姆和迪安克特那里寻求智慧。栖云岛的战士们在战斗中呼唤努阿达的名字，并感谢盖布尼赐予他们钢铁的礼物。农民在播种和收割时祈祷，以获得达努和鲁格的祝福。古老的石圈以天体形态排列，以取悦阿尔温和梵塔西娅，但栖云岛没有猎人敢杀兔子或食用兔肉，因为谢戈拉奇会给他们带来厄运。</p>\n<p>相比之下，神圣之火在栖云岛只是一支摇曳的残烛。这里只有几座小教堂、神殿和修道院。@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]{圣火守护者}和侍僧是与周围异教徒保持距离的孤独隐士。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">魔法</h2>\n<p>栖云岛充满了魔法，位于伟大的地脉交汇处，这些地脉缩小了凡人世界与其他维度之间的边界。如今，紫晶学院在栖云岛的星极观测站设立了一个重要要塞，以监测这些魔法现象。</p>\n<p>这些岛屿与幻梦境和精之国度这些异界紧密相连。沿着薄雾笼罩的海岸、恶臭的泥沼和茫茫森林，无数人类发现自己迷失在另一个位面中。相反，各种@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.MUpBNDoJEr09bLaO]{小妖精}、皮克精、@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.KOHVWl5RU9XBR8Jb]{树精}、@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.TjWQOgI3A4UAl7lC]{地精}和其他精类在通过妖精通道时被困后，选择在栖云岛定居。在这些位面漫游的种族中，最值得注意的是精灵，人们相信今天世界上许多精灵都是从他们的被的遗忘世界到栖云岛的难民后裔。</p>\n<blockquote

class=\"standard-h1\">历史</h1>\n<p>在整个大陆上，栖云的历史与神话密切相关。栖云的每个人类社区都有自己的传说，讲述了他们是如何来到这个岛上的，以及为什么众神看重他们胜过其他人。比如，达里尔的战士们相信他们是努阿达的凡人儿子的后代，这位儿子的名字成为了这座城市的名字。许多人在奥法王朝时代来到栖云岛，大多数沿东部海岸和峡谷建立的小城镇都是在这个时期建立的。尽管栖云岛并不在巫王的控制范围之外，但它是为数不多的几个保持远离他们绝对统治的地方之一。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">精灵到达</h2>\n<p>没有人确切知道精灵为何逃离他们的家园，以及他们是如何建立精灵之门的，尽管大多数学者一致认为这一事件发生在奥法王朝兴起之前很久。精灵很少谈及这个故事，因为即使是他们中最年长的人也已经忘记了真相。</p>\n<p>这是因为精灵的历史的比他们最古老的记忆还要古老，但一旦他们到达这个世界，精灵就从栖云岛出发，在大陆漫游，寻找他们的亲属。只有一小部分社区留在艾拉椎亚的森林林地中。传说中的聚落不时吸引其他精类生物，人类旅行者会冒险数英里来目睹这个奇妙地方的奇迹。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">艾拉椎亚的陷落</h2>\n<p>女巫王凯斯特拉利亚八世对精灵怀有深切的仇恨，她认为精灵们对她隐瞒了他们的魔法秘密。为了报复，这位复仇心切的女王决心找到艾拉椎亚，窃取其奥术秘密。她召集了一支庞大的舰队，在北方的海洋中搜寻栖云岛，结果却在龙息之柱附近遭遇海难而全军覆没。尽管损失惨重，凯斯特拉利亚八世仍未放弃，她亲自传送了一支由她最精锐士兵组成的军团直接进入栖云岛。虽然这支军队有一半以上被卷入世界之间的空间而消失无踪，但剩余的兵力足以将艾拉椎亚夷为一片冒烟的废墟。</p>\n<p>凯斯特拉利亚八世带着掠夺来的知识和偷走的魔法宝藏逃回了诺克斯城，遗弃了她的军队，最终被恩尼斯基伦坚定的人类战士击败。只有少数精灵幸存者得以幸免。然而，这场残酷的种族灭绝耗尽了凯斯特拉利亚的大量资源，导致她完全失去了对东部山谷的控制权，这一失败成为她长期无法维持奥法王朝统治的把柄。</p>\n<p>精灵的清洗对栖云岛产生了重大影响。精灵们流离失所，岛上许多美丽景观需要多年时间才能从凯斯特拉利亚造成的焦土和战争伤痕中恢复。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">派系与人物</h1>\n<p>以下描述了一些居住在栖云岛的知名人物。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">北方人氏族</h2>\n<p>栖云岛是众多技艺高超的战士的故乡，以其残酷的战术、愤怒驱动的战斗和兽性化的仪式而著称。尽管许多家族和亲族构成了这些掠夺性的氏族，但它们总体上被称为北方人氏族。其中最著名的是洛克兰和布莱斯维氏族。</p>\n<p>他们居住在木流河畔的村庄，长屋取代了城堡或要塞。北方人氏族保留着坚固的长船，船头上装饰着动物雕像；狼、熊和野猪常常是他们氏族的象征。他们手持斧头、棍棒、钉头锤和标枪冲入战场，并用野生动物的血或被杀敌人的血涂抹他们的脸。夜晚他们进行仪式性的篝火仪式，通常由致力于古神的德鲁伊领导。</p>\n<p>这些氏族经常互相交战，很少有几年不发生家族之间的血腥战斗。然而，北方人氏族也不时入侵大陆。在冯·德拉肯家族统治时期，洛克兰氏族的祖先以一百艘长船的力量袭击了水晶海岸，试图占领德兰斯蒙。尽管他们未能控制这座城市，但他们在数年内蹂躏了水晶海岸，焚烧了几个较小的村庄，并建立了至今仍然存在的诺登斯神庙。</p>\n<h3>马丁·麦克·洛克兰</h3>\n<img

class=\"standard-h1\">地点与地标</h1>\n<p>以下是栖云岛上一些奇妙的地方。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">龙息之柱</h2>\n<p>沿着栖云岛大陆的西南海岸线，以及离岸的几个小岛上，矗立着无数六边形的玄武岩柱。锯齿状的柱子形成交错的岩石悬崖和低矮的高原。玄武岩塔的顶部形成了通往海面下的悬崖上的踏石。当地人相信这些奇怪的岩石形态是盖布尼建造的几座伟大城堡的遗迹，被克罗马克指使的红龙和诺登斯召唤的元素风暴摧毁。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">巨人之倾</h2>\n<p>岛屿的西北端是著名的巨人之倾，一块巨大的平坦土地，覆盖着郁郁葱葱的绿草，向上延伸数英里，直至结束于加洛森林上方的山峰。这块悬崖被认为是观赏栖云岛全景的最佳地点，在晴朗的日子里，远处的地平线上甚至可以看到维斯特玛的水晶海岸的闪光。嵌在悬崖边缘的石头中有一把古老的剑。当地传说称这把剑曾属于古神银手努阿达。虽然许多人尝试过，但这把剑从未被移走。据说这把剑等待着一位被古神选做勇士的，与之般配的女武神在追求消灭伟大邪恶的任务中夺取它。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">瓦代尔峡谷</h2>\n<p>从恩尼斯基伦到达里尔之间延伸的多山绿色田野是一片密集的农田拼图，被称为瓦代尔峡谷。这里的农场生产了栖云岛大部分的牲畜和谷物。它们沿着翡翠之路延伸，这是栖云岛两个主要城市之间最受欢迎的贸易路线。数不清的战斗在这个地区展开，农民常常在耕作时挖掘到古老的武器和骨骸，就像顽固的石头一样频繁。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">瑞格林高地</h2>\n<p>栖云岛大陆的西端被称为瑞格林高地。这里有一片由绿色小山丘和多岩石山组成的山脉区域，西海岸是一条陡峭的悬崖，数百英尺高，直直地垂入海面下的锯齿状岩石中。传言偶尔可以在悬崖外的海域中发现@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.KUpbXdn1XmHEeOPk]{人鱼}和其他海洋生物。长期以来的神话声称，在岛屿下方的洞穴和岩洞深处有一个水族城市。与此同时，绿色的山脉据说充满了使用岛屿自然魔法进行仪式和法术的神秘鬼婆们。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">星极观测站</h2>\n<p>这座巨大的精灵塔楼已被改建成一座伟大的观测站和图书馆，是紫晶学院八大要塞之一。虽然这里的学生很少接受教育，但学院的魔法师们前往这个地点研究的不仅仅是夜空，还有整个宇宙。</p>\n<p>这是一座高数百英尺的大白色圆柱形建筑，顶部有一个巨大的玻璃圆顶。蜿蜒的楼梯穿过一个填满整个建筑的巨大中央图书馆。一些魔法平台，有些装饰着舒适的阅读椅子，在看似无尽的书架之间漂浮。其他房间专门用于星图、天文计算以及生产卷轴和魔法墨水的书房。在巨大的玻璃圆顶下是一架巨大的黄铜和铜望远镜，指向上方的天空。</p>\n<p>在大法师@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ZUhQYvVymk4PgNu6]{星天·尽视}的要求下，@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.UxxrMnYJxnSuAcew]{宗师德莉拉·威洛沃特}保持着观测站的完美状态，并照顾设施的一切需求，欢迎紫晶学院的学生和教职员工来研究宇宙。</p>\n<p>在与观测站平行的一个秘密维度是星天的奥术实验室，这里被加上了结界，除了德莉拉·威洛沃特之外任何人都无法进入。星天使用妄质作为奥术导管，以控制和利用位面之间的薄弱之地的波动。尽管容易发生奥术异常和意外崩溃，但星天已经建立了相对稳定的通往幽影界、精之异界、幻梦境以及一个遥远的未命名行星（天空为紫色，草地为橙色）的传送门。然而，这些实验导致栖云岛各处的薄弱之地变得活跃，吸引更多危险的精类和阴影生物来到岛上。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">阿尔莫拉之石</h2>\n<p>位于栖云岛大陆北部海岸附近的一片绿色平坦的土地。这座岛屿因其平坦而著名，以至于数英里之外你就可以看到站在岛上的另一个人。在岛屿的最北端，有一个神秘而古老的德鲁伊圣地。</p>\n<p>关于这座岛屿的起源并无任何记载，但北方人氏族将这个地点命名为“阿尔莫拉之石”，这是栖云岛上一个充满争议的神话传说，认为古神阿尔温和梵塔西娅是同一存在。这片神圣之地由三环立石组成。在中心位置是一个嵌入地面的石盘，上面雕刻着九个不完美的环形圈，向中心逐渐变小，每个圈内都有一个微小的雕刻点。</p>\n<p>这个石圈的用途至今尚不为人所知。一些人猜测中心石盘上的环可能对应于宇宙中的行星，大型石环代表着每位古神观察和维护的宇宙。然而，没有人能解释这些石头代表的神祇数量，因此所有理论都只是纯粹的猜测。德鲁伊们声称他们并非建造者，但他们现在保护并视这片土地为古神的神圣之地。</p>\n<h1

class=\"dropcap\">位于卡斯匹亚、伊利瑞亚和维斯特玛三国交汇处，临黄金海湾最北端的这个独立城邦——利比里奥，其自由民众自豪地认为他们的城市是世界之巅。这种自豪感不无道理。利比里奥以其民主（虽带有富豪统治色彩）的政府体制、丰富的财富和宜人的气候，成为了商业繁荣、文化丰富和工业发达的典范。得益于其独立性和位于中海心脏地带的地理位置，利比里奥已经成为整个大陆贸易的枢纽。这里是各种商品流通的中心——包括妄质。此外，作为大陆上三个最大国家的中立地带，利比里奥无疑成为了一个国际政治活动的热点区域。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">历史</h2>\n<p>利比里奥由巫王奥利安三世建立，最初是作为一个造船厂，用来建造一支庞大的魔法舰队，以此控制中海。自从奥法王朝崩塌以来，利比里奥已经几度易手。它原本是伊利瑞亚联盟的一员，之后被多次围攻和占领。克里斯托弗·卡恩是第一个宣称占领该城的人，此后利比里奥被割让给雷克斯·卡斯匹亚。随后，伊利瑞亚与杰克逊、乔普林和乔伊斯家族为了这座城市而战。然后，它被阿尔布雷希特·冯·德拉肯占领，他的入侵失败后，利比里奥的人民宣布独立并建立了他们的共和国。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">政府</h2>\n<p>利比里奥是一个由两院制管理的民主国家。立法机构是由一百名公民组成的选举机构，他们服务期为四年，而议会由每年通过抽签选出的五百名公民组成的轮换机构组成。立法机构制定法律和政策，这些法律和政策必须由议会批准。两院共同提名并每两年选举一名执政官来领导这座城市。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">宗教</h2>\n<p>尽管利比里奥的人民相当温和，但与伊利瑞亚的长期紧密联系和接近留下了其影响。在利比里奥，神圣之火蓬勃发展，该宗教中的故事和神话是利比里奥艺术家们热衷的主题。关于圣塔尔娜的无数画作、雕像和诗歌在这里被创作和谱写：当然，圣主母几乎一直是利比里奥艺术的最大赞助者。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">魔法</h2>\n<p>紫晶学院的影响力在利比里奥无处不在，强大且明显。街道上，身着紫色长袍的法师们成为一道独特的风景线，他们常借助飞毯或施用魔法在空中穿梭，往返于神秘的谜境金字塔之间。魔法师们在利比里奥开展着他们的主要商业活动，与穿梭于此自由城市的富商贵族进行交易，提供魔法物品、药剂和施法服务，以换取金币和妄质。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">地点与地标</h1>\n<p>利比里奥汇集了众多银行、专注于各式工艺与技术的行会，以及富人用以保管金币与珍稀艺术品的庞大金库。无论白天还是夜晚，城市的广场与市场都是热闹非凡，活力四射。利比里奥的街巷之中，运河、桥梁与步道构成了交通的主干线，而非传统的道路。各式船只与筏子齐聚于此，向着深入黄金海湾的宏大码头圈汇流。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">创造学院</h2>\n<p>这座大型建筑位于利比里奥的中心。它是一座不对称结构，拥有奇特、令人困惑的角度，本身就是一件艺术作品。建筑由古老的米色砖石构成，拥有大型拱门和镶嵌在外墙的巨大镶嵌工艺。大型彩色玻璃窗不规则地分布在外墙上，描绘了发明、艺术和科学方面的伟大历史突破。建筑内部拥有一个美丽的中央庭院，设有石铺步道、长椅和一个雕塑园。</p>\n<p>创造学院既是艺术画廊也是学校。自成立以来，一些最伟大的画家、雕塑家、诗人、吟游诗人、发明家和哲学家都曾就读于这所独特的学校。其中包括：设计了该建筑本身以及大陆上许多伟大教堂的著名建筑师霍拉提奥，包括圣塔尔娜大教堂的翻新。还有杰出的发明家卢多维科，他设计了蒸汽动力引擎、大炮、改进了冶金技术，甚至构想了不使用魔法进行飞行的设计。伟大的哲学家萨托，他在其作品<em>阵营九宫格</em>中探讨了政治、伦理和宗教。著名雕塑家尼克雷迪，他创作了现位于学院庭院中的歌利亚雕像。罗萨娜，她创作了著名作品<em>利塞拉·玛丽亚</em>、<em>仲夏之夜</em>和<em>戴钻石戒指的女士</em>；以及著名诗人戈蒂，他撰写了<em>卡斯匹亚赞美诗</em>以及<em>少有人走的路</em>。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">圣菲奥娜大教堂</h2>\n<p>圣菲奥娜大教堂堪称建筑艺术的典范，与炉明的圣塔尔娜大教堂以及德拉肯海姆的圣维特鲁维奥大教堂齐名，被誉为大陆上最壮丽的大教堂之一。这座宏伟的白色建筑以其中央的巨大玻璃穹顶为特色，位于祭坛之上，使得教堂内部的灿烂光芒能够透过穹顶，从远处就能一眼望见。沿着这座绵长的建筑排布的各式彩色玻璃窗，高达三层，生动描绘了神圣之火的诸多传说。</p>\n<p>高阶圣火守护者波提亚长年守护着这座教堂，不仅保持圣火长明，还为莅临这片圣地的朝圣者提供引导。她性情温和，从不强行推广信仰，而是总是以一颗慈爱之心和实用的建议，向那些寻求帮助的人伸出援手。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">大桥</h2>\n<p>这座宏伟的石桥跨越了城市中心的运河，其两侧点缀着商铺和建筑，令其成为城市里最热闹的交易市场。桥的两侧装饰有数个精美的大型雕塑，这些雕塑展现了城市杰出艺术家的面容，俯瞰着下方的运河。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">底基堡垒</h2>\n<p>这座坚不可摧的城堡坐落于城市的海港之上，配备了专属的码头和一扇巨大的水门，以便船只的顺畅进出。这座引人注目的要塞担任着利比里奥陆军和海军的指挥中心。尽管城市的陆军规模适中，但其强大的海上舰队足以弥补这一不足。这些庞大的船舰挂着印有城市标志的白帆，宛如中海上的坚固盾牌，保卫着海域的安全。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">谜境金字塔</h2>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>紫晶学院要塞</em></p>\n<p>悬浮于港口之上，谜境金字塔的壮观景象象征着利比里奥城本身。这座巨大的第八虹色四面体，其外表被缓慢变换着的拼图形状面板、楼梯、柱子和阳台所覆盖。由于缺乏陆地或海上的入口，访客需依靠飞行或传送才能进入此建筑。</p>\n<p>其内部是一个迷宫似的地城，内部空间远超其巨大外观所暗示的范围。金字塔的众多角落和隐蔽的壁龛中充满了学院的工艺和产业专用房间。咒语熔炉、元素铸造厂和平面坩埚被用来制造魔法武器、魔杖和法杖。炼金精炼厂和巨大的旋转大锅则酿造出大量的魔法药水和@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.items.Item.A9qY2fXBh1Ky1bOs]。特殊的奥术加速器用于研究魔法能量、物质和各种现象，使得魔法师几乎能从基本元素合成任何材料。魔法师们利用加固了奥术结界和守卫的要塞隐秘区域来封锁那些不可言喻的生物和危险的魔法。</p>\n<p>谜境金字塔由巫王奥利安三世建造。当紫晶学院的首批魔法师寻找一个安全的行动基地时，他们利用自己的影响力和资源夺取了金字塔，并将其改造成了一个奥术研究设施。虽然谜境金字塔一直是主要总部之一，但是自从德拉肯海姆的莫测之塔失落以来，谜境金字塔成为了紫晶学院的真正中心。在金字塔深处的实验室、工坊和铸造厂中，魔法师们研究妄质，并利用妄质水晶制造出各种神秘奇观。紫晶学院在建筑的核心建造了一个巨大的洞穴，里面装满了从德拉肯海姆收集的大量妄质。魔法师们希望通过集中巨量的妄质促进新水晶的生长。强大的污染应对措施和奥术结界封闭了这个衬铅的房间，以防止能量的溢出和新污霭的蔓延。</p>\n<p>每当有重大事宜需要学院理事会与大陆的统治者会面时，他们都会在谜境金字塔的无尽走廊举行讨论。这个宏伟的大厅被施以特殊魔法，使得从大厅两端进入的人能够看到并与对方交谈，但无法穿越到房间的另一边。房间中的参与者可以永远地朝对方走动或奔跑，却永远也接近不了对方。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">派系与人物</h1>\n<p>这些杰出的人物居住在利比里奥：</p>\n<h3>执政官伊莎贝拉·埃齐奥</h3>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/065-pg102-isabella-ezio-cmykk.webp\" alt=\"\"

我说话总是像在发表演讲一样。我谨慎选择我的词汇，以确保它们的影响力。</p>\n<p><em><strong>理想。</strong></em> 利比里奥不受神或国王的统治；伟大源于人民。通过人民的选择，我们将见证我们的胜利或毁灭。</p>\n<p><em><strong>羁绊。</strong></em> 利比里奥始终处于失去自由的边缘，被邻国的威胁所困扰。我们的自由是一件脆弱的事物，我们必须珍视它。</p>\n<p><em><strong>缺陷。</strong></em> 我会不择手段地争取自由：撒谎、欺骗、偷窃，如果必要的话，我还会杀人。</p>\n<p>在担任执政官期间，伊莎贝拉发现自己必须直面卡斯匹亚的至高王和伊利瑞亚的圣主母。她在妄质和维斯特玛的议题上努力发声，然而，她却屡屡被排斥在关于大陆的重大讨论之外。伊莎贝拉坚信，把利比里奥的担忧带到讨论桌前，并在这样一个动荡的时期，以果敢的姿态证明利比里奥是大陆事务中不可忽视的一方，是她不可推卸的责任。</p>\n<h3>贵族家族</h3>\n<p>三大贵族家族在利比里奥主导着文化、政治和贸易：</p>\n<p><em><strong>莱昂特家族。</strong></em> 公爵贝纳多·莱昂特领导着一个由银行家、公证人和放贷者组成的大家庭。他们的家族几乎参与了利比里奥的每一笔商业和金融交易。</p>\n<p><em><strong>德维克西家族。</strong></em> 公爵吉尔莫的家族是创造学院的创始人和主要赞助人；得益于他们的赞助，利比里奥的美学和艺术得以繁荣发展。德维克西家族委托创作了许多著名的绘画、雕塑和诗歌，并在全城经营着几家剧院和旅店。</p>\n<p><em><strong>马尔沃里奥家族。</strong></em> 由女公爵弗朗西斯卡统治的马尔沃里奥家族深度参与利比里奥立法机构的政治派系。该家族正推动民主机构形成政党——这一想法长期以来被利比里奥的共和国创始人所拒绝。这个家族寻求更大政治影响力的确切目的尚不为人所知。</p>\n<h3>大法师白玉</h3>\n<p class=\"type\"><em>紫晶学院理事</em></p>\n<p>这位强大的@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.0ernP9oaCHNmeshf]法师出自一个将血脉与天界血统融合的巫王家族。因此，他拥有天使般的特征，淡淡的薰衣草色皮肤，一把短黑胡须，以及闪烁着乳白色光泽的眼睛。他通常只戴着护目镜，穿着染有污渍的皮革铁匠围裙，外加一件紫色的长袍，他抛开了学院的长袍，换上了更适合他工作的服装。</p>\n<p>白玉是炼金和变形学派无与伦比的大师。他的实验和研究涉及使用妄质改变其他物质的物理属性。众所周知，白玉创造了@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.items.Item.A9qY2fXBh1Ky1bOs]的配方。他已经成功开发出一种使用妄质将铅变成金的过程，但现在他更感兴趣的是使用这些石头创造某种形式的生命。然而，白玉清楚地意识到这些晶体对肉体的不稳定和混乱效应，这往往会产生疯狂、被污染的怪物。相反，在谜团金字塔的深处，他用妄质水晶心脏制造了几个人形魔像的雏形。他独特的方法魔法性地创造了具有感知和个性的活化物件。每一个都是独一无二、精心制作的存在，具有复杂的面部特征，常常装饰有瓷器、玻璃和银器。这位大法师悄悄地将少数他的创造物释放到世界上，去看看它们将会发现什么样的冒险。</p>\n<p><em><strong>个性特征。</strong></em> 我试图尽快结束任何对话，这样我就可以回到我的实验中去。</p>\n<p><em><strong>理想。</strong></em> 如果真的是天界生物创造了生命和宇宙，那我只是在努力模仿我的祖先们的榜样。这个世界不过是一个宏大的实验，现在已被那些启动它的人遗忘。</p>\n<p><em><strong>牵绊。</strong></em> 妄质是真正的哲学家之石：其变化的属性是至高无上的。使用它的魔法，我们可以转化任何事物——也许甚至包括生命本身。</p>\n<p><em><strong>缺陷。</strong></em> 我一生中创造了许多东西。然而，我很快就转向下一个项目，对我过去的实验几乎不怎么在意。</p>\n<p>白玉是泰瑞尼的大法师@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.ggBl9pLVIGPL49rz]{半影}的密友、伙伴，有时还是情人。两人共同育有几名即将崭露头角的学院学生。</p>\n<h1

class=\"dropcap\">泰瑞尼的土地被一片广阔的丛林所覆盖，这片丛林形成了国家定居的海岸线与卡斯匹亚领土之间的自然边界。尽管许多人居住在丛林中无数的村庄和紧密联系的社区里，它在很大程度上仍然是一个充满了怪异爬行动物、凶猛野兽和原初魔法的危险荒野。然而，这片郁郁葱葱的绿色丛林是一个遍布美丽的动植物的自然环境，在大陆上别无分号，深入无路的林叶中隐藏着许多效力于古神的隐秘德鲁伊结社。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">总括</h1>\n<p>泰瑞尼（Terene）这个名字源于\"Terrene\"一词的误写，在古米底语其意为\"陆地地\"，或更通俗地说是\"土地或地区\"。在巫王早期，许多人简单地将未开发的丛林称为\"丛林地区\"，后来这个名称就被用来指代泰瑞尼的土地。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">人口</h2>\n<p>大约有两百万人居住在泰瑞尼，大多数人居住在南部海岸，那里有漫长的沙滩和美丽的蓝色海水。然而，还有许多人居住在托维斯塔河岸边点缀的许多村庄中。大部分是人类，但其中也混杂着具有动物特征的独特而多样的变种，当地人声称这是古神的标志和祝福。</p>\n<h2

Their actions and choices will shape the fate of Drakkenheim, but the line between hero and villain rests entirely within one's point of view.</p>\n<p>Players shouldn't hesitate to create characters who are often at odds with the established order of the world. The world's nations, factions, religions, and laws exist to present compelling conflicts and deep dilemmas, and players should embrace characters who seek to challenge, defy, and resist them. When creating your character's backstory and personality, consider the following questions to deeply connect them to the forces at play in the setting:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>What was your character doing while civil war wracked Westemär?</li>\n  <li>How do the conflicts in the world affect your character's desires and goals?</li>\n  <li>Are your character's friends and family affected by these conflicts?</li>\n  <li>How does your character view the mages of the<br />Amethyst Academy?</li>\n  <li>What is their opinion of the Divine Matriarch of the Faith of the Sacred Flame?</li>\n  <li>Which noble houses hold your character's respect or rivalry?</li>\n  <li>Does your character care about who rules the nations of the continent?</li>\n  <li>What does your character think about delerium?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Player characters will face antagonists who defiantly wish to hold on to the old ways or aim to enforce their particular vision for the way the world ought to be. Meanwhile, the looming threat of otherworldly forces beyond mortal reckoning underpins a world slowly unraveling into chaos. Will your character meet these challenges head on, or be consumed by them?</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Exceptional Individuals</h2>\n<p>Adventurers of any race or class in the Core Rules can be found in the world of Drakkenheim. We've aimed to provide lots of ideas and inspiration for a wide variety of player character concepts, and believe a few well-considered constraints help foster creativity. However, players and Game Masters shouldn't shy away from making exceptions to the established lore when it comes to the origins and personal story of the player characters. After all, in many fantasy stories the protagonists are outsiders who don't quite fit into the world and every player should feel empowered to play the class, race, or background that speaks to them. The player characters get to be the exceptions to the rule. That's the beginning of an exciting story!</p>\n<p>Regardless of your character's origin, consider the<br />following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Where did your character grow up?</li>\n  <li>What cities, nations, and places has your character visited before? What did they do there? Who might they know there?</li>\n  <li>Does your character have living family members, friends, or loved ones? Where are they? What are they doing?</li>\n  <li>How did your character gain their class features and abilities?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Interconnected Relationships</h2>\n<p>Consider establishing a personal connection between two or more player characters, such as one of the following: They are…</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>...siblings, cousins, or childhood friends.</li>\n  <li>...a shared origin, religion, or teacher.</li>\n  <li>...former rivals turned unlikely allies.</li>\n  <li>...one saved the life of the other.</li>\n  <li>...saw each other in a dream or vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Personal Quests</h2>\n<p>A character's core motivation for adventuring is represented by their Personal Quest. This is a specific individual objective for player characters to achieve during the campaign. The players do not need to reveal their characters' Personal Quests to each other.</p>\n<p>When a character completes their Personal Quest, they choose one of the following rewards:</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Improvement</strong>. One ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.</p>\n<p><strong>New Feat</strong>. You gain a bonus feat of your choice, subject to the GM's approval.</p>\n<p>We've provided a few ideas for a personal quest related to each core class in Fifth Edition, but players can work with Game Masters to create one of their own design.</p>"

Yet this woman felt their approach before they even noticed her. As they draw their blades, she stands to face them, alone, unarmed, and unarmored.

The sorcerer-kings destroyed many holy symbols and divinely empowered artifacts. The continent's first monks were forged in the rebellion against the sorcerer-kings, when a group of devout and faithful warriors channeled their divine powers into martial practices. While these monks could not master true divine spellcasting, they discovered how the meditative disciplines merged with martial practices led them to a higher spiritual state.</p>\n<p>These warrior-monks, imbued by the flame, led the devout in a rebellion against the sorcerer-kings after the fall of Saint Tarna. They sparked new hope into the Sacred Flame, when the sorcerer-kings thought they had squashed the rebellion by seizing holy relics and outlawing divine magic.</p>\n<p>In the time since the fall of the sorcerer-kings, the Faith has built many monasteries. These locations are holy places where monks train to harness the light of the flame through deep meditation. They practice martial arts and follow the sacred texts of the Flame. in their own way. The Isles of Skye houses one of the largest and most notable monasteries to the Sacred Flame, and many worshippers travel there to live a life in service to the flame. Regardless of the faith they follow, monks dedicate their lives to honing divine energy into themselves, perfecting their skills, mastering ancient combat techniques, and purifying their body and mind.</p>\n<p>While there are some ancient reports of druidic warriors who could channel the natural elements into their fighting style, most monks are dedicated to the Faith. Monks that meditate on the powers of primal elements, or follow the Old Gods, might very well be the first divine warriors of the lands. They share a lot of similarity to barbarians in their ancient traditions and paths, but with a dedication to control and calm, over brute strength and rage.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table041\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I only speak when it is absolutely necessary that I do so.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>I always have an anecdote to explain any situation.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p>I enjoy the beauty of this world and take every opportunity to embrace it.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Ideals</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table042\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Open.</strong> I have much to learn from others, and I embrace every opportunity to do so.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Cunning.</strong> I know I am capable, and many who doubt me have learned quickly not to do so.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Suspicious.</strong> Question everything: nothing in this world is as it seems, people especially.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Bonds</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table043\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>The order of my faith or tradition has sent me and I must do right by them.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>I am fascinated by new places, and this is my first time leaving my home.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p>I was exiled, and cannot return until I prove myself worthy.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Flaws</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table044\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I am so devoted to my faith or tradition that it blinds me from seeing other points of view.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>Sometimes I am so lost in meditation that I forget there are others around me.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p>I think less of the unconscious people who have not found the light within them.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Personal Quest</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table045\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I have traveled far in hopes of taking the Sacrament of the Falling Fire and joining their divine purpose.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>I have heard a rumor of a temple of monks to the Sacred Flame up in the Pale Teeth Mountains.

During the reign of the sorcerer-kings, Tarna turned away from her wicked ways and found redemption by swearing the first sacred oath before the archangels Michael and Gabriella. She fought righteously against the darkness of her time, and her martyrdom inspired the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Following her example, many have taken up the holy paladin's mantle and dedicated their lives to serve the Sacred Flame as champions of justice and hope.</p>\n<p>Today, most paladins are valiant warriors who take divine oaths and or venture forth on sacred missions, protecting the innocent from the deadly extraplanar forces which threaten the world. They are master combatants, but also devout worshippers who through meditation and practice are able to tap into divine magic. Many join knightly orders, such as the storied Silver Order of Elyria.</p>\n<p>Although the term “paladin” is most closely associated with the Silver Order and the tales of Saint Tarna, the word has been used to describe many outside the faith of the Sacred Flame who follow similar traditions with different gods. The dwarves of Ironhelm Ridge are defended by knightly protectors who swear oaths to Danu and Gaibhne, and among the elven communities of Eladria are paladins devoted to Arwyn, Morrigan, and Phantasia.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table047\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I do not respect those who do not share my faith and views.

Often separated from the heavily armored knights and soldiers, rangers stick to the fringes of society and are often seen as lone travelers who spent time surviving the wilds, or living amongst a druidic circle for a time. Rangers might be guerilla operatives of military organizations, bringing inventive tactics and skills to the battlefield, or protecting innocent people from the beasts and monsters occupying the untamed wilds of the continent.</p>\n<p>On the continent and beyond there are many skilled survivalists who travel to see the great sights, exploring the world to learn or adventure. These outlanders live a life on the road, venturing from location to location and aspiring to remain outside of society as nothing more than a wanderer. Some are simple survivors who lost their home to war or disaster, and are simply trying to reclaim what was lost to them.</p>\n<p>Many elven rangers hail from the Isles of Skye, protecting their sacred lands or traveling to see what the rest of the world has to offer. The Jungles of Terene have a great force of warriors who use the environments of the jungle, and commune with the animals who live there. Sometimes these jungle warriors ride fierce beasts into battle as mounts or fight alongside them.</p>\n<p>In Westemär, the Hooded Lanterns represent the remnants of the guards of Drakkenheim and the military sent to investigate the ruins. These rangers are more attuned to urban survival. They are military strategists, able to navigate ruins and rubble with ease, move swiftly through dangerous monster infested landscapes and get the drop on their enemies.</p>\n<p>Rangers are known to be resourceful and practical, mastering a wide range of martial and wilderness survival skills. Seeking every advantage they can, rangers often dabble in practical spellcasting. However, a ranger's magic comes not from their own power, but through knowledge of how to use material components, herbs, tools, traps, and natural conditions to invoke a bit of spontaneous magic from the environment itself. Occasionally, a ranger might master a true low-level spell taught to them after helping a local druid or witch.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table053\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I am calculating and precise in everything I do.

They might be members of organized guilds or military strike teams specialized in covert operations, or crime lords ruling from the shadows. Rogues have some elements in common though. They are quiet and deadly combatants, who are skilled at taking out their chosen target.</p>\n<p>The Jaggers of Caspia are well known for training noble rogues who hold high reputation amongst their people, and are called upon for stealth strikes or assassinations in Caspia's many wars. Elyria has a known underbelly of scoundrels operating in the shadows, plotting just below the surface of their pristine city of Lumen. In Westemär the gangs of thieves, bandits, and ruffians have banded together under the guidance of a Queen of Thieves who has organized an army of rogues into a dangerous force.</p>\n<p>Rogues and scoundrels have been making their fortunes recently by the smuggling of delerium, the dangerous rocks fetch a high price, and many mages and distant lands want in on the power these crystals contain, and so the smuggling operations of rogues have been running rampant through the continent.</p>\n<p>Rogues can hail from any nation, and work for any organization. The Hooded Lanterns, and many military organizations use rogues for covert operations and scouting. Some work as mercenaries for anyone who needs something done quietly. A rogue might be a noble duelist, or a streetwise survivor. They could be a smuggler, thief, or a skilled assassin looking for their next contract.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table059\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I trust my skills and cunning over anyone else's.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I enjoy keeping an air of mystery around my past and my goals.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I thrive on outwitting those around me.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Ideals</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table060\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p class=\"chart\"><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Redemption.</strong> Every scoundrel and criminal has a story and a reason for their path.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p class=\"chart\"><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Greed.</strong> To acquire wealth, live in splendor, and grow old and fat is my dream.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td>\n                <p class=\"chart\"><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Loyalty.</strong> I respect and trust my friends or faction to the end.

He winces from the coursing pain as his veins bulge and his eyes illuminate with an eldritch glow.

The mageborn trait is passed on through the generations. Some sorcerers come from long lines of powerful arcanists — some even descended from powerful lines of mages tracing back to the sorcerer-kings of old — while others are wild talents, manifesting the latent potential long dormant in their families. Others gain the trait through magical or mysterious circumstances encountered at birth or a very young age.</p>\n<p>Most sorcerers manifest their powers by puberty. These spells and magical effects are often chaotic and destructive, and most young sorcerers have trouble controlling their powers until they receive proper training. As such, the mages of the Amethyst Academy devote considerable resources to locating those with sorcerous potential. By law, the Academy can take children as young as age six as wards. Those who take well to Academy education learn to refine their natural talents and become wizards. However, others struggle with such methods, or are not found until late puberty by the purple-robed mages. This enables their true sorcerous potential to flourish, and with less restraint and discipline, their magic diverges from the techniques of wizards, though shares the same origin. They choose emotion, drive, and intuition in place of advanced study, relying on their training to hone their skills to a level of control so they are no longer a danger to themselves or others.</p>\n<p>Amongst the Amethyst Academy, most sorcerers become field agents, investigators, and ambassadors rather than researchers and instructors, giving up academics for a purpose to use their skills more readily. Nevertheless, as mageborn, sorcerers are beholden to the terms of the Edicts of Lumen.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table064\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td>1</td>\n              <td>I am endlessly curious, especially when it comes to unique magic and otherworldly oddities.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>2</td>\n              <td>I strive to do good in this world, but constantly feel like my magic is a problem and not a solution.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>3</td>\n              <td>I consider myself clever and cunning.

Long before the rise of the sorcerer-kings, the first people to acquire arcane spellcasting were humans who sought out eldritch pacts with demons, angels, fey, dragons, and entities from distant realms for survival during an age of endless winter millennia ago. From these pacts, their blood was tainted with arcane power and their children were the first mageborn.</p>\n<p>In the modern world, most warlocks emerge due to either necessity, curiosity, or unfortunate accident. Many become warlocks not because they sought out an eldritch patron intentionally, but because these entities approached them in a desperate moment with an offer of power. Others become warlocks because they crave the potential that magic wields. Motivated by jealousy and greed, these warlocks often fall under the influence of fiendish and diabolical patrons seeking mortal pawns to advance their wicked schemes. Other warlocks are children of mageborn parents who hold no capabilities for magic, and forge an eldritch pact to live up to the expectations of their magical family members. On rare occasions, unknowable beings from far realms seek out individuals to use as their chosen ones, and grant them powers in exchange for service.</p>\n<p>Warlocks with malevolent patrons typically avoid the Amethyst Academy. Due to the nature of how warlocks acquire their powers — often as adults — it's extraordinarily rare to find a young warlock among the student body. Furthermore, since a warlock's eldritch patron acts as their mentor and instructor in magic, many warlocks may feel they have little to learn from Academy professors.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Amethyst Academy cautiously welcomes warlocks into their ranks, as often a warlock's unique connection to an extraplanar entity can bring valuable arcane knowledge. Experienced Academy instructors understand how a warlock's relationship with their patrons can be dangerous or problematic, but also that a warlock will always produce mageborn children. In some cases, Academy professors monitor these ties to distant beings amongst their students and faculty, but for the most part, warlocks are treated as equals to the great sorcerers and wizards of the world.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table070\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td>1</td>\n              <td><p>My familiar is an avatar of my patron.

Though their magical powers originate in the same manner as a sorcerer — through bloodlines and lineages — a wizard's training tames their inborn chaotic and unpredictable sorcerous abilities, allowing them to master a wider range of spells through disciplined techniques. Like sorcerers, the Amethyst Academy seeks out those with magical potential and brings them under their guardianship around the age of six, though their full magical training does not begin until puberty.</p>\n<p>On the continent, a wizard's strictly controlled instruction is carried out exclusively by the Amethyst Academy. It is not enough for a mageborn to learn this craft from a spellbook alone. Wizardly education demands years of apprenticeship under a careful mentor, and includes physical and mental conditioning alongside guided study of complex arcane theories and formulae. As a result, a wizard who was not raised and trained within the Amethyst Academy is almost unheard of. Although very rare, travelers from distant lands outside the reach of the Academy have shown up with advanced knowledge of arcane spellcasting. There are tales of other organizations and rival schools across the ocean who have their own practices and studies to train wizards in arcane magic.</p>\n<p>Once a wizard has completed their apprenticeship, it is up to them to decide whether or not they wish to advance within the ranks of the Amethyst Academy or depart to pursue their own interests. Those who strive to climb the ranks of the Academy can access fantastic resources and vast libraries of magical lore, but are required to work under the strict hierarchy of the bureaucratic organization.</p>\n<p>Other wizards are appointed to noble courts, and spend their days as advisors to the nobility, and some set up their own shops to peddle arcane services. The most adventurous mages travel the world in search for new magics, people, places, and ancient artifacts. Many of the great libraries of the world house Academy-trained wizards who dedicate themselves to the uncovering and protection of lore and history, keeping records and details of world events, and non-magical study, these wizards are responsible for making sure that all magical texts and spell books are sent to academy strongholds for proper safeguarding and study.</p>\n<p>Whether or not they remain within the Academy hierarchy, all mageborn must abide the rules of the Edicts of Lumen. Those who do not are declared malfeasants, and hunted by mages and paladins alike.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table078\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I am always buried in books, and distracted easily by a good library or bookshelf.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p>I use big words and complicated explanations to show my<br />vast intellect.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td>\n                <p>I ignore niceties and polite social queues and just say what<br />I am thinking, or what I think others won't say.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Ideals</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table079\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Inclusion.</strong> I strive to make the world better for mageborn.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Education.</strong> To share knowledge and wisdom is the greatest good one can do.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Secrecy.</strong> There are things about this world that should be kept from ordinary people for their own safety.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Bonds</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table080\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>My mentor taught me all I know.

class=\"dropcap\">本章节内容涵盖了各种族在世界舞台上所扮演角色的简要历史及其解析。它勾勒出了它们可能的起源以及它们在当前世界中的生活状态。利用本节内容，可以丰富你的角色背景故事，或在创建角色时激发新的背景设定和个人追求的灵感。</p>\n<p>那些来自异界和其他位面的生物，将世界上的人类视作\"凡人\"，并把我们所在的物质位面称为\"凡人世界\"。钻研这些议题的智者和学者有时也会采纳这些称呼，这样的命名惯例因此在学术界得到了广泛的应用。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">人类</h1>\n<p>人类是大陆上最为常见且数量最众多的居民，几乎占据了总人口的95%。在当今的时代，人类在整个大陆上建立了辉煌的国家、广袤的领土和强大的帝国。从历史上看，最为人称道的君王、宗教领袖、伟大的法师、军事将领以及臭名昭著的恶人均出自人类。在大陆的各个角落，除了极个别的例外，人类构成了每一个主要城市、乡村和镇落的主体。</p>\n<p>人类在体态、面容特征、眼睛、头发和皮肤的颜色以及性别上展现出了极为丰富的多样性，这种多样性在大陆的每一个国家中都能找到其体现。尽管人们传承了许多古老的宗教习俗，但在今天，大多数人依然信奉着神圣之火。除了这一共同的信仰之外，人类还保留着各种各样的时尚风格、传统习惯和社会规范，这些差异主要是基于地理位置的不同而形成的，人们通常将自己的出生地视为家园。因此，无论是生活在伊利瑞亚、卡斯皮亚还是维斯特玛的人们，都对自己的国家有着深厚的认同感。尽管这些国家的人民在沟通、旅行和贸易方面进行了广泛的互动，但他们之间也同样频繁地因土地所有权、政治分歧等重大问题或一些较为琐碎的原因而产生敌对情绪、纷争乃至全面的冲突。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">人类起源</h2>\n<p>人类早期历史是神话和传说的主题；关于人类起源，没有达成一致的历史事实。神圣之火的信仰教导，人类是由光明和阴影组成的不完整存在，必须通过过着正义的生活来变得完整。然而，宗教文本对生命本身的起源几乎没有提及。另一方面，关于古神的各种传说讲述了人类是在风暴之诺登斯的命令下从海沫中出现，或是由始祖女神达努播种、耀阳之鲁格培育的种子中长出来的。还有一些传说说，神匠盖布尼用黏土、尘土和岩石塑造了他们的身体，或者说人类曾作为毁灭之神克罗马克控制下的野兽，直到月亮猎手阿尔温驯服并教导了他们。</p>\n<p>魔法最初是如何传给早期人类的，同样是神秘而未知的 —— 人类在记录历史之前就已经能施展魔法。有一个传说讲述了一个持续了数个世纪的严冬降临到整个世界。绝望求生的人类向宇宙呼唤帮助，愿意付出任何代价来换取他们在无尽的雨雪中生存所需的魔法。人类得到了他们的愿望，但关于这是由女巫莫瑞甘施放的诅咒、贤者欧格姆的礼物，还是欺诈之神谢戈拉奇的恶作剧，各种说法不一。更多的人说这并不是古神，而是更加黑暗和可怕的东西回应了人类的呼唤。无论是谁或是什么与古代人类签订了这个契约，魔法的力量自那时起就一直流淌在他们的血液中。他们为获得这种力量付出了什么代价不得而知，但所有的故事都有一个共同的细节：人类的债务从未完全偿还。</p>\n<p>然而，数个世纪后，人类继续与神秘存在交易，以扩大他们对魔法的控制。他们将自己的血统与许多异界和超自然生物交融，从这些结合中产生了龙裔、提夫林等混血血统。在很大程度上，这些人被视为共同的人类祖先，并被看作人类整体多样性的一部分。</p>\n<p>人类最伟大的帝国也是最大的愚行；古老的奥法王朝的巫王统治了大陆一千年之久。然而，从这些黑暗时期中，当圣塔尔娜将神圣之火的光明带给了大陆的人民时，人类得到了拯救。在今天的世界中，人类仍然处于所有重大冲突和动荡的中心。事实上，德拉肯海姆的世界是一个非常人类化的地方，人类的所有缺点和特质都被放大展现。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">创建人类角色</h2>\n<p>人类遍布大陆的每个角落，蔓延至各个国家。你所扮演的人类角色，可以源自你心之所向的任何地域。卓越的人类冒险者或许出身于卡斯匹亚，那里培育了既强健英勇的骑士和机智的诗人，他们远行冒险，旨在考验自身的实力并为家族争取荣耀。伊利瑞亚是那些对神圣之火虔诚之人的信仰之地，其牧师和圣武士们常常肩负使命，向世界各地传播光明与正义。或许，你的角色来自破碎国度维斯特玛，那里坚毅的游侠、游荡者和战争幸存者渴望重建家园，或在贵族之间的权力斗争中谋求一席之地。也可能，你的角色自幼被紫晶学院所收留，成为法师或术士，他们在这所充满奇幻魔法的学院中长大，对自己的出生之地一无所知。从泰瑞尼的原始德鲁伊到冥风冻原的野蛮人，人类角色可以扮演各式各样的冒险者，支持任意派系或国度，源自世界的任何一个角落。</p>\n<img

奥法血缘\n</h1>\n<p>龙裔和提夫林组成了整个大陆上第二大的人口。他们直接是源自与魔法生物达成契约和盟约的人类后代，并被接纳和欢迎为人类大家庭的一部分。特别是龙裔可能具有更多的人类特征，只有鳞片、小角、尾巴或甚至翅膀标志着他们龙类的遗传，而提夫林的异族特征则更加鲜明。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">历史</h2>\n<p>在奥法王朝的黄金时代，巫王和他忠实的追随者寻求各种方法来增强他们的天生魔力。这些奥术暴君不再追求通过学习和勤奋来获得知识，而是选择将自己的血脉与源自魔法的生物结合。其中最重要的是远古龙和恶毒的邪魔，有些甚至俘虏了天使和巨灵进行亵渎的实验。从中诞生了第一批提夫林、龙裔和许多其他这样的类人后代种族。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">创建奥法血脉角色</h2>\n<p>在人类亲属的广阔家族中，拥有奥法血脉的冒险者的多样性不亚于任何人类社群。对他们而言，成为魔法血脉者或血液中带有某种奥术力量是极其普遍的现象——一个没有某种潜在魔法能力的提夫林被视为异类。继承了这些奥法血脉的个体通常成为诗人、术士、邪术士和法师，他们穿着紫色长袍在城市街头的身影更为常见，而不是其他服饰。而有些人选择放弃他们的奥法继承，转而信仰宗教，成为牧师或圣武士。</p>\n<h1

/>\n<p>精灵极为罕见，在德拉肯海姆世界中只有几千人。精灵族裔主要作为漂泊的避难者居住在德拉肯海姆世界上——传说称精灵来自另一个完全不同的世界。他们大部分被遗忘的历史是古老的，他们的祖先在世界各处的隐蔽地方留下了神秘的废墟。每个精灵都是魔法血脉者，尽管并非每个精灵都发展出他们天生的魔法能力。</p>\n<p>然而，现如今，他们的人数正在减少。如今，大多数精灵独自居住在文明边缘的隐士或小部落中。唯一已知的精灵部落位于栖云岛的深处，在这里，凡人国度与精之异界和梦境之异界之间的界限模糊不清。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">精灵后裔</h2>\n<p>在当今时代，半精灵的身影比起他们的纯血精灵亲族更为普遍，这是因为精灵的血脉在人类家谱中强烈而持久的延续着。经过与人类千年的共存，众多精灵与人类结成了家庭，他们的子嗣继承了明显的精灵特质，虽然真正拥有近代精灵血统的人并不多见。大部分人都是精灵的远裔。因此，整个大陆上几乎每个角落都能找到带有精灵血脉的人类。</p>\n<p>尽管如此，并非每个人都对自己的精灵血统给予了过多的关注。很多人仅仅将其视为家族谱系中的一个有趣特性，认为自己首先是人类，而大多数人类也以相同的视角看待半精灵。</p>\n<p>由于精灵总是魔法血脉者，他们的后代继承这一特质也极为常见。然而，与他们精灵祖先相比，这些后代拥有魔法血脉的普遍性并没有那么显著。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">历史</h2>\n<p>这是一个鲜为人知的事实：精灵最初并不存在于德拉肯海姆的世界中，精灵族的准确起源笼罩在神秘之中。即使是最古老的精灵也只能模糊地描述他们祖辈对精灵历史的记忆。</p>\n<p>最常见的传说声称精灵是通过阴影领域和精类之门从一个遥远未知的土地来到这个世界的。至于精灵为何离开，无人能说。一些学者推测现今的精灵只是一个更伟大文明的幸存者，那个文明遭遇了某种灾难性的终结。他们进一步推测，那些隐藏在偏远地区的摇摇欲坠的精灵遗迹，就是古代精灵为完成这次旅程而建造的强大魔法传送门所剩下的全部。事实上，探险家们报告称在这些异族塔楼和闪闪发光的巨石建筑中发现了奇异的奥术技术和先进的魔法，这些建筑是由远古精灵建造的。</p>\n<p>尽管精灵们来到这个世界时似乎对自己的起源毫无记忆，但他们确实带来了强大的魔法知识，并谨慎地与他们的新邻居人类分享。不幸的是，精灵们被奥法王朝的巫王们猎杀，这些巫王嫉妒他们天生的魔法天赋，但几个世纪后，精灵大法师们在建立紫晶学院作为受迫害魔法血脉者的避难所方面发挥了重要作用。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">创建精灵角色</h2>\n<p>精灵角色总是魔法血脉者；许多人通过成为术士或法师来拥抱他们的魔法天赋。精灵被列为紫晶学院中最熟练的法师之一。然而，其他精灵选择走上更具战斗性的道路，只是涉足魔法；许多精灵成为游侠。还有一些精灵具有深厚的精神追求，试图通过信仰古神作为牧师和德鲁伊来寻找他们人民祖先记忆的任何痕迹。然而，一个信仰神圣之火的精灵崇拜者将是一个真正的异类。</p>\n<p>相比之下，半精灵更像他们的人类表亲。在他们中可以找到任何职业、天职和使命的角色，特别是那些更融入大陆各国和文化的人。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">矮人：石塑者</h1>\n<p>矮人自称为世界上最早的居民。他们的传说中，神匠盖布尼以其巧夺天工之手将矮人铸造出来，目的是辅助众神打造地球的底座。直至今日，矮人们坚信自己的存在是伟大神匠智慧的结晶。不但石头的沉重是他们传说的佐证，矮人的建筑遗迹从地球最深的地底延伸至最高的山巅，无处不在。</p>\n<p>在当代，矮人变得相对罕见。大部分矮人已经融入人类社会，在其中公开生活，把他们的一生献给了工艺、石雕和采矿。然而，值得一提的是，仍有一些矮人家族坚守着他们古老的传统和根源，居住在微光山脉和铁盔之脊的山城及矿坑之中。矮人是唯一拥有庞大城邦的非人类种族，尽管他们并未统治任何国家。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">历史</h2>\n<p>许多城市的基底留有矮人石工的遗迹，许多下水道和引水渠是建于古老矮人隧道和运河之上，这些运河的最初用途已经失传。事实上，矮人说这些废墟来自于一个时代，他们建造了横跨世界的巨大城市，直到一个寒冷的时代让他们全部深入地下生存。在传奇般的穿越深暗时期，他们建造了几乎无尽的隧道、大厅和人工洞穴，寻找地球的核心，在那里他们可以在达努的炽热核心旁生存，这个地方在矮人语中被称为\"沃尔·达努恩\"。传说称矮人族在那里建造了一个庞大的都市，在那里生活了数千年。当然，已经没有记录表明这座城市可能在哪里或如何到达那里。尽管只有少数矮人真正相信这个故事，但偶尔会有一位勇敢的年轻人或长者打包行囊，冒险进入深处寻找\"沃尔·达努恩\"。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">创建矮人角色</h2>\n<p>许多矮人对先古信仰有个人解释；一些矮人擅长利用原初和神圣魔法，成为德鲁伊和牧师。矮人有强大的军事传统，致力于达努、盖布尼和努阿达的矮人圣武士是少数在神圣之火信仰之外知名的圣武士之一，这是大多数矮人认为是胡说八道的宗教。那些接受人类信仰的少数矮人被他们的同族视为疯子。</p>\n<p>矮人很少天生具有魔法天赋，因此在紫晶学院中极少见到他们。然而，极少数矮人确实获得了奥术能力。矮人长期以来一直保持着制作魔法物品的传统，许多矮人对紫晶学院独裁管理魔法物品的销售和制造权感到愤慨。</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\"矮人们利用巧思和精湛工艺制造了火炮和威力惊人的武器。当我生气时，我轻轻一弹指就能炸毁建筑物。我赢了。\"</blockquote>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">\n  半身人、侏儒和地精：<br />\n  小地方\n</h1>\n<p>半身人遍布整个大陆，无论是宁静的城镇还是繁华的城市，都能见到他们的身影。然而，他们更偏爱在较小的乡镇和农田区域建立自己的社群，这样他们就能远离喧嚣的都市生活和那些居住在此的人群，享受宁静的家庭时光。目前，位于伊利瑞亚和维斯特玛的乡村半身人社区正好处于这两个地区主要的粮食生产中心。城市中的半身人则以他们丰富的农产品为基础，开展了各种重要的商业活动，包括面包房、酒厂、裁缝铺和酒吧。东部山谷里有一个几乎全由半身人居住的著名小村庄——亲族之丘，它由金色的山丘、肥沃的田地以及典型的乡村市场组成，是半身人静谧且朴素生活方式的典范所在。</p>\n<p>另一方面，那些被精类触碰过的侏儒和地精，倾向于更加隐秘地生活。他们常选在与世隔绝的自然环境中定居，如巨大树木的根部、布满蘑菇的洞穴、隐秘的瀑布背后，以及其他能激发对精类血统回忆的神秘地点，建造他们的家园。这些侏儒和地精对魔法、科技以及城市生活的便利性抱有浓厚兴趣；他们的社区往往是自然美景与蒸汽动力机械技术奇妙结合的产物。尽管他们之间存在许多共通之处，侏儒和地精的现代文化却孕育了彼此之间的激烈竞争和偶尔的敌对关系，虽然一些坦率且富有冒险精神的人士仍旧希望能够修复这些破裂的联系。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">历史</h2>\n<p>半身人在任何书面历史之前就居住在他们的山丘和山谷中，他们的人民中很少有人关心记录或叙述他们的起源。有一些传说称，半身人是由古神谢戈拉奇创造来取悦他，或者是达努和鲁格最小的孩子。</p>\n<p>如今生活在大陆上的侏儒和地精是许多纪元前从精之异界穿越到这个位面的后代，大多数是出于偶然或好奇——这些人中最大的族群仍居住在精之国度。一些智者推测侏儒和地精有关联，是同一枚硬币的两面。然而，侏儒和地精会无休止地争论他们之间没有关系，彼此完全不同。不过，两者都具有很强的魔法和发明倾向，当这两种激情相遇时，通常会产生爆炸性的结果。</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">创建半身人、侏儒和地精角色</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/133-pg121-goblin-doll-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside:url(&quot;modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/133-pg121-goblin-doll-cmyk.webp&quot;)\" />\n<p>半身人、侏儒和地精往往一辈子都生活在家乡和社区的舒适中，从不离开。然而，每一代都有少数半身人被一种驱使他们追求伟大抱负的漫游欲所困扰。有着魔法血脉的半身人更常成为吟游诗人，但在紫晶学院中也有一些著名的半身人法师和术士。甚至有一些杰出的半身人勇士曾与覆影明灯和白银骑士团并肩作战。尽管身材矮小，但没有人怀疑这些生物的勇敢和坚韧，也不怀疑他们能够取得的伟大成就。像精灵一样，侏儒和地精几乎都是魔法血脉者，但他们更倾向于隐藏自己的能力。只有少数人成为紫晶学院的成员，而那些成为成员的人通常都会表现出色。</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">罕见血缘</h1>\n<p>在其他第五版规则出版物中，描述了众多独特的角色血统，这些血统的范围远远超出了本书的讨论界限，它们在德拉肯海姆的世界观中也未找到确切的位置。然而，如果你渴望在德拉肯海姆扮演一个更为奇特或罕见的类人角色，我们非常鼓励你这样做。</p>\n<p>尽管这些罕见血统的角色数量远不及人类，但在这片大陆上，仍旧居住着许多其他种族。有时，他们的起源成谜，而在其他时候，他们在这个世界中的历史甚至比任何已知种族都要悠久。不管他们的外貌、起源或习俗如何，他们都应受到与其他所有人相同的尊重，并且在这个世界的各个国家、社会、宗教和组织中找到属于自己的一席之地。</p>\n<p>例如，在泰瑞尼的土地上，可以找到龟人族和鸟人族，许多人认为他们是该地区的原住民，并得到了古神的祝福。奥利昂拥有众多的猫族和狮族，而冥风冻原则是半巨人的故乡。谁又能确切地说，围绕大陆周边的诸多岛屿上，可能隐藏着哪些神秘的水族呢？</p>\n<p>如果你有更为不寻常的角色构想，我们建议你可以将这些角色设定为：</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>来自遥远的未知大陆或异世界的旅行者</li>\n  <li>魔法实验的产物</li>\n  <li>种族的最后幸存者</li>\n</ul>\n<p>另一方面，如果你希望捕捉到德拉肯海姆世界中的低魔氛围，可以考虑要求至少一半的队伍成员创建人类角色（或具有人类血统的角色，如半精灵和提夫林），和/或限制不超过一名玩家选择第五版规则中的其他罕见类人血统角色选项。在德拉肯海姆中，奇遇之所以显得更加特殊和异乎寻常，正是因为这种对比。因此，这样的设置可能会加强宇宙恐怖和异域主题的体验。</p>\n<p>然而，这只是一个有趣的建议，并非硬性要求。游戏体验的丰富性至关重要，你完全可以尝试并塑造属于你自己的德拉肯海姆世界。最重要的是，玩家能够创造出令他们感到兴奋和激动的角色，而不必过分拘泥于设定的\"神圣不可侵犯性\"。毕竟，作为故事的主角，玩家角色本就应当具有独特性和例外性。</p>"

They wield their knowledge to both heal and harm, augmenting their conventional skills with alchemy and occult magic. Some apothecaries might first attempt treatment with traditional means like medicinal herbs and surgical techniques. When these mundane methods are not enough, they use arcane magic and eldritch forces to restore their patients. An apothecary's unique skills prove useful whether their patients suffer from natural or supernatural ailments, but apothecaries possess knowledge of the body which can be used for more than just healing. Their arcane methods can strengthen, transform, or protect their allies, and some apothecaries know deadly techniques which can harm and kill their enemies. An apothecary understands how the difference between a poison and a cure lies often only in the dose.</p>\n<p>Their careful study of life and death gives an apothecary the tools to both help allies survive horrible ailments, injuries, and pluck them from the clutches of death, or use their enemies as test subjects for their dangerous compounds, terrible diseases and poisonous magic.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Knowledge Seekers</h2>\n<p>Most apothecaries set out with the goal of furthering their studies and expanding their magical horizons, uncovering new ways to wield magic for dangerous or life-saving effects, and learning forbidden knowledge kept from the rest of the world. They believe that knowledge is power, and see themselves as seekers of knowledge. Some kinder apothecaries see their duty as protectors of the innocent, dedicating their lives to helping sick and injured people. Others see every opportunity to exploit the weak and push their search for true power forward. Many fall somewhere in between, riding the lines of mad scientist and renowned doctor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Occult Practitioners</h2>\n<p>Apothecaries seek out occult lore and use it to study and practice scientific theories. Many of their magical incantations, whether it be for the purposes of saving lives, or ending them, are deemed experimental. Many apothecaries keep a notebook close at hand and write down esoteric theories based on their findings and field work.</p>\n<p>Apothecaries are gaining renown within some remote communities on the continent as doctors and healers to whom one can turn to instead of religious figures. However, they are more often viewed as dangerous scientists and mysterious witches who use magic to create toxins and poisons that could eradicate entire armies.</p>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Creating an Apothecary</h1>\n<p>When you set out to create an apothecary, the most important question is to decide your path of study. What is it that drives you to seek knowledge? Are you working in the service of good? Is your life dedicated to helping those in need? By studying poisons, diseases, occult lore, and forbidden knowledge, do you hope to help the sick and wounded? Perhaps you aim to save someone you care about, or protect your kingdom or homeland from the evils of this world. Or maybe your studies are more dangerous in nature. Do you set out on adventure to test your dangerous chemical formulae? Do you see each monster or enemy as a test subject for your concoctions and spells?</p>\n<p>All apothecaries share a search for knowledge, and dabble in forbidden lore and occult practices. Although many in their practice are happy to sell their services or potions in cities or to well-paying nobles and kings, some are called to adventure, setting out on the endless hunt for knowledge. Others work as investigators and researchers. Many apothecaries see adventure as a means to perform direct field research, perfect their skills, and test the true potential of their theories.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Quick Build</h2>\n<p>You can make an apothecary quickly by following these suggestions.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.</li>\n  <li>Second, choose your character ancestry and background.</li>\n  <li>Third, choose the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.dtoYtccI3x7J3KVy] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8zT7njvqbpXs4Cel] cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.x9rCqOtPhpL6F68C] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1].</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 class=\"standard-h1\">Apothecaries in Drakkenheim</h1>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Apothecaries can be found throughout the continent in many forms. The term is broadly used to describe many magic-adjacent professions found on the continent and the vast array of possible fields of study is ever expanding.</p>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy has departments of apothecaries managing their labs and research centers. Within their many schools and strongholds, they teach advanced sciences and using magic to better understand the body and mind, and the various modern medical practices that can be combined with magic to save lives — or end them.</p>\n<p>Not all apothecaries are mageborn. The broad term has been used to describe several practices that combine herbal ingredients, chemicals, and poisons with biological study to induce outcomes similar to the effects of evocation or necromantic magic. Pathogenists working in distant labs perform studies to create new powerful strains of disease and poison. Chemists find ways to surpass the potency of mageborn spellcasting with the right dose of chemicals for their explosive and destructive results. Other Mutagenists working with the mutating effects of delerium seek to control and isolate the elements of mutation and apply them in a more controlled manner. There are even reports of apothecaries who are studying techniques to unlock the potential of the mind. These Alienists have caused a stir amongst nobles, mages, and clergy for their ability to tap into mental capabilities that mirror magic, without requiring a mageborn's lineage.</p>\n<p>Secretive reanimators pursue grisly studies into the realms of death and undeath, mimicking necromantic magic using little more than new science and invention. There are apothecaries working under the Sacred Flame as exorcists, channeling their occult knowledge and research into helping rid holy sites of undead, dispatch unwanted spirits, and remove terrible curses.</p>\n<p>Apothecaries are found on every continent; whether mageborn or not, many are skilled academics who have a keen mind for pushing the boundaries of science. These researchers have found themselves on the path of the apothecary, lending their aid to cities and towns throughout the continent, and occasionally bringing unique chemical warfare to the battlefield of great wars.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table001\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I often use big scientific words; I just can't help but to embellish my superior intellect.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I have a dark sense of humor.

Refer to the Core Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing in this book for the apothecary spell list.</p>\n  <h3>Formula Book</h3>\n  <p>You have a book or collection of notes that you study to prepare your apothecary spells, develop your @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.9ygVgpyoY5TC6QhV], and record your occult practices. You may use your formula book as an arcane focus for your apothecary spells. You may describe this book any way you like. Some examples of your book's appearance include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A large leatherbound tome with yellowing pages bound shut with an iron lock</li>\n    <li>A scattered assortment of scribbled notes loosely held together by rope</li>\n    <li>A pristine journal with perfect edges and beautiful penmanship</li>\n    <li>A leather briefcase with two small golden locks</li>\n    <li>A medical bag with surgical symbols on the sides</li>\n    <li>A beat-up satchel slung over one shoulder with vials and bottles poking out of every pocket</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>If the book is destroyed or lost, you can recreate it using inks and paper during a long rest.</p>\n  <h3>Cantrips</h3>\n  <p>You know three cantrips of your choice from the apothecary spell list. You learn additional apothecary cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Apothecary table.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong><em>Elementary Reformulation.</em></strong><em></em> Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one apothecary cantrip you know with another cantrip from the apothecary spell list.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n  <p>The Apothecary table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your apothecary spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your apothecary spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n  <p>You prepare the list of apothecary spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the apothecary spell list. When you do so, choose a number of apothecary spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your apothecary level (minimum of one spell). A spell you prepare must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Apothecary table's Slot Level column for your level.</p>\n  <p>For example, if you are a 5th-level apothecary, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, in any combination. To cast the 1st-level spell<em> cure wounds</em>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n  <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of apothecary spells requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n  <h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n  <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your apothecary spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and occult knowledge. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an apothecary spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n  <p class=\"save-dc\"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n  <p class=\"save-dc\"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n  <h3>Ritual Casting</h3>\n  <p>You can cast an apothecary spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n  <h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>\n  <p>You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section of the Core Rules) as a spellcasting focus for your apothecary spells.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"class-feature\">\n  <h2 class=\"name\">Occult Practices</h2>\n  <p>At 1st level, you take up one of the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.3wvDHPWvb3yfZH7b], a chosen discipline which defines your ongoing research of the body and spirit: the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.LJn6blcn7U3WZM0f], the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.066tdj7Ot5Sf9Xj2], the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.JGquN35T5lVUy5EH], the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.f9mSl94Qzz5xjeGF], the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.iBeOFPdnKuZESA43], or the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.eUqv8wW7ar9CuQXh].</p>\n  <p>Your choice grants you additional proficiencies and an expanded spell list at 1st level, and additional class features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"class-feature\">\n  <h2 class=\"name\">Esoteric Theories</h2>\n  <p>You have discovered esoteric theories, scraps of forbidden lore that you can use to augment your magical abilities.</p>\n  <p>At 2nd level, you gain two esoteric theories of your choice.

You learn an additional 6th level spell at 19th level, and an additional 7th level spell at 20th level.</p>\n  <p>You regain all uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n  <p style=\"text-indent:0\"><strong><em>Master Reformulation.</em></strong> Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level from the Apothecary spell list.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"class-feature\">\n  <h2 class=\"name\">Miraculous Recovery</h2>\n  <p>At 20th level, you can spend 5 minutes channeling power into a number of creatures (which can include yourself) equal to your Intelligence modifier to facilitate an abnormally fast recovery.

大陆上那些所谓的大国宣称每一片土地都属于他们。然而，世界上仍有许多荒蛮不羁的地方，生活在那里的人们拒绝将自由拱手交给任何领主、国家或信仰。为了让自己的生活免受纠缠于各国间的政治纷争的影响，他们必须战斗。在寒冷的冥风冻原的北地冻土、神秘的栖云岛、遥远的泰瑞尼丛林南部、炎热的龙爪山脉之峰等地，都居住着强大的勇士，他们一次又一次地奋起抵御着文明的入侵。</p>\n<p>这些野蛮人是勇猛无畏的战士。他们的战斗策略往往更倾向于传统方式，依赖纯粹的力量和灵巧，而非盔甲和战术。许多著名的战争领主都曾被称为野蛮人，其中有些人威名远扬且骁勇善战，有些则臭名昭著而残忍暴戾。东部山谷的侵略者克里斯托弗·卡恩，曾以征服为名在东部的自由地带开辟出一条血腥之路。铁盔矮人们则继承了狂战士的古老传统。栖云岛的诺斯福克人和冥风掠夺者都是著名的野蛮人族群。</p>\n<p>一些野蛮人对远古的古神怀有深深的信仰和崇敬，并自视为圣地的守护者。他们与德鲁伊关系密切，认为自己与大自然、动物和荒野是一体的，并将自己视作代表自然秩序的战士。而其他人只是宽松地维系着这些古老的传统。</p>\n<p>然而，有些野蛮人并不关心古神之道，他们活着就是为了战斗和冒险。许多人在维斯特玛内战期间作为雇佣兵出站，或成为了中海的海盗，甚至还有一些勇猛的卡斯匹亚战士是为了各自的家族而展示着自己的强大。</p>\n<aside

Once, many a passersby would drop copper pieces in his hat, eager to hear his stories and songs for the magical insights they tell. Now a sallow expression hangs over the bard, and his lyrics sing of a terrible doom coming from the stars beyond. Few heed these haunting words, unaware of the dangerous truths hidden within the puzzling verses.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Bards fine tune their magic through music, poetry, dance, and artwork. Weaving magic comes to bards like pulling the strings of a lute comes to a musician or brushstrokes to a painter, but to produce great magic requires talent honed by years of practice. While art and music have always been part of continental society, true bards are a rare breed, and only very recently has bardic magic been recognized as a distinct magical practice.</p>\n<p>The most famous bards hail from Caspia. The six Great Houses each have countless musicians, artists, and authors who accompany their scions, composing songs, poems, and creating other works of art to bolster their house's renown. Every Caspian noble leaves home with a trusty herald by their side to sing their praises and announce them, but having a magical bard amongst your entourage is a mark of true prestige well sought after by Caspian nobility. Oftentimes a particularly skilled bard will seek out a career in a Caspian noble house to leave their mark on the world. Yet for every famous Caspian bard, there are many more who seek their own adventures using their skills to help others or make their own fame and fortune.</p>\n<p>Most bards are thought to be mageborn who manifest their powers as teenagers or young adults, their powers latent until suddenly unlocked in a flash of creative inspiration. Creatively gifted mageborn who otherwise struggle to harness their magical abilities have found that performance, poetry, and song helps them cast certain spells in a more nuanced and controlled manner. However, a person with the right knack can master a cantrip or low-level spell without necessarily needing to be mageborn, and the power of art and music presents a pathway to much more powerful magic. Through mastery in their craft, bards can tap into the extraplanar forces to cast powerful spells, even though they lack the mageborn gene.</p>\n<p>As a result, there is still much dispute over whether bardic magic is a unique manifestation of mageborn magic, or whether it may be performed solely through the use of art and music. Bardic magic was not well known when the Edicts of Lumen were written. Many amongst the nobility and clergy believe bards should be held to the same restrictions and laws as mageborn, and disinherited from any noble claims. As such, bards often join the Amethyst Academy in hopes of refining and understanding their craft. Only recently has the school delved into art and music studies as a means of analyzing the unique nature of bardic magic.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table019\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p class=\"chart\">I take every opportunity to sing the praises of those I care<br />most about.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I enjoy the simple things in life; I find beauty in peace and quiet.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p class=\"chart\">I love to hear gossip and stories, and then retell them with much more flair.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Ideals</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table020\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p class=\"chart\"><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Beauty.</strong> I want to leave my mark on this world and make it a more beautiful place for everyone.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p class=\"chart\"><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Love.</strong> I do what I do for love.

The Flamekeeper addresses her assembled congregation as the last sliver of suns sets under the horizon. “Before one can understand the true potential of the light, one must also understand what lurks in the shadows.” As night falls and the stars appear one by one above, the priest continues her sermon: “Never forget that Tarna herself wore that cloak of blood and shadow ere she stood before the angels. Do not fear the darkness; it is nothing more than what lies in the hearts and souls of every mortal. Even when light and hope are but a glimmer, the smallest flame is bright enough to carry you through the deepest night.</p></div>\n    </div>\n  </blockquote>\n</article>\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Faith has a power all its own, and mortals have long sought the wisdom of the distant gods and divine forces they believe shaped the cosmos. Hoping to understand the true nature and purpose of the universe through deep meditation and spiritual discipline, priests, mystics, oracles, and prophets have found the means to tap into the spark of divine magic that thrums like a heartbeat connecting all things.</p>\n<p>However, the largely silent gods have posed many long-standing mysteries about the nature of the heavens and divinity, and mortals long struggled to fully harness divine magic. While arcane magic spread like a scourge through mortal bloodlines and druids channeled the elements, only a few clerics would emerge every generation. Nevertheless, these individuals brought wisdom and enlightenment to others, and through their words, mortals came to understand the will of the Old Gods.</p>\n<p>That changed, however, when the legendary Saint Tarna found the Sacred Flame. During her trials and tribulations, Tarna learned many divine truths from angelic beings, and lit the fires of a new faith. She revealed how those who demonstrate unwavering faith and devotion can form a powerful connection with the Sacred Fire and harness divine magic for righteous purposes. While the study, discipline, and intense meditation required to wield heavenly power makes it a difficult path that few can achieve, Tarna illuminated a pathway others could follow. Nevertheless, the true nature of divine magic remains dimly understood, and many clerics spend their twilight years contemplating these heavenly mysteries hoping the Sacred Flame will shed light on new truths.</p>\n<p>There are still clerics who uphold the tenets of faith to the Old Gods, and even clerics of shadow cults. The dwarves have clerics who worship ancient stones and blazing forges, while the elves have clerics more tied to nature, resembling druids to many outsiders. Gnomes and goblins keep faith in their own fey gods as well. Amongst all people there are those devoted to the holy path who have been able to harness divine magic, but none as prominently or numerous as those dedicated to the Sacred Flame.</p>\n<p>Today, clerics are often the heads of their congregations in many places of worship, though not every priest and acolyte is a divine spellcaster. Other clerics go on adventures serving the cause of their respective faith. Some seek to bring justice and faith back to the world; some go on holy quests to investigate world events and see if they find divine purpose there. Some just see their purpose in the world is to help those who need it, and so they set out intent to aid in important events.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table024\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I recite the testaments of my faith as proof of my utter devotion.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>I idolize the leader of my faith and strive to be like them.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p>I believe all things happen for a reason, and I show kindness and positivity in all circumstances.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </section>\n      <h3>Ideals</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table025\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Charity.</strong> It is my duty to help those who need it, and show them the light of the flame.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Change.</strong> A new age is upon us, one that I must help usher in with my devotion.</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong class=\"bold-italic-chart\">Faith.</strong> I work for my god, and only they know my path.

While there is little recorded history concerning the first druids, it is believed they learned their ways through the whispers of the Old Gods, the secrets of elusive fey, and a strong connection to primal creatures and elements. Today, many druids shepherd the traditions of these faiths. Ancient shrines, standing stones, and circles of worship can be found throughout the wildlands, tundras, high mountains, and sprawling deserts of the world, still inhabited by ancient druidic circles. The jungles of Terene are particularly well known for great druidic temples dating back thousands of years.</p>\n<p>Druids often stand at odds to the rise of civilization and the politics of the continent. More and more, the nations of the world encroach upon natural lands, felling the great forests to fuel their industries, ripping stones from the earth to forge weapons and fortresses, and polluting the waterways with the filth of their cities. The dominant Faith of the Sacred Flame cares more for heavens and salvation of the soul than it does for the preservation and protection of the earth itself. Druids may even view arcane magic as a conduit for chaotic and otherworldly powers which subverts elemental energies and corrupts primal forces. Druids are often driven to adventure when they witness the impact of these imbalances, and desperately seek the means to restore the fragile equilibrium which sustains life on the planet.</p>\n<p>Druids do not have to be mageborn to acquire their powers. Instead, their deep connection to nature, the elements, and living creatures help guide them in intense practice to acquire their mastery over the primal forces of the world.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3>Personality Traits</h3>\n      <section class=\"table-wrapper\">\n        <table id=\"table030\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">1</td>\n              <td><p>I see signs in the flowers and trees; everything in nature speaks to me in small ways.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">2</td>\n              <td><p>I hate cities and populated places, preferring the quiet of nature to people.</p></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td style=\"text-align:center !important\">3</td>\n              <td><p>I speak to the Old Gods.

The verbal, somatic, and material components of spells are vital: a spell fails if the pitch, resonance, and volume of the verbal components are out of tune, or if gestures are not performed in an exacting and precise manner. While casting a spell, mages eyes burn with octarine or radiant light, magical energies swirl about them, and their voices take on an otherworldly resonance. The act of casting a spell is obvious and unmistakable in the world of Drakkenheim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Secret Spells</h2>\n<p>In the world of Drakkenheim, several powerful spells found in the Core Rules are significantly rarer than normal:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]. While the knowledge of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz] spell is more widespread than the other secret spells, the planar tuning forks used by the<em> plane shift</em> spell are the stuff of legends; see the World of Drakkenheim section for details.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jccbeBIfLrqEZnDP]. This spell was only recently invented by the members of the Academy Directorate. While those within the Amethyst Academy are aware of the spell, the Academy Directors have not shared the means to cast this spell except with a few Grandmaster Wizards.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV] and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY] The only living nonplayer characters capable of casting these spells are Lucretia Mathias and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.05xsetZAEnlTjdl5] of the Sacred Flame.</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]. For centuries, the mighty sorcerer-kings zealously guarded the knowledge of this mightiest of all spells. Today, while members of the Academy Directorate have knowledge of the spell, all have expended their ability to cast it on prior wishes made centuries ago. This is a fact that they do not disclose — not even to each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the Game Master's option, player characters must obtain knowledge of these spells as described in the “Learning new spells” section below, and cannot be selected as normal when characters gain a level.</p>\n<p>Non-player characters do not have access to these spells unless specifically indicated in their description or game statistics. Furthermore, the material components for these spells are exceptionally scarce and should be treated as consumable magic items of Very Rare (for 7th- and 8th-level spells) or Legendary rarity (for 9th-level spells).</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Contaminated Spells</h2>\n<p>The Contaminated Spells section contains new spells with the “contaminated” descriptor beside their school of magic. Such spells always require delerium as a material component, and cause the caster to gain Contamination Levels when cast.</p>\n<p>A contaminated spell simply fails if the spellcaster prevents gaining Contamination Levels from its casting. The only exception to this rule is if the spellcaster has a class feature or magic item such as the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.features.Item.wp6siMcKHUXZbxgg] Druid's Purify Spell feature (described in Chapter 3) which specifically allows them to cast contaminated spells without gaining Contamination Levels.</p>\n<p>A monster with the Fully Contaminated trait can cast contaminated spells with impunity, and does not gain Contamination Levels when they do so.</p>\n<h3>Learning the Spells</h3>\n<p>While many monsters and NPCs know these spells,<strong> contaminated spells are not available to player characters at the outset of the campaign unless explicitly granted by a subclass feature in this book</strong>. Instead, characters must either study the spell from a found spellbook or scroll, locate a mentor to teach them the spell, or research the spells themselves!</p>\n<p>Once they've found a spellbook or teacher, a player character must spend two days of downtime and 100 gp per spell level practicing the spell. Once complete, the character may prepare the spell, add it to their spellbook, or replace a spell they already know with the new spell, as appropriate for the spellcasting features of their class.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Researching New Spells</h3>\n      <p>We've included three spells and two magic items that previously appeared in<em> Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em>. These items provide key tools characters need to deal with contamination in a Drakkenheim campaign.</p>\n      <p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.vs23ts2HfajIOxlI] and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.XVfNWNJ36bDL758U] are totally undiscovered at the outset of a Drakkenheim campaign, and instead, these spells must be discovered through research. The player characters might undertake this research directly during their downtime. Alternatively, the party may seek out an NPC spellcaster to help develop the spell, such as an Academy mage or @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.actors.Actor.hrA4chl0k57Ijr83]. The spell descriptions outline the prerequisites needed to successfully research the spell. Once these requirements are met, a character must spend downtime and gold to complete the research: for each level of the spell, the character must spend 5 days of downtime and 250 gp. Once complete, the character may prepare the spell, add it to their spellbook, or replace a spell they already know with the new spell, as appropriate for the spellcasting features of their class.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">“What's the worst that could happen?”</blockquote>\n<img class=\"full-page\" src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/magic-list-sc.webp\" alt=\"\" />"

Albrecht von Drakken used this power to bind three ancient dragons into his service so he could make war on Caspia, while Helena I of House von Kessel made a wish to end a great plague which ravaged her nation at the start of her reign. Elyrian monarchs have used their wishes to strip a favored child of mageborn traits, or aid the construction of great cathedrals to the Sacred Flame. Caspian High Kings have been known to use their wishes to restore the lives of their headstrong offspring killed in rash battles against fearsome monsters. Whether to save their nations from turmoil, or to increase their personal wealth and indulge in their own vices, more than once has a monarch hastily used their wishes, only to be left without it in a time of dire need.

Indeed, the dragon's unique complexion of crystalline purple scales and gemstone-like features is the namesake of the Amethyst Academy itself.</p>\n      <p><strong><em>Personality Trait.</em></strong> How do you know if you are the dreamer, or merely the dream? I speak in absurd paradox, asking mortals vexing questions to which they cannot answer within their limited reference frame.</p>\n      <p><strong><em>Ideal.</em></strong> A single grain of sand makes no sound upon falling, but a million grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something. That is the nature of magic.</p>\n      <p><em>Bond.</em> Mortals believe they can comprehend the fundamental forces of the universe, but they are gravely mistaken. If I know one thing, it is that even I know nothing.</p>\n      <p><strong><em>Flaw.</em></strong> I find the fixed nature of the mortal world deeply strange. It is for the best that this world is unraveled by delerium, for chaos will only improve it.</p>\n      <p>Amaranthyst is order out of chaos incarnate. Aeons ago, the dragon entered the mortal plane from the Space Between Worlds, and has aided mortal mages out of curiosity and amusement. They have long sought to understand the unknowable properties of the strange dimension where it sprung into existence, and has spent millennia wandering that unfathomable place. Amaranthyst has long known about the secret properties of delerium, and views the crystals as merely the fundamental building block of reality itself. To them, the crystals are transforming the world into something wondrous, and he does not understand why mortals would fear it.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<img src=\"modules/drakkenheim-scgd/assets/art/010-011-version2-pg214-amaranthyst-cmyk.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n<article class=\"bestiary\" data-split-here=\"Amaranthyst the Ultraviolet\">\n  <h3 class=\"name no-toc\">Amaranthyst the Ultraviolet</h3>\n  <p class=\"type\"><em>Gargantuan dragon, chaotic neutral</em></p>\n  <ul class=\"stats\">\n    <li><strong>Armor Class</strong> 22 (natural armor)</li>\n    <li><strong>Hit Points</strong> 546 (28d20 + 252)</li>\n    <li><strong>Speed</strong> 40 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul class=\"attributes\">\n    <li><strong>STR</strong> 30 (+10)</li>\n    <li><strong>DEX</strong> 14 (+2)</li>\n    <li><strong>CON</strong> 29 (+9)</li>\n    <li><strong>INT</strong> 18 (+4)</li>\n    <li><strong>WIS</strong> 17 (+3)</li>\n    <li><strong>CHA</strong> 28 (+9)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul class=\"traits\">\n    <li><strong>Saving Throws</strong> Dex +9, Con +16, Wis +10, Cha +16</li>\n    <li><strong>Skills</strong> Arcana +11, Insight +10, Perception +17, Persuasion +16, Stealth +9</li>\n    <li><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> psychic, force</li>\n    <li><strong>Senses</strong> Blindsight 60 ft., Darkvision 120 ft., Passive Perception 27</li>\n    <li><strong>Languages</strong> all, telepathy 1 mile</li>\n    <li><strong>Challenge</strong> 24 (62,000 XP)</li>\n    <li class=\"pb\"><strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong> +7</li>\n  </ul>\n  <div class=\"features\">\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The dragon can breathe air and water.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong><em>Delerium Healing.</em></strong> As an action, Amaranthyst can touch a delerium shard to regain 10 (3d6) hit points.

These hazards cause a new condition called contamination, which inflicts both debilitating<strong> symptoms</strong> and otherworldly<strong> mutations</strong>.</p>\n<p>Contamination is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more Contamination Levels, as specified in the effect's description. If an already-contaminated creature suffers another effect that causes further contamination, its current Contamination Level increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</p>\n<p>In addition, each time a character finishes a long rest while they have 1 or more Contamination Levels, roll 1d20. On a 1, they gain a Contamination Level.</p>\n<p>On Contamination Level 6 or higher, the creature transforms as described in the Monstrous Transformation section.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2 no-toc\">Contamination Symptoms</h2>\n<p>A contaminated creature suffers the symptoms from its current level as well as all lower levels.</p>\n<section class=\"table3-wrapper\">\n  <table id=\"table002\">\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th style=\"text-align:center\">Level</th>\n        <th>Symptoms</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>1</td>\n        <td>None.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>2</td>\n        <td>Hit points regained by expending hit dice are halved.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>3</td>\n        <td>No hit points regained at the end of a long rest.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>4</td>\n        <td>Damage dealt by weapon attacks and spells is halved.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>5</td>\n        <td>The character is incapacitated.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>6</td>\n        <td>Monstrous Transformation!</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</section>"

          "text": "<h2 class=\"standard-h2 no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Mutations\">Mutations</h2>\n<p>In addition to suffering symptoms, each time a character gains a Contamination Level, it rolls 1d6. If the result is equal to or less than the character's current Contamination Level, the creature gains a mutation. The Game Master may choose the mutation, or determine it randomly by rolling 1d20 on the Mutations Table below. Unless otherwise specified, a creature can't gain the same mutation more than once. If a duplicate result is rolled, the Game Master chooses a different one or rolls again.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Removing Contamination</h2>\n<p>Only magic can remove Contamination Levels. Creatures do not recover from contamination naturally. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.spells.Item.RCZRkk5mU0PoswsG] spell (see the Magic of Drakkenheim chapter) can remove contamination, but it leaves affected characters exhausted. A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1] spell removes all Contamination Levels and mutations from a contaminated character. An effect that removes a Contamination Level also removes one randomly determined mutation. All contamination symptoms end and all mutations are removed if a creature's Contamination Level is reduced below 1. Skin, hair, fingernails, and toenails lost to mutations regrow normally once contamination is removed. However, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.9kGrFXnLiRg3Xnbo] spell or similar magic is needed to restore any other body parts (such as teeth, limbs, or eyes).</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Death and Dying While Contaminated</h2>\n<p>When a humanoid creature with any Contamination Levels dies, it animates as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW] 24 hours later. A creature with six or more hit dice rises as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rbyp54px2D0ql4QK] instead.</p>\n<p>A creature restored to life with @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6] or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz] spell reduces a creature's contamination level by one, and all contamination level are removed from a creature restored to life by @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO] or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY]. Note however that a fully contaminated creature who was transformed into a monster is not restored to its original form if it is raised or resurrected.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Monstrous Transformation!</h2>\n<p>A creature who reaches Contamination Level 6 or higher undergoes a Monstrous Transformation into a horrific monster controlled by the Game Master. Once triggered, the transformation finishes in 1 round. It is thereafter permanent. Game Masters are encouraged to narrate a suitably gory description of the transformation.</p>\n<p>The Game Master chooses the creature's new form, which is most often an aberration or monstrosity of some kind such as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8pX2JhWUpTNNRBVx]. The new form usually has a Challenge Rating similar to that of the original creature — in the case of a player character, their level determines the transformation's Challenge Rating. Under appropriate circumstances, such as very sudden onset of contamination or the presence of arcane anomalies, you can choose one that is much higher or much lower.</p>\n<p>The creature's game statistics are entirely replaced by those of the chosen monster. The creature assumes the new form's hit points and Hit Dice. All Contamination Levels are removed, though the Game Master may grant additional traits to the new form similar to any beneficial mutations gained from Contamination Levels.</p>\n<p>The Game Master determines what remains of the original creature's personality and memories, if anything. Regardless, the creature is invariably driven mad by the transformation and falls under the Game Master's control.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Reversing the Transformation</h2>\n<p>The means of reversing a Monstrous Transformation are completely unknown at the outset of the campaign. A transformation is widely regarded as permanent.</p>\n<p>A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz] spell or similar magic can restore a single transformed creature to its previous form, removing all madness and contamination in the process. This is considered a stressful use of the<em> wish</em> spell, and thus there is a 33 percent chance that the caster will be unable to cast<em> wish</em> ever again if they use the spell in this manner.</p>\n<p>The transformation is otherwise irreversible by any means short of divine intervention. Nevertheless, at the Game Master's discretion, it may be possible to temporarily alleviate a transformed creature's innate madness. However, an intelligent monster who receives long-term treatment of any sort may eventually conspire to contaminate or subtly corrupt its caretakers.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <section class=\"table3-wrapper\">\n        @Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.tables.RollTable.MAPdTcv6s2out8Pr caption=false]\n        \n      </section>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>"

It appears in geode clusters of translucent, sharp-edged crystals that reflect octarine light. The eldritch stones softly hum in dissonant tones, and glow brightly at night or when exposed to magic. Deposits are found throughout Drakkenheim, often fused into stone streets and buildings like crystalline moss.</p>\n<p>A typical delerium fragment is about the size of a finger. Crystals may be fist-sized or slightly larger, and geodes may be as big as a pumpkin.

          "text": "<h2 class=\"standard-h2 no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Delerium Properties\">Delerium Properties</h2>\n<p>All delerium samples have the following traits regardless of size:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.</li>\n  <li>Resistant to acid, cold, fire, and lightning damage; as well as slashing and piercing damage from magical weapons.</li>\n  <li>Vulnerable to bludgeoning damage from magical weapons.</li>\n  <li>Unless contained within an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ], delerium shatters and crumbles into worthless ash when reduced to zero hit points. However, delerium geodes release a random<strong> Arcane Anomaly</strong> when destroyed (see below).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Delerium Hazards</h3>\n<p>When a creature touches delerium without protective gear for the first time on their turn, or ends their turn in bodily contact with delerium, they must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage and gain 1 Contamination Level (see<strong> Appendix C</strong>).</p>\n<h3>Delerium Harvesting</h3>\n<p>Delerium found in Drakkenheim is usually fused into the ground or stone buildings, and may be carefully extracted using handheld mining equipment such as shovels, picks, hammers, and chisels. Consult the table to determine how long it takes characters to harvest delerium deposits of various sizes. Lacking proper equipment, extraction takes ten times as long. Massive clusters are impossible to extract without heavy equipment or powerful magic.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Uses for Delerium</h2>\n<p>Delerium has vast arcane potential. Beyond trade, delerium crystals are used for several purposes:</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Spell Component.</strong></em> Delerium may be used as an arcane focus or material component for any spell on the apothecary, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent value to the required cost.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Magic Items.</strong></em> Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Any magic item described in the Core Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM's discretion, characters who can cast 5th-level spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Stable Delerium.</strong></em> The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk contamination when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Delerium Dust.</strong></em> Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ]. Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks for<em> spell scrolls</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Improvised Weapons and Ammunition.</strong></em> Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a sling or fashioned into a makeshift club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, and humanoid creatures struck must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one Contamination Level. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed.\n</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar sidebar-light\">\n  <div class=\"outer-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n      <section class=\"table3-wrapper\">\n        @Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-scgd.tables.RollTable.qjt8fb06VRfDcems]\n        \n      </section>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</aside>"

It covers the ruins of Drakkenheim, but smaller areas are beginning to manifest in other regions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Effects on Characters</h2>\n<p>Creatures do not gain any benefits from finishing a long rest within the Haze.</p>\n<p>In addition, a humanoid creature may only spend up to 24 hours within the Haze, after which it must finish a long rest to adequately recover from exposure. Humanoid creatures who remain in the Haze beyond 24 hours before recuperating risk contamination. For each additional hour spent within the Haze beyond 24 hours, a humanoid creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one Contamination Level.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Environmental Effects</h2>\n<p>The Haze magically manifests mist throughout the area. Characters can see normally through the mist up to 150 feet. Vision beyond is lightly obscured, but vision past 300 feet is totally obscured. Any mists dispersed during the day re-form 10 minutes later.</p>\n<p>The mists dampen sunlight. Creatures with sunlight vulnerability or similar traits do not suffer these penalties during the day while within the Haze.</p>\n<p>The corpses of beasts and humanoid creatures do not rot within the Haze.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Effects on Spells</h2>\n<p>Any divination or teleportation spell cast outside the Haze targeting a creature or location within the Haze automatically fails. Telepathic communications or effects such as the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD] spell transmitted from outside the Haze fail to contact a character within it, and vice-versa. Finally, other divination spells fail to reveal useful information about delerium, the Haze, the origins of the meteor, or any events which occurred within the Haze.</p>\n<p>When a character attempts any of the above using a spell or other effect, they must make a [[/save int 15]] saving throw. On a failure, they take [[/damage 6d6 psychic]] damage and become incapacitated with madness until they finish a long rest. During this time, they speak only in gibberish. A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk] spell ends this effect.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.NXWWWgHtWb7Nv21F] and similar spells or abilities do not provide shelter from the Haze. However, characters may rest within a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pn4SnsFDvYDiE6rC] spell cast within the Haze.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Deep Haze</h2>\n<p>Certain areas are so suffused by the Haze that mere exposure is extremely dangerous and potentially fatal. Known as the Deep Haze, these areas have the following additional traits:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Deep Haze is instantly recognized by a thick prismatic fog. Characters can see normally through this fog up to 60 feet. Vision beyond is lightly obscured, but vision past 120 feet is totally obscured. If dispersed during the day, the fog reforms 1 minute later.</li>\n  <li>Characters entering the Deep Haze must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, and again for each full hour spent within. On a failed saving throw, they suffer 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and gain one Contamination Level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"standard-h2\">Delerium Sludge</h2>\n<p>Gargantuan delerium geodes perspire an opalescent sludge. Characters submerged in delerium sludge must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn. They take 42 (12d6) necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, and half as much on a successful one. In addition, characters who fail the saving throw gain one Contamination Level.</p>"
