Lingering mists of blood in the water are often interpreted as signs of his passage, and though tales invariably describe him vanquishing pirates and scoundrels, most prefer to avoid him... just in case.</p><p><i><b>Shark Senses.</b></i> While wearing this helmet, your peripheral vision extends behind you and your sense of smell is enhanced, granting you <b>advantage</b> on initiative rolls and <b>Wisdom (<span id=\"was-tagged\">Perception</span>)</b> checks that involve smell. In addition, you can inhale deeply as an action, gaining <span id=\"was-tagged\">blindsight</span> to a range of <b>30 feet</b> until the start of your next turn. This <span id=\"was-tagged\">blindsight</span> can only detect a creature that has blood and is below its hit point maximum.</p><p><i><b>Blood Frenzy.</b></i> While wearing this helmet, you can cast the <span id=\"was-tagged\">blood frenzy</span> spell on yourself. When you do, roll a <b>[[/r d6]]</b>. On a <b>3</b> or lower, this property of the helm can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><i><b>Curse.</b></i> This helmet is cursed with the essence of its former occupant, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to remove the helmet. Over the course of a week, you begin to develop shark-like features. First, your skin develops small patches of tough, iridescent scales. Next, your fingers and toes become webbed, and small fins appear on your elbow and neck. Lastly are the teeth. They become a jagged conveyor belt of razors, a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to <b>[[/r 1d6]] + your Strength modifier</b>. Once you grow these shark teeth, the curse is complete and you are constantly under the effects of the blood frenzy spell. A <span id=\"was-tagged\">remove curse</span> spell or similar magic ends the curse and the effects of the blood frenzy spell, but doesn't undo any changes to your appearance that have already occurred, including the natural weapon.</p>"

First, your skin develops small patches of tough, iridescent scales. Next, your fingers and toes become webbed, and small fins appear on your elbow and neck. Lastly are the teeth. They become a jagged conveyor belt of razors, a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to <b>[[/r 1d6]] + your Strength modifier</b>. Once you grow these shark teeth, the curse is complete and you are constantly under the effects of the blood frenzy spell.
