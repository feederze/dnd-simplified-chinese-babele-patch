The stone gives off waves of magical fear and despair, overwhelming workers and transforming some into Undead. A monk of the Yellow Rose monastery, Brother Trasig, investigated the quarry but has never returned.</p><p><strong>Hook. </strong>Helmsdale’s town elders, distraught over Trasig’s disappearance, offer [[/award 300GP]] for the characters to investigate the quarry and learn his fate. They believe the quarry is cursed and have no knowledge of the stone hidden in its depths.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>Use the @UUID[Scene.aifQuarry0000000]{quarry map} for this adventure. The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Work Area.</strong></em> Just inside the quarry lurk five <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifZombie0000000]{Zombies}</strong>, two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGhoul00000000]{Ghouls}</strong>, and a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGhast00000000]{Ghast}</strong>. Once laborers here, they were corrupted by the stone but continue to swing picks and drive shovels in pointless labor. They fight anyone who disturbs them.</p><p><em><strong>Ambush. </strong></em>Sarbrindar, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWight00000000]{Wight}</strong> clad in robes decorated with Orcus’s symbol, hides behind a wagon to ambush the party. He’s accompanied by two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSkeleton00000]{Skeletons}</strong> of former workers. The skeletons fight from high ground. Sarbrindar singles out one character for mockery and insults, gleefully fighting until destroyed. Brother Trasig’s broken body is partially buried behind nearby crates, clutching a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPeriaptOfHeal]{Periapt of Health}</em>. The cause of the transformations is concealed behind an illusory wall. If the illusion is touched, it vanishes.</p><p><em><strong>Hidden Cavity.</strong></em> Within the hidden cavity, the cult has hidden a relic called the Tenebrous Stone. As the characters enter, each is subjected to a vision of a past failure. Roleplay through each of these scenes, inviting players to describe the failure and what their character did or didn’t do in the past. A demonic figure appears in each vision, taunting the character. A character who succeeds on a [[/save 15 Wisdom]] saving throw can change the tragic outcome of their vision; a character who fails experiences the tragedy all over again.</p><p>When every vision has resolved, the characters return to their senses, and the demonic figure of their visions manifests as a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSuccubus00000]{Succubus}</strong>. The succubus is Vulnerable to all damage from characters who succeeded on the save and changed the outcome of their vision, but characters who failed that save and experienced a tragic outcome again have the &amp;Reference[Frightened] condition instead.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion. </strong></em>If the succubus is defeated, the Tenebrous Stone loses its power, and the quarry returns to normal over several days.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.q1w5lU1VxF2xP2XR caption=false]</p>"

The Harborhands worry about this strange attack, as they should.

A character can take an Influence action and convince the pair to leave with a successful [[/check Deception Intimidation Persuasion 10 format=long]] or buy them off for 10 GP. The guards also leave if the characters try to start a fight, grumbling, “I hope you get the trouble you’re so eager to find.”</p><p><em><strong>Dock Clues.</strong></em> Blood spatters cover the area where the stevedores were killed, and blood trails lead over the side of the dock. The only ship near the site is an unseaworthy vessel called the <em>Fearsome Grimace</em>. The ship has sunk up to its gunwales in Gray Harbor, and it’s afloat only because it’s lashed to Narrowlady Dock. A character who takes a &amp;Reference[Study] action and succeeds on a [[/check Investigation 12 format=long]] realizes that the corpses were recently rolled over the side of the dock by the Flaming Fist. A character who takes a &amp;Reference[Search] action and succeeds on a [[/check Perception Survival 12 format=long]] identifies tracks of the killers—the splayed, scaled feet of sahuagin.</p><p><em><strong>In the River. </strong></em>Two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifHunterShark00]{Hunter Sharks}</strong> have eaten the dead stevedores.

The exterior water level is 5 feet higher than depicted on the map, and the thick wooden gangplank descends from Narrowlady Dock to the main deck.</p><p><em><strong>Main Deck. </strong></em>The ship’s dilapidated condition is evident on its main deck, where rotted rigging barely clings to the masts and tattered sails hang like forlorn laundry. A thin cord across the end of the gangplank connects to the rigging, which functions as a falling net trap. In addition, the large hatch over the main hold breaks if a creature moves onto it, like a hidden pit trap, except that the fall into the partially flooded hold doesn’t deal damage. See chapter 3 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for both traps.</p><p><em><strong>Forecastle. </strong></em>The elevated front of the ship bears an enormous windlass used to haul up an anchor, but the chain dangles limply over the side. A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.equipment.Item.dmgPoleOfAngling]{Pole of Angling}</em> is jammed into the windlass. Manipulating the windlass or its chain stirs up four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifLacedonGhoul0]{Lacedon Ghouls}</strong> that are under the ship; the ghouls climb the exterior of the ship to fight the characters.</p><p><em><strong>Sterncastle. </strong></em>The ship’s elevated stern has mounts for two ballistae. The ballistae look to be in excellent condition apart from several white seagull feathers adhered to each. Both ballistas are in fact <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifMimic00000000]{Mimics}</strong> that like to eat seabirds.</p><p><em><strong>Hold. </strong></em>The rotted, mold-crusted hold is flooded 2 feet deep with river water and is &amp;Reference[Difficult Terrain] for creatures that lack a Swim Speed. Six <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifReefShark0000]{Reef Sharks}</strong> lurk under the overturned jolly boats, awaiting prey or sahuagin orders.</p><p><em><strong>Forward Cabin. </strong></em>Water in this cabin, where the sailors once bunked, is ankle deep and thick with blood. Two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSahuaginWarri]{Sahuagin Warriors}</strong> and a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSwarmOfLemure]{Swarm of Lemures}</strong> are messily devouring an enormous eel. If the characters descend from the main deck, one warrior flees to warn Cracklebone, then it makes a stand with the sharks in the hold. An old hammock holds a pouch with [[/award 75gp]] and a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbagPotionofHea]{Potion of Healing}</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Aft Cabin. </strong></em>The finery of this captain’s cabin has long ago turned to rot. Cracklebone the <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifImp0000000000]{Imp}</strong> is here with a loyal <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSahuaginPries]{Sahuagin Priest}</strong>. They immediately initiate combat with intruders but retreat to the hold for reinforcements if outmatched. Tacked to one wall is a tattered map of the docks with plans for several river attacks drawn on it in blood.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion. </strong></em>If the characters return to Cadmin after exploring the <em>Fearsome Grimace</em>, he gives them [[/award 100gp]] for defeating the sahuagin and another [[/award 100gp]] for Cracklebone’s map.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.w8wbxlHmPFtb9XzZ caption=false]</p>"

They are stealthy hunters with an affinity for lost lore and fungi that flourish in the depths. As deep dragons age, their smooth, serpentine bodies become riddled with fungal rot, particularly around their faces, to imbue their breath with terror-inducing spores.</p><p>Deep dragons covet treasure and knowledge. Some deep dragons seek to gain knowledge via experience and travel, slithering through caverns and seas of the Underdark to map hidden passages for dozens of miles. Other deep dragons enjoy cultivating groves of molds and fungi, including colossal varieties sufficient to conceal the dragons’ sinuous forms. Many deep dragons collect forgotten tomes or works of art and bully, cajole, or steal collections from drow or duergar sages.</p><p>Deep dragons are excellent swimmers. They often clash with aquatic Underdark societies, such as kuo-toa. Many deep dragons demand tribute from these groups in the form of food or treasure.</p><p>Underdark explorers have many reasons to brave deep dragon lairs beyond treasure hunting; they might contain the only surviving copies of forgotten lore, fungal ingredients for cures or plagues, or maps to lost Underdark locales.</p><h3>Adult Deep Dragon</h3><p>The strange magic pervading the Underdark twists deep dragons as they grow, so few adult deep dragons look alike. Their skin is usually pitted by fungal growths that spread across the body. Although lacking the versatile shape-shifting of metallic dragons, deep dragons can assume the form of animals or humanoids and often masquerade as snakes or dragonborn.</p><p>Adult deep dragons eliminate challengers with ferocious might, cunning ambushes, or fungal poisons. Some adult deep dragons plunder the surface for treasures and lore.</p><h3>Deep Dragon Lairs</h3><p>Deep dragons lair in fungus-encrusted caverns of the Underdark or old, forgotten ruins, preferring locations near subterranean bodies of water.</p><p>The region containing an adult or ancient deep dragon’s lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:</p><p><strong>Preservation of Knowledge</strong>. Books and other written forms of communication with 1 mile of the lair become magically protected and can’t be damaged by nonmagical means.</p><p><strong>Restless Sleep</strong>. When a creature finishes a Long Rest within 1 mile of the lair, the creature makes a [[/save con 10 format=long]]. On a failed save, the creature doesn’t reduce its Exhaustion level as a result of finishing that Long Rest. Creatures with Immunity to the Poisoned condition are immune to this effect.</p><p><strong>Verdant Growth</strong>. Vegetation and fungi within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair grow faster and cover a greater area than normal. Foraging in this area yields twice the usual amount of food. The dragon is immediately aware of the presence of any creature that eats this enhanced vegetation.</p><p>If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</p>",

She’s been prophesying doom for weeks while keeping the creature’s existence a secret.</p><p><strong>Hook.</strong> The characters are in Termalaine when the beholder emerges from the mines and begins laying waste to everything and everyone nearby.</p><h4>Encounters</h4><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Terror in Termalaine.</strong></em> A disoriented, half-frozen <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBeholder00000]{Beholder}</strong> assaults Termalaine.</p><p><em><strong>Prophetic Dreams.</strong></em> After the attack, Echomorne’s supporters demand a vote to elect her speaker of Bryn Shander, saying she foresaw the disaster.</p><p><em><strong>Mornethraxys Strikes.</strong></em> Echomorne identifies the party as a threat to her plans and resolves to bring them to her family. Reverting to her dragon shape, she chases them into a tunnel leading to the Underdark.</p><p><em><strong>Giant Ruins.</strong></em> Mornethraxys chases or guides the characters through ruins in the Underdark, through a hall of fallen giants (<strong>@UUID[Actor.aifHauntingReven]{Haunting Revenant}</strong>), to a cavernous, ruined throne room.</p><p><em><strong>Throne Room.</strong></em> Here, the characters eventually come face to face with Mornethraxys, her father Enderbalathal the Lord Below (<strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAncientDeepDr]{Ancient Deep Dragon}</strong>), and her brother Guvaali of the Grand Appetite (<strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAdultDeepDrag]{Adult Deep Dragon}</strong>), who interrogate the party for lore and secrets. When the characters are of no more use, the dragons hurl them down into an ooze swamp.</p><p><em><strong>Ooze Swamp.</strong></em> In a dim and noxious swamp, the characters fight four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBlackPudding0]{Black Puddings}</strong> while searching for an escape. Meanwhile, gluttonous Guvaali decides to hunt them in the fog-filled swamp.</p><p><em><strong>Frozen Horror.</strong></em> The only way out of the swamp is to climb a melting subterranean glacier to a distant steam vent. If the characters light a fire or shine a bright light, they discover true horror: the ice is full of aberrations frozen in a contorted mass, their tendrils reaching upward. Unless the thaw stops, these monsters will surely bring an eldritch apocalypse to Icewind Dale.</p><p><em><strong>Near the Surface.</strong></em> The characters encounter three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGrickAncient0]{Grick Ancients}</strong>, as well as clusters of @UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.content.JournalEntry.dmgDmsToolbox000.JournalEntryPage.lVkdQivhFHqVmxg7#fireball-fungus]{fireball fungus} (see chapter 3 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>) as they clamber back to the surface.

Unusual beasts have been spotted nearby. The Oglyntyr family, secretly lycanthropes and worshipers of Malar, are responsible.</p><p><strong>Hook. </strong>Lord Warder Dauner Ilzimmer (Medium, Lawful Neutral <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifNoble00000000]{Noble}</strong>) sends for aid from other member cities in the Lords’ Alliance. He offers [[/award 150GP]] per person to investigators, half in advance.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Road Killers.</strong></em> Near Amphail, in the foothills of the Sword Mountain along the Long Road, three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPeryton000000]{Perytons}</strong> swoop down on the characters. The perytons hint at Malar’s involvement in this mystery.</p><p><em><strong>Amphail Arrival.</strong></em> Lord Ilzimmer greets the party and hosts them in his Stone Stallion inn. He tells the party that he doesn’t want to choose sides, but the deep-rooted Oglyntyr family blames newcomers the Hemzars, who train dangerous creatures—Strem Hemzar recently slew an owlbear on Hemzar Ranch. But Riven Oglyntyr, who left decades ago to adventure, returned not long ago and could be involved. He needs an outside party to investigate.</p><p><em><strong>Hemzar Ranch.</strong></em> When the party visits Hemzar Ranch, 7 miles west of Amphail, use the @UUID[Scene.dmgManor00000000]{Manor map} if needed. The Hemzars, all humans, largely cooperate with the investigation and instruct their four servants and ranch hands to do the same.</p><table><caption>Hemzars</caption><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\"><p>Name</p></th><th scope=\"col\"><p>Traits</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Elyann</p></td><td><p>Quiet, wise herbalist; Strem’s wife (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCommoner00000]{Commoner}</strong>)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kalia</p></td><td><p>Witty, driven trainer and daughter (Medium, Lawful Good <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifScout00000000]{Scout}</strong>)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Strem</p></td><td><p>Flighty, loyal trainer and son (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWerewolf00000]{Werewolf}</strong>)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Taero</p></td><td><p>Proud, practical father and patriarch (Medium, Lawful Neutral <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifNoble00000000]{Noble}</strong>)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Vonda</p></td><td><p>Warm, sharp treasurer and matriarch (Medium, Neutral Good <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifNoble00000000]{Noble}</strong>)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Strem slew a bloody owlbear a few weeks ago and has been ill ever since. The owlbear was sent by Malar, who cursed Strem to be a werewolf. He convalesces in the manor tower, and he and his family chain him up there at night, keeping the truth of his condition a secret.</p><p>The Hemzars assume Strem contracted lycanthropy from the owlbear. A character who takes a &amp;Reference[Study] action and succeeds on a [[/skill 15 rel]] check recalls Malar sends blood-covered beasts out into the world, and he takes umbrage when they’re slain. Searching the Hemzar manor turns up an ivory idol of Malar in one of the barns, but the Hemzars don’t know where it came from.</p><p><em><strong>Oglyntyr Ranch.</strong></em> Eight miles north of Amphail, Oglyntyr Ranch shows signs of neglect. Use the @UUID[Scene.dmgSpookyHouse00]{Spooky House} map if needed. The Oglyntyr basement houses a gory Malar shrine decorated with human heads and an owlbear skull.</p><p>The Oglyntyrs, all humans, have a nasty reputation. Riven became a lycanthrope while away on adventure and has brought Malar’s worship back to his family, all of whom are now cursed.</p><table><caption>Oglyntyrs</caption><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\"><p>Name</p></th><th scope=\"col\"><p>Traits</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Dorn</p></td><td><p>Ruthless, sly trainer and patriarch (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWereboar00000]{Wereboar}</strong>)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jhess</p></td><td><p>Affable, wayward trainer and son (Medium, Chaotic Neutral <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWererat000000]{Wererat}</strong>)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mirin</p></td><td><p>Calm, cruel healer and matriarch (Medium, Neutral Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWerewolf00000]{Werewolf}</strong>)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Riven</p></td><td><p>Ambitious, greedy uncle (Medium, Chaotic Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWeretiger0000]{Weretiger}</strong>)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The family’s four remaining servants are <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWererat000000]{Wererats}</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Sacred Hunt. </strong></em>When the party begins investigating the Oglyntyrs, the family pretends to cooperate and blames the Hemzars. But as the party discovers the shrine or otherwise gets close to the truth, the Oglyntyrs decide to kill the party and honor Malar by making them the object of a hunt. The family stalks the characters and harries them in the wilderness.</p><p>Use the following encounters, giving the party time to recover between each.</p><ul><li>Dorn alongside Mirin.</li><li>Jhess and two servants. If Bloodied, these lycanthropes flee back to the ranch or surrender.</li><li>Riven, one servant, and one <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPanther000000]{Panther}</strong>. If &amp;Reference[Bloodied], the servant flees or surrenders, but Riven makes sure the cowardly servant dies.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> Lord Ilzimmer is displeased if the Oglyntyrs come to harm, but if confronted with the evidence, he admits the family was likely responsible. Strem Hemzar’s hidden lycanthropy can prompt further adventure. Each character’s Renown Score with the Lords’ Alliance increases by 1.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.7uyWoGQBGNVrTVho caption=false]</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.0UridbSiogioV1Ul caption=false]</p>"

Rusted creatures feature heavily in this adventure; to modify stat blocks into Rusted versions see the “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifBestiary00000.JournalEntryPage.EPxseka41oW3goRm#other-rusted]{Other Rusted}” sidebar in chapter 9.</p><p><em><strong>Kythyss Wharf.</strong></em> Here, the characters find sewage from Kythyss dumping into the harbor. The sewer tunnel is home to a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWererat000000]{Wererat}</strong> and six <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGiantRat00000]{Giant Rats}</strong>. If the sewage is redirected into septic tanks or cleaned before reintroduction to the harbor, the Rusting withdraws.</p><p><em><strong>Bregonshire Coast.</strong></em> The Rusting continues up the rocky coast between Kythyss and Dorset, where dead fish wash ashore. As the characters investigate, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifKuotoaMonitor]{Kuo-toa Monitor}</strong> and four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifKuotoa0000000]{Kuo-toa}</strong> emerge from the sea to fight. Speaking with local farmers reveals they’re using an alchemical fertilizer that is washed into the sea by rain.</p><p><em><strong>Rushdown Wood.</strong></em> North of Dorset, the trees of Rushdown Wood are covered in a thin, metal skin, and their leaves have turned to rust. Lumbering efforts have penetrated deep into the forest, leaving behind fields of stumps. Rusted Norlanders have infiltrated the Rushdown Wood; a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifRustedBerserk]{Rusted Berserker}</strong> and six <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifRustedGuardCo]{Rusted Guards}</strong> attack when discovered. The characters can follow their trail back to an abandoned camp near the local moonwell; plans drawn in the dirt reveal a Rusted force is attacking the well.</p><p><em><strong>The Moonwell.</strong></em> Use the Moonwell map below for these encounters. When the characters rush to the moonwell’s defense, they must first get past three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifRustedScout00]{Rusted Scouts}</strong> in the trees to reach the main Rusted force, which is engaged with local druids and their allies. The characters must defeat four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifRustedGuardCo]{Rusted Guards}</strong> and two Rusted <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifRustedWolf000]{Rusted Wolves}</strong> before they can reach the leader of the assault: a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifRustedWarrior]{Rusted Warrior Veteran}</strong>. If the leader is defeated, the remaining Rusted flee and the moonwell is saved.</p><p><em><strong>Aftermath.</strong></em> Mayor Shivven can’t address all the problems the characters have discovered with the resources he has at hand, but he’s grateful for their efforts. He rewards each character with [[/award 100GP]].</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.RrS1c0zz7MHOI3Wn caption=false]</p>"

The gang offers to exchange Sullivan for 10,000 GP, instructing that the exchange take place at a lonely caravansary along the Black Road called Kozah’s Whisper.</p><p><strong>Hook.</strong> Janussi (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifArchmage00000]{Archmage}</strong>), Candlekeep’s Keeper of Tomes, meets the characters in a private room at a tavern in Baldur’s Gate and shares with them the ransom note detailing the gang’s demands. The Eyes of At’ar write they will be at Kozah’s Whisper in one month and will wait one month more for Candlekeep’s representatives to make the trade. After that, Sullivan will be killed. Janussi confides that Sullivan was carrying a scroll of priceless Netherese magic when he was abducted. She refuses to encourage the bandits by paying the ransom. She offers the party [[/award 1500GP]] plus expenses if they will travel to Kozah’s Whisper and secure Sullivan and the scroll.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Doing Their Homework. </strong></em>Characters might seek to use Candlekeep’s resources to learn more about their mission. Anyone wishing to enter the library must provide a work of writing the library doesn’t already have. Characters researching in the library learn the gang’s name refers to At’ar the Merciless, the Bedine god of the sun. Characters can acquire maps suggesting possible routes to Anauroch. An obscure scouting report describes the leader of the Eyes of At’ar as a mysterious “half-lion” spellcaster named Inixera (<strong>@UUID[Actor.aifLamia00000000]{Lamia}</strong>). The report cautions that the gang has eyes everywhere. You can find more information on Candlekeep to flesh out this part of the adventure in the <em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em> adventure anthology.</p><p><em><strong>The Journey. </strong></em>The characters have a long journey ahead of them. One option is to take the Trade Way north to Daggerford, then turn east along the Delimbyr Trail until they reach the Black Road and Anauroch. Alternatively, the party might travel cross-country, skirting the Forest of Wyrms, Marsh of Chelimber, and Lonely Moor. Use the rules for @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbExploration00.JournalEntryPage.CIKNTZvYHNPixLRp]{travel} and journey stages in chapter 2 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Kozah’s Whisper. </strong></em>Kozah’s Whisper is a caravansary halfway along the Black Road, in the middle of the Great Desert. Use the @UUID[Scene.aifTheEyesOfAtar]{Roadside Inn} map. Characters who used magic to travel to Kozah’s Whisper might get there before the bandits, but its more likely the gang has already arrived.</p><p>The caravansary is managed by a human woman named Enla Massine (Medium, Chaotic Neutral <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCommoner00000]{Commoner}</strong>) who has survived in Anauroch by not getting involved in the business of her guests. She is assisted by her wife, Nari (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAssassin00000]{Assassin}</strong>), who serves as a bouncer and general laborer. The two are fiercely loyal to each other. Their three adult children (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCommoner00000]{Commoners}</strong>) work as cooks, grooms, and cleaning staff. Other guests at the caravansary include the following:</p><p><strong>Lorna</strong>, a nosy human merchant (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCommoner00000]{Commoner}</strong>) lingering at Kozah’s Rest while her pack animals recover from a difficult journey. Lorna is a source for gossip at the caravansary, and she can sell the party any gear they might need, including a few <em>Spell Scrolls</em>.</p><p><strong>Mikkam</strong>, a halfling lieutenant in the Eyes of At’ar (Small, Chaotic Neutral <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifToughBoss0000]{Tough Boss}</strong>). He leads eight <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifTough00000000]{Toughs}</strong>.</p><p><strong>Nama</strong>, a wandering elf mage (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBanditDeceive]{Bandit Deceiver}</strong>) pursuing lost Netherese lore. If Nama learns about the Netherese scriptures, she might offer her services to the party in exchange for the scroll—or simply try to steal it.</p><p><strong>Raheel</strong>, a human tracker (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifScout00000000]{Scout}</strong>). Raheel is looking for work. The party can hire him for 100 GP. He will spy on the Eyes of At’ar or anyone else the party directs him to, but he avoids combat.</p><p>The party has time to investigate the caravansary and guests while meeting with Mikkam to set up the exchange. Once convinced the party intends to make the deal, Mikkam sends word to Inixera, leader of the gang, at a bandit camp half a day away in the desert.</p><p><em><strong>The Exchange. </strong></em>Inixera arrives a day after being sent for, with the bulk of the gang in tow. This includes four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBanditCaptain]{Bandit Captains}</strong> and two dozen <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBandit0000000]{Bandits}</strong>, and Gnasher, Inixera’s pet <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifManticore0000]{Manticore}</strong>. Sullivan is manacled and gagged, in Gnasher’s care. Inixera has the Netherese texts in an elaborate scroll case, hidden in a simple sack.</p><p>When Inixera confronts the party, he changes the terms of the deal. He will release Sullivan if the party agrees to read the scroll aloud, right now, in the open yard of the caravansary. Inixera has read the scriptures and knows they summon a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPhaerimmAgent]</strong> (see <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifBestiary00000.JournalEntryPage.tS4vS4Wqd1A5Kljq]{chapter 9}</strong>). If the characters go through with this bargain, the phaerimm appears and fights them while Inixera looks on, cackling with glee. If they refuse, Inixera intends to feed Sullivan to Gnasher and keep the scrolls for himself.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.YsJCgr3GXtV3IU2X caption=false]</p>"

After 1 minute, a 50-foot-wide, 500-foot-high Cylinder of light erupts from the circle of power. Each creature in the Cylinder makes a [[/save 15 dex]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 10d6 radiant average]] damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><em><strong>The Mythal. </strong></em>The effects of the reawakened mythal are up to you to determine.</p>"

Recently two students of magic discovered the truth about him and located five hidden libraries he constructed.</p><h3>Lethchauntos’s Tragic Life</h3><p>Five centuries ago, an orc priest named Wund forged a kingdom under the Sword Mountains, choosing an orc warlord named Uruth as a figurehead ruler. Wund was devoted to an evil god of death and disease, and Uruth was a cruel warmonger. A young orc wizard named Nath fled the Sword Mountains with his wife Ona and their children to avoid the wars he knew Wund and Uruth would soon wage.</p><p>Settling near the village of Phandalin south of Neverwinter, Nath traded with farming families and shared arcane knowledge with the crafters of nearby Wave Echo Cave. Nath hid his identity to protect himself and his family, and the folk of Phandalin knew him as Lethchauntos.</p><p>Nath and his family had peace for a few years but, deeply troubled by Wund’s leadership, Lethchauntos decided to take action. With the skilled crafters of Wave Echo Cave, he forged the <em>Ettin Axe</em>, a sentient weapon with two distinct minds and personalities. Then, leaving his family, he returned to the Sword Mountains and sought out Uruth. Nath argued that Wund was selfish and manipulative, and Uruth had an obligation to be a wiser, better king. He gave Uruth the <em>Ettin Axe</em>, optimistically hoping that the axe’s two minds would balance out the bad advice Uruth was getting from Wend.</p><p>For a brief time, Wund, Nath, Uruth, and the twin minds of the <em>Ettin Axe</em> were locked in a power struggle for Uruth’s realm. But communications from Nath’s family ceased and, fearing the worst, the wizard fled home to find his family dead from poisons only Wund knew how to brew. Wund’s spies had identified Nath’s family and murdered them.</p><p>Nath was devastated. Donning black robes of mourning, he forsook his birth name. For the rest of his life, he wore only black and answered only to Lethchauntos. For twenty years, he researched Wund’s poisons in an attempt to find antidotes to the poisons that killed his family, collecting this knowledge in a book he dubbed the <em>Nathlum</em>, and planned elaborate memorials for his loved ones.</p><p>Uruth and Wund eventually perished in war, but one of Uruth’s successors discovered Lethchauntos’s location and led a raid against Phandalin, devastating the region.</p><p>Lethchauntos survived, but he considered himself cursed for bringing death to his friends and family. He left Phandalin and put his final plans in motion, visiting the Dalelands, Icewind Dale, Calimshan, the Moonshae Isles, and Baldur’s Gate, places his family had spoken of visiting. In each of these locations, he constructed a hidden library, burying one of his family in each location. When the last library was complete, Lethchauntos departed for the Outer Planes. His final fate is unknown.</p><h3>A Tale of Two Apprentices</h3><p>Today Lethchauntos is mostly forgotten, and those who do recall him believe he was an evil wizard due to his association with poison and slaughter. But two students of magic named Myrna Nor and Powell Niccam discovered the existence of the <em>Nathlum</em> from old records found in Phandalin and Wave Echo Cave. The two didn’t agree on what to do next, though. While Myrna wanted to recover the <em>Nathlum</em> for academic purposes, Powell saw an opportunity to get rich quick.</p><p>Powell reached out to Zhentarim agents and told them about the <em>Nathlum</em>, which details many deadly poisons. She offered to share the knowledge with the Zhentarim in exchange for the agents’ help in recovering the <em>Nathlum</em>. With Zhentarim allies and goblin and hobgoblin mercenaries she hired along the way, Powell set out for the hidden library near Myth Drannor.</p><p>Myrna wants to stop Powell, but she’s no adventurer. She uses her merchant contacts to locate the characters, and she hires them to stop Powell and recover the <em>Nathlum</em>.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.wyqB4W80WDv0k1xb inline]</p>"

The Council of Four can’t formally stop this legally proper procedure, but the council insists that debates on it be held publicly at the Unrolling Scroll. Banites work to eliminate politicians opposed to the power grab, including the human philanthropist Roxus Nalbeth (Medium, Lawful Good <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifNoble00000000]{Noble}</strong>).</p><p><strong>Hook.</strong> Allies who fear their authority being undermined, such as a commoner crew, arrange for the characters to help Roxus Nalbeth at the debates.</p><h4>Encounters</h4><p>The debate takes place at the Unrolling Scroll (see “Upper City”); you can use its map for this adventure.</p><p><em><strong>Ambush.</strong></em> On the way to the Unrolling Scroll, the characters are ambushed by a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultistofBane]{Cultist of Bane}</strong> (see chapter 9) and two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWarriorVetera]{Warrior Veterans}</strong> dressed as Flaming Fist members. They level a spurious accusation of criminal activity as a pretext to attack. If the characters search the cultist, they find a tattoo of Bane’s symbol on him.</p><p><em><strong>Debate Preparation.</strong></em> The characters meet Roxus in a reserved room at the Unrolling Scroll. He shares rumors that a secret, tyrannical “Shadow Parliament” is gaining followers within the Parliament of Peers, and this debate is the last chance to keep the Shadow Parliament from seizing control. If the characters share they were ambushed by followers of Bane, Roxus surmises that cultists of Bane are probably behind the clandestine organization.</p><p><em><strong>Opening Remarks.</strong></em> The entire Parliament of Peers is in attendance around the reflecting pool for the debate’s opening remarks, as are the members of the Council of Four. Roxus’s remarks on the important distinctions between leadership and tyranny stir the crowd. Three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWaterElementa]{Water Elementals}</strong> erupt from the pool to cause mayhem; when they turn to Roxus, the characters are the only ones who can intervene and save him. Characters with a [[/skill perception 14 passive format=long]] spot a dwarf (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultistFanati]{Cultist Fanatic}</strong>) in the crowd subtly directing the summoned elementals and might notice that she bears the same tattoo as the earlier cultist.</p><p><em><strong>The Debate.</strong></em> Roxus is shaken by the attack, and he asks the characters to take his place. (If Roxus didn’t survive, another parliament member or a commoner crew ally asks the characters to fill this role). There are three debate rounds against patriars who support the power grab, listed below. Only one character can participate in each round, but different characters can participate in ensuing rounds. Victory in a round requires a successful [[/check Deception Persuasion 18 format=long]], but a participating character who succeeds on one of the additional checks listed with each patriar below makes the Charisma check with Advantage. Intersperse the debate checks with reactions from the audience, such as gasps as the characters reveal secrets and applause if they win a round.</p><p><strong>Arvin Dlusker.</strong> A successful [[/check History Insight 15 format=long]] reveals that Arvin’s debate position is motivated by desire to reverse his family’s severe financial losses.</p><p><strong>Brevek Faenor. </strong>Duke Brevek Faenor’s arguments in favor of expanding Parliament authority draw surprised gasps from the audience. A successful [[/check History Religion 15 format=long]] reminds the character of Brevek’s tense history as a former priest of Oghma here in the Unrolling Scroll.</p><p><strong>Tallis Whitburn.</strong> A successful [[/check Nature Perception 15 format=long]] notes slate dust on Tallis’s garments, showing she has resorted to helping with manual labor at her understaffed Whitburn quarry.</p><p><em><strong>The Vote.</strong></em> If the characters win at least two debate rounds, the measure to expand the Parliament of Peers’ authority is voted down. Otherwise, it passes, and the Council of Four summarily approves it.</p><p><em><strong>Treachery at the Bindery.</strong></em> Regardless of the vote’s result, Roxus (or his valet if Roxus died) informs the characters that Arvin Dlusker and Tallis Whitburn have surreptitiously entered the Unrolling Scroll’s bookbindery. There, the characters find both patriars (<strong>@UUID[Actor.aifNoble00000000]{Nobles}</strong>) talking with two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBanditDeceive]{Bandit Deceivers}</strong>. The politicians are asking about their next orders now that the vote has been decided; the bandits are tattooed cultists of Bane who are orchestrating the Shadow Parliament. The bandits fight to silence the characters, but the patriars retreat. In addition to the four conspirators, two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPriestAcolyte]{Priest Acolytes}</strong> of Oghma work here. The acolytes have the Charmed condition and treat the bandits favorably, but they don’t join the fight.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> After the bookbindery battle, the patriars are unwilling to talk about the Shadow Parliament. The two acolytes, however, tell everything they overheard if the characters remove the Charmed condition from them. Their public testimony disgraces Arvin and Tallis and drives the Shadow Parliament back underground—for now.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.bEUoTaiTT4fbBT4s caption=false]</p>"

She discovered a weeping statue alongside a shrine. Mist then covered the isle, and Valdi and her helpers retreated. Since then, grieving people in Leilon have forgotten much of their past while also becoming darker of mood.</p><p><strong>Hook. </strong>Merrygold Brightshine, priest of Leilon’s Lathander shrine, suspects Shar’s involvement. Merrygold and Valdi ask the characters to investigate the weeping statue. Valdi provides a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.phbmobRowboat000]{Rowboat} (see the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>), and Merrygold provides four <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbagPotionofHea]{Potions of Healing}</em>.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Raven Run.</strong></em> As characters leave for Idol Island, they are followed by a large flock of ravens, animals sacred to Shar. Eventually, the birds swoop down and initiate combat. They include three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSwarmOfRavens]{Swarms of Ravens}</strong> and a fourth group infused with shadow magic (<strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSwarmOfStirge]{Swarm of Stirges}</strong>).</p><p><em><strong>Gloom Mist.</strong></em> Mist around Idol Island dampens nonmagical lights and cantrips so they create only &amp;Reference[Dim Light]. Five sobbing <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifShadow0000000]{Shadows}</strong> ambush the characters as the group nears the shore.</p><p><em><strong>Weeping Goddess.</strong></em> As the party approaches a rough statue fronting an old shrine, sounds of weeping emanate from it. If the group lingers, the crying ceases, and three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifKenku00000000]{Kenku}</strong> and a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultistFanati]{Cultist Fanatic}</strong> loyal to Shar, who were making the weeping noises, emerge from the shrine and order the characters to leave or die.</p><p><em><strong>Entryways.</strong></em> This area has two entrances to the sanctum. A hole opens in the shrine’s southern wall, leading to a flooded tunnel. The shrine’s altar conceals a standard secret door ([[/skill perception 15]] to detect), leading to a dry secret passage.</p><p><em><strong>Flooded Tunnel.</strong></em> Darkness and cloudy water fill this tunnel. Two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifLacedonGhoul0]{Lacedon Ghouls}</strong> have been attracted to the deathly magic here.</p><p><em><strong>Sanctum.</strong></em> Within this sanctuary, which also serves as a barrack, an obsidian pillar glows with violet light. Irric (Medium, Neutral Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifPriest0000000]{Priest}</strong>) dwells here along with three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifKenku00000000]{Kenku}</strong>. Irric uses the pillar to draw sorrow from townsfolk to offer to Shar, hoping she’ll break the curse on his kenku followers. During battle, stolen grief manifests as a weeping <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifShadow0000000]{Shadow}</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> On Irric’s defeat, Shar withdraws her power from the pillar, which returns to normal but blackened stone. The shadows and gloomy mist on Idol Island vanish, as do the unnaturally aggressive ravens.

Bonegnasher has captured a Dalefolk family, the Silverstars, but Sulwood doesn’t know why. Sulwood offers to pay each character [[/award 100GP]] and suggests the tomb might have other plunder.</p><h4>Encounters</h4><p>Bonegnasher dwells in a ruined castle with subterranean tunnels. Use the @UUID[Scene.aifTombOfDamara0]{map} on this page, with the characters entering via the area labeled “Start.” The following encounters happen in the corresponding areas.</p><p><em><strong>Barrack and Great Hall. </strong></em>Two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGhoul00000000]{Ghouls}</strong> dwell in the barrack. If creatures enter the barrack or make loud noises in the great hall, the monsters pounce.</p><p><em><strong>Prison. </strong></em>The four members of the Silverstar family (Medium <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCommoner00000]{Commoners}</strong>) are being kept prisoner here in the corner cell. A <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifHobgoblinCapt]{Hobgoblin Captain}</strong> and two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifHobgoblinWarr]{Hobgoblin Warriors}</strong> are interrogating the family. The hobgoblins are Hostile to anyone other than Bonegnasher who interrupts their work. The youngest Silverstar, Sara, is hiding the key to Damara’s tomb. Once rescued, Sara gratefully gives the key to her rescuers.</p><p><em><strong>Garden. </strong></em>An Indifferent <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGiantFrog0000]{Giant Frog}</strong> lives here.</p><p><em><strong>Storeroom. </strong></em>Six <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGiantRat00000]{Giant Rats}</strong> lurk among the splintered crates and ambush anyone who approaches. As a &amp;Reference[Study] action, a creature can make a [[/skill 10 inv]] check to look for useful supplies, finding a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.equipment.Item.phbagPotionofHea]{Potion of Healing}</em> and five days’ worth of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.equipment.Item.phbagRations0000]{Rations}</em> on a successful check.</p><p><em><strong>Bonegnasher’s Den. </strong></em>Bonegnasher (use the <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifSpecter000000]{Specter}</strong> stat block, but Bonegnasher is Large) takes a break from interrogating the Silverstars here with his two pet <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifWolf000000000]{Wolves}</strong>. He is Hostile toward any unfamiliar creature that enters his room.</p><p><em><strong>Vault. </strong></em>The vault contains [[/award 200GP]].</p><p><em><strong>Armory. </strong></em>A <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCarrionCrawle]{Carrion Crawler}</strong> lurks on the ceiling. Inside the armory is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifLongsword1000]{+1 Longsword}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifShield0000000]{+1 Shield}</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Mine. </strong></em>A <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGelatinousCub]{Gelatinous Cube}</strong> roams the cavern.</p><p><em><strong>Damara’s Tomb.</strong></em> The magic door to this hidden chamber can be opened only with the key kept by Sara Silverstar. Damara is now a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifMummy00000000]{Mummy}</strong> protected by two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifShadow0000000]{Shadows}</strong>. In addition to the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifOrbOfDamara00]{Orb of Damara}</em>, the tomb contains a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.items.Item.aifSpellScrollFi]{Spell Scroll of Fireball}</em>, and [[/award 500GP]].</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion. </strong></em>Lady Sulwood pays the characters as promised on the defeat of Bonegnasher. She says the party can keep any treasure they found while exploring the tomb; if the characters have the <em>Orb of Damara</em>, she recoils at its presence, citing its ominous history and suggesting that the characters find a way to destroy the relic.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.LGino0JW51skPN03 caption=false]</p>"

As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p><p><strong>Flood. </strong>You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a [[/r 1d100cs&lt;26#Vehicle is capsized]]{25 percent} chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water. </strong>You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow. </strong>You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool. </strong>You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a [[/check ability=str skill=ath dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against your spell save DC.</p>",

Now cultists devoted to Cyric have settled there, bringing monsters and evil magic. A ranger of the Order of the Shooting Star (see <em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn</em>) named Keadan Rolamin investigated, but the cult has slain him.</p><p><strong>Hooks. </strong>Uvdi Sarsk, a Mystran priest, contacts the characters and asks them to meet her at the Seven-Stringed Harp, a famous tavern in Secomber. Keadan warned her about the inverted tower and told her its location, but she hasn’t heard from him since. She wants the party to investigate.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>The characters reach the inverted tower in a few days. The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Wild Magic. </strong></em>The inside of the tower is a @UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.content.JournalEntry.dmgDmsToolbox000.JournalEntryPage.xgLA30rErlkjIPAK#wild-magic-zone]{wild magic zone}. See chapter 3 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for rules on wild magic zones.</p><p><em><strong>Living Menhirs.</strong></em> Outside the inverted tower, menhirs and rubble swirl in the air, combining into a creature that defends the entrance. Use the <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAirElemental0]{Air Elemental}</strong> stat block but change its creature type to Construct. When the creature drops to 0 Hit Points, the last menhir animates (use the <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGalebDuhr0000]{Galeb Duhr}</strong> stat block).</p><p><em><strong>Initiation Well.</strong></em> The tower once had a level for each school of magic. Only four levels remain, listed from the top to the bottom:</p><p><strong>Transmutation.</strong> Open to the sky, the transmutation level has three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAwakenedTree0]{Awakened Trees}</strong> and a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifAnimatedRugOf]{Animated Rug of Smothering}</strong>. A Cyric <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBerserker0000]{Berserker}</strong> watching the entry joins any combat.</p><p><strong>Necromancy.</strong> Rough exam tables fill this level. A <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGhastGravecal]{Ghast Gravecaller}</strong> and three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifGhoul00000000]{Ghouls}</strong> converse with a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultistFanati]{Cultist Fanatic}</strong>. They study the dead remains of Keadan, his three comrades, and two slain cultists.</p><p><strong>Illusion.</strong> This level subjects invaders to an illusory maze, but the magic fades as two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultistFanati]{Cultist Fanatics}</strong>, two <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifToughBoss0000]{Tough Bosses}</strong>, and four <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifCultist000000]{Cultists}</strong> use the illusions to surprise interlopers. The area is a barrack stocked with supplies.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Reveal the Room When Ready</h3><p>This floor starts with a Darkness light source enabled to prevent players who enter it from being able to see the room until you're ready to end the illusory maze portion. You can disable the light to reveal the room.</p></article></section><p><strong>Conjuration.</strong> On this level, a human man named Nacrel (Medium, Chaotic Evil <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifMage000000000]{Mage}</strong>) works inside a runic circle, experimenting with a floating silvery-blue orb of energy connected to Weave threads. His allied <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifNightmare0000]{Nightmare}</strong> lurks in the southern tunnel, which leads outside. The orb can be disrupted with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDispelMagi]{Dispel Magic}</em> spell (DC 17) or by slaying Nacrel. Until the orb fails, Nacrel regains 5 Hit Points at the start of each of his turns, provided he has at least 1 Hit Point remaining.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion.</strong></em> Uvdi Sarsk rewards each character with an Uncommon magic item.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.94AzIilsAHZu70Ye caption=false]</p>"

Meanwhile, three <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifBugbearWarrio]{Bugbear Warriors}</strong> hide in the courtyard to ambush anyone who attempts to escape the priory. If the party defeats both groups, the raiders fall back, building a camp. Otherwise, defenders abandon the temple, retreating into the shelter of the sanctuary and living quarters.</p><p><em><strong>Reprieve.</strong></em> The party has a chance to take a Short Rest. The characters might bolster the faith and courage of civilians trapped in the priory, reinforce doors, make barricades, and set improvised traps for invaders. Four <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbagPotionofHea]{Potions of Healing}</em> are stored in the vault. The sanctuary is protected by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplHallow0000]{Hallow}</em> spell.

              "description": "<p><em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p><p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p><p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</p><p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the <em>Greater Restoration</em> spell.</p><p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p><p><strong>Spell Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</p><p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.</p><p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</p><p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails.</p><p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em> to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a [[/r 1d3cs1]]{33 percent chance} that you are unable to cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>",

The vault lies hidden beneath an ancient burial ground in Rashemi territory.</p><p><strong>Hook. </strong>Honored Sage Varelles, a respected Red Wizard, offers the party the honor of plundering the vault on his behalf and bringing any arcane lore there back to him. He warns that others also seek the vault, so speed is of the essence.</p><h3>Encounters</h3><p>Use the map below. The vault’s main features and inhabitants are as follows.</p><p><em><strong>1: Entrance. </strong></em>A withered corpse, killed by a blast of necrotic energy from wards on the pillars, lies here. The wards are now spent, and the pillars nonmagical.</p><p><em><strong>2: Hall of the Blessed Dead. </strong></em>The massive statue of a lich fills the center of this room. Four withered bodies are scattered about. The statue is a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifHauntingReven]{Haunting Revenant}</strong>. It killed rival explorers and tries to kill the party as well.</p><p><em><strong>3: Sarcophagi. </strong></em>Each sarcophagus holds a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifDeathKnightAs]{Death Knight Aspirant}</strong>. If a sarcophagus is opened, the death knight begins combat.</p><p><em><strong>4: Fountain of Dark Knowledge.</strong></em> A fountain of unholy water churns in the room’s center. Narbossa, a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifMarid00000000]{Marid}</strong> drained of color and vitality by the necromantic energy of the vault, is bound to the fountain. Narbossa longs to return to the Elemental Plane of Water. It is Indifferent to the characters, and the spell binding the marid to the fountain can be ended with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDispelMagi]{Dispel Magic}</em> spell (DC 14). If the party fails to end the binding, the marid initiates combat. A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgNecklaceOfPra]{Necklace of Prayer Beads}</em> lies submerged in the fountain.</p><p><em><strong>5: Library. </strong></em>The library holds dozens of rare and ancient books on necromancy, as well as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgTomeOfClearTh]{Tome of Clear Thought}</em>. A statue depicting Velsharoon is a <strong>@UUID[Actor.aifStoneGolem000]{Stone Golem}</strong> that fights if the books are touched.</p><p><em><strong>6: Puzzle Sphere. </strong></em>A sphere of complex, interlocking metal bands with an inky void at its core floats in this room. A character who takes a &amp;Reference[Study] action to inspect the sphere and succeeds on a [[/skill 20 arc]] check deduces incantations required to make the sphere’s bands align, opening a portal to Mungoth, the third layer of Gehenna, where Velsharoon’s divine realm is found.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusion. </strong></em>Varelles pays [[/award 5000gp]] for the books from the library, doubling his offer if the party brings him the <em>Tome of Clear Thought</em> unused. Each character’s Renown Score with the Red Wizards increases by 1.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-adventures-faerun.book.JournalEntry.aifAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.XoP1woB6toNfQojo caption=false]</p>"
