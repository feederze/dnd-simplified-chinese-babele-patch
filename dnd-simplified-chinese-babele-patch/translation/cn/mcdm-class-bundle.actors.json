You use Intelligence whenever a power refers to your manifestation ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a talent power you manifest and when making an attack roll with a talent power.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Power save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Power attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p><strong>Manifestation Die.</strong> You have a manifestation die that you use when making manifestation tests (see below). At 1st level, your manifestation die is a d4. The die changes as you gain talent levels, as shown in the Manifestation Die column of the Talent table.</p><p><strong>Manifestation Score.</strong> Every power of 2nd order or higher has a manifestation score equal to its order. A power's manifestation score increases by 1 for every other power you are concentrating on when you manifest it. For example, if you attempt to manifest the 2nd-order <em>again</em> power while concentrating on <em>apparition</em> and <em>caress of fire</em>, the manifestation score of <em>again</em> is 4.</p><p><strong>Manifestation Tests. </strong>Whenever you manifest a power of 2nd order or higher, you must make a manifestation test at the end of the power's manifestation time . To make a manifestation test, roll your manifestation die and note the result:</p><ul><li><p>If the roll is higher than the power's manifestation score, you manifest the power.</p></li><li><p>If the roll is equal to the power's manifestation score, you manifest the power, then gain 1 strain.</p></li><li><p>If the roll is lower than the power's manifestation score, you manifest the power, then gain strain equal to the power's order.</p></li></ul><p>If the amount of strain you gain from manifesting a power would cause you to exceed your strain maximum (see “Strain” below), you can choose to either manifest the power then immediately die; or to not manifest the power, gain no strain, and drop to 0 hit points</p><h2>Strain</h2><p>Manifesting psionic powers can put stress on a manifester's body, mind, and soul. The strain mechanic represents this stress for your talent character.</p><p><strong>Strain Maximum.</strong> At 1st level, your strain maximum is 5. If your strain ever exceeds your strain maximum, you die. If you are returned to life after dying as a result of gaining strain, you return to life with strain equal to your strain maximum.</p><p>Your strain maximum increases as you gain talent levels, as shown in the Strain Maximum column of the Talent table.</p><p><strong>Gaining Strain.</strong> Strain can manifest in three different ways for a talent:</p><ul><li><p>When you gain body strain, your physical prowess is depleted.</p></li><li><p>When you gain mind strain, your mental fortitude weakens.</p></li><li><p>When you gain soul strain, your connection to self and reality weakens.</p></li></ul><p>Whenever you gain strain, you choose which type of strain it is and how much strain is applied as that type. For example, if you gain 3 strain while manifesting a 3rd-order power, you can choose to gain all 3 strain as body, mind, or soul strain; you can gain 2 strain in body and 1 in mind; you can gain 1 strain each in body, mind, and soul; and so forth.</p><p><strong>Strain Effects.</strong> As you gain strain, you gain detrimental strain effects as shown on the Talent Strain table. These effects are cumulative. For instance, if you have 3 body strain, you have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and your speed is halved.</p><p><strong>Reducing Strain.</strong> When you finish a short rest, you can spend Hit Dice to remove strain instead of using them to regain hit points. For each Hit Die spent this way, you lose 1 strain from body, mind, or soul (your choice). When you finish a long rest, your strain is reduced to 0.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p><strong>1st-Order Powers:</strong> At 1st level, you know four 1st-order powers. You learn additional 1st-order powers of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the 1st-order Powers column of the Talent table. Manifesting 1st-order powers doesn't require a manifestation test.</p><p><strong>Powers Known.</strong> At 1st level, you know two 2nd-order powers, which are the highest-order powers you can manifest. When you reach certain levels of this class, you can manifest powers of higher orders: 3rd-order powers at 5th level, 4th-order powers at 9th level, 5th-order powers at 13th level, and 6th-order powers at 17th level.</p><h2>Learning New Powers</h2><p>At 1st level, you can learn only 2nd-order powers, and can manifest 1st-order and 2nd-order powers. But as you increase in level, there is no limit to the number of powers of 2nd order or higher that you can learn. Whenever you are able to manifest powers of a particular order, you can learn powers of that order.</p><p>Each time you gain a level in this class, you can learn one new power of any order between 2nd and the highest order of power you can manifest. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the powers you already know and replace it with another power of the same order or lower (minimum 2nd order).</p><p><strong>Learning from Others.</strong> Whenever another creature you can see within 30 feet of you manifests a psionic power of 2nd order or higher, and that power is one you can learn and don't already know, you can use a reaction to roll your manifestation die. If you roll higher than the power's baseline order (ignoring any order increase when the power is manifested), you begin to learn the power. If you roll lower than the power's baseline order, you fail to learn the power and can't attempt to do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>The <em><strong>Learning New Powers</strong></em> table shows how long it takes to learn a new power you have successfully observed. You must spend 1 hour doing nothing but practicing the power each day of the learning period, and you can't attempt to learn any other new powers during this time. This 1-hour period of practice can be undertaken as a short rest. If you fail to spend 1 hour each day of the learning period studying the power, or if you begin to learn a different power before the learning period is over, you must successfully observe the power once more before trying to learn it this way again.</p><p></p><table><caption>Learning New Powers</caption><thead><tr><th>Order</th><th>Learning Period</th></tr></thead><tbody style=\"text-align:center\"><tr><td>2nd</td><td>1 Day</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>4 Days</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>8 Days</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>12 Days</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>16 Days</td></tr></tbody></table>",

But if the characters are charged with rescuing a fallen druid NPC's owlbear pet from the clutches of a villain, the GM can choose to instead make that an owlbear companion, allowing the creature to join their rescuers and become part of subsequent adventures.</p>",

If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by this power.</p><p>If you target a creature directly or target an object being carried or worn by a creature, the creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, or if you target an object that is not carried or worn, you move the target creature or object up to 30 feet in any direction, including up, but not beyond the range of this power. Until the end of your next turn, the target is held in your telekinetic grip, and is &amp;reference[restrained] if it is a creature. A target lifted up is suspended in midair, and begins to fall as soon as this power no longer affects it.</p><p>On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to maintain your telekinetic grip on the target. If the target is a creature, they can repeat the saving throw to break your grip and end the power's effect on them.</p><p>As part of moving an object with this power, you can make a ranged power attack with the object against one creature in the path of its movement. If the attack hits, the target takes 5d10 bludgeoning damage from a Huge object, 4d10 bludgeoning damage from a Large object, or 3d10 bludgeoning damage from a Medium or smaller object.</p><p>You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.</p><fieldset><legend>Foundry Note</legend><p>This power has been modified for this creature's statblock.
