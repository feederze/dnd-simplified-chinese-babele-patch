      "description": "<blockquote><p>Over a thousand years ago the Demon Queen, Nehebkelat, and her four dread generals ruled an empire that spanned a continent. Her tyranny was opposed by an ancient and noble order, the Eyes of Aten, who after a century of terrible conflict defeated the dread generals and cast down the Demon Queen, imprisoning her for a thousand years. Those thousand years have now passed and the ancient order of protectors who imprisoned the Demon Queen has been lost to time.</p></blockquote><p>In <em>The Demon Queen Awakens</em>, the player characters represent the only heroes willing to assist the last surviving member of the Eyes of Aten - charged with the sacred duty of preventing Nehebkelat from escaping her prison. Upon entering the Vault of Aten, the heroes will realize this is no easy task. Dark forces have awoken to ensure that Nehebkelat will rise again and subjugate the continent beneath her abyssal rule.</p>",

When transformed it takes on the traits of the new form (finesse, two-handed, heavy, etc), but does not gain the benefit of increased damage for the versatile trait. Regardless of the weapon type, it always deals 1d8 radiant damage, and if a ranged weapon, never requires ammunition.</p>"

However, given the danger and difficulties the adventurers must face, victory is hardly a guarantee. This section will cover some of the possible resolutions to the story, and provide GMs with guidance for how to handle alternative outcomes.</p><h2>Saving the World</h2><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>The Demon Queen is Bound</h5><p>As the final binding pillar is realigned, the Demon Queen unleashes a roar of unbridled fury and defiance...but she is too late to stop what happens next. A tremendous thunderclap sounds within the chamber and resonates throughout the prison, walls rumble and dust shakes loose overhead. Underfoot, the stones on the floor tremble and shake and for a moment you fear the prison itself may collapse around you.</p><p>The capstone of each pillar flashes with a light as brilliant as the sun itself, briefly blinding everyone in the chamber! With your ears ringing and your vision swimming with spots you are forced to find ways to steady yourselves. When finally your senses clear, you find that in the center of the room that the Demon Queen Nehebkelat has been frozen in time, her face still contorted by her final howl of defiance. A slowly churning vortex of chromatic light encases her, and periodically waves of energy pulse along the magical chains leading to her shackles. The Demon Queen's awakening has been stopped again, for another thousand years.</p></div><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>For the fate of the heroes and their allies go to:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[.ZcUN114fxnvvP38O]{Adventure Epilogues}</p><h2>Dooming the World</h2><p>The final battle with the Demon Queen is no easy encounter, and the risk of defeat is a very real one. This is not the only way that the adventure can end with Nehebkelat's victory, though. The possible negative endings are as follows:</p><h3>Joining the Queen</h3><p>Should the players choose to side with the Demon Queen (she will make the offer upon first contact) they will find Abasi, Kesi, Uraeus and Last (and any surviving Ushabti) immediately attempt to convince them to change their minds. If that fails, they will turn hostile, and must be defeated.</p><p>Win or lose, this chaos and betrayal gives Nehebkelat the moment she needs to escape, allowing her to easily overtake any remaining foes. If the players choose to join the Demon Queen's ranks, they become powerful figures in the newly formed empire of blood. If they do not they are free to travel the lands and pursue whatever fates they desire, as the Demon Queen holds true to her promise of letting them live.</p><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>The Demon Queen is Aided</h5><p>With the shackles broken and the last of the last of the Eyes of Aten laying on the ground defeated, the Demon Queen cackles with elation and stretches, enjoying her newfound freedom. She surveys the carnage around her and congratulates the \"heroes\" that have come to her aide.</p><p>With the aide of the party she is able to make her escape from the prison, pausing only to destroy the Dial of Aten at its heart. Her Dread Generals, freed from their equally eternal prison march beside you as you emerge from the Vault of Aten. You have scarcely reached the surface and already she has begun discussing plans for a new century of violence, conquest and subjugation.</p></div><h3>Losing in Battle</h3><p>If the players all fall in battle, the Demon Queen will free herself as the last of the prison’s magic fails. She then resurrects her generals, and begins a campaign to capture the lands of mortals anew. </p><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>The Demon Queen Escapes</h5><p>As you lay upon the stone in the prison of Nehebkelat, with the life slowly fading from your broken bodies, you bear witness to the Demon Queen's victory. Cackling with elation, she stretches, feeling the absence of her chains, and then begins collecting the amulets of the sky. </p><p>\"I had a thousand years to dwell on my defeat at the hands of mortals, it pleases me to know they were the best that this plane could muster. Retaking the mortal lands should be much simpler if this pitiful showing is the worst I have to contend with...\" She mocks you as the world goes dim. The last sight you see before slipping away is her massive serpentine form vanishing past the door of the chamber and slipping away towards freedom</p><p>With the Eyes of Aten finally destroyed and the kingdoms of mortals too lazy or corrupt to fight her, the world does not stand a chance. Soon the surrounding kingdoms fall under her iron grip once more, and the Demon Queen reclaims her terrible throne, to plunge the mortal realm once more into centuries of her dark rule.</p></div>"

The last remnants of the order knew that they had only the rest of their mortal lives to prepare for the next awakening. Though a daunting task, they now had vaults of gold and stores of knowledge to work from. The order could be re-established.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Abasi and Kesi perished</h5><p>With no living members of the Eyes of Aten, the party remains the only mortal souls aware of the Vault of Aten and the horror that rests within. As they leave the vault they find this knowledge weighs on them. </p></div><h2>Abasi</h2><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Abasi lived</h5><p>In truth, the old warrior-priest never actually expected to survive the effort of containing the Demon Queen. In the minutes after her imprisonment he found himself feeling a profound sense of loss, for with his purpose fulfilled, what did he have now? As they began to leave the vault, Abasi seemed almost listless- but it did not take long for him to come to find new purpose. A new cause revealed itself to him.</p><p>With Nehebkelat defeated and the Vault once more under control, the Eyes of Aten would need to be rebuilt. Without the order, who would purge the lands of corruption? They had a thousand years to establish the order with enough strength to ensure the Demon Queen remained forever imprisoned.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Abasi perished</h5><p>With Abasi's death in the Vault there were now no living members of the Eyes of Aten who truly understood the state of the modern world and the corruption that now festered in it. Had the old warrior-priest lived the battle against evil might have been less blind. Sadly, this was not so, and any efforts to root out the loyalists of Nehebkelat would become monumentally more difficult.</p></div><h2>Kesi</h2><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Kesi lived</h5><p>Dauntless, the young priestess of the Eyes of Aten was very quick to realise that the Order must be rebuilt. If the Vault had fallen into such disrepair then it must mean the Eyes of Aten too had dwindled. Kesi had untold firsthand knowledge of the Demon Queen's last rule, of precepts and knowledge of the order long lost to time.</p><p>Still, she was stepping into a world that was a thousand years removed from the one she knew. Though she was a quick study, it would cost her years to learn the lay of the land and the politics of the realms. It was going to be an onerous task.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Kesi perished</h5><p>With the oldest and more knowledgeable member of the Eyes of Aten lost, with her went untold firsthand knowledge of the Demon Queen's last rule, the precepts and knowledge of the order, and the ancient magic it wielded against the forces of darkness. </p></div><h2>Imey-er-Sekhrey (Last)</h2><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Last was never repaired</h5><p>Last languished on the stone of the Vault, forgotten, broken, and worthless. Eventually the magic faded from his damaged body, leaving him nothing more than another ancient statue of an age long forgotten by mortal history.</p><ul><li><strong>If Kesi Lived</strong>: Eventually the ancient priestess repaired the last of the Ushabti protectors. Restoring to him not only his body, but his name: Imey-er-Sekhrey. Beside her, he rose once more as her immortal bodyguard, attending her as she undertook the great effort to rebuild the Eyes of Aten.</li></ul></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Last survived the final battle</h5><p>Scarred and damaged as the ancient protector was, Last continued to serve the Eyes of Aten as a faithful protector for as long as the powerful magic animating him remained. </p><ul><li><strong>If Kesi and Abasi perished</strong>: With no members of the once-powerful order of the Eyes of Aten remaining, Imey-er-Sekhrey resigned himself to being the final protector of the Vault. Though the last Ushabti knew he would never be able to stop the Demon Queen's next awakening, he knew that he must try; it is what he was made to do.</li><li><strong>If he was destroyed, but either Kesi or Abasi lived:</strong> Though Imey-er-Sekhrey was broken and scattered across the stone during the final confrontation with Nehebkelat, the Eyes of Aten would never forget his tireless loyalty and protection. The remnants of the order swore oaths over his remains to one day build new Ushabti, though there would never be another like Imey-er-Sekhrey.</li></ul></div><h2>The Party</h2><p>With the world saved and the Demon Queen locked away for another thousand years the party is free to collect payment and return to their lives, or retire and never work another day in their life!</p><h3>Payout</h3><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Abasi Lived</h5><p>Grateful for their assistance, Abasi sees to the immediate payment of 2,000 gold from the Vault of Aten's treasure room as a bonus, and when they eventually return to civilization he makes good on his promise to deliver the full 8,000 gold for the job well done. He wishes the party safe travels, and that their way is lit by the guiding light of Aten.</p></div><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> [[/award 2000gp]]</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> [[/award 8000gp]]</p><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Abasi died but Kesi Lived</h5><p>The ancient priestess will happily handle payment for the heroes if Abasi was unfortunate enough to perish, though she explains that she must keep the majority of the treasures from the vault for the order. With the Demon Queen defeated, those coffers are all she has at her disposal to help rebuild the Eyes of Aten. Someone must be ready to stop the Demon Queen when next she awakens.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h5><strong>If Abasi and Kesi Perished</strong></h5><p>With no one to pay them, they were left to help themselves to the gold in the vault's treasure rooms. The logistics of carrying out hundreds of thousands of gold would prove quite insurmountable, but since they were the only survivors, they could return as often as they liked for more.</p></div><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Note</strong>: 50 coins weigh 1 lb, and all containers have carrying limits.</p><h3>Recruitment</h3><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>If Abasi or Kesi Lived</h5><p>Either (or both) of these characters will offer to recruit any willing members of the party into the Eyes of Aten. They recognize that in another thousand years the world will face this exact problem, and the world is already badly decayed thanks to the Demon Queen's influence. They will need to rebuild and root out the sources of corruption if it will survive the next awakening.</p><p>Their presence in the Eyes of Aten would be welcomed, and quite valuable! It's acceptable to say no, and the offer will always be available if they should ever change their mind. Those of the party that agree spend the rest of their lives rooting out evil and corruption, recruiting heroes to the cause and preparing the world for the next time<strong> </strong><em><strong>the Demon Queen awakens.</strong></em></p></div>"

              "text": "<h2>An Empire of Blood</h2><p>Over a thousand years ago the Demon Queen, Nehebkelat, ruled an empire that spanned a continent. Her dominion was forged in the blood of subjugated nations and protected by four dread generals - each of whom commanded a place at Nehebkelat's side by destroying or enslaving any who dared to oppose her. These dread generals commanded vast legions of demonic servants, elemental slaves, and armies of corrupted mortals pledged to Nehebkelat's bloody crusade.</p><p>For centuries the Demon Queen ruled unopposed, and without equal. She was cruel, depraved, and brought nothing but devastation to the lands she claimed as hers. The people within her borders knew only suffering, save those who served her and were rewarded. The survivors of conquered and broken nations lived in fear, because any who drew Nehebkelat's wrathful gaze were swiftly erased from existence. None dared to oppose the immortal tyrant openly ... none except The Eyes of Aten, a secret order that dedicated itself to combating the scourge of the Demon Queen.</p><p>At the height of Nehebkelat’s power the Eyes of Aten recruited and united the land's mightiest warriors to resist the great generals, cripple their armies, and weaken their grasp upon the land. The resistance struggled for over a century of battle, hardship, and loss - the lands of the empire stained red with blood of human and demon alike. At last, rallied behind the banners of the order's greatest champions, the Eyes of Aten cast down the dread generals and defeated the Demon Queen - binding her in unbreakable chains.</p><p>This triumphant victory was not final, however, for while Nehebkelat was defeated she could not be destroyed. The Demon Queen was an immortal being with fiendish magic so potent that her body could neither be banished nor destroyed. The few beleagured survivors of the Eyes of Aten knew that there could be no total victory, not against evil so terrible. </p><p>Desperate for a solution that would return the lands to control of the mortals and break the empire of blood’s stranglehold, the Eyes of Aten imprisoned Nehebkelat and her generals. With powerful magic they shackled her body and bound her mind in a timeless sleep deep within a sacred vault built in an uncharted desert. The demonic souls of Nehebkelat's dread generals were likewise bound within potent vessels from which escape would be impossible. So powerful was this binding magic that it would last for one-thousand years.</p><p>To power such potent magic required a terrible cost; the great heroes of the Eyes of Aten sacrificed themselves - giving their own life energy to empower the binding of Nehebkelat's restraints. Through this final act of sacrifice, Nehebkelat was imprisoned. Peace and prosperity blossomed from the broken ruins of her demonic empire. Time marched onward, nations rebuilt, and the peoples of the land healed. Now, even though the continent still bears scars inflicted by the Demon Queen and her armies, none remain who remember her horrific rule.</p><h2>The Eyes, Blinded</h2><p>As years trickled through the great hourglass of time the Eyes of Aten did their best to remain vigilant protectors over the lands they fought to liberate, and for a while they were celebrated as saviors and heroes. For decades after their victory many joined the order and pledged their support, but this was not to last.</p><p>The Eyes of Aten were never able to fully rebuild after vanquishing the Demon Queen; the toll of that struggle had been too great, and they lacked the leadership of their greatest champions and leaders who had sealed themselves within the Demon Queen's prison. Worse still... they lacked a clear enemy to fight and a clear evil to oppose. Slowly their ranks dwindled as their surviving heroes casting their gaze towards other pursuits.</p><p>Pockets of surviving Nehebkelat loyalists strove, even in the face of crushing defeat, to prepare the lands for the Demon Queen's return. They worked to erode support for the Eyes of Aten, to corrupt newly reformed nations, and to seed injustice and cruelty into their laws and customs. Over time the Eyes of Aten found themselves suffering wounds from an enemy they could not even see.</p><p>Like sand falling in an hourglass, the Eyes of Aten dwindled. Many who could not muster the courage to continue the fight forsook their oaths and left the order. Those who remained had forgotten much of their history, misplaced or squandered their resources, lost all of the fame and support they once had. The order was fractured and scattered across the land, a disappearing shadow of its former greatness.</p><h2>The Final Guardian</h2><p>Now, after a thousand years have passed, none remember the Eyes of Aten or their ancient charge. None except one, a lone descendent of the ancient order of protectors who saved the world so long ago. His name is Abasi, and unlike his faithless brethren he was undaunted, and stayed true to his ancient charge and remembered the terrible evil which his ancestors had locked away. </p><p>In Abasi's time the Eyes of Aten numbered only three dozen, and they were dedicated to the task of gathering support for the cause: the Demon Queen must not awaken. Though their numbers were few, they dispersed themselves far and wide to carry out this task. Over time they began to disappear or turn up dead, or support they’d gotten would suddenly be withdrawn without warning or explanation. A year came and passed with no contact from the other members of the order, and Abasi knew in his heart that the sacred duty of the Eyes of Aten was now his alone to oversee. He must succeed or die in the attempt. </p><p>Abasi traveled across the land, imploring viziers and princes to once again pledge their mightiest warriors and potent mages to a noble cause: that the Demon Queen must remain safely imprisoned for another millenium. To Abasi’s shock they laughed at what they believed to be superstitious doom-saying, some even going so far as to suggest that Nehebkelat never truly existed and was just a tale used to scare children before bed. Such was their derision that Abasi almost came to doubt his own creed, but he was a man of stern soul and great will, and so he wandered on. If the order's ancient allies would not rally behind him, Abasi knew that he must find any who would.</p><h2>Desperate Times</h2><p>As the final grains of sand trickled through the hourglass, Abasi knew that any hope of success depended on finding powerful allies. Unable to depend upon the righteousness of his cause to motivate the rulers of the land, Abasi turned towards more worldly motivation - offering all that remained of the order's hidden treasuries to be divided among any heroes that would join his cause. </p><p>Raiding abandoned order safehouses and headquarters, Abasi opened every one of the hidden vaults he could find; emptying ancient coffers of gold, and collecting ancient relics as he went. To his dismay, what little coin remained within the vaults would never be enough to raise an army and the relics that those secret ossuaries contained were more interesting to collectors than champions. Yet a few still answered the call - for reasons that Abasi could not guess and dared not question. He could only pray that together they would be strong enough for what was to come. </p>"

              "text": "<p>This journal entry is intended to give the Gamemaster of this adventure an overview of how the magic of the Vault of Aten works, so that any questions by especially inquisitive characters with a background in magic can be properly informed.</p><h2>How does the Vault's magic work?</h2><p>At the core of the vault is a powerful arcane focus that uses divine magic from the sun and powerful wards throughout the vault and its stonework to amplify and shape the magical energy. This is coupled with the powerful life energy of four great heroes to further amplify the magic until it's strong enough to create shackles that will hold the Demon Queen.</p><p>However, over time this magic will weaken, especially as the Demon Queen begins to stir and struggle against her bonds, stressing the magical warding and causing it to fray. Couple this with outside influence, specifically from Nekhbel-Amun, a caster, and the magic can be eroded to the point escape is possible.</p><h2>What schools of magic are used in the Vault?</h2><p>Nearly every school of magic is used in some way throughout the vault:</p><p><strong>Abjuration </strong>is used heavily for the creation of magical barriers, negating the powers of the generals and the Demon Queen, and weakening them to the point that they cannot fully break out of the prison without external assistance or the decaying of the magic itself. This can be observed more directly in Nehebkelat's arena, where she is chained and how those chains drag her back to the center of the arena as a lair action.</p><p><strong>Conjuration </strong>is used to contain the generals in pocket dimensions within the sepulchers. This is directly referenced by Nehkbel-Amun's dialog declaring his unwillingness to \"go back.\" It's also used for various magical passageways that open up after certain criteria are met, like the bridges in the sundial room and Ansubek's sepulcher.</p><p><strong>Divination </strong>is not well utilized in the vault, and does not appear in any notable way.</p><p><strong>Enchantment </strong>is used minimally, and only in conjunction with Illusion (below) to keep interlopers from finding or disturbing the vault unless they have a way to push through the magical wards.</p><p><strong>Evocation </strong>is used extensively to pull power from divine and arcane sources both in the sun and in the souls of the heroes interred in the vault sepulchers. It is not used to deal harm or damage, but as the primary means for channeling energy needed to power other effects.</p><p><strong>Illusion </strong>is used minimally, primarily to keep the whole of the Vault and its exterior edifice from being noticed by unwelcome visitors. Within the vault there is very little use of this school of magic.</p><p><strong>Necromancy </strong>is extensively used not only to draw on the life force of the heroes within the sepulcher, but also to keep the Order's sleepers in suspended sleep without aging, withering or dying. Sadly, this didn't protect them from being killed, but it is directly seen as part of why @UUID[.0JUK8U1RlyfmxVur]{Kesi the Divine Artificer} is still alive after a thousand years.</p><p><strong>Transmutation </strong>is subtly used throughout the Vault, largely to make the structure of the dungeon more resilient and able to withstand the ravages of time and the elements. It is also used to transform sunlight into more powerful radiant energy that is used elsewhere in the dungeon.</p><h2>Why are the Sepulchers themed to the Generals?</h2><p>This was largely done to capitalize on sympathetic ties to the generals themselves. By creating environs that are similar to their domains, or laden with the remains of their victims the vaults resonate more strongly with the souls of the generals, allowing the magic of the Vault to impact them more strongly.</p><p>Unfortunately, this also allows the generals to exert their own influence over the sepulchers, allowing them to have lair actions, but this was considered a necessary risk, and acceptable given the fact that the generals should never actually be loose and awake in their sepulchers.</p><p>Sadly, the designers couldn't foresee the future!</p><h2>Why are the Heroes interred with the Generals?</h2><p>This ties into the vault's sympathetic designs. By interring the Eyes of Aten heroes that were responsible for defeating each Dread General, any life force magic used to imprison the general would resonate in a more profound way, as it was coming from a mortal who had already defeated them once.</p><h2>Are the Heroes dead?</h2><p>Technically the heroes are not dead but are in a timeless sleep which they can never be woken from. It is theoretically possible that with potent enough magic they could be woken from the sleep, and if they died they could certainly be resurrected. However, based on their state when first discovered, they are not dead, and cannot be woken from this sleep by any mundane means.</p><h2>Who knows about the design of the Vault?</h2><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">@UUID[.0JUK8U1RlyfmxVur]{Kesi the Divine Artificer} knows the most about the Vault's design and magic. She can help inform the player characters of the history and magic in the place, how it came to be, and how it works.</p><p>There are also clues about the function of the vault scattered throughout the location that will help provide small bits of insight into how the vault works.</p>"

              "text": "<h2>Appearance</h2><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>Abasi the Undaunted</h5><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">Abasi is tall, broad shouldered, and muscular. His garb is simple and light with no more armor than absolutely necessary. Though it is obvious he attempts to keep his head clean-shaved, a few days growth of gray hair now betray his age. </p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">A network of scars are cut into his deeply tanned and weather-worn face, down his cheek, to neck and shoulders. It seems that this aging warrior's life has seen no shortage of battle. Unlike most who break under the stress of constant danger, he does not appear the least bit diminished by such trials. His eyes are the color of the morning dawn, and his gaze is stern.  </p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">At rest he is still, with the patient bearing of a hawk watching for prey.</p></div><h2>Personality</h2><p>Abasi is somewhere between historian, priest, and warrior, as he has lived a life dedicated to protecting people from evil. Despite a life of trial and danger he remains a willful and dedicated protector who does not hesitate to do what is right.</p><h3>Abasi is...</h3><ul><li><strong>Proud.</strong> He comes from a long line of defenders chosen by the very gods themselves to protect mankind from the greatest evils of the land. This gives him great purpose.</li><li><strong>Passionate.</strong> In another life he would have been a poet and historian who traveled the lands writing of its people and their beauty. He sees beauty and artistry in all things.</li><li><strong>Wisened.</strong> He could not have spent a life fighting evil and injustice if he were a foolish man. Though he acts decisively when the time is right, he is never brash or impatient.</li><li><strong>Fearless.</strong> He knows that his life has been just and good. Even if he fails this last mission, the gods will not find him lacking.</li><li><strong>Honest.</strong> He knows that lies and deceit are the weapons of evil men and monsters, so he reserves his subterfuge for them, not the folk he is meant to protect.</li><li><strong>Generous.</strong> Though he has lived a difficult life, and lost most everything he holds dear, he has not let this rob him of kindness for the weak, ill, and poor.</li></ul><h2>Background &amp; History</h2><p>For ages there were a dozen family lines chosen to protect the lands. Abasi was one of them. His father was a protector, as was his mother, and both his grandparents. He was raised with adopted siblings and \"uncles\" within the order. He can count on one hand the friends he has who were not part of the great families dedicated to keeping the forces of evil at bay, and balancing the scales so that all creation would not fall into destruction.</p><p>He was taught that his family was one of many that had been chosen by the gods to stand watch over the people the sun fell, and the evil ran free in the darkness, with no gods to watch them. He learned that their eyes were golden to reflect the light of the sun god, so that all they looked upon would be safe. So that no wickedness could stand their gaze.</p><p>For all his life he fought back the forces of evil and championed the causes of good, just men, as he was chosen to. It was a tireless calling, but one he did without reservation. As the years went on the order was slowly whittled down, families corrupted, children killed in cradles, and support withdrawn by rulers whose hearts were turned rancid by the temptation of evil. In time the order withered, and shrank as fathers, mothers, and siblings fell to the the darkest machinations of monster and man.</p><p>When Abasi found himself among the last of his order he refused to abandon his cause. He would make sure that Nehebkelat was paid in full for her deeds, and that she would be dragged before the gods, measured, and found wanting. It would be the last thing he did, and perhaps it would be enough.</p><h2>Insights &amp; Opinions</h2><p>Abasi may have grown up in the Eyes of Aten, but much of it was gone by his time. What he learned of it is only a fraction of what used to exist. He is very much traveling blind in many situations, especially in regards to the Vault, Demon Queen, and her generals.</p><p>Refer to @JournalEntry[yYTw7GSNzcKvjpPq]{Prologue: Unlikely Heroes} for what Abasi knows of the situation.</p><p>Abasi is partially fluent in the old languages found in the Vault and does his best to translate, but it takes time.</p><h3>Wise Sayings</h3><ul><li>Know yourself and you will know the gods and their opinion of you.</li><li>A person's undoing begins in their mind, and ends at their hand.</li><li>A master can only point the way, it is experience that leads the student.</li><li>Remember that one foot is not enough to walk with, a man needs two, and a fox twice that.</li><li>I have found it best to measure a person by cause, but to judge them by effect.</li><li>Knowledge is not necessarily wisdom. Though both are bought at a great personal cost.</li><li>The scales must ever be balanced in one's heart, or they will tip you into oblivion.</li><li>A house has the character of the one who lives in it.</li><li>To speak the name of the dead is to make them live again... but speak their name too much or too loudly and they might think themselves alive again.</li></ul>"

Chambers of Repose}.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>Imey-er-Sekhrey, the Ushabti Captain</h5><p>Seven feet tall, broad, and imposing, this ushabti guardian appears to be made of a reddish-brown sandstone pieced together like a mannequin. As commander of all other ushabti, Imey-er-Sekhrey wears a mixture of simple garb; a cloth skirt and braces, but is also adorned with ornate gemmed armbands, a decorated usekh collar, and an embroidered cloth cap. He also has extremely pronounced divine and arcane markings carved into his stony form, all of them glowing brightly with blue energy.</p><p>Slowly, all cracks and fissures in his ancient stone body are healing themselves over, making the stone look pristine and perfectly carved.</p></div><h2>Personality</h2><p>Restored to his former glory, Imey-er-Sekhrey is an aloof and reserved guardian with great cunning and little to say. As one would expect of a sentry, he is always watchful and alert of his surroundings.</p><h3>Imey-er-Sekhrey is...</h3><ul><li><strong>Determined</strong>. He was created with a small handful of purposes: to protect the vault, to defend the Eyes of Aten, and to stop the Demon Queen. He cannot be swayed from these tasks, and will face the foes of his order without reservation. He does not believe in mercy for those that serve the Demon Queen.</li><li><strong>Loyal</strong>. Whether through the magic that made him or by choice, he is absolutely loyal to the Eyes of Aten and their members. He will follow their orders, and will even sacrifice himself if it means one of them will live instead.</li><li><strong>Protective</strong>. He was made to be the master and commander of the other Ushabti, as a result he is protective of them and if able would like to recover them. Despite this, he will not hesitate to destroy any of his underlings if failure to do so would result in one of the order dying.</li><li><strong>Intelligent</strong>. He was the first of the Ushabti ever made and as such was imbued with a greater intelligence and will than any others. He is akin to a true consciousness, not simply a mindless automaton. This allows him a greater ability to think tactically, reason, and be reasoned with. </li></ul><h2>Background</h2><p>Over a thousand years ago the Eyes of Aten began working on methods of creating immortal sentries that could protect their vaults, ossuaries and armories. The task would take decades to perfect, and would suffer many failed attempts.<br />Imey-er-Sekhrey was the first success to come of this project. Because the process was new and the methods still being refined, he came out unwaveringly good and loyal, but also too smart and self-aware for an immortal sentry. This lead to a great amount of debate over the process, the result, and what to do with \"The First\" as he was initially known.</p><p>Ultimately the priests that created him were not comfortable destroying a thinking, sapient construct, and also recognized his potential. The priests offered him the chance to become the leader of all future Shabti, a posting he quickly agreed to. As a result he was given the name and title of Imey-er-Sekhrey. More than that the priests imbued him with the power to sense the location and state of all of Shabti, and to command them from afar.</p><p>For a century he served as the first watcher of the Vault of Aten, and when it was repurposed into a prison he become the guardian of sleeping priests. He bears these titles with great pride, something no other construct is capable of doing.</p><h2>Insights</h2><p>When restored to proper working order Imey-er-Sekhrey's memories come flooding back and he can accurately retell the events that occurred in the Vault after the sleepers were put to rest. However he knows little of the time before this as he spent much of his time in the divine workshop where he and his underlings were made. To know more about the order @UUID[.0JUK8U1RlyfmxVur]{Kesi the Divine Artificer} is the NPC to speak to.</p><h3>What happened in the Vault?</h3><p>Everything was quiet for centuries. The worst the ushabti ever had to deal with were the odd snake, scorpion or spider creeping into the tomb and nesting too close to the sleeping priests. He and his underlings silently patrolled the Vault and waited for the time to come when they would need to wake the sleepers.</p><p>They did not notice the prisons of the generals breaking open, nor did they notice the generals manipulating the tombs. It was only when Anubhet was freed and rose from his throne that they realized something was amiss.</p><p>He gave the order for all Ushabti to rally in the Sepulcher of Dusk to fight back the Stygian Monolith, but to his horror, Anubhet quickly overpowered the Ushabti and enslaved them, turning them into corrupted Ushabti. Before he knew it he was the last of them.</p><p>Imey-er-Sekhrey proved too powerful and too wilfull to be corrupted, however, and quickly fled to begin waking the sleeping priests so that a proper defense could be mounted. Sadly, he was quickly overtaken by the corrupted and found himself fighting ferociously to protect the sleepers, while the few that had woken up were slain.</p><p>Eventually cornered, he managed to save only Kesi, albeit at great personal cost, leaving himself badly damaged with a fractured mind and no clear recollection of who he was or what had happened.</p>"

              "name": "Biography: Kesi the Divine Artificer",
              "text": "<h2>Appearance</h2><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>Kesi the Artificer</h5><p>Kesi is woman of modest stature but stark appearance. With a shaved head, garb that is a mixture of sky blue vestments, bronze scale armor, an excessive amount of jewelry, and a mace hung from her belt, it is impossible to identify her as any one thing. The countless acessories she wears are made up mostly of charms and icons of the various gods of the lands or mystical symbols, many of which are unfamiliar to contemporary eyes. Her every movement jingles noisily, yet she leaves no footprints where she walks.</p></div><h2>Personality</h2><p>Kesi is a good-hearted person by nature, keenly minded, and happy to let people figure things out themselves while she quietly sits on the answer. Despite this, she never hesitates to help or answer a question if asked. Though naturally averse to combat, she's highly trained in wielding steel and spell against the forces of evil.</p><p>Kesi is...</p><ul><li><strong>Brilliant</strong>. She was one of her order's most respected artificers, having risen to prominence at a very young age. Her natural intelligence and problem solving allows her to overcome most obstacles easily, if given time to think.</li><li><strong>Knowledgable.</strong> As one of the foremost divine artificers in the Eyes of Aten, she is highly informed about the magical creation rituals that went into powering the Vault, the prisons, the Ushabti guardians, and the dial.</li><li><strong>Peaceful.</strong> She considers violence a crass last resort when keener minds have failed to find a bloodless solution. She will grudgingly admit that there are times violence is the only answer, such as defeating the Demon Queen, but still prefers to provide support behind the battle lines, if possible. She is happy to let the adventurers tackle danger themselves.</li><li><strong>Driven</strong>. She knows that failure is always a possibility, but she has never allowed it to stop her before. If she had, she would never have attained the station and respect she did within the Eyes of Aten. When a task is set before her, she will do all in her power to see it done, using any resources at her disposal.</li><li><strong>Pragmatic</strong>. Though she respects and reveres the traditions of her order, she recognizes when sometimes you must break from them for the sake of efficiency or effectiveness. Especially if the alternative means failure and people suffering for it.</li><li><strong>Energetic</strong>. She is still a young woman, full of energy and curiosity for the world, she does not like sitting idly by when there are things to be done. She would rather channel her abundance of youthful energy into something productive, whether that is studying or tinkering.</li></ul><h2>Background &amp; History</h2><p>Kesi was born to minor nobles serving in a royal court that openly supported and backed the Demon Queen. Her parents, however, were turncoats and secretly feeding information to the Eyes of Aten. When the war to defeat her broke out her parents were discovered and publicly executed. At the age of fourteen she arranged for her own secret transport to safety, taking the entirety of her family's secrets with her to the Eyes of Aten.</p><p>From this moment onward she was a member of the order, and strived to honor the sacrifice of her parents by helping destroy the Demon Queen. She devoted herself as a record keeper, scribe, researcher and assistant to the other ritualists.</p><p>This gave her the ability to absorb insights and knowledge from several mystical branches of the Eyes of Aten at once, allowing her to become indispensible almost immediately. Eventually she proved herself as a highly skilled spellcaster and used her clout to become a student of the order's divine artificers.</p><p>By her mid-twenties Kesi had earned her status as a venerated priestess in the order, and became one of the first to volunteer to be made a sleeper so that the order would have one of its best on-hand to stop the Demon Queen when the time came.</p><p>She is fearlessly and relentlessly dedicated to stopping the Demon Queen’s awakening, because she has seen firsthand the cruelty and horror that results from Nehebkelat's rule.</p><h2>Insights &amp; Opinions</h2><p>As the last sleeper to survive, Kesi has unique insights into the vault, the Order of Aten, the evil imprisoned in it, and the history of the order. She knows little about what transpired after being placed into a timeless slumber, however. For that, consult with @UUID[.DDJCLG51cp0qYvMb]{Biography: Imey-er-Sekhrey (Last)}.</p><p>For Gamemasters, Kesi is a potentially invaluable source of knowledge for the players and their characters. How much information Kesi volunteers is up to you, but she is the single easiest way to provide useful nudges and guidance to the players, as she is familiar with the dungeon and what is in it.</p><p>Take care not to have her lead, however. She is best used as a source of support for the party's actions.</p><h3><strong>The Vault of Aten</strong></h3><p>Kesi is familiar with all of the rooms and features of the Vault of Aten and Prison of Nehebkelat below it. She can also directly bypass any investigation areas that require ability checks or language proficiencies as she can personally decipher them for the party.</p><h3>Nehebkelat and her Rule</h3><p>Kesi is an excellent source of exposition and information about the Demon Queen, as she lived through that time period and saw firsthand the horrors of her rule and the war that brought her down. As a result she knows quite a lot more about the events than Abasi does.</p><p>Consider Kesi an opportunity to make the out of character story exposition provided in the @UUID[JournalEntry.yYTw7GSNzcKvjpPq.JournalEntryPage.sqwjl12QZhKzMq30]{Prologue} something that is shared with the characters. They have likely only heard Abasi's understanding of the situation, which he learned through old incomplete historical records.</p><p>She can also share information on the Demon Queen's abilities and tactics as discussed in @UUID[JournalEntry.vPmzQTMVZwRbbuu8.JournalEntryPage.d2QkKiFARaMN1JaJ]{2d. The Demon Queen's Arena} and the binding obelisks as detailed in @UUID[JournalEntry.vPmzQTMVZwRbbuu8.JournalEntryPage.3UYTQMRV8CopMNPE]{2e. Obelisk Mechanics}.</p><h3>The Dread Generals</h3><p>Though Kesi didn't directly fight any of the Demon Queen's generals, she does know quite a lot about them and was alive during their downfall. If asked, she can tell them about any of the tactics the generals will use, their personalities, and similar as discussed in the Sepulcher journals here:</p><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.n6Fb0D0xskxz4zR4.JournalEntryPage.MwQMOshR3SD8Mkan]{1f.

The Sepulcher of Night}</p><p>She does not know about Anubhet taking over the Ushabti guardians, however, nor does she know about the trapped hallway that Serketraj created.</p><p><strong>The Shabti Guardians</strong></p><p>Though Kesi didn't have a hand in creating the Shabti, she has studied their creation extensively, and can speak about the consecrated stone, the pure electrum wires, the celestial star sapphires in their bodies, and what the markings mean in terms of powering and containing the shabti's might. </p><p>If she's alive, she becomes the defacto commander of the Shabti in the vault, provided any of them survive. Her default stance is to keep them in reserve in case the party fails to defeat the generals themselves.</p><h3>The Champions of the Vault</h3><p>Though Kesi didn't know them well, she was around when the four champions in the vault were made permanent parts of the magic used to contain Nehebkelat and her Generals. She can provide insight into those characters. For information on them, refer the \"<strong>Who was X?</strong>\" section in each of the Sepulcher journals listed above.</p><h3>Ransacking the Vault</h3><p>Kesi plans to begin rebuilding the Eyes of Aten if she survives the events in the Vault, and she knows that if she is going to do this, she'll need all of the wealth contained in it. Despite this, she will openly state that any magical weapons or armor stored in the vault should be taken and used, and yes this even includes ransacking the Sarcophagi of fallen warriors near the vault entrance. This is especially important if she examines the party's gear and finds it lacking for the task ahead.</p>"

While relatively simple, it does rely on investigation and exploration to locate all the materials, and could be missed.</p><h2>Discovering this Quest</h2><p>When the party first meets Last he is feebly protecting the last of the sleeping priests in @UUID[JournalEntry.n6Fb0D0xskxz4zR4.JournalEntryPage.6LW1QSpBGQejAsve]{1c. Chambers of Repose}. In speaking to him it's possible to learn that he was trying to wake her with the others, but there was violence, and he had to instead focus on defending her. While he no longer remembers how to wake the sleepers, he says the dead will have the knowledge. This is a hint to search the corpses around the vault.</p><p>If a more coherent source is necessary, it's very simple to have Abasi want to search around for a way to wake the sleeper, as she surely has knowledge of the vault that will be useful. </p><h2>Acquiring the Materials</h2><p>This quest requires three items to be found before the next step can be undertaken, they are:</p><ul><li>@Compendium[dnd5e.items.eJY20LOs3pOkRDPl]{Block of Incense}</li><li>@Compendium[dnd5e.items.VmcgAIsRCyrjBguC]{Restorative Ointment}</li><li>@Compendium[dnd5e.tradegoods.eDVTXE3qv28DwvPl]{Salt}</li></ul><p>In the @UUID[JournalEntry.n6Fb0D0xskxz4zR4.JournalEntryPage.samRQxdYtO0GIJwJ]{Embalming Chamber} there are several old, battered manuals with complex instructions for all manner of rituals including putting beings to sleep, waking them, and embalming bodies so they do not rise as defilers or other forms of restless dead. This will require defeating or bypassing the mummies in the embalming chamber. The manual is old and written in an ancient form of Celestial that Last can easily understand and Abasi can read with some difficulty.</p><p>The incense can be found by investigating pots and urns around the vault. </p><p>The rare ceremonial reagents can be found in the @UUID[JournalEntry.n6Fb0D0xskxz4zR4.JournalEntryPage.6LW1QSpBGQejAsve]{Chambers of Repose}<strong> </strong>on the various shelves at the back of each room. It takes 20 minutes of work to sort through all of the materials to find what is called out as necessary in the manuals.</p><h3>Performing the Ritual</h3><p>Once the materials are available, the waking ritual requires 60 minutes and the undivided attention of the caster. Abasi can carry out the ritual by himself, and requires no outside assistance. If a player character would like to undertake the ritual, they will need to be proficient in &amp;Reference[Arcana] and &amp;Reference[Religion], and be able to &amp;Reference[ritual]{ritually} cast spells.</p><p>We recommend having Abasi insist that he handle it, in case anything goes wrong, or the magic draws unwanted attention. Which funnily enough is exactly what happens once the ritual gets underway!</p><h2>Encounter: Ghostly Interference</h2><p>Twenty minutes after the ritual begins wraiths and specters begin to creep into the chamber, their attention drawn by the magic taking place. They will attempt to disrupt Abasi by attacking him. Once a wave is defeated another will not arrive until another 20 minutes of ritual time has passed.</p><p>Each wave consists of <strong>4 @UUID[Actor.9PhjNp5QfjC8wcjs]{Specters}</strong> and <strong>1 @UUID[Actor.UlMpC25T09egaqzU]{Wraith}</strong>. These shadowy figures bear a striking resemblance to the slain priests in the chambers of repose. Dark energies from the generals have caused their spirits to linger, unable to find the way to the afterlife and now they are drawn to the magic ritual, and begin to lash out at any living creatures around it.</p><p>The waves are intended to be easy encounters for a party of about 5 adventurers. For smaller parties remove one of the specters, and for larger parties (or if the waves don’t prove a challenge) add one extra specter and wraith.</p><h3>Defeating the Shades</h3><p>Once all the waves of restless dead are defeated Abasi completes the ritual and the sleeper awakens! She is initially confused and alarmed at the sight of strangers in the tomb, but recognizes the symbols on Abasi as part of the Eyes of Aten. She quickly realizes that something terrible has happened, and correctly assumes that the generals have broken free of their prisons.</p><div class=\"explainer macro\"><img src=\"icons/magic/time/hourglass-tilted-gray.webp\" /><div class=\"text\"><p><strong>Active Effect: Sleeping Stasis</strong></p><p>The Last Sleeper actor has an active effect that represents her timeless sleep.

It is possible to speak to her via Celestial or Draconic though the dialects are so old that it is stilted and broken at best. If it appears that no one in the party can easily communicate with her she will instead collect a few items from the dead, some reagents from the shelves and craft a small amulet that allows her to understand and speak common with the party.</p><p>If asked how she did this she states that she is one of the order's finest artificers.</p><p>For more on this thousand year old priestess, please refer to @UUID[.0JUK8U1RlyfmxVur]{Biography: Kesi the Divine Artificer}.</p>"

At the end of this ritual glowing echoes of the champions appear, and grant their boons to any creature that touches the pillar. Once complete all of the adventurers and their allies gain a +2 bonus to an ability score of their choice. This bonus is temporary, and lasts as soon as a character leaves the Vault of Aten.</p><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>Ritual Description</h5><p>At each Sarcohagus an offering of ancient incense burns, filling the sepulcher with a sweet haze of smoke which lingers around the stone sarcophagus of the hero held within. Kesi kneels beside it, as Imey-er-Sekhrey stands at the head of the tomb, still as a statue. The ancient priestess begins chanting the names and deeds of the hero within the tomb. You watch as with each pass through a champion's chant their sarcophagus begins to resonate with power and emite a strong hum.</p><p>At the height of the drone the sarcophagi each seem ready to vibrate themselves apart, and each word spoken by Kesi resonated through the ancient stone of the vault as a whole, vibrating underfoot and reverberating in the chest. Imey-er-Sekhrey lays a stony hand on the forehead of the champion carved into the tomb's cover. With that touch the sarcophagus goes still and quiet, as the ushabti's magical runes and symbols on his body blaze with a new, powerful light.</p><p>Together Kesi and the Ushabti Captain returns to the central pillar, laying hands on the capstone and speaking in unison: \"Champions of Aten, we ask that you bless us with your strengths, so that we may do what is necessary.\" The light in the Ushabti's body fades by a measure, and pictrographs etched into the pillar stone flash with new light.</p><p>For two hours this ritual is repeated at each sarcophagus until all four heroes have had a small measure of their energy moved to the Dial's central obelisk. When finally it is done the vault goes quiet, and Kesi calls for the adventurers to gather. At the Dial of Aten they are guided to touch the pillar as Kesi does, which causes a great power to rush through the body, making it stronger.</p></div>"

              "text": "<p>Over a thousand years ago the Demon Queen, Nehebkelat, and her four dread generals ruled an empire that spanned a continent. Her tyranny was opposed by an ancient and noble order, the Eyes of Aten, who after a century of terrible conflict defeated the dread generals and cast down the Demon Queen, imprisoning her for a thousand years. Those thousand years have now passed and the ancient order of protectors who imprisoned the Demon Queen has been lost to time.</p><p>In <em>The Demon Queen Awakens</em>, the player characters represent the only heroes willing to assist the last surviving member of the Eyes of Aten - charged with the sacred duty of preventing Nehebkelat from escaping her prison. Upon entering the Vault of Aten, the heroes will realize this is no easy task. Dark forces have awoken to ensure that Nehebkelat will rise again and subjugate the continent beneath her abyssal rule.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>The players and their characters will need to defeat four dread generals, unlock the Demon Queens arena, and defeat her before she has the chance to fully escape. There are also several side-quests which take place in the Vault of Aten, providing the party with opportunities to make powerful allies and gain advantage for the final confrontation, if they can work quickly enough to secure them.</p><p>The adventure has three core pillars:</p><ol><li><strong>Boss Combat:</strong> The core pillar of this adventure involves defeating four powerful bosses, opening the way for a final boss encounter. These encounters are designed to be difficult, and tackled in whatever order the players choose. In addition to this there are several side quests and random encounters available which involve additional combat.</li><li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> In addition to deadly adversaries in combat, this adventure challenges players to manage their resources well. The heroes have only 24 hours to open the path to the Demon Queen and defeat her, a limitation which allows for only a single long rest. The party lacks the ability to restock or resupply beyond what they bring with them. While the Vault of Aten has resources to scavenge, they are limited.</li><li><strong>Light Exploration:</strong>The main map where the bulk of the adventure takes place is a large vault full of ancient history, sarcophagi, rooms of treasure, and other valuable resources. Players will need to interact with the environment to succeed, and the side quests all require some amount of investigation or exploration outside of the main boss battle arenas.</li></ol><h2>Difficulty</h2><p>This adventure is designed for a party of four to six 9th level adventurers, and can take anywhere from 2 to 5 sessions to complete. Encounters with bosses are meant to be deadly, while all other side encounters are designed to be easy or medium in difficulty, mostly meant to drain resources and consume the limited time the party has.</p><p>Tackling this adventure with characters under 9th level may find that these challenges are too difficult to overcome, and may find only defeat, while tackling this adventure with characters beyond 11th level may not find themselves significantly challenged.</p><h2>Scenes</h2><p>This adventure has four scenes, two of them are used as backdrops for narrative play, and two of them are full-featured dungeons with walls, lights, macros, monsters, and sounds. The scenes provided are:</p><ul><li><p>@Scene[5dbhXcJcNPEfS5yf]{The Demon Queen Awakens}<br />This is the title scene that the adventure begins on. It is used for the majority of the prologue in Chapter 2.</p></li><li><p>@Scene[sGf9LUF7niN9qdFj]{The Valley of Stone}<br />This scene shows the entrance to the Vault of Aten. This scene is used for the ending of Chapter 2 and beginning of Chapter 3 before players enter the dungeon proper. This scene could also be used for the epilogue of the story handled in Chapter 5.</p></li><li><p>@Scene[FHEOrs4QELs6a1Y0]{The Vault of Aten}<br />This scene is used for the entirety of Chapter 3 and is the main dungeon of the adventure.

              "text": "<p>The Demon Queen Awakens is designed to be run with the basic rules as provided by the 5e SRD, but provides a few wrinkles to the formula which are detailed below. We’ve included some notes and suggestions along the way where you can tweak the difficulty of the adventure to suit the challenge you and your players want.</p><h2>The Dial of Aten</h2><p>This adventure introduces a new mechanic in the form of a 24-hour countdown to the escape of the adventure's main villain. Players will need to work through the Vault of Aten, acquire the four scepters, unlock the prison and defeat the Demon Queen before this time runs out.</p><p>For every 20 minutes that pass in the vault the beam of light on the Dial of Aten shifts, moving around the room. </p><p>When Abasi first brings the party into the Vault it is the dawn of the last day, and the dial begins at the leftmost icon (the rising sun). As the adventure progresses this beam marches clockwise to day, dusk, and eventually night. Once the magical dial completes a full revolution time is up, and the seal will break, allowing the Demon Queen to escape.</p><p>Hopefully the heroes are faster than that, however!</p><div class=\"explainer macro\"><img src=\"icons/magic/time/hourglass-tilted-glowing-gold.webp\" /><div class=\"text\"><p>The <strong>Advance Time (20 Minutes)</strong> macro moves the light of the Dial of Aten clockwise 5 degrees, signifying 20 minutes passing. This script is designed to also advance the game time when used, so i<span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary)\">f you are using timekeeping modules this will update them automatically. @UUID[Macro.Z3WOb4UeFmk9qOPW]{Advance Sundial of Aten (20 Minutes)}</span></p></div></div><h2>Tracking Time</h2><p>The clock starts ticking the moment the new day begins, and from that point on the party has a full 24 hours, no more, no less. Tracking this time can be done in a number of ways:</p><ol><li><strong>Track real time to the dial.</strong> Every 20 minutes the dial should advance, meaning that the players have a real-world 24 hours to beat the adventure. Depending on how many sessions you have available, this is generally going to be the simplest method. Be sure to adjust the clock for any short or long rests the party takes, or sidequest related tasks that consume time.</li><li><strong>Track each real world hour to a 20 minute block on the dial.</strong> This allows for a slower pace and a much more generous amount of time to explore the vault, complete quests, and work toward confronting the final boss. You should still account for resting time and other actions, but otherwise this makes the time limit a minor concern at best.</li><li><strong>Make the dial shift as dramatically appropriate. </strong>To make the adventure more tense or difficult, you can start the dial with less time, or say that time seems to flow differently in the vault, causing the dial’s ray of light to advance more often than normal. This can allow you to apply more pressure to the party, but may prevent them from exploring the entirety of the vault’s story and quests.</li></ol><h2>Long Rest Limits</h2><p>Per the basic rules, characters can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period. This limits the party to only a single rest, which they must take before their time runs out on the Dial of Aten. If you would like to make the adventure slightly easier, you can remove this limitation, allowing the party to take multiple long rests during their time in the vault, though this still consumes 8 hours of their very limited time.</p><h2>Resource Management</h2><p>The Demon Queen Awakens is intentionally designed and balanced toward being a very difficult adventure where victory will be hard won. As a result, the 24 hour limit and the inability to leave the Vault once inside means that players will need to be ready for anything, and make best use of their resources once inside.</p><p>Players should make sure to acquire anything their characters might need before entering the location. To their advantage, there are several relatively safe locations in the vault that an overburdened party can stash items for later if they need, so arriving over-prepared might be a boon.</p><p>Recommended items that could be useful are healing kits, potions, and scrolls, as consumable items could prove especially important when time is at a premium and resupply is impossible.</p><h2>Useful Skills</h2><p>The following skills will prove especially useful to the party when exploring the Vault of Aten's many chambers.</p><ul><li><strong>Arcana </strong>is vital for understanding some of the magical concepts at play, and will lend greater insight into mystical forces being used to hold the Demon Queen and her minions in place. It will also make pursuing certain sidequests slightly easier.</li><li><strong>History </strong>is useful for connecting the ancient history of the Vault of Aten to more contemporary historical records, and will allow characters to reveal more of the world lore of this place. Though not vital to any sidequests, it is broadly useful for exposition.</li><li><strong>Investigation </strong>is good for spotting small details and patterns in some of the investigation points. Though not vital to success, this skill and provide insight that may help direct additional investigation efforts.</li><li><strong>Religion </strong>is vital for deciphering the ancient mystical and spiritual trappings found in the Vault of Aten, as well as understanding the lore, history, and people of the Eyes of Aten. It will also make pursuing certain sidequests slightly easier.</li></ul><h2>Ancient Languages</h2><p>Much of this adventure takes place in a thousand-year-old vault which has been forgotten by the mortal world and left behind. The languages found within its halls are a mixture of inscrutable dialects and unchanging root languages.</p><p>Most of the common 5e languages prove useless once within the vault. However, there are a handful of exotic language remain legible despite the passage of time thanks to their age:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Primordial </strong>came from the ancient primordial titans before recorded time. As the inherent language of elementals it never strays too far from its roots, allowing it and its dialects of Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran remain largely readable despite the age.<br /></p><ul><li><strong>Abyssal </strong>is a warped variant of Primordial and <strong>Giant </strong>has its root language in Primordial, making it possible to parse some of the most basic and common concepts in passages with a little effort. Abyssal is a common language between the Demon Queen and her servants.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Celestial</strong> was handed down from the heavens and as such is largely unchanged within the past thousand years. Celestial is the common script used by the Eyes of Aten for much of its magical and religious record keeping.</li><li><strong>Draconic </strong>is the language of dragons and became the chief language of arcane design. Having existed for longer than the Vault of Aten, it to remains very legible despite the passage of time. Draconic is the common script used by the Eyes of Aten for magical record keeping and ritual design.</li></ul><p>The above languages are generally intelligible when inscriptions are discovered, though doing so requires taking the time to puzzle through unfamiliar symbols or archaic usage of terms. This ensures that characters can absorb information despite the age of the vault.</p>"

Almost every cot bears the desiccated corpse of an unidentifiable humanoid.</p><p>The far wall is lined with more urns and jars similar to those found at the entrance, their faded labels bearing archaic script identifying the contents. It is likely they were meant to be used in magical rituals or alchemical endeavors.</p></div><div class=\"exam-text\"><h5>Examining the Dead</h5><p>The bodies of the dead are all dressed similarly, wearing blood stained clothing of styles only seen in historical texts. Some of the slain wear rusted and worthless armor, others do not, and though there are sheaths, there are no weapons present.  Each figure looks to have been bludgeoned to death or hacked at with swords in their sleep. The wounds and position of the bodies indicate they were not awake when this happened, and offered no defense.</p><hr /><h5><strong>Speaking with the Dead</strong></h5><p>Should an enterprising character choose to speak with the dead through magical means, the priests know the following things:</p><ul><li>The priests volunteered to be placed into an endless slumber until they were needed. This slumber was induced with a mixture of powerful alchemical, magical, and divine methods which can be undone through magic ritual.</li><li>The ushabti guardians would look after them, keeping them and the vault safe while they slept, and know how to wake them when it was time for them to bind Nehebkelat again.</li><li>Nehebkelat is held under the Vault, beyond the fountains of restoration. They must use the power of the obelisks, for they are all that holds her in place.</li><li>The Dread Generals cannot move beyond the Dial of Aten until the last ray of light has passed through it.</li></ul><hr /><h5>Searching the Rooms</h5><p>Chests and footlockers laying about the room are filled with spare clothing, rotted armor, old rusted weapons, magical implements, and the like. A character lacking basic equipment can probably scrounge up something to get by in here, but there is little of actual value.</p><p>Searching in-depth can yield any of the following bits of information:</p><ul><li><p><strong>[[/skill investigation 18]] </strong>One chest holds loose papers containing faded diagrams. Upon closer inspection they appear to be architectural drawings of the Vault. By the look of them this vault used to be meant for housing treasure and relics but was converted into a prison. It appears that several smaller sub-vaults were converted into much larger rooms. Sadly the drawings are faded and smudged, making it impossible to tell what the final changes were.</p><ul><li><strong>[[/skill arcana 20]] or [[/skill religion 20]] </strong>Though much of them have been ruined by the ravages of time, a few diagrams of the vault post-modification did survive, and indicate a fountain room on a lower level. Holy and arcane symbols present on the drawing are indicative that it is used for rejuvenation or healing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>[[/skill arcana 18]]</strong> There are several scroll cases filled with arcane diagrams which appear to be gibberish at first, until laid out and examined as a whole. The scrawled notes appear to be prelimary magical notations on turning an entire room into a magical focus which draws energy from a living source and directs it elsewhere. Necromancy and Transmutation factor heavily into it, but the notes are incomplete thanks to several scrolls having rotted away inside the case.</li><li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><p><strong>[[/skill perception 18]]</strong> Several old, sealed potions rest in a crate near one of the beds.

His eyes glimmer faintly with light and he hefts a battered weapon with his one working arm. Arrayed around this construct are the remnants of several other stone men not unlike him, though he appears more elaborate than those scattered on the floor.</p><p>In a strained voice, the guardian declares: “You will not have this one. I am the Last, and you must go through me.” </p><p>Behind the Last, laid atop a single untouched cot, is a sleeping figure clad in robes and armor like the rest. Unlike the others her equipment has not fallen into decay and rust with the passage of time. She appears to be bald woman in her early twenties, uninjured and seemingly asleep.</p></div><p>If any attempt to approach the sleeping figure before getting the stone guardian to stand down, he will fight them to the best of his ability. @UUID[Actor.Q0p3eb2id8BOVXxp]{Last} can be calmed with a persuasion check to convince him that the party does not serve the Demon Queen, or Abasi can display his holy symbol, which immediately accomplishes the same goal.</p><p>If Last has been calmed down, characters can examine the last sleeper.

What he does know is limited:</p><ul><li>He is “The Last,” and he cannot provide more information or context than that. If pressed for more, he thinks hard and says \"I was the first. I am the Last.\" and does not remember anything else.</li><li>He has protected “the sleeper” who is still laying on the slab behind him. He defended her against attackers that he cannot remember. However in the chamber with him are the remains of several destroyed ushabti, leading one to believe he fought against his own kind after they turned on him. If asked if these were his foes, he admits possibly, but he doesn’t remember clearly.</li><li>He is damaged, and cannot move, which is troubling to him. At best he can turn his head and raise one arm which is holding a quarterstaff that he can't let go of.</li><li>He knows that the last sleeper may provide hope, if she can be woken up. If asked where to find the knowledge he says that he knows that he knew how to wake her, but has forgotten. His best advice is to seek out the dead, as they will have knowledge he does not.</li></ul><hr /><h5>Examining the Sleeper</h5><p>The sleeping priestess appears to be at rest, with no visible signs of injury. Closer inspection may yield more insight, however!</p><ul><li><strong>[[/skill arcana 20]]</strong> You find several places where paint or dye was applied to the sleeping woman's armor and skin. Though faded, they are clearly ancient draconic symbols commonly used in magic. Based on the limited information to work with you'd suspect some blending of necromancy and transmutation to place the woman's soul and body into a timeless state.</li><li><strong>[[/skill religion 16]]</strong> The sleeping woman wears an almost unreasonable number of charms and symbols belonging to gods and deities of antiquity. Though some of the symbols haven't changed for centuries, there are many obscure or variant symbols worn on bracelets or hung around her neck. Most of them are benevolent or at least neutral in nature.</li><li><strong>[[/skill medicine 15]]</strong> You find that the woman is utterly uninjured and in good health, albeit without any pulse or breathing. She feels warm to the touch, if slightly cool. If left like this she might live for a week or so, not a thousand years, so magic is clearly at play.</li><li><strong>Casting @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{Detect Magic}:</strong> You recognize a powerful magical effect on the woman which is a strange blending of necromancy and transmutation. Without knowing more about the magic there's no way to truly tell what is at play.</li><li><strong>Casting @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</strong>: The spell affecting the woman is functionally a 10th Level spell, requiring a DC 20 spellcasting ability check to overcome.

He is violent and unhinged, caring only for his next battle or meal. During the empire of blood's height he commanded an army of elementals and their ilk, protecting the Queen's rivers, ports, and ships while raiding those of her enemies.</p></section><h3>Ansubek’s Tactics</h3><p>Ansubek revels in combat, slaughter, and violence. He wants nothing more than to engage in battle and then eat the losers. When beginning combat he will focus on whoever appears to be the biggest and toughest combatant in the arriving party. If this initial decision appears wrong, and someone else starts dealing large amounts of damage, he will reprioritize to the new, most \"worthy\" opponent. A clever and well coordinated party can use this tendency against him to manage his aggression and who he targets.</p><p>Ansubek is unbelievably strong, and relies on his multi-attack to get the bulk of his work done. He can use his hide bonus action and legendary movement to set up his attacks and give himself some space to reassess the battlefield, but his cunning is limited and he prefers direct action as often as possible. If a creature is proving troublesome or elusive for him, he can use his bite to hold them in place and death roll to rip them apart.</p><p>Ansubek should...</p><ul><li>Use his multi-attack to rip apart enemies that decide to square up against him in melee.

Anubhet's first act was to stomp the life from its creator, killing him instantly, much to Nehebkelat's amusement. From that point forward it served as her most loyal of generals, subjugating constructs across the lands, twisting their magic to serve the Demon Queen instead of their creators.</p></section><h3>Anubhet's Sword and Shield</h3><p>Though they appear to be seprate items, these massive stone items are actually part of the malevolent construct's form and are considered part of it.

This society of murderers made a great name and fortune for themselves as ruthless assassins, and she was the greatest among them. Yet for all her power and skill, the limits of her mortal body weighed heavily upon her. As she aged, muscles would weaken, strength would dissolve, and before long her body would fail her.</p><p>Serketraj sought out a means by which to transcend that mortality; she sought to make a deal with Nehebkelat. In return for the service of her cult of assassins the Demon Queen granted her wish and Serketraj ascended to her new form, becoming an immortal being of shadow and poison.</p></section><h3>Serketraj's Tactics</h3><p>@UUID[Actor.AiImuhfg9DPr5e6Q]{Serketraj} is an exceptionally tricky and deceptive being who has steeped herself in secrets and lies for centuries. When engaged in combat her first objective is to create disarray in her attackers. Her tactics involve creating darkness, separating her foes, constantly relocating, and selectively targeting enemies that are responsible for maintaining cohesion of the party. This often leads her to target casters, healers, and leaders as soon as they make their presence known. Otherwise she targets whoever appears the most isolated and vulnerable, preferring to pick her foes apart one-on-one.</p><p><strong>Serketraj should...</strong></p><ul><li>Use her pincer attack in conjunction with Veil of Darkness, Shadow Slip, and Movement to grapple and relocate with enemies, pulling them away from their allies.</li><li>Take advantage of Creeping Darkness to keep enemies at bat while dealing with a single target.</li><li>Utilize Body of Shadow to avoid damaging attacks and spells, steal away grappled foes, or escape from dangerous enemies.</li></ul><p><strong>Serketraj's Darkness</strong>: We have included a 20ft radius light in the Sepulcher of Night which can be moved into place and activated to represent Serketraj's field of darkness.

I know this vault is filled with treasures. If you release me I'll grant you an army of minions to deliver it to whatever pitiful hovels you call home. Think of it: you could live as royalty, and if you wished to serve me... well, even greater power, riches, and influence could be yours. Perhaps even immortality!\"</p><p>Of course, Abasi refuses to accept this path  and begins heading for the binding pillars to reassert the magic holding the Demon Queen in place. If Kesi, Uraeus or Last are present they also will outright refuse to serve the Demon Queen, opting to fulfill their divine duty!</p></div><p><strong>Note</strong>: This combat relies on @UUID[.3UYTQMRV8CopMNPE]{2e. Obelisk Mechanics} as the party's means of defeating Nehebkelat. Attempting to defeat her by simply reducing her hit points to 0 will not be as successful as expected. See <strong>Defeating the Demon Queen</strong> below for details.</p><h3><strong>Nehebkelat's Tactics</strong></h3><p>Nehebkelat is a merciless combatant who relishes combat as a chance to demonstrate her physical superiority over others. She will target anyone who directly engages her in melee combat, calls her out, or issues challenges. If and when they fall, she simply moves on to the next foe. If an enemy proves especially dangerous, she will change focus to neutralize them to the best of her ability.</p><div class=\"explainer macro\"><img src=\"icons/skills/targeting/crosshair-triple-strike-orange.webp\" /><div class=\"text\"><p><strong>Anchor Beams.</strong></p><p>This macro should be used when Nehebkelat finishes moving in the arena, or is pulled back to the arena center. It automatically refocuses the beams of light on her token. @UUID[Macro.W0RT57M84QGq2Lr3]{Anchor Nehebkelat Beams}</p></div></div><h3><strong>Combat Barks</strong></h3><p>The Demon Queen begins her battle confident, knowing that she has moved her pieces on the board carefully and is on the verge of escape. Any setbacks suffered at the hands of the party are minor, or at least not worth acknowledging. However, as the fight goes on and she gets closer to being rebound she will become more volatile and incensed at the mortals threatening her escape.</p><ul><li>\"I see my generals have failed in destroying all of the Eyes of Aten. No matter, the time of ascension is at hand and your order is too late to stop it. It has already begun.\"</li><li>\"Consider that we do not have to be enemies. You have bested my generals and proven your worthiness, take their places beside me and we can accomplish incredible things.\"</li><li>\"I have had one thousand years to plan your undoing, you will burn like locusts before my flames!\"</li><li>\"Your brotherhood and their army of hired 'heroes' were barely enough the first time! An old man and a gaggle of hapless adventurers will not be enough now!\"</li><li>\"I will not spend another thousand years in this hole! You will not succeed!\"</li><li>\"Stop! I will give you riches, power, kingdoms! Anything you desire in the lands are yours if you stand by me as my new generals!\"</li><li>\"Fools! You may have stopped me, but I am eternal! In a thousand years you will not even be memories, and the seals will once again weaken!\"</li></ul><h2>Defeating the Demon Queen</h2><p>Though difficult, it's not impossible to reduce the Demon Queen to 0 hit points. If this occurs she will be &amp;Reference[incapacitated] for 1 minute (10 rounds), but cannot be permanently killed. Any attempts to decapitate, maim, disintegrate, banish, petrify, or entomb her automatically fail as such mortal wounds magically heal almost instantly.</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\">After a minute passes she will rise again with half of her maximum hit points and begin attempting to free herself again. If she is observed during this time it's clear that her wounds are rapidly closing as some magical force repairs her body. As the minute runs out she will begin to twitch and move indicating she's about to reawaken.</p><p>If the players manage to fully shackle her while she's incapacitated, the timer is extended by 2 additional rounds, giving them a little more time to get in place and finally lock her down for another thousand years.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>For mechanics on shackling the Demon Queen before or after incapacitating her see:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[.3UYTQMRV8CopMNPE]{2e.

Abasi would relate this history to the players in full, or paraphrase an abbreviated version as follows:</p><div class=\"box-text\"><h2>An Empire of Blood</h2><p>Over a thousand years ago the Demon Queen Nehebkelat ruled an empire that spanned a continent and subjugated nations. At her side were her four dreadful generals, each of whom led her vast armies of corrupted mortals marching toward their bloody cause of domination.</p><p><span style=\"color:#191813\">For centuries the Demon Queen ruled unopposed. She was cruel, depraved, and brought nothing but devastation to the lands she claimed. The people within her borders knew only suffering, except those who served her and were rewarded. None dared to oppose the immortal tyrant openly, none except for my order. We are ... or rather were ... </span><em><span style=\"color:#191813\">The Eyes of Aten</span></em><span style=\"color:#191813\">, a secret society that dedicated to combating the Demon Queen herself.</span></p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h2>The Fall of Nehebkelat</h2><p>The Eyes of Aten rallied the land's mightiest warriors to cast down the great generals, and break their armies. It took them a century of battle and stained the lands red in the process, but the order's greatest magi and sages were able to defeat the Demon Queen.</p><p>This victory was not all it appeared though, for while Nehebkelat was defeated, she was not destroyed. The Demon Queen was an immortal being with abyssal magic that defied all others. My predecessors knew that there could be no total victory, not against an evil so terrible.</p><p>Desperate for a solution that would return the lands to control of the mortals and break the empire of blood's stranglehold, they imprisoned Nehebkelat and her generals using powerful magic, and shackled them deep within a sacred vault built in an uncharted desert.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h2>The Last of the Order</h2><p>Unfortunately, this act cost my order much, and the Eyes of Aten were never able to fully rebuild after sealing the Demon Queen away; the toll had been too great. Our greatest heroes and leaders were integral to making the magic work, and were sealed away with her. Without the powerful leadership that had directed them, our ranks have been in freefall ever since.</p><p>Though it well before my time, historical records in our archives show how the order became fractured, and scattered across the lands, a dim shadow of its former greatness. By the time I and my peers inherited it our predecessors had forgotten much of our history, misplaced or squandered all of our resources, and lost all of the fame and support they once had. We had become a relic of a time that society had forgotten, and many of my peers could not muster the courage to carry on, and simply left the order.</p><p>Those of us that remained carried on as best we could, knowing that very soon the old magic holding Nehebkelat at bay would fail, and someone would need to renew it.</p></div><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>If the heroes agree to assist despite the danger proceed to</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[.Pi5TxSSzLvFxPwS8]{Gold and Heroism}</p>"

A successful [[/skill insight 10]]<strong> </strong>check reveals that he is utterly serious, absolutely believes what he's saying, and is not deceiving the party. As far as he's concerned, there's a very real threat to the world out there, and he plans to stop it.</p><h2>What Abasi Offers</h2><p>Abasi promises eight thousand gold per-person if successful in rebinding the Demon Queen, provided that they (and Abasi) survive. This is enough to live comfortably for a good portion of one’s life without ever having to work a day of it. </p><p>Abasi also offers to pay for all of the expedition costs (food, animals, tents, lodging, etc). The mission in this case involves traveling to the Vault of Aten in the desert, entering it, and defeating the Demon Queen within.</p><div class=\"exam-text\"><h5>Questions and Answers</h5><p>If characters ask for more information, these are the major points of knowledge the old warrior priest has:</p><ul><li><strong>How long have they got left?</strong> In truth, not very long. A month or more at most. He has been careful to give them as much spare time as possible for the journey, and is optimistic they will arrive with days to spare. However, if the journey is treacherous or they get waylaid, they might arrive too late or with no time to spare.</li><li><strong>If the Demon Queen's Immortal, can she be killed?</strong> Abasi knows that defeating her is impossible, but they used something called \"The Dial of Aten\" to lock her away for a thousand years, and he suspects that they can use it to renew or extend her imprisonment.</li><li><strong>What if you're wrong about all this?</strong> He recognizes that he could be wrong. He’s working from badly-damaged documents that are almost a thousand years old. However, if he is wrong, they will travel out into the deserts, find nothing, travel back, and make the same amount of gold regardless.</li><li><strong>Where is this Vault located?</strong> The vault is in a valley on the far edges of most modern maps, in a stretch of hostile sand where a nation once stood but was swallowed by the deserts after it collapsed. He knows the route, though he expects most of the landmarks in his notes will have been long buried. So the journey may take longer than expected.</li><li><strong>How will they get into the Vault?</strong> He has a gem of light which records claim is the key to entering into the vault. The gem is paired with some other specific holy invocations which will unlock the magical doors. Getting in will not be an issue.</li><li><strong>What defenses does the Vault have?</strong> Honestly, he has no idea. There might be magical constructs, or traps, or monsters that have made the vault home. They should be ready for anything, since there's no way to know what awaits them.</li><li><strong>Where are the rest of his order?</strong> Sadly, he is the last of the Eyes of Aten. There were more, once, but in the last few years many of them have turned up dead, disappeared, or abandoned the order. It's been over a year since he had contact with any of his allies.</li></ul></div><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>If the adventurers agree to the mission, proceed to</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[.TXoWtve0voBRXuK9]{Journey to the Vault}</p>"

Nestled in the heart of it is a great stone obelisk casting a long, ominous shadow in the late hours of the day.</p><p>During travel to this point Abasi spoke of the Vault’s known history, or at least what little he knew of it. He claimed that when it was first built the vault was covered in white marble and its obelisk was capped with the purest gold, all of which gleamed in the sun.</p><p>As you gaze upon it now you see only bare stone scarred by centuries of abuse from wind and sand. It is impossible to know whether the tomb was robbed of its splendor by mortal hands or the work of the elements. Regardless, looking upon it gives you a certain feeling of dread. If the vault is real, then perhaps the evil within it is as well.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h2>The Last Night</h2><p>With only a few hours light left, you camp in the shadow of the monolith and prepare for the next day. Abasi explains that the tomb can only be opened at the day’s first light, with the gem, and the right command words. Therefore they will need to camp. By his reckoning they have all cut it about as close as possible, and have perhaps a few days before the magic breaks and the Demon Queen is free.</p><p>The evening chill sets in shortly after sundown, and all through the evening nerves prey on the campers. Shifting dunes and deep shadows cast by rocky outcrops create many false alarms in the night, and rest is disturbed and fleeting at best.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h2>The Last Dawn</h2><p>The night passes without issue, despite any nerves and paranoia present among the party. The hard sand makes for a terrible bed, camping gear or no, in the early morning hours before the sun chases away the evening chill Abasi quietly wakes each member of the expedition. </p><p>“Wake friends, we’ve little time before dawn, and there is much to do.” He says to one after the next until all the camp is roused and in preparation.</p><p>Before striking camp you are afforded an hour or two to eat and prepare for the events to come.  For his part, Abasi prays to the Sun for guidance and protection. Watching the aging holy warrior, one might believe he is utterly unfazed by the cold pre-dawn hours, and the weight of what is coming. </p></div><h2>Final Preparations</h2><p>Give the players a chance to square away their inventories, and make any last preparations before entering the Vault of Aten. This is the point of no return, once inside the vault they will not be able to leave until the adventure comes to an end. It might be worthwhile telling the players this, even if their characters might not realize it (yet).</p><p>A potential moment of roleplaying to capitalize upon here is to ask each player how their character is feeling in this moment. Are they anxious, excited, do they remain skeptical that there is anything in the tomb? Perhaps they would like to make a [[/skill insight 15]] check on Abasi to see how he is coping (A result of 15 or higher reveals he is anxious, but focused).</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Continue onto Chapter 1: The Vault of Aten.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[n6Fb0D0xskxz4zR4]{1a.
