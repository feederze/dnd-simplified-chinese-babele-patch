When transformed it takes on the traits of the new form (finesse, two-handed, heavy, etc), but does not gain the benefit of increased damage for the versatile trait.

              "text": "<div class=\"box-text\"><h2>West Chamber: Dead Priests</h2><p>The western door opens to a long, broad chamber that is dimly lit and lined with cots of simple construction with little care given to the comfort of whoever uses them. Almost every cot bears the desiccated corpse of an unidentifiable humanoid.</p><p>The far wall is lined with more urns and jars similar to those found at the entrance, their faded labels bearing archaic script identifying the contents. It is likely they were meant to be used in magical rituals or alchemical endeavors.</p></div><div class=\"exam-text\"><h5>Examining the Dead</h5><p>The bodies of the dead are all dressed similarly, wearing blood stained clothing of styles only seen in historical texts. Some of the slain wear rusted and worthless armor, others do not, and though there are sheaths, there are no weapons present.  Each figure looks to have been bludgeoned to death or hacked at with swords in their sleep. The wounds and position of the bodies indicate they were not awake when this happened, and offered no defense.</p><hr /><h5><strong>Speaking with the Dead</strong></h5><p>Should an enterprising character choose to speak with the dead through magical means, the priests know the following things:</p><ul><li>The priests volunteered to be placed into an endless slumber until they were needed. This slumber was induced with a mixture of powerful alchemical, magical, and divine methods which can be undone through magic ritual.</li><li>The ushabti guardians would look after them, keeping them and the vault safe while they slept, and know how to wake them when it was time for them to bind Nehebkelat again.</li><li>Nehebkelat is held under the Vault, beyond the fountains of restoration. They must use the power of the obelisks, for they are all that holds her in place.</li><li>The Dread Generals cannot move beyond the Dial of Aten until the last ray of light has passed through it.</li></ul><hr /><h5>Searching the Rooms</h5><p>Chests and footlockers laying about the room are filled with spare clothing, rotted armor, old rusted weapons, magical implements, and the like. A character lacking basic equipment can probably scrounge up something to get by in here, but there is little of actual value.</p><p>Searching in-depth can yield any of the following bits of information:</p><ul><li><p><strong>[[/skill investigation 18]] </strong>One chest holds loose papers containing faded diagrams. Upon closer inspection they appear to be architectural drawings of the Vault. By the look of them this vault used to be meant for housing treasure and relics but was converted into a prison. It appears that several smaller sub-vaults were converted into much larger rooms. Sadly the drawings are faded and smudged, making it impossible to tell what the final changes were.</p><ul><li><strong>[[/skill arcana 20]] or [[/skill religion 20]] </strong>Though much of them have been ruined by the ravages of time, a few diagrams of the vault post-modification did survive, and indicate a fountain room on a lower level. Holy and arcane symbols present on the drawing are indicative that it is used for rejuvenation or healing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>[[/skill arcana 18]]</strong> There are several scroll cases filled with arcane diagrams which appear to be gibberish at first, until laid out and examined as a whole. The scrawled notes appear to be prelimary magical notations on turning an entire room into a magical focus which draws energy from a living source and directs it elsewhere. Necromancy and Transmutation factor heavily into it, but the notes are incomplete thanks to several scrolls having rotted away inside the case.</li><li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><p><strong>[[/skill perception 18]]</strong> Several old, sealed potions rest in a crate near one of the beds.

His eyes glimmer faintly with light and he hefts a battered weapon with his one working arm. Arrayed around this construct are the remnants of several other stone men not unlike him, though he appears more elaborate than those scattered on the floor.</p><p>In a strained voice, the guardian declares: “You will not have this one. I am the Last, and you must go through me.” </p><p>Behind the Last, laid atop a single untouched cot, is a sleeping figure clad in robes and armor like the rest. Unlike the others her equipment has not fallen into decay and rust with the passage of time. She appears to be bald woman in her early twenties, uninjured and seemingly asleep.</p></div><p>If any attempt to approach the sleeping figure before getting the stone guardian to stand down, he will fight them to the best of his ability. @UUID[Actor.Q0p3eb2id8BOVXxp]{Last} can be calmed with a persuasion check to convince him that the party does not serve the Demon Queen, or Abasi can display his holy symbol, which immediately accomplishes the same goal.</p><p>If Last has been calmed down, characters can examine the last sleeper. To do so, please refer to the following journal entry: @UUID[JournalEntry.cmqoF8Cq3mEIsGPA.JournalEntryPage.hUb53NOjbZ2OILqh]{Side Quest 1: Waking the Sleeper}.</p><div class=\"exam-text\"><h5>Speaking to the Last</h5><p>Ultimately Last knows nothing of the tomb, and can do nothing but lay on the stone floor where he fell. What he does know is limited:</p><ul><li>He is “The Last,” and he cannot provide more information or context than that. If pressed for more, he thinks hard and says \"I was the first. I am the Last.\" and does not remember anything else.</li><li>He has protected “the sleeper” who is still laying on the slab behind him. He defended her against attackers that he cannot remember. However in the chamber with him are the remains of several destroyed ushabti, leading one to believe he fought against his own kind after they turned on him. If asked if these were his foes, he admits possibly, but he doesn’t remember clearly.</li><li>He is damaged, and cannot move, which is troubling to him. At best he can turn his head and raise one arm which is holding a quarterstaff that he can't let go of.</li><li>He knows that the last sleeper may provide hope, if she can be woken up. If asked where to find the knowledge he says that he knows that he knew how to wake her, but has forgotten. His best advice is to seek out the dead, as they will have knowledge he does not.</li></ul><hr /><h5>Examining the Sleeper</h5><p>The sleeping priestess appears to be at rest, with no visible signs of injury. Closer inspection may yield more insight, however!</p><ul><li><strong>[[/skill arcana 20]]</strong> You find several places where paint or dye was applied to the sleeping woman's armor and skin. Though faded, they are clearly ancient draconic symbols commonly used in magic. Based on the limited information to work with you'd suspect some blending of necromancy and transmutation to place the woman's soul and body into a timeless state.</li><li><strong>[[/skill religion 16]]</strong> The sleeping woman wears an almost unreasonable number of charms and symbols belonging to gods and deities of antiquity. Though some of the symbols haven't changed for centuries, there are many obscure or variant symbols worn on bracelets or hung around her neck. Most of them are benevolent or at least neutral in nature.</li><li><strong>[[/skill medicine 15]]</strong> You find that the woman is utterly uninjured and in good health, albeit without any pulse or breathing. She feels warm to the touch, if slightly cool. If left like this she might live for a week or so, not a thousand years, so magic is clearly at play.</li><li><strong>Casting @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{Detect Magic}:</strong> You recognize a powerful magical effect on the woman which is a strange blending of necromancy and transmutation. Without knowing more about the magic there's no way to truly tell what is at play.</li><li><strong>Casting @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</strong>: The spell affecting the woman is functionally a 10th Level spell, requiring a DC 20 spellcasting ability check to overcome.

It is possible to sneak past the dread general, perhaps to steal things from the Sepulcher, but he has a good view of both entrances from his perch on his throne, making it a difficult proposition to begin with. The only advantage that a sneaking character has is in the form of the rushing water which masks sound quite well and imposes disadvantage on any attempts to hear things.</p><h3>Who Is Ansubek?</h3><p>Through investigation of ancient scrolls and glyphs or conversation with Kesi, the party can learn:</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-NIiyUSntwYTtv57r\"><p>Ansubek is an elemental monstrosity who escaped from the Elemental Plane of Water to the Prime Material and had been terrorizing the lands unchecked for centuries before joining the Demon Queen. He is violent and unhinged, caring only for his next battle or meal. During the empire of blood's height he commanded an army of elementals and their ilk, protecting the Queen's rivers, ports, and ships while raiding those of her enemies.</p></section><h3>Ansubek’s Tactics</h3><p>Ansubek revels in combat, slaughter, and violence. He wants nothing more than to engage in battle and then eat the losers. When beginning combat he will focus on whoever appears to be the biggest and toughest combatant in the arriving party. If this initial decision appears wrong, and someone else starts dealing large amounts of damage, he will reprioritize to the new, most \"worthy\" opponent. A clever and well coordinated party can use this tendency against him to manage his aggression and who he targets.</p><p>Ansubek is unbelievably strong, and relies on his multi-attack to get the bulk of his work done. He can use his hide bonus action and legendary movement to set up his attacks and give himself some space to reassess the battlefield, but his cunning is limited and he prefers direct action as often as possible. If a creature is proving troublesome or elusive for him, he can use his bite to hold them in place and death roll to rip them apart.</p><p>Ansubek should...</p><ul><li>Use his multi-attack to rip apart enemies that decide to square up against him in melee. While the Waters Rise is active, he can be especially brazen since most enemies can't easily retaliate or attack him.</li><li>Target vulnerable enemies with his lurking danger, pulling them into water and grappling them.</li><li>Avoid opportunity attacks and relocate through the use of his Shadow Beneath ability.</li></ul><div class=\"explainer audio\"><img src=\"icons/tools/instruments/bell-gold.webp\" /><div class=\"text\"><p><strong>Sound Effect: Ansubek Growl</strong></p><p>This sound effect is meant for when Ansubek's uses his <strong>Dreadful Vibrations</strong> legendary action, but it can be used for any general vocalizations and roaring the monstrous general might make! @UUID[Playlist.b7X2872YARmMKskF.PlaylistSound.iJa5eIBjrgzvRDap]{Ansubek Growl}</p></div></div><h3>Combat Barks</h3><p>Ansubek does not have much to say during battle, and mostly mocks or provokes his foes, attempting to incite them to action, or strike fear in them to give himself the upper hand.

Anubhet's first act was to stomp the life from its creator, killing him instantly, much to Nehebkelat's amusement.

This society of murderers made a great name and fortune for themselves as ruthless assassins, and she was the greatest among them. Yet for all her power and skill, the limits of her mortal body weighed heavily upon her. As she aged, muscles would weaken, strength would dissolve, and before long her body would fail her.</p><p>Serketraj sought out a means by which to transcend that mortality; she sought to make a deal with Nehebkelat. In return for the service of her cult of assassins the Demon Queen granted her wish and Serketraj ascended to her new form, becoming an immortal being of shadow and poison.</p></section><h3>Serketraj's Tactics</h3><p>@UUID[Actor.AiImuhfg9DPr5e6Q]{Serketraj} is an exceptionally tricky and deceptive being who has steeped herself in secrets and lies for centuries. When engaged in combat her first objective is to create disarray in her attackers. Her tactics involve creating darkness, separating her foes, constantly relocating, and selectively targeting enemies that are responsible for maintaining cohesion of the party. This often leads her to target casters, healers, and leaders as soon as they make their presence known. Otherwise she targets whoever appears the most isolated and vulnerable, preferring to pick her foes apart one-on-one.</p><p><strong>Serketraj should...</strong></p><ul><li>Use her pincer attack in conjunction with Veil of Darkness, Shadow Slip, and Movement to grapple and relocate with enemies, pulling them away from their allies.</li><li>Take advantage of Creeping Darkness to keep enemies at bat while dealing with a single target.</li><li>Utilize Body of Shadow to avoid damaging attacks and spells, steal away grappled foes, or escape from dangerous enemies.</li></ul><p><strong>Serketraj's Darkness</strong>: We have included a 20ft radius light in the Sepulcher of Night which can be moved into place and activated to represent Serketraj's field of darkness.

Obelisk Mechanics} will work.</p><div class=\"exam-text\"><h5><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Investigating the Scrolls</strong></span></h5><p>The scrolls are an intense collection of ancient and obscure celestial, draconic, primordial scripts, arcane notation, religious pictograms, and unintelligible writing that was likely the common writing at the time.</p><ul><li><strong>[[/skill arcana 20]] </strong>Each of the scrolls bear complex arcane and mystic notations detailing the intricate magic of the pillar and the chamber. Each pillar appears able to channel an innate attribute of whoever touches it, using it to build an arcane connection between a source elsewhere in the vault and the pillar itself. Several of the designs bear striking resemblance to necromantic and transmutation magical principles.</li><li><strong>[[/skill history 20]] </strong>Each of the scrolls bears pictograms and images depicting feats of strength, agility, great performances for audiences, and similar. The feats are all of a single type per scroll, and many of them line up with ancient deeds of fabled heroes of antiquity. See <strong>Pillar Attribute by Color </strong>below for a guide of what each pillar represents, and the hero dossiers in each of the Sepulcher journal entries here: @UUID[JournalEntry.n6Fb0D0xskxz4zR4.JournalEntryPage.MwQMOshR3SD8Mkan]{1f.

The scrolls are telling of the deeds of the heroes based on their abilities.</li><li><strong>[[/skill religion 20]] </strong>An extensive network of carefully laid out divine symbols read more like an arcane diagram than a religious piece of art. It appears as though aspects of the obelisks are meant to directly channel light and power from the sun itself and some divine source beyond it. Perhaps the Eyes of Aten found or were given the means to channel godly might directly through the obelisks.</li><li><strong>Language Proficiency (Draconic):</strong> Large swathes of each scroll detail how the magical designs of the pillars are meant to direct innate magical and spiritual energy of a being through conduits built into the vault itself.</li><li><strong>Language Proficiency (Celestial):</strong> Large sections of the scrolls are dedicated to extolling the divine virtues of the ability tied to that scroll, and how the spirit is empowered through the cultivation of great strength, wisdom, intelligence, and so forth. That through this greatness they will have the power to overcome the endless evil that plagues the lands.</li><li><strong>Language Proficiency (Primodial, or a dialect):</strong> You recognize a large amount of elemental magical symbols in the writing and magical diagrams in the scrolls. Some of the text indicates that the pillars actively dampen the presence of powerful elemental sources they are attached to, and that this was by design. It seems that the Vault of Aten was built to directly hinder the natural powers of the Dread Generals, making them easier to overcome.</li></ul></div><h3>Pillar Attributes by Color</h3><ul><li><strong>The Yellow Obelisk</strong> bears the hieroglyph for the aspect of <strong>Strength</strong>.</li><li><strong>The Cyan Obelisk</strong> bears the hieroglyph for the aspect of <strong>Dexterity</strong>.</li><li><strong>The Red Obelisk</strong> bears  the hieroglyph for the aspect of <strong>Charisma</strong>.</li><li><strong>The Blue  Obelisk </strong>bears  the hieroglyph for the aspect of <strong>Wisdom</strong>.</li><li><strong>The Green Obelisk</strong> bears  the hieroglyph for the aspect of <strong>Constitution</strong>.</li><li><strong>The Purple Obelisk</strong> bears  the hieroglyph for the aspect of <strong>Intelligence</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p>"

              "text": "<div class=\"box-text\"><h5>Door to the Demon Queen's Cell</h5><p>Nearing the heavy stone door you can see that the massive cobra carving with its fangs bared is joined by depictions of snakes, demons, chains, and archaic text warning onlookers of the great danger within. You cannot help but feel that these are warnings meant to ward off even those that cannot read the script. Below them are a series of pictograms showing the four scepters of the sky touched to the snake, causing the door to open.</p></div><p>Nehebkelat, The Demon Queen is bound within. Upon preparing for the final fight, Abasi will urge the heroes to remember that the Demon Queen is immortal and unkillable, therefore the only path to victory is binding her again. Attempting to defeat her martially is a hopeless endeavor, as she cannot truly die.</p><h2>Entering the Arena</h2><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>Nehebkelat's Cell</h5><p>The final prison of the Demon Queen is a massive circular arena. Piled against the walls are thousands upon thousands of blackened bones of countless dead. The longer you stare at the piles of bones, the more you begin to hear the wailing keen of the tormented victims of the Demon Queen. Forcing the horror from your mind, you blink and for a moment see the bones vanish.</p><p>As the piles of bone vanish you also realize that the doorway you entered through has turned into a wall of solid stone bearing the four symbols on the amulets of the sky!</p><p>On either end of the room narrow stairs rise up to a platform that surrounds the arena, with six golden pyramids jutting from the stone, each one capped with a brilliant gem that glows with energy.</p><p>At the center of the arena is a raised platform lined with wailing skulls, and atop it is the massive Demon Queen, shackled in place by magical chains coming from three of the pyramids around the arena.</p><p>The horror before you is that of a half-woman half-snake, a mass of slithering, scaled flesh. The Demon Queen's form is equal parts beautiful and terrible, with six arms, a mouth of fangs, and glowing gold serpent eyes. In each hand Nehebkelat holds a different longsword, wielding them like they weigh nothing in her grip.</p><p>On each of the Demon Queen's forearms are metal bracers with glowing gems. Half of them are dark, the other half glow with power light, with spectral chains hanging between them and a pyramid with a gem of matching color. As the great marilith's arms move in a slow, hypnotizing sword dance, you can see that some of her arms are not as free, causing her to periodically struggle against her magical bonds.</p></div><h2>Final Encounter: Nehebkelat</h2><div class=\"box-text\"><h5>The Demon Queen's Gambit</h5><p>Nehebkelat goes still upon seeing the group, and angrily hisses. “I am disappointed. I was told that the Eyes of Aten were no more. Both in and outside this accursed vault.\"</p><p>She clenches a fist and pulls at the air, a magical chain appearing attached to her shackle. \"When I am freed from these bonds I’ll have to remind my servants of what happens to those that lie to me...”</p><p>The Demon Queen pauses with that thought, a moment of calculation evident on her features. \"You know... this could be quite simple and beneficial for the both of us. I know this vault is filled with treasures. If you release me I'll grant you an army of minions to deliver it to whatever pitiful hovels you call home. Think of it: you could live as royalty, and if you wished to serve me... well, even greater power, riches, and influence could be yours. Perhaps even immortality!\"</p><p>Of course, Abasi refuses to accept this path  and begins heading for the binding pillars to reassert the magic holding the Demon Queen in place. If Kesi, Uraeus or Last are present they also will outright refuse to serve the Demon Queen, opting to fulfill their divine duty!</p></div><p><strong>Note</strong>: This combat relies on @UUID[.3UYTQMRV8CopMNPE]{2e. Obelisk Mechanics} as the party's means of defeating Nehebkelat. Attempting to defeat her by simply reducing her hit points to 0 will not be as successful as expected. See <strong>Defeating the Demon Queen</strong> below for details.</p><h3><strong>Nehebkelat's Tactics</strong></h3><p>Nehebkelat is a merciless combatant who relishes combat as a chance to demonstrate her physical superiority over others. She will target anyone who directly engages her in melee combat, calls her out, or issues challenges. If and when they fall, she simply moves on to the next foe. If an enemy proves especially dangerous, she will change focus to neutralize them to the best of her ability.</p><div class=\"explainer macro\"><img src=\"icons/skills/targeting/crosshair-triple-strike-orange.webp\" /><div class=\"text\"><p><strong>Anchor Beams.</strong></p><p>This macro should be used when Nehebkelat finishes moving in the arena, or is pulled back to the arena center. It automatically refocuses the beams of light on her token. @UUID[Macro.W0RT57M84QGq2Lr3]{Anchor Nehebkelat Beams}</p></div></div><h3><strong>Combat Barks</strong></h3><p>The Demon Queen begins her battle confident, knowing that she has moved her pieces on the board carefully and is on the verge of escape. Any setbacks suffered at the hands of the party are minor, or at least not worth acknowledging. However, as the fight goes on and she gets closer to being rebound she will become more volatile and incensed at the mortals threatening her escape.</p><ul><li>\"I see my generals have failed in destroying all of the Eyes of Aten. No matter, the time of ascension is at hand and your order is too late to stop it. It has already begun.\"</li><li>\"Consider that we do not have to be enemies. You have bested my generals and proven your worthiness, take their places beside me and we can accomplish incredible things.\"</li><li>\"I have had one thousand years to plan your undoing, you will burn like locusts before my flames!\"</li><li>\"Your brotherhood and their army of hired 'heroes' were barely enough the first time! An old man and a gaggle of hapless adventurers will not be enough now!\"</li><li>\"I will not spend another thousand years in this hole! You will not succeed!\"</li><li>\"Stop! I will give you riches, power, kingdoms! Anything you desire in the lands are yours if you stand by me as my new generals!\"</li><li>\"Fools! You may have stopped me, but I am eternal! In a thousand years you will not even be memories, and the seals will once again weaken!\"</li></ul><h2>Defeating the Demon Queen</h2><p>Though difficult, it's not impossible to reduce the Demon Queen to 0 hit points. If this occurs she will be &amp;Reference[incapacitated] for 1 minute (10 rounds), but cannot be permanently killed. Any attempts to decapitate, maim, disintegrate, banish, petrify, or entomb her automatically fail as such mortal wounds magically heal almost instantly.</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813\">After a minute passes she will rise again with half of her maximum hit points and begin attempting to free herself again. If she is observed during this time it's clear that her wounds are rapidly closing as some magical force repairs her body. As the minute runs out she will begin to twitch and move indicating she's about to reawaken.</p><p>If the players manage to fully shackle her while she's incapacitated, the timer is extended by 2 additional rounds, giving them a little more time to get in place and finally lock her down for another thousand years.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>For mechanics on shackling the Demon Queen before or after incapacitating her see:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[.3UYTQMRV8CopMNPE]{2e.

At her side were her four dreadful generals, each of whom led her vast armies of corrupted mortals marching toward their bloody cause of domination.</p><p><span style=\"color:#191813\">For centuries the Demon Queen ruled unopposed. She was cruel, depraved, and brought nothing but devastation to the lands she claimed. The people within her borders knew only suffering, except those who served her and were rewarded. None dared to oppose the immortal tyrant openly, none except for my order. We are ... or rather were ... </span><em><span style=\"color:#191813\">The Eyes of Aten</span></em><span style=\"color:#191813\">, a secret society that dedicated to combating the Demon Queen herself.</span></p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h2>The Fall of Nehebkelat</h2><p>The Eyes of Aten rallied the land's mightiest warriors to cast down the great generals, and break their armies. It took them a century of battle and stained the lands red in the process, but the order's greatest magi and sages were able to defeat the Demon Queen.</p><p>This victory was not all it appeared though, for while Nehebkelat was defeated, she was not destroyed. The Demon Queen was an immortal being with abyssal magic that defied all others. My predecessors knew that there could be no total victory, not against an evil so terrible.</p><p>Desperate for a solution that would return the lands to control of the mortals and break the empire of blood's stranglehold, they imprisoned Nehebkelat and her generals using powerful magic, and shackled them deep within a sacred vault built in an uncharted desert.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h2>The Last of the Order</h2><p>Unfortunately, this act cost my order much, and the Eyes of Aten were never able to fully rebuild after sealing the Demon Queen away; the toll had been too great. Our greatest heroes and leaders were integral to making the magic work, and were sealed away with her. Without the powerful leadership that had directed them, our ranks have been in freefall ever since.</p><p>Though it well before my time, historical records in our archives show how the order became fractured, and scattered across the lands, a dim shadow of its former greatness. By the time I and my peers inherited it our predecessors had forgotten much of our history, misplaced or squandered all of our resources, and lost all of the fame and support they once had. We had become a relic of a time that society had forgotten, and many of my peers could not muster the courage to carry on, and simply left the order.</p><p>Those of us that remained carried on as best we could, knowing that very soon the old magic holding Nehebkelat at bay would fail, and someone would need to renew it.</p></div><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>If the heroes agree to assist despite the danger proceed to</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[.Pi5TxSSzLvFxPwS8]{Gold and Heroism}</p>"

A successful [[/skill insight 10]]<strong> </strong>check reveals that he is utterly serious, absolutely believes what he's saying, and is not deceiving the party.

A month or more at most. He has been careful to give them as much spare time as possible for the journey, and is optimistic they will arrive with days to spare. However, if the journey is treacherous or they get waylaid, they might arrive too late or with no time to spare.</li><li><strong>If the Demon Queen's Immortal, can she be killed?</strong> Abasi knows that defeating her is impossible, but they used something called \"The Dial of Aten\" to lock her away for a thousand years, and he suspects that they can use it to renew or extend her imprisonment.</li><li><strong>What if you're wrong about all this?</strong> He recognizes that he could be wrong. He’s working from badly-damaged documents that are almost a thousand years old. However, if he is wrong, they will travel out into the deserts, find nothing, travel back, and make the same amount of gold regardless.</li><li><strong>Where is this Vault located?</strong> The vault is in a valley on the far edges of most modern maps, in a stretch of hostile sand where a nation once stood but was swallowed by the deserts after it collapsed. He knows the route, though he expects most of the landmarks in his notes will have been long buried. So the journey may take longer than expected.</li><li><strong>How will they get into the Vault?</strong> He has a gem of light which records claim is the key to entering into the vault. The gem is paired with some other specific holy invocations which will unlock the magical doors. Getting in will not be an issue.</li><li><strong>What defenses does the Vault have?</strong> Honestly, he has no idea. There might be magical constructs, or traps, or monsters that have made the vault home. They should be ready for anything, since there's no way to know what awaits them.</li><li><strong>Where are the rest of his order?</strong> Sadly, he is the last of the Eyes of Aten. There were more, once, but in the last few years many of them have turned up dead, disappeared, or abandoned the order. It's been over a year since he had contact with any of his allies.</li></ul></div><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>If the adventurers agree to the mission, proceed to</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[.TXoWtve0voBRXuK9]{Journey to the Vault}</p>"

If the vault is real, then perhaps the evil within it is as well.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h2>The Last Night</h2><p>With only a few hours light left, you camp in the shadow of the monolith and prepare for the next day. Abasi explains that the tomb can only be opened at the day’s first light, with the gem, and the right command words. Therefore they will need to camp. By his reckoning they have all cut it about as close as possible, and have perhaps a few days before the magic breaks and the Demon Queen is free.</p><p>The evening chill sets in shortly after sundown, and all through the evening nerves prey on the campers. Shifting dunes and deep shadows cast by rocky outcrops create many false alarms in the night, and rest is disturbed and fleeting at best.</p></div><div class=\"box-text\"><h2>The Last Dawn</h2><p>The night passes without issue, despite any nerves and paranoia present among the party. The hard sand makes for a terrible bed, camping gear or no, in the early morning hours before the sun chases away the evening chill Abasi quietly wakes each member of the expedition. </p><p>“Wake friends, we’ve little time before dawn, and there is much to do.” He says to one after the next until all the camp is roused and in preparation.</p><p>Before striking camp you are afforded an hour or two to eat and prepare for the events to come.  For his part, Abasi prays to the Sun for guidance and protection. Watching the aging holy warrior, one might believe he is utterly unfazed by the cold pre-dawn hours, and the weight of what is coming. </p></div><h2>Final Preparations</h2><p>Give the players a chance to square away their inventories, and make any last preparations before entering the Vault of Aten. This is the point of no return, once inside the vault they will not be able to leave until the adventure comes to an end. It might be worthwhile telling the players this, even if their characters might not realize it (yet).</p><p>A potential moment of roleplaying to capitalize upon here is to ask each player how their character is feeling in this moment. Are they anxious, excited, do they remain skeptical that there is anything in the tomb? Perhaps they would like to make a [[/skill insight 15]] check on Abasi to see how he is coping (A result of 15 or higher reveals he is anxious, but focused).</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Continue onto Chapter 1: The Vault of Aten.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:center\">@JournalEntry[n6Fb0D0xskxz4zR4]{1a.
