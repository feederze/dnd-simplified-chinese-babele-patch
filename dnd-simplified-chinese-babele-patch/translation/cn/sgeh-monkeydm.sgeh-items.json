This ancient elven tradition has persisted through the ages, renewing its knowledge with each new moon that manifested itself. These wardens of old learned to harness these new lunar powers, consolidating their wisdom and passing it down through generations. Today, this conclave of stout defenders has become exceedingly rare, with only a sparse few members residing within the city-state's walls. While some whisper that members of this conclave can cleanse the moons of their corruption, the turmoil within Luyarnha suggests otherwise.</p><p class=\"callout\" data-bkit-id=\"b8cn61udbb9\" data-bkit-leader=\"1\" data-bkit-group=\"callout\">By embracing the lunar energies, these rangers undergo a transformation that melds their very essence with that of the moons, adopting aspects of their celestial beauty and might. As their bond with the moons deepens, Lunar Wardens attune themselves to the celestial bodies' forms, allowing them to channel lunar energies in extraordinary ways--mending grievous wounds using the power of a blood moon or burning asunder their foes with the blazing intensity of a scorching moon. When in perfect harmony with the eldritch body looming above, their abilities swell to incredible heights, transforming them into exceptional nocturnal hunters, whereas others would instead seek refuge from the dreadful moons.</p></div>",

In its battleaxe form, it is crowned with a black-hole-like orb that bubbles menacingly with molten metal. This churning crucible holds the devastating axe together and serves as a searing ammunition barrel in the weapon's pistol form.</p><p data-bkit-id=\"pbagfxxnugq\">When you attune to the Caldera, the metallic crucible at its apex ignites, constantly simmering with superheated lead. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"q7wncuankq9\">Trick Weapon. <span class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"uggihqkfei\">As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. Each time you transform the weapon, you take 1d4 fire damage as the liquid-fire reservoir that serves as a material catalyst surges with thermal energy.</span></p><p data-bkit-id=\"m1opnvtz97h\">In its untransformed state, the Caldera is a battleaxe that can devour its haft to reform into a pair of pistols, each holding half of the crucible. In its transformed state, the weapon is two pistols that can be slammed together to reform the crucible, alongside the rest of the battleaxe.</p><p data-bkit-id=\"ik830ji4yyb\">When you transform this weapon into pistols, the crucible refills each of the barrels with 6 lead bullets (12 total), filling up one pistol fully, then the other. When you switch to the untransformed state of the weapon, any unfired lead bullets are re-added to the boiling metal.</p><p data-bkit-id=\"o0jbhc4eq77\">The boiling metal can contain up to 60 lead bullets, and the weapon can't transform unless it contains at least 7 lead bullets. As an action, you can feed the crucible in either state by throwing lead bullets in it or by adding a cannonball, which counts as 30 bullets.</p><p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"y24amfz3x7\">Untransformed. <span class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"ajo30z3afp9\">When you hit with this battleaxe, you can expend 3 lead bullets from the boiling metal to cover the target in molten lead. The target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage, and it takes that damage again at the start of each of its turns unless it rolls on the floor (prone) or uses a bonus action to wipe off the lead.</span></p><p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"gdqgsj67lrg\">Transformed. <span class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"lal1vdgg2ta\">You pull out two fiery pistols from the molten metal. When you attack with them, you can use your Strength modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. These pistols are each loaded to full capacity, if there are enough lead bullets in the boiling metal.</span></p><p data-bkit-id=\"bam9wirbrrb\">When you use the Fan Fire property of these pistols, the cumulative penalty per bullet fired is -2 instead of - 3, and the pistol deals fire damage instead of piercing damage. In addition, if you roll a 1, the gun doesn't jam, and you instead take 1d6 fire damage.</p><p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"0oylmjl2xfc\">Bullet Hell. <span class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"h7nk03s8pns\">As an action, if both pistols are fully loaded, you can fire both of them in rapid succession, emptying all 12 bullets. Make 6 ranged attacks with the pistols, each dealing 1d6 piercing damage and 1d6 fire damage on a hit. Each attack after the first suffers a cumulative -2 penalty to the attack roll. You cannot add any modifier to the damage roll of these attacks beyond the first — such as the bonus from your Dexterity modifier or the Sharp-Shooter feat — apart from this weapon's bonus to damage rolls. The weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.</span></p></div>",

When wielded, these teeth whirr into a blur of destructive motion, capable of rending flesh, bone, and even the thick hide of beasts with horrifying ease.

Yet, some pursue baser ambitions, offering their expertise to those who desire to bend these rangers to their malevolent will, extracting confessions or inflicting retribution upon adversaries. After all, torture, a practice as ancient as the very bedrock of the earth, is a dreadful instrument, potent enough to shatter even the most indomitable of spirits.</p><p class=\"callout\" data-bkit-id=\"qzoobzab3i\" data-bkit-leader=\"1\" data-bkit-group=\"callout\">In the throes of battle, these rangers bring their torturous expertise with them, employing it with merciless precision to break their enemies, methodically subjecting them to unspeakable agony. They do not recoil from these savage tactics, for they understand that failure means death or a fate grimmer still. They show no mercy to their foes, for they are well aware that none would be extended to them in kind.</p></div>",

The weapon has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The dominant personality may attempt to influence the wielder's actions, particularly when it comes to matters of morality or strategy.

Each creature within a 10-foot radius of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage and 2d6 necrotic damage as the antithetical energies resonate and self-destruct.
