      "description": "<p>The Sigil of Jerusalem is a massive Adventure Module, spanning levels 1 to 10, filled with massive dungeons, legendary NPCs, immersive handouts and soundtracks, and a deep and branching storyline.</p><p>The year is 1182, and the Crusades came to a halt as an unexpected truce was struck between Baldwin and Saladin. Hidden behind this peace is an occult war, against an eldritch threat, awakening deep below in the catacombs of Jerusalem and the dunes of Cairo.</p><p>The adventurers must carve their path to fight back against the eldritch forces, corrupted knights, accursed beasts, and mythical creatures – to survive, to thwart, or to usurp the dark powers of eons past.</p>",

It serves as a reminder of the universe's enduring search for balance: just as the hearts of the departed are weighed against this feather in age-old rites, so too do these sorcerers weigh their every action against the eternal scales of truth. In a world teetering on the precipice of imbalance, the Sorcerers of the Soul of Maat stand as unwavering sentinels of cosmic harmony.</p><p></p>",

For a more detailed character builder, see the <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Character Builder </span>section in <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Era of the Crusades</span>.</p><h2>Choose your race</h2><p>As in the core rulebooks, you should decide which race you’d like to play first. It has an impact on some of the decisions you have to make ahead.</p><h3>Human</h3><p>If you choose to play as a human, you don’t need extra effort to adapt your appearance, as you have nothing to hide. However, if you have some arcane features regarding your body due to your class, background that is magical or arcane in nature, you must take some precautions to hide them as it may arouse many questions.</p><h3>Non-Human</h3><p>If you choose to play as a non-human race, think about the sections on how to keep your arcane features a secret from the superstitious, hateful, and ignorant eyes of the locals. See Running a Story in the Crusades in the Era of the Crusades to see how you might hide amongst the humans. Naturally, some races will need to go to greater lengths than others to hide their true nature.</p><h2>Where did you come from?</h2><p>Take some time to consider this question. Jerusalem is a place where people from different civilizations all across the world meet. Though it doesn’t have to define you, the place you come from is still important in understanding how you fit into this rich tapestry and decide your place in the world through roleplaying and character development.</p><h3>1) I am from Kingdom of Jerusalem</h3><p>You can be a local of the Kingdom of Jerusalem or be born in the city itself. You can be a knight, squire, farmer, trader, priest, acolyte, sage or a person with a whole other profession or interest. You are on your journey to return to the city. It is where you live after all – it can be the reason for the beginning of the adventure. You know the customs, laws, culture, habits, and other aspects about the city. You probably know who’s in charge, which lord does what, and which knightly order helps out the poor and similar core information regarding the city. The GM may feed you needed information in the right places without an ability check.</p><h3>2) I am from Europe</h3><p>You are from Europe, including but not limited to the urban centers of Berlin, Vienna, Toledo, Paris, Warsaw, Belgrade, Copenhagen, Brussels, Stockholm, London, Venice, Rome, and Florence. You came here for a cause. It can be for pilgrimage, joining the crusade or a whole other reason. You still share a bond with the locals and nobles in Jerusalem. There is a good chance you have the same faith and speak the same languages or at least you are familiar with the languages spoken in the Holy Lands and probably know the general customs and traditions of the kingdom.</p><h3>3) I am from Ayyubid Dynasty</h3><p>You can be from Cairo, Alexandria, Damascus, Aleppo or a similar city or countryside controlled by the Ayyubid Dynasty, thus from the areas called Egypt or Syria. You can be a local Muslim or an Eastern Christian, or even one of the descendents of the Ptolemaic Dynasty or local Egyptians of old. You are familiar with the area, as Jerusalem is surrounded by the Ayyubid forces and Saladin’s army is closing in. You are aware of the general customs, laws, and people in the city and know some important figures by name.</p><h3>4) I am from other Muslim countries</h3><p>You can be from Isfahan, Baghdad, Tashkent, Ghazne, Anatolia or other Muslim-controlled places. You may have originated from the remnants of the Great Seljuk Empire as they face their last years or come from Anatolia, the very heart of the Sultanate of Rum, another country controlled by the Seljuk Dynasty. You are familiar with Muslim laws and customs but probably don’t know the specifics about the Holy Lands and especially about Jerusalem. You may bring special trade goods, interesting items, weapons, and other things after consulting with your GM.</p><h3>5) I am from Byzantine Empire or other Christian realms</h3><p>You are from Constantinaple, Macedonia, Silistre, Thessaloniki, Kiev, Moscow, Thracia or a similar Christian-ruled realm. You can be considered as an ally of the Crusaders depending on your worldviews or you could be an Eastern Orthodox believer who has an enmity towards the Roman Catholics. You probably know Greek, Russian, Armenian or other proper language and do not share the tongue with the locals. You can bring special items from your realms with the discretion of the GM. You can be greeted as a friend or an interesting traveler, but the locals most likely heard about your realm and will be interested in what you brought. In general, you are a stranger to these lands and you do not know local laws, customs, and traditions and only heard them in legends.</p><h3>6) I am from distant lands</h3><p>You can be from Nanjing, Xi’an, Lhasa, Delhi, Ferghana, Ordu Baliq, Otugen, Mali, Kyoto, or Kilwa. You are most likely considered a stranger among these lands, and you probably only know of myths, legends and childhood tales of the holy cities of the Levant. Though people from all over the world are commonplace in the markets and caravanserai of the region, people are more likely to be curious of you and want to raise a glass of ale with you and hear your story. Alternatively, some may be suspicious of you and act hostile towards you.</p><p>If the GM allows it, you may bring interesting weapons, items, armor, tools or exotic goods with you.</p><h1 class=\"ha-red\">Jerusalem Hooks</h1><p>This section offers ideas about your characters’ motive for entering Jerusalem. There can be just one motive or many at once depending on the character’s backstory. Work with your GM to establish the details.</p><h2>Business Reason</h2><p>You are trying to reach Jerusalem in a matter related to your occupation, profession or interest.</p><p>@UUID[Macro.3AfBkFOmTDk0jczP]{Roll Business Reasons Table}</p><table class=\"roll color-red\"><thead><tr><td><p>D8</p></td><td><p>Business Reasons</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>In Jerusalem lies your chance to settle a crippling trade debt.

The players are free to choose who they are; there are no restrictions (unless you, as a GM, force some restrictions on them, this is going to be your story after all). All that is expected from the players is for them to have a strong reason to travel to Jerusalem.</p><p>As the player characters are free to choose, there can be many different characters with different and even opposing backgrounds. For example, one character could be a Mamluk-trained-fighter and a loyal soldier to Sultan Saladin, leader of the Saracens, while the other could be a proud and strong Crusader (a Paladin) who is extremely loyal to King Baldwin. From a distance, these characters seem to clash from the beginning and could turn enemies very quickly. In Sigil of Jerusalem, this is not the case.</p><p>There are several reasons that can be explored before the beginning of the campaign:</p><ul><li>There is truce between Baldwin and Saladin. It is a fragile peace but some Muslim entries to the Crusader cities are allowed.</li><li>The story’s main plot is about an eldritch horror that lies beneath the city of Jerusalem rather than the enmity between the two clashing countries.</li><li>The characters’ backgrounds can be tied to stopping the enmities between them.</li><li>The story’s first important moment will tie the characters nonetheless to a tied cause. So, at the beginning of the story, some tension between them can be explored and that could turn out to be a great companionship.</li></ul></div>"

We’re Sarp and Doğa from Metis Creative, and if there’s one thing we’ve learned from our adventures in creating worlds to explore, it’s that stories have the power to bridge worlds.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">When we first dreamed up this project, the idea of Historica Arcanum, the idea of running a Tabletop RPG Studio, we couldn’t help but worry about being left out of the global community. We were culturally, and geographically far away - and the dread of not being able to get our voices heard was overbearing. Yet, this was one of the instances that we couldn’t be happier to be proven definitively wrong.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">The love, passion, and unwavering support you’ve shown us have not just filled us with an insatiable hunger to create; they have truly made us feel that we were a part of the global Tabletop community. And for that, we are grateful. Honestly, we’re still pinching ourselves to make sure it’s real.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">“Era of the Crusades” is a project that’s close to all of our hearts at the office. It was a setting that we really wanted to make since we released the first Historica Arcanum - City of Crescent. Everyone in the team, from writers to artists, poured their hearts and souls into this book, making sure every page, every illustration, and every line of text captured the essence of the story and world we wanted to bring to life. It’s with this setting, where we’ve started to really nail the dark, mysterious, and slightly eerie tone we’ve always wanted the World of Historica Arcanum to have. This book marks a significant step in developing our universe, laying down even more pieces of the lore that will grow and evolve with time and new entries to the setting.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">Sharing this creation with you feels like sharing a piece from our souls. The late nights, the brainstorming sessions, the occasional frustrations, and the breakthrough moments—it’s all been a labor of love, a testament to what we can achieve together, as a team and as a community. Your enthusiasm and support light the way for us, encouraging us to keep dreaming, creating, exploring, and sharing new worlds that resonate with the depth and diversity of the human experience.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">Thank you for joing this incredible journey with us. As you turn the pages of Era of the Crusades, know that you’re stepping into a world crafted with love, dedication, and a little bit of magic from everyone at Metis Creative.</p><p class=\"align-right ha-dark-gold\">With all our gratitude and love,</p><p class=\"align-right ha-dark-gold no-margin\">Sarp and Doğa</p><p class=\"align-right ha-dark-gold\">Metis Creative</p></div>"

It was enslaved amongst the clouds, and the despair brought forth by the darkening sky was attempting to suffocate the most sacred city in the world. Despite all the darkness, enemies at the gate, and traitors within, a silver flag was hoisted towards the heavens, rising from every tower on the walls, striving to reach the stars. Brave warriors on the high battlements, fixing their eyes on the roads and all the struggles that lay ahead, were waging a sincere and relentless battle against the fear that would take their hearts to the depths of the abyss.</p><p>The walls, to which almost everyone feeling a sacred call in their heart turned their gazes, were facing one of the greatest challenges in history. In these lands that have breathed as the heart of faith for thousands of years, secrets lay hidden, difficult to see for those whose inner eyes were closed. The custodians of this city, accustomed to altering the fate of the world, were struggling to perceive the threats lurking behind the veil.</p><p>A victorious king sat upon the throne of the city. Despite his young age, he had proven his strength to everyone and had overcome seemingly impassable obstacles. Yet, the whims of fate, the very curse of Mother Nature herself, were subjecting him to an impossible test. His greatest rival, a sultan determined to become the city’s conqueror, knew that the mysteries within the walls walked arm in arm with what horror lies beyond the veil and carried - and bravely fought - the marks of the rising darkness in his soul with each passing day.</p><p>Two adversaries, each holding deep respect for the other, were acutely aware that they were destined to engage in a desperate struggle. They knew that they would not have the chance to sit and debate the most skillful commanders in the world as two former rivals and new friends after the war was over, like Hannibal and Scipio did. They both knew that this war would cost one of them their lives.</p><p>The people living within the walls entered their beds at night, knowing all too well that they could not easily escape the ruthless claws of war. They could do no more than place their trust in their young king and their bravest of knights.</p><p>Very few heard the calm and enticing lullaby rising from behind the curtain. Not far from a caravanserai that gazed distantly at the city’s battlements, there gathered a group eager and willing to reach the silver towers, looking towards the visage of the most sacred city with hope. Neither the owners of the stifling silence among the shadows nor those who followed the faith in their hearts were aware of this.</p></div>"

They can possibly take on small quests as a form of introduction to the campaign. The caravanserai will be attacked by Raynald of Chatillon, and Yakup’s escape attempt with magic will result in a strong spell rebound effect.

As the sorrowful clouds fight away the radiant sunlight, the faces around the caravanserai seem to be sunless and joyless. The very fragile peace of the world hangs in a delicate balance, and the ones who take a side in this endless war are perilously close to the edge. You notice two different sides in this small caravanserai, just as the world you know also shattered between the cross and the crescent. The chasm bleeds, and you only see blades in the dark to widen the bloodshed; almost nothing makes an attempt to stop it.</p><p class=\"centered\">You notice warriors with stern faces, armed from head to toe –proudly carrying the cross on their chests, close to their hearts. Their gaze is upon the newly arrived –the followers of the crescent. Neither party is here to disturb the peace or be the reason the balance is off the scale and cause all hopes to fall from the edge right into the abyss. However, you feel the ice in the air, filling the gap between them.</p></div><h2>Hirelings</h2><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Note on Economy: </span>Instead of gold pieces (gp) gold dinar (gd), instead of silver pieces (sp) silver dirham (sd) and instead of copper pieces copper fals (pl. fulus) (cf) is used.

He believes that all religions should be treated equally, and the war is pointless. He was born in Jerusalem and protected the Dome for many years. However, the things he witnessed changed his worldview slowly, and he no longer wished to fight for a greater cause.

Each morning, he wakes up early before dawn, and travels to a nearby pond. He spends some time there watering two beautiful flowers, interestingly colorful and healthy in this desolate area. The flowers are a tribute to his two children that died during the war. If the matter is brought up, he will state that both Crusaders and Saracens were responsible. Alexios bought Christopher from slave owners and set him free immediately. Christopher, however, wanted to stay by his side and settle his debt. Alexios does not see Christopher as indebted to him, and he enjoys his company as the captain of his guards.</p><p>In the main building, there are about thirty attendants that work for the caravanserai and attend to many needs, from kitchen duties to tending to horses.

Due to times of relative peace, the traders are free to continue their affairs as they wish. In the courtyards, their caravans and goods are at the ready if the adventurers wish to trade.</p><p>There are also two interesting groups: a Crusader group and a Saracen envoy from Damascus who are traveling to Cairo. They clearly don’t enjoy the other’s presence, and the adventurers can catch cold looks or long and intimidating glares towards one another if they spend time in the courtyard.</p><p>Characters with Passive Perception of 13 or higher notice a man in his late thirties, possibly of Arabic descent and trying to keep a low profile and warding off unwanted attention. He seems to be working at the caravanserai, near the well. He serves water to those who ask and tries to act as a shy and quiet person. A further [[/skill Insight 10]] or [[/skill Perception 10]] check reveals that he pays attention to every face and rarely loses focus. If the roll is above 15, the character also notices that he hides a scar. The scar is actually from a spell rebound effect (check out the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Magic in Historica Arcanum</span> section in <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Era of the Crusades</span>).</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">This character is <span class=\"weight600\">Yakup al-Qudsi</span>, a sigil knight of Jerusalem, and he is directly connected to the main story.

He does not want to do it himself because he avoids any possible unwanted attention.</p><p>Yakup has no idea what happened to the locket, but he discovered a wizard’s tomb on his way here; he believes there may be useful spell scrolls there. Yakup will inform the adventurers that it is probably guarded. They can identify the specific tomb with the Mark of Banu Musa, which is a symbol of a wave with the letter <span class=\"helvetica bold\">ب</span> on it. [[/skill History 15]] check reveals that Banu Musa is a group of engineers that originates from Baghdad. Banu Musa means the Sons of Musa and was founded by three brothers: <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Abu al-Qasim</span>, <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Ahmad ibn Musa ibn Shakir</span>, and <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Al-Hasan ibn Musa ibn Shakir</span>, known as Abu al-Qasim, Ahmad, and Al-Hasan for short, respectively.

She waits for someone to complete the sentence with, “but I lie alone.” She is very enthusiastic about her work and enjoys cracking jokes here and there.

It appears to be a normal grave under the shadow of a tree, with the name Nurullah ibn Musa carved on it. The Mark of Banu Musa is small on the gravestone, but it can be easily spotted by anyone looking for it. A [[/skill Survival 10]] check reveals that there is a solid object beneath it, far above for a grave. It is not customary for Muslim burials to involve solid objects. Rather, they are buried well deep with only a white shroud. The object is actually the beginning of a ladder that leads downwards.</p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>With each step you take, a subtle aroma begins to pervade your senses, intensifying as you descend. It's an unsettling scent, primarily because it's so wholly unexpected. You had braced yourself for the stench of decay, perhaps even death, yet what greets you is neither. Instead, an acrid smell assaults your nostrils, almost as if it's singing the hairs within. Upon reaching the bottom and venturing into its heart, your eyes start to water. This is a scent you recognize, one that's ingrained in your memory. It's the odor of rusty chains abandoned in a damp chamber for centuries, reminiscent of an old, retired blacksmith whose hands are eternally marred with the soot and scent of metal. It's the threatening presence of a darkened, burnt orange nail that could fatally pierce your skin with a single swipe. The longer you linger here, the more you sense this pervasive, rusty essence beginning to claim your belongings, as if it seeks to engulf them—and not just them, but your very bones as well.</p></div><h4 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Main Grave Room</h4><p>The room has a sarcophagus, with one set of full plate armor (actually an <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.eORmAXuV5v3nWsQL]{animated armor}</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-dark-blue-note\">j</span>) in front of it, and a carved steel plate on the left. On the ground, there is a carpet made from silk, obviously torn by the cruel touch of time. The carpet’s weave tells the story of Moses and the Parting of the Red Sea. Players who speak Arabic or Turkic languages realize that Musa is the name for Moses in Arabic and Turkic dialects. The carpet has magical grease under it which can be noticed with a Passive Perception score of 13 or higher or with an active [[/skill Perception 10]] or [[/skill Investigation 10]] check. If the creatures succeed in the active check, they also notice a loose plate under the carpet, which triggers a mechanism.</p><p>The steel plate on the left has a dragon’s carving on it, and if the carpet is removed, the trap is triggered; the mechanism belches fire in a 15 ft. cone.

The grease also catches fire and forces the ones on the greased area to make another [[/save 10 dex format=long]]. On a failed save, they catch fire.

Yakup immediately tries to escape but is quickly cornered by the enemy. The enemy appears to be ruthless, slaying everyone in their path, and is not interested in showing mercy to the injured or surrendered.</p><p>The leader, Raynald himself, can be seen in the heart of battle with incredible might and horrible methods:</p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"centered\">A large man with a greatsword dismounts his horse, voluntarily giving up his advantageous position.

While the gap is narrowing, a sudden surge of blood pours from the leader. To your shock, he cuts his own arm with one swift strike. He seems to ignore the pain and hastily charges towards Yakup.</p><p class=\"centered\">Before he is ready to strike, you hear those words: “Finally, the restless nights are over!”</p></div><p>The adventurers are cornered by one <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">@UUID[Actor.iQN4H2wZ6EnJptbk]{brute warrior of the wolf sigil}</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle\">a</span> and can fight him.

Suddenly, the stars in the sky betray your desire for light, and you find yourself engulfed in darkness. A starless, cosmic cold surrounds your very soul and attempts to strangle you at the edge of darkness. You feel some strong iron chains pull you to a dark hole, and a sudden, soft lullaby is heard from a distance. You hear a calling that resembles your mother’s voice, even if you didn’t know her.</p><p class=\"centered\">You suddenly feel you’ve been struck by a volcano’s eruption.

You feel his scars are yours now, and somehow, his destiny marches your way, and there is nothing you can do to stop it.</p><p class=\"centered\">The lullaby stops when the chains are gone and the branding is done. The skies show mercy, and suddenly, the stars rush to your aid. The strangling darkness vanishes in front of you, and you feel a chilling cold down your spine.

But none are alive. No one can scream anymore. Body parts are all over the place. All shattered to pieces and fused into the stones or each other. You don’t know how many people died here. How many bodies fused into the holy grounds like this? You notice Yakup’s face in a stone wall. His face twitches with pain and agony. His last moments are forever embraced by the stones; his pain will always be visible here.</p><p class=\"centered\">You notice you are at the center of all this. Your arrival caused this.

His name was Mamduh, and he was arrested for heresy, seemingly following the ways of the old Arabic pagan religion. He received the death penalty.

In recent days, he was accused of killing an important merchant of the city (named Hassan) while he was sick, and Jaques was performing surgery on him. Jaques used a special medicine to put Hassan to sleep and told the relatives he should wake up after 1 hour, which he didn’t. Relatives accused Jaques of poisoning the merchant, and he received a death penalty. Jaques is only willing to share information if the adventurers prove his innocence, which he is certain of.</p><p>In truth, the merchant had a secret affair with another merchant’s (<span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Djemil, artisan</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle\">a</span>) wife (<span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Elif, traveling artist</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle\">a</span>). When the rival merchant Djemil found out about the affair, he interfered with his food and poisoned him further, and then blamed it on the surgeon. Djemil has the poisoning kit stored in his cart, which can be used as proof of Jaques’s innocence.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">The information gained:</span> Alec is inhumanely powerful, and before he attacked the guards, his eyes had a purple shimmer. This information will give the adventurers an advantage on the saving throw against Alec’s Corrupting Presence and other abilities that enforce a condition called Corruption.</p><h3 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Church of St. Anne</h3><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>When you see the building, you notice a certain joy pouring into your soul, and you are blessed with the most innocent voice in the world: the laughter of children.

The leading priest of the church is a man called Father Godfrey. He is a priest with high intelligence and a very compassionate man. He is different from most priests and avoids religious dogma and mostly uses teachings about peace, compassion, love, and learning.</p><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/church-of-saint-anne.webp\" style=\"margin-bottom:-70px\" /><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>Father Godfrey is about fifty years old, with a shaved and clean face and short gray hair. He has scars starting from his neck down to his chest and has callused hands. He was taken prisoner from a village near Edna during the early campaigns of the Zengid Dynasty when he was only a child. While in a prisoner camp, he was freed by a local imam named Zaid. He was raised as a scholar and taught astronomy and mathematics as well as many languages. However, Zaid’s main teaching was that all human life is sacred, and learning and teaching are very important for those who have sharp minds. Zaid believed that Godfrey was very bright and that his turn to teach would eventually come.</p><p>Godfrey always felt the calling of Jerusalem and has always been a strong believer. Zaid never enforced Islam on him and at all the times said that: “We are under different pillars of light that look like they are coming from different sources. However, both beams are from the same sun.” Eventually, Godfrey left for Jerusalem and always helped those in need.</p></div><div class=\"box-character1 ha-dark-blue-note\"><p class=\"centered bold font-size-x1.5\">@UUID[Actor.KXlGSh047Z0K8IrE]{Father Godfrey}</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-blue-character-subtitle\">Medium humanoid (human), neutral good</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Armor Class</span> <span class=\"ha-dark-blue-character-subtitle\">14 (faithful’s robe)</span></p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Hit Points</span> <span class=\"ha-dark-blue-character-subtitle\">35 (10d8 - 10)</span></p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Speed</span> <span class=\"ha-dark-blue-character-subtitle\">30 ft.</span></p><div class=\"box-character-attributes\"><div><p>STR</p><p>8 (-1)</p></div><div><p>DEX</p><p>11 (+0)</p></div><div><p>CON</p><p>8 (-1)</p></div><div><p>INT</p><p>16 (+3)</p></div><div><p>WIS</p><p>18 (+4)</p></div><div><p>CHA</p><p>14 (+2)</p></div></div><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Saving Throws </span>Wis +5, Cha +4</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Skills </span>Arcana +5, History +5, Insight +5</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Senses</span> passive Perception 15</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Languages </span>Latin, French, Arabic, Turkish, Persian</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Challenge </span>2 (450 XP)</p><hr /><div><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Divine Aura. </span>Father Godfrey adds its Wisdom modifier to each of his saving throws.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Sacred Touch (1/day).</span> When Father Godfrey spends 1 hour and uses 10 gd worth of powdered silver with a flask of water, it becomes a flask of holy water.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Faithful’s Robe. </span>The wearer’s Armor Class becomes 14 while wearing and attuned to the item.

The priest invited Caliph Omar to the garden and personally asked for his blessings and the continuation of the church and its studies. Omar observed the orphans in the area and saw the innocence within them. He replied that he would not touch any of those who remain loyal to the city and added: “Your presence is enough to bless this place; you need none from me.”</p><p>Each creature resting in the church receives a blessing as if the <span class=\"italic\">greater restoration</span> spell was cast on it when they finish a long rest. If they are of good alignment, they are under the effects of the bless spell for the next two hours.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Entrance Floor: </span>The entrance floor of the church has the main prayer hall and a shrine. If the creatures within 5 ft. of the shrine receive healing, they will have the maximum possible amount. There is a holy water fountain near the door. On Sundays, at noon, the font actually has holy water, and it can be bottled in one flask and used to produce a <span class=\"italic\">flask of holy water</span> and it is also considered as a Fountain of the Blessed.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Fountain of the Blessed:</span> The water in this fountain is believed to be holy water and carries a faint magical essence. Believers that use some of the water according to their beliefs (such as crossing oneself) gain temporary hit points equal to their Wisdom modifier.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Godfrey’s Chamber:</span> It is a modest room with only necessary furniture and objects. On his desk, a letter from his teacher, <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Zaid</span><span class=\"dot-sup losangle\">q</span>, can be found. Apparently, he will visit the city, and he’s very ill, possibly coming to spend his final weeks. He’s afraid that the roads will be dangerous, and due to the upcoming war, he may not be allowed into the city.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Library:</span> It contains many books and tomes on religious and academic topics. One shelf contains a hidden door, especially untouched by Father Godfrey if asked, as he did not want to disturb whatever was in it. It leads to a small vault with a lock (DC 15) and contains 4 spell scrolls that are 2nd level or lower. There is also a note signed from a man called Sheref ad-Din: “<span class=\"italic\">Find me near the mosque. I’ll be playing backgammon.</span>” Only active mosque in the city is the Mosque of Omar.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Upstairs:</span> There are about twelve children (8 AC, 2 HP) in the church who reside upstairs in three rooms with bunk beds and similar furniture. During the day, the children’s number almost reaches thirty due to more from the neighborhood coming for lessons and lectures from Godfrey. The lectures usually happen in the library or the courtyard.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Sisters’ Rooms:</span> Sisters stay in the same room with two beds and modest furniture. <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Sister Mary</span><span class=\"dot-sup losangle\">q</span> is in her mid-thirties and keeps her private belongings under her bed, in a small chest, with a mirror and a drawing in it. The drawing is a small and cozy house on a sunny hill and signed by a child, which can be understood by the handwriting. It is titled: “My mama’s dream house -Anthony.”</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Sister Alice</span><span class=\"dot-sup losangle\">q</span> is a young woman in her twenties who aspires to be a powerful magic user. She believes that her faith will prevail no matter what. She keeps some books on arcane matters and legends near her bed and has a personal journal full of notes, suggestions, training routines, and such about spellcasting.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">Sister Alice and Sister Mary will be ambushed by a group of madmen (4 <span class=\"weight600\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thugs}</span>) that went crazy due to Little Death effects. If the adventurers did not coincide with it, their belongings can be found beneath the <span class=\"weight600\">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</span>. Check out the <span class=\"weight600\">Little Death</span> section below.</p></div><h4 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Abandoned Warehouse</h4><p>The warehouse is a large room with 20 ft. wide and 30 ft. long walls. It appears to have not been in use for a very long time due to strange noises in the night. It was abandoned by Father Godfrey to prevent children from coming here and to protect them from whatever problem was there. He used a Faithful Seal to bar the door, which was ripped apart by Alec at night.</p><p>Father Godfrey sensed the seal was being broken and confronted Alec and Mamduh. Alec threatened to hurt the kids if Godfrey didn’t help them.</p><p>Inside, Alec and Mamduh can be found. It seems that Alec is using leeches to transfer his blood to Mamduh and turn him into a branded sigil warrior like him. Combat is almost unavoidable. If the adventurers do not interfere with the process (which takes almost an hour), Mamduh will receive five levels of Corruption and become <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">corrupted</span> and will attack people around him, including Alec, once the process is done.</p><p>If Alec notices the adventurers observing the warehouse or sees them before they enter, he will attempt to take a child as hostage and force the adventurers to retreat. His eventual goal is to escape the city and gain his freedom.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">If any creature sleeps in the Abandoned Warehouse, their dreams will be plagued with nightmares of being buried alive while a woman sings a lullaby. Due to this, any creature attempting a long rest in the room must succeed on a [[/save 10 wis format=long]] or can’t benefit from the long rest.</p></div><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered weight600 no-margin\">Corruption</p><p class=\"centered\">This new condition works like exhaustion by means of mechanics; each long rest reduces it by one level, and the <span class=\"italic\">greater restoration</span> spell can affect it as it affects exhaustion in the spell’s description.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Corrupted.</span> The creature has disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks but has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p><p class=\"centered\">Other than the condition, Corruption has 5 levels:</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Level 1: </span>The target sees under normal light as if it is in dim light.

In total darkness, if it has darkvision or a similar means to perceive, it sees as the normal rules deem appropriate.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Level 2:</span> The target sees under dim light as if it is in total darkness. It bypasses every kind of vision except Truesight, Tremor Sense, and Blindsight.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Level 3:</span> While perceiving its surroundings as if it is in dim light, it must succeed in a [[/save 10 wis format=long]] when making an attack roll, or it confuses the target as a friendly creature; thus, it must attack another creature or lose the attack.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Level 4: </span>While perceiving its surroundings as if it is in normal light, it must succeed on a [[/save 10 wis format=long]] when making an attack roll, or it confuses the target as a friendly creature; thus, it must attack another creature or lose the attack.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Level 5:</span> The target is blinded and sees everyone in shades and colors. It can’t discern friend from foe and perceives everyone as hostile creatures of the GM’s choice, related to its characteristics, knowledge, traits, fears, and other circumstances.</p></div><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">While the adventurers fight with the brute warrior of the wolf sigil, their abilities due to the Serpent Sigil will be revealed and can be added to their character sheets:</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">The Serpent Sigil. </span>You are always under the effects of the <span class=\"italic\">protection from evil and good</span> spell and the <span class=\"italic\">speak with animals </span>spell. However, the <span class=\"italic\">speak with animals</span> spell only works with snakes and similar beasts.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">The Sigil Breaker. </span>You deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage to any creature bearing one of the sigils or its marks. Additionally, if you kill a creature bearing the sigil itself, it will be shattered and lose its power.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">The Sigil’s Bane. </span>The sigil’s power can be unleashed upon those who wear the other sigils. For 1 minute, you have advantage on attack rolls against the wearers of the sigil, or the ones who bear its marks. This works as if you’re concentrating on a spell, and once used, it can’t be used again until you finish a long rest.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">The Ancient Tongues.</span> The bearer can speak, read, and write Akkadian and Babylonian.</p></div><p>If the adventurers successfully save the children and defeat the enemies, Father Godfrey will reward them with the spell scrolls behind the hidden door if the adventurers ever notice that place. If the adventurers don’t notice such a place, Father Godfrey will offer them <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">two flasks of holy water</span> and offer them support on general matters, such as tending wounds, broken bones, spending the night, or similar matters.</p><p>After the quest is over, they will be informed by city guards or other officials that Balian can be found at the construction site of the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Church of Holy Sepulchre</span>.</p><h2>Little Death</h2><p>Due to the approaching birth of the dragon that is the mount of Whore of Babylon beneath the city of Jerusalem, some strange events may happen to various NPCs, random people on the street or even on the adventurers themselves. These effects mostly to enrich and foreshadow the main conflict and can be implemented in city Quests in Jerusalem - City of God section in Era of the Crusades, or directly can be used in the flow of this adventure.</p><p>The most prominent sign is the missing people and their dead bodies. While they delve deep in the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</span> (see below) or while traveling in the city they may encounter many dead bodies, missing people who are dead and their belongings that suggest their deaths. Such NPCs are marked with <span class=\"dot-sup losangle\">q</span> symbol throughout the adventure.</p><p>From time to time you can use the descriptive texts below to detail the strange happenings and check out the table below:</p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>You have heard that sleep is often called the little death, a time when you lie in repose so akin to the stillness of the grave. Each night, as you slumber deeply, your breaths slow and your thoughts fade, mirroring the final peace that awaits us all. It’s a nightly rehearsal, a gentle reminder of the inevitable: You are mortal. You are close to your grave and your spirit knows it. What is the meaning of a single life against the tides of eternity?</p><p>Some nights, a faint, almost unseen movement catches your eye, dancing at the edges of your vision. It’s as if a kind figure, caring and tender, hovers just out of sight, brushing your cheek with the softness of a mother’s kiss. It’s comforting, reminding you of the sunny days. The subtle, loving presence that watches over you is gone once you open your eyes or actively search it. Where it might have gone?</p><p>At times, you could swear a distant lullaby drifts through the air—a melody so sweet and faint, it vanishes the moment you try to listen. Yet, this elusive song is not yours alone to hear; many catch its fleeting notes, a shared whisper of comfort that dances just beyond the silence. When you try to hum or play the melody, you just can’t. It feels like trying to remember a drifting dream.</p><p>You’ve sensed the unease that creeps through the streets of Jerusalem. People are vanishing, going missing and the whispers of their absence ripple slowly, steadily. Fear mounts, and the rumors that once hushed and shunned are welcomed with open arms, because most people know it in their bones: Dark stars are upon the realm and the end might be near.</p><p>In your wanderings, you must have observed at least five souls, their actions unmoored from reason. They roam, they shout, they gesture wildly to unseen visions. Madness, it seems, has laid its hand upon them, drawing them into its unpredictable dance through the city’s shadowed lanes.</p></div><p>@UUID[Macro.8WiyNYwjHkywF3tK]{Roll Happenings Table}</p><table class=\"roll color-blue\"><thead><tr><td><p>d20</p></td><td><p>Happenings</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p><span class=\"weight600\">Whispering Walls:</span> At night, the city walls echo with whispers in a long forgotten tongue, Old Persian, ancient dialects of Aramaic languages or even some that can’t be comprehended.

How many dreams faded, or how much blood was spilt? How many stories ended here?</p><p>Or how many of them started?</p><p>You feel like yours has already started, and you are entering a new chapter.</p><p>When you see the king’s tent and his colors on fabrics near the construction, the thoughts leave you, and reality welcomes you.

You feel like you are staring at the heart of the void. The room has no edge corners and no walls. Instead of the walls, you are greeted with flesh, veins, and, with it, an unexpected vibration: a pulse. Like the veins and the whole walls moving like a heart’s pulse and the black veins reaching onto the door.</p><p>The door has a giant parchment on it: a seal. It is written in reverse Arabic letters: “Locked. Banished. Awakened. Hold your breath to unmake. Forget the sun to unveil.”</p></div><p>A [[/skill Nature 10]] or [[/tool mason int 10]] check reveals that the door is made of a material known as “marsik.” It clearly has Arabic architectural signs. However, the rest of the room, except the altar, seems to have been here for a really long time.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">Marsik is actually a term used for coal that has not been burned properly, a word in Turkish. However, the guild of blacksmiths in Damascus discovered an arcane way to make the Marsik more powerful and solid, “Layet-Efel-Ahen (Stainless Iron),”. For further information on Stainless Iron, check out Act II: We Become What We Behold.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">Marsik is a special material that absorbs magic and damage to an extent. When the metal of armor is covered with marsik, it will grant a damage threshold to the wearer (5 damage) and grant +1 bonus to saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If it is used to cover a blade, the weapon gains the siege ability, dealing double damage to constructs. If it is applied to doors, walls, and similar surfaces in large quantities, the door will gain a damage threshold equal to 30 damage and get resistance to all nonmagical attacks.</p></div><p>A quick investigation or casting detect magic inside the room reveals that there is a handle inside the flame. The flames must be extinguished, and the handle must be pulled to open the door. Marsik will not yield to damage and magic.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered weight600\">The Seals of Kings - Entrance to the Lullaby Palace</p><p class=\"centered\">This is the first obstacle that the adventurers face before they are thrown into the adventure. When the Whore of Babylon was sealed in ancient times by Cyrus the Great, he used a seal and bound her to the city to avoid further destruction by her. This seal, however, was not strong enough. This was discovered by Heraklios, the Basileus of the Eastern Roman Empire who ruled from Constantinople. He further improved the seal.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">In later years, when Caliph Omar conquered the city, he sensed the seals’ weakness. He foresaw their eventual downfall, and prepared another seal, which is what the adventurers discover.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">Each seal opens a new floor until the Womb of Dragon is reached, where Cyrus bound the Whore of Babylon. With each passing day, the Dragon is getting stronger and preparing to bring the Whore of Babylon from her bound place, an extra-dimensional prison, which will be introduced in the <span class=\"weight600\">Lullaby Palace</span> section in <span class=\"weight600\">Act III: Little Death by the Paradise</span>.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">The first seal can be unmade by the <span class=\"weight600\">Breath of the Caliph</span> that carries the last breath of the Caliph Omar, which was put in a device called Extinguisher – hidden inside the cisterns under the city, still protected by his unyielding guardian. This is the first dungeon –which the adventurers are about to enter.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">The second seal can be unmade by the <span class=\"weight600\">Blood of Basileus</span>, which can be found intact on the True Cross hidden under the Byzantine Cardo.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">The third seal can be unmade by the <span class=\"weight600\">Voice of Shahenshah</span>, which can be found in the Cylinder of Cyrus, where Cyrus put his memories and vision of the world. It is located in the Library Pageless, the headquarters of Peter the Hermit, one of the holders of the Sigils of Jerusalem, granted by Whore of Babylon and distributed among the Crusaders.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">King Baldwin is not adequately knowledgeable in this whole manner. His main goal to pursue this excavation to the deeps, he believes there is a cure for his leprosy at the end.</p></div><p>The king will tell this from memory: “Where the pulse lies bloodless with the vein, hold your breath – or all will be in vain.”</p><p>If the adventurers wait for an explanation, the king will stay silent for a moment and then will explain these:</p><ul class=\"blue\"><li>This was the reason he was personally overseeing the reconstruction of the church.</li><li>There is a strong mystery concerning the room and whatever lies below Jerusalem. The king has seen the sigil before, in a book: an important magical item called The White Book. The book is heavily encrypted, and the part he told from memory was one of the first parts to be solved.</li><li>The king will reveal that he probably doesn’t have much time due to his leprosy, and his well-being isn’t getting any better with each passing day. With the incident at the Church of St. Anne and now saving the workers from horrible monsters, the adventurers have proven themselves and may have proved that they may be the only hope to help cure the king. This is why the king needs their help. He believes The White Book hints there is a cure for most diseases.</li><li>His leprosy can’t be cured by even the most powerful clerics; it has been tried before.</li></ul><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">If the king deems the adventurers trustworthy, he will mention that if anything happens to him he will give the book for safekeeping to his mother, the Mother Queen Agnes. Mother Queen has the statblock of Scholar of Jerusalem. She usually doesn’t leave the Temple Mount.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">The king dies in Act II. So before departing for Kerak Castle, this exchange of the book will be completed. Even Sibylla does not know about this.</p></div><p>When the adventurers and the king focus on the room, a [[/skill Religion 10]] check reveals this: usually, reverse Arabic letters mean “spellcasting” or “communication with the djinni” in Islamic tradition. Many ancient spells and rituals involve writing Arabic letters from left to right (although they are normally written from right to left.) and reading them aloud.</p><p>If read aloud, the flames come to life:</p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>A whisper from the depths fills your very soul, as if you hear it inside your skull. The whisper drowns every other sound; you can’t even hear the flickering of flames, only a distant echo in your memories.</p><p>“Find where the breath is enchained. Where the conqueror companion’s last wish is restrained. Venture deep until your eyes can’t see, until you feel the breeze of the blue sea.”</p></div><p>[[/skill History 10]] check reveals that the conqueror companion is Caliph Omar, the one who conquered Jerusalem. Companion is the short version of “Companions of the Prophet” and the translation of the word “Al-Sahaba,” which defines the ones who followed, saw, and accompanied the Prophet Muhammad during his lifetime. Conqueror is obvious, as Omar was the most successful Rashidun Caliph, conquered many territories and expanded the Rashidun Caliphate to its mightiest state.</p><p>The king immediately realizes that the adventurers should venture to the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Mosque of Omar</span>, as it was built where he first prayed after the conquest of the city. He is not sure what the remaining bits mean, but the Mosque of Omar is a really good place to start.</p><h4 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">The String of Life</h4><p>If the adventurers investigate the room further, they will realize the material resembling flesh and meat and black veins is still alive, as if the source of the pulse. A [[/skill Medicine 15]] or an Intelligence (Medicine) (possible herbalists or physicians among the adventurers have advantage on the roll), this resembles a birth cordon that ties the baby and the mother together.</p><p>This cordon actually feeds the dragon beneath and it mostly devours on actual blood and essence of the city. Through its physical form, most of the dead in the city’s blood and essence is sucked into it and reaches directly to the dragon at the womb.</p><p>It is deep within the room, but when the adventurers reach the area behind the Blood of Basileus, they can attempt to actually wound or poison the dragon. If you deem appropriate, they can damage Whore of Babylon and the Womb this way (check out Act III: Little Death by the Paradise for Womb and the Whore of Babylon).</p></div>"

Very few Muslims or pilgrims in the city visit the place for namaz (prayer). No adhan is recited; it is forbidden by the city law. Only during the prayer can the lead imam recite the prayers. The imam is usually chosen by the cemaat (the current members of the community during the prayer) to lead the namaz.</p><p>Many Muslims perform their prayers in silence and without drawing any attention, as some eyes may be hostile towards them given the current situation of the Crusades. However, King Baldwin IV lets Muslims pilgrims enter the city and pray in peace.</p><p>If the adventurers have found the note, there are two men right at the small courtyard of the mosque, quietly sitting near the flowers and playing a game of backgammon. <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Sheref ad-Din</span> may be accompanied by Father Godfrey or another Chritsian priest of the city.

Father Godfrey may speak on their behalf. Sheref would explain his dreams as best as he can: A darkness gathers in Jerusalem. Beneath the earth, there’s a womb and a beating pulse. The pulse was weak but it is getting stronger by the day and there is a mother in the dream. A mother with a terrible purpose, but he is not sure what it is. Once belonged to the world for sure but became so distant over time, it is now otherworldly.</p><p>If the adventurers are focused on getting rid of that threat and would promise to work together, he could explain what a Satrap is.</p><p>Usually a man with a serene face, the imam of the mosque is a man named<span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\"> Jaffar (local priest, NG)</span>, born to a Crusader father and a Muslim mother. He was left in the streets and raised by the local thieves. He found his way to the mosque and found a Quran among the dirt and dust. He devoted himself to the reading and cleaning of the mosque.

When the door opens, read:</p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"centered\">One of the most ancient fears is assaulting all of your senses: the fear of falling. You feel as though you are walking on the edge of a cliff, with the painful winds gnawing at your skin and every survival instinct you possess. An old saying comes to mind: “Don't look down, so that you won't be afraid;” however, even if you don't look down, you can feel the depths gazing back at you. Your knees feel weak, as if they could give out at any moment. It's as if you're about to fall into an endless abyss, plummeting into your darkest nightmares. All these feelings are chasing you right now and are staring right at you from afar. A terrifying and utterly unnatural void stretches out in front of you, calling you towards the deepest depths of the nine hells.</p></div><p>The way to the second door is interrupted by a giant hole, a rift that leads to darkness. It leads to the Lullaby Palace and the adventurers’ first glimpse of the greater picture that surrounds Jerusalem. If desired, the adventurers can go around it.</p><p>The rift has a 20-foot radius, and even to the untrained eyes, it reeks of magic and seems to carry the essence of Al-Ghaib. A dark smoke rises from its edges, taking the shapes of humanoids and similar creatures. The creatures appear to be falling into the rift or slowly lying down near it as if falling asleep.</p><p>Apart from the rift, the room’s interior reminds one of an ancient religious site filled with archaic stones and intriguing shiny stones within solid natural walls. The second door seemingly doesn’t belong to this ancient sight, as it has a giant cross on it and a grand seal: the seal of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius. A [[/skill History 12]] check reveals this information for the players. If a player is proficient in Greek or Ancient Greek, the check is automatically successful, as the Emperor’s name can be read directly.</p><h3>The Rift</h3><p>With a [[/skill Arcana 10]] check, the adventurers may realize the rift reeks of conjuration magic and will likely travel to otherworldly places rather than below the earth. Its bottomless appearance is caused by magic. Better rolls may reveal further information:</p><table class=\"roll color-red\"><thead><tr><td><p>Roll Total</p></td><td><p>Information Revealed</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>The essence of the rift is not from Al-Ghaib; its nature reminds you of the pocket dimensions of powerful magicians and similar figures.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>This is raw magic.

They were like beauties trapped in that precise moment. The symbols, icons, and figures etched into the wall with tremendous passion symbolized an ancient victory, depicting the fall of a colossal titan. However, like the emperors whose names were cursed in Roman inscriptions, the fallen titan also resembles a pitch-black void. This time, the name was not cursed by those who came after; whoever carved those marks on the wall had depicted the fallen titan as a consuming darkness.</p></div><p>With a [[/skill History 10]] check, it is revealed that the ancient remains in the room are from the Achamanaeid period of Jerusalem, made in the name of the great emperor Cyrus the Great. It depicts a victory of Cyrus, seemingly against a dark foe. This fallen enemy’s face and identity is unclear, intentionally drawn without a face and form, only made of darkness that devours.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Note to the GM: </span>These carvings tell of the day that Cyrus the Great bound to Whore of Babylon beneath the city of Jerusalem.</p></div><p>Among some cracks in the wall there is a spell that was put there by Cyrus the Great to aid anyone with the correct motivations and power. Anyone touching a crack in the wall activates the spell, and its effect is determined randomly.</p><p>First, the creature that touches it must succeed on a [[/save 20 cha format=long]]. On a failed save, it can’t lie for the next 10 minutes. Then, a male’s voice, strong and deep, is heard in the Akkadian tongue: “What happens to the dragon?” Due to their sigil, the adventurers can understand it.</p><p>A [[/skill Insight 10]] or an Intelligence check reveals that the voice emphasized the word “dragon” as if it despised it. If the adventurers answer with the sentences below or with a close meaning, they will be granted a boon until they finish a long rest or the next dawn (whichever comes later). They can’t receive a boon again until two days have passed.

The massive cross above the door is engaged in a battle with all the deeply embedded evils gathered around it. Unfortunately, it is losing the battle. The seal is weak and getting weaker by the second. Three holes on the cross catch your eye, as if someone had been crucified there, and the marks of the nails remain.</p></div><p>The door has a magical seal on it, very much like the one Omar built on the first door, except it resembles a hole designed to bear a cross in it. The only thing that can disrupt it is the Blood of Basileus. It is located in an underground catacomb in the Byzantine Cardo neighborhood of the city (Check out the @UUID[.7LfdO7vF2j1nKOq7]{Dungeon: Legacy of the Basileus} section below for the dungeon that it is located in).</p><p>If the adventurers take advice from the King, he will easily make the connections between the Basileus and the possible Byzantine remains in the city, advising the adventurers to visit Byzantine Cardo.</p><h2>A Search in Byzantine Cardo</h2><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">For shops, stores, inns, and other points of interest in the street, check out <span class=\"weight600\">Jerusalem - The City of God</span> section in the Era of the Crusades.</p></div><p>With the resources of the King, the adventurers find a small obelisk left from the Byzantine era that carries a number of Greek letters. However, even for Greek speakers, the letters don’t mean anything and seem to be random. A [[/skill Arcana 10]] check also reveals that these letters, their meanings, and the way that they are read aloud are gibberish.</p><p>The meaning of the words when the puzzle is solved is: “Only the blood of the heir can reveal the blood of the emperor.” The emperor can be used as a synonym for a Basileus, as the Byzantine Emperors used the title Basileus. The heir of King Baldwin is Princess Sibylla, and her blood can open the door. (Check out the Dungeon: Legacy of the Basileus section below.)</p><h2>Order of Saint Lazarus</h2><p><span class=\"italic\">Supremus Ordo Sancti Lazari Hierosolymitani Sacri Romani Imperii</span></p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"centered\">Eyes shimmering with a spark of joie de vivre are visible only between tightly wrapped white bandages, complemented by armor adorned in green. This is how you recognize the knights of the Order of Saint Lazarus. Known for their never-removed bandages, their deadly silence, and equally lethal swords, they embody the unique pride of knighthood with their resilience, devotion, and strength. As silent oath-takers, they stand close to the royal family, protecting them from all dangers. They are always ready, both in their awareness and with their swords.</p></div><p>The Order of Saint Lazarus, also known as the Leper Brothers of Jerusalem, was founded in a leper hospital a few decades ago. The order’s main goal is to care for the people diagnosed with leprosy and research a cure for it. Their order became militaristic over time as their economy relied on donations, and war was the best income source.</p><p>The signature of this order is their green cross, and, most of the time, members wear bandages all over their bodies or at least the visible parts. Most of the newcomers and low-ranking members are allowed to show their skin, but those who reached knighthood or entered the order as knights must swear an oath to wear the bandages all the time, both to protect others from catching leprosy and as a symbol of unity, silence, precaution, and dedication.</p><p>The leader of the order is a middle-aged man called <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Lambertus of Martigues (Crusader Veteran</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span><span class=\"bold ha-red\">, LG, 19 Constitution, 17 Intelligence)</span>. He is a leper and his condition has greatly worsened (his Constitution score is normally 6), but he has a special item called <span class=\"italic\">Bandages of Lazarus</span>, made from fabrics imbued with a strong ritual. He offered the fabrics to King Baldwin when he learned about his leprosy, but the King refused, stating that Lambertus deserved the items because he served the realm.</p><div class=\"box-item rare\"><div><p class=\"title\">@UUID[Item.awLcB8SfaGEuRDE1]{Bandages of Lazarus}</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Wondrous item, rare, requires attunement</p></div><div><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"centered\">While attuned to these bandages, your Constitution score becomes 19 if it isn’t higher already. In addition, whenever you receive healing, you also regain hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.</p></div></div><p>Lambertus is a devoted Christian and a man who is curious about all manner of medicine and illnesses, especially leprosy. He constantly visits the city folk to diagnose early sightings of leprosy among them, intervening to take them into treatment quickly. He constantly works on herbs, plants, fungal life, arcane methods, and more in his studies. He is secretly in love with a beekeeper in the city, a woman named <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Giselda (Artisan</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span><span class=\"bold ha-red\">)</span>, but due to his leprosy, he never approaches her and only secretly helps her. Giselda’s small backyard in the city is on a desecrated site, which possibly lost its grace during the First Crusade. Due to the desecration, some spirits from nearby graveyards may linger and hurt civilians. Unbeknownst to most people, Lambertus spends one night each Sunday soothing the spirits around.</p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"centered\">Sir Lambertus is a good man and can be a possible ally for the adventurers if they act early against Princess Sibylla or Guy of Lusignan. If presented with solid proof, he can be persuaded to side with the adventurers.</p></div><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Richard Lighthand</span> (<span class=\"bold ha-red\">Crusader Priest</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span>) is the priest of the order and alongside performing his priesthood duties, he is also responsible for tending to the wounds of the knights. After losing his brother to leprosy as a young priest, he decided to be actively involved in helping people who suffer from the same affliction. Once he noticed he could do more than just pray, he felt enlightenment and joined the order to help more people.</p><p>Although he is in his thirties, most of the order look up to him for being wise, calm, and helpful. While many in the order cover their faces, whether it is due to their rank or deteriorating condition, Richard refuses to do so even if it means not rising in ranks. As he is looking over the sick, he claims this way is more peaceful and relatable for the patient because showing a face also shows what remains of humanity within them.</p><p>The young fighter <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Cain Ironlad</span><span class=\"dot-sup losangle ha-red\">q</span> (<span class=\"bold ha-red\">Crusader Champion</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span>), has a reputation for being the symbol of wrath inside the order. With his red dyed bandages inside his bulky armor, he is easily noticeable among others. While no brother-in-arms has yet beaten him in a fair fight, they like to challenge themselves from time to time, inviting Cain to a training duel. He covers every part of his skin, leaving only his eyes and mouth open, devoting himself completely to the order and the Leper King.</p><p>Cain carries a greatsword and states that it will be passed on to the knight who defeats him in a fair duel. Cain’s Greatsword is a two-handed weapon but can be held one-handed if the wielder meets or surpasses these prerequisites: 20 Strength and 16 Dexterity.</p><p>Cain is often used as the executioner inside the order and as the axeman regarding situations outside. Though knights in the order know they can trust Cain with their lives, they sometimes find his violent ways unnecessarily excessive. He frequently talks with the priest of the order Richard, and confesses his sins, asking guidance from him and forgiveness from the lord. He believes every man he kills makes him more of a sinner but thinks he is too far beyond to turn back and redeem his salvation.</p><h3>Features</h3><div class=\"p-no-margin\"><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Bandage of Saint:</span> While wearing these bandages, a member of the order's Constitution score becomes 15 if it isn't higher already.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Face of Leprosy:</span> People are afraid of those who are cursed with leprosy.

Each room represents an important place for the Roman Empire in general, taking into account the history from 753 BCE to c. 600 CE, as the Byzantine Empire (as Eastern Roman Empire, and after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the sole Roman Empire) is directly a continuation of the Roman Empire.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">Each room has a test of its own, but they are not mandatory, though completing them helps the party gain power through the dungeon and makes the final boss fight relatively easier. However, they must gather at least five magical items from each room and offer them in the Room of Mare Nostrum to advance into the final room, where Theodore, the brother of the emperor, awaits as the guardian of the Blood of Basileus.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Rot in the Dungeon: </span>Weapons and magic items found in the dungeon slowly rot away. There is no specific timeline, and it rots when the item or weapon leaves a room with an adventurer. If it is taken out from the dungeon, it will rot away. If the adventurers defeat Theodore, the rotting effect will be gone, and the items will be able to go beyond the dungeon, taken as rewards by the adventurers at your discretion, except for the Sword in the Stone. A [[/skill Arcana 10]] check made in each room reveals the item’s remaining time before rotting away.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">It is up to you to decide the lifespan of the items. The recommended method is once every two rooms, roll for a percentile dice.

She sincerely believes these tests are for adventurers and would like to see their quality.</p></div><p>While the adventurers are getting close, they see a faint figure walking in the distance. A knightly figure with old armor, possibly belonging to centuries ago, walking away from the adventurers, only his back is to be seen. They accidentally drop a <span class=\"italic\">Cold Iron Dagger </span>and walk away. The adventurers are expected to resist taking the <span class=\"italic\">Cold Iron Dagger</span> for themselves and give the item back to the knight.</p><p>This is the first test of the room: <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Honesty</span>.</p><p>If they follow the knight, they will encounter him in a state of meditation, sitting on the ground, concentrating inwards.

If he is harmed, the adventurers are considered to have failed and must battle the knight (you can use the Fallen Crusader<span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span> or Crusader Veteran<span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span> statblock). If they drop the item nearby for him to get it later, the knight will vanish into thin air with a smile on his face.</p><p>If the adventurers keep the <span class=\"italic\">Cold Iron Dagger</span> for themselves, they will be considered to have failed, and the forest around them will be caught in blazing and scorching flames suddenly appearing. At the start of each of their turns, the adventurers must succeed on a [[/save dex 13 format=long]] or take [[/damage 2d6 average=true]] damage.

Their colorful garments make you feel as if you're glimpsing a style from a very long time ago, more than just old clothes—especially the armor and swords, which suggest these newly appearing spirits are not from your time. Yet you feel you belong there.</p><p>Among the eyes that turn towards you, one is so noble that you have no doubt he is a king. Directly in front of him, you see a man bowed low to the ground, missing an arm. His words are the first you hear: “If need be, I will face trial by combat; I do not accept the accusations.”</p><p>Then, those noble eyes turn to you, and it's as if your clothes are perfectly appropriate for the setting, and you look as though you have been a part of this place for a long time, and his voice echoes in your heart:</p><p>“Then, who among you will be my champion?”</p></div><p>As the man is missing an arm and is only one person; thus, the adventurers are expected to choose one of them amongst themselves as the champion and fight him in an equal way. The way to equalize the combat can include one of the choices below or something entirely you deem appropriate:</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li>The champion uses their bad hand/only one hand, tying their other hand to their body.</li><li>Choosing a champion with a poor Strength score (less than 12) or with other disadvantages.</li><li>Giving the man a chance to strike first or give an obvious advantage.</li><li>The champion uses no weapons but lets the man equip a weapon for himself.</li><li>Anything that willingly puts the champion to attack with disadvantage or other penalties.</li><li>Giving the man a strong magic item and a mechanical help (like casting a beneficial spell, giving a class feature like bardic inspiration or the like) also works.</li></ul><p>If you want the fight to be serious, the man may use a CR 3 or similar humanoid’s statblock, such as a <span class=\"bold ha-red\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knight}</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-red\">j</span> or a <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Crusader Noble</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span>, but the test is not designed to put a trial on their abilities.</p><p>If adventurers prove their honor, the spirits will vanish immediately with an approving nod from the nobleman at the last second, leaving behind four @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.L887NdWEP5NqHCrQ]{potions of greater healing}. If needed, one of the spirits around them may give clues to the adventurers that fighting with full force against a man with one arm missing has no honor by directly stating it or implying it.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Trial of Valor</h4><p>In this trial, the courage of the adventurers is tested. There can be several ways:</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li>Putting them against an almost undefeatable monster in a hard situation, such as a <span class=\"bold ha-red\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.UFW8M3JHzHkxUEGM]{Mummy Lord}</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-red\">j</span> that is about to kill a helpless commoner. The adventurers are expected to try to save the commoner; they do not have to succeed. Cautious ways to distract the monster, such as using spells and similar solutions, can also be accepted as long as they try to save the helpless commoner.</li><li>Depending on the adventurers’ backgrounds, personal stories, classes, faiths, and other aspects, a source of fear could be introduced for each of them. For example, if there is a cleric in the party terrified of demons due to a massacre in their village, a demon could be put in front of them to test their valor.</li><li>They could be put in a position that would certainly end in death.</li><li>Causing them to make a [[/save wis 20 forma=long]] or a similarly hard position that would end in them being frightened, and they can be expected to fight nonetheless.</li></ul><p>If at least one of the adventurers proves they have valor, they pass the test and are immediately counted as if they had finished a long rest.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Trial of Loyalty</h4><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>Mists appear among the trees, and this time, it is not spirits but a dark figure that materializes before you, standing in front of a flowing waterfall. You are sure it is not alone there; indeed, its reflection in the water before it and from the waterfall moves differently from the dark figure, as if it has its own will and presence. The reflection in the puddle speaks, and you can see its face: a witch from your mothers’ tales and your deepest nightmares. The ones that make the dreams come true and seal the fates of time.</p><p>“Rí Deircc stands as our witness; our words bind the fates. Speak, reveal the yearnings of your heart. What you voice, so shall be wrought.”</p></div><p>The three witches appear as if they are actually there, and not like the way spiritual knights and nobles appeared.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">Ri Diercc means Red King in Middle Irish. Characters that are proficient with similar tongues or with a background close to Irish lands may learn the phrases’ meaning with a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. Red King is a Scottish king named Macbethad mac Findláech, an eventual inspiration for the famous main character of William Shakespeare’s Tragedy of Macbeth centuries later.</p></div><p>The adventurers must be tested with their greatest temptations. The witches will offer them their wildest dreams and will act like their arrival is not about the dungeon’s magic or whatever is going on here. They are truly here to grant them whatever the characters desire.</p><p>However, a [[/skill arcana 20]] or [[/skill Insight 20]] check will reveal that the three witches are part of this dungeon as well and are only trying to fool them. The party can be tempted to stray from their path, abandon their loyalty to a person, a country, an ideal, or something similar:</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li>Wealth &amp; Treasure: Witches offer a substantial amount of gold, magical items, or rare artifacts.</li><li>Power &amp; Authority: Witches promise a position of power, such as becoming a lord, a high-ranking officer, or a recognized hero.</li><li>Immunity: Assuring any crime or act that is considered illegal will have no consequence for them anymore.</li><li>Revenge or Justice: Witches offer instant revenge by giving them the chance to punish an ally who has wronged them or someone else in the past.</li><li>Knowledge &amp; Secrets: Offer forbidden or hidden knowledge that a character deeply desires.</li><li>Love or Affection: Witches can use an adventurer’s romantic desires by offering the affection or attention of a person they have feelings for.</li><li>Restoration or Healing: Witches promise to provide a rare opportunity for healing a grievous wound, curing a disease, or even bringing a loved one back from the dead as a reward for disloyalty.</li><li>Fame and Glory: Witches offer the chance to be celebrated as a hero in songs and stories, and become mythical heroes.</li><li>Salvation or Redemption: Witches offer a chance at redemption for past misdeeds or a guarantee of salvation in the face of eternal damnation, which hinges on betraying someone’s trust.</li></ul><p>If the adventurers refuse the witch, they are counted as successful. If needed, witches may perform illusions or similar magical ways to trick the adventurers. The DC for realizing the fraud is 15. If they accept an offer, the witches will laugh and disappear, leaving behind a magical item proper to their promise but dripping with satire and irony. For example, if they need it for healing, they could simply give a <span class=\"italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{potion of healing}</span>; for revenge, a <span class=\"italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.tEWhsb2lYF4uvF0z]{+1 arrow}</span>; for love or affection, a <span class=\"italic\">friends</span> cantrip scroll; for fame and glory, a <span class=\"italic\">silvered dagger</span>; for knowledge and secrets, a letter written in Latin that appears to be from Judas, telling the hiding place of Jesus of Nazareth (a magical paper that has immunity against fire and rot) or something similar.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Conclusion</h4><p>If the adventurers are successful on all trials, the spectral hand will be removed from the sword, and they will be able to pull it from the stone and the exit reveals itself. For the exit to reveal itself, the adventurers can simply wish to exit the room and the door still opens.</p><div class=\"box-item legendary\"><div><p class=\"title\">@UUID[Item.BfaQYoKAIIfldkG9]{Sword in the Stone}</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Weapon (longsword), legendary, requires attunement</p></div><div><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>When you hit a creature with this sword, you can force it to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

The legionaries must retrieve the eagle standard, <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Aquila</span>.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">If the princess is with the adventurers, she may give general information on the Roman Empire and Caesar’s conquest and how Aquila is a very important and even religious item in Roman society.

He does not need a statblock because he is not technically there. He can’t be touched, harmed, or targeted by spells or other effects.

The cross looks so old that it's hard to understand how time has not taken it away.</p><p>The man by the strait turns to you and smiles: “It seems we have at least a few minutes, don’t we?”</p></div><p>The man is Constantine the Great. He welcomes the adventurers and has a few words with them while explaining the danger ahead:</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li>The bound man is the guardian of the cross. He has immunity against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage types. He is very hard to hurt. However, before crossing, they have time to choose a relic from the strait.</li><li>If activated, the cross shrinks to a tiny cross that can be worn as a necklace or held safely in a pocket.</li><li>The bound man is the brother of Emperor Heraclius, Theodore. He was brutally wounded in Damascus while defending against the advancing Muslim forces and believed to be dead. However, Heraclius couldn't let his brother die, brought him here and bound his soul to defend this place. The bound nature of his situation made him brutal and angry. He will not show mercy.</li></ul><p>If they choose the future, read:</p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>First, your attention is drawn to an angry man chained to a large cross on the opposite side. Wrapped in numerous chains like a demon bound to the earth, his eyes are not even visible. Then, on this side of the strait, you see a man wearing a turban and Eastern garments that do not feel specific to this era or the past. The man has a prominent nose and black hair, a curved sword hanging at his waist, and he smiles upon seeing you.</p><p>\"Welcome to Konstantiniyye!”</p><p>The word 'Konstantiniyye' catches you off guard. It means the city of Constantine, for sure, but he said it with a touch of the Levant.</p></div><p>This man, Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottomans, will be the conqueror of Constantinople in 1453 CE. The emperor of a yet unexisting empire. He’d love to hear about the adventurers’ lives, especially any stories of Saladin. Seemingly, Mehmed sees himself as an heir of Saladin’s deeds and wants to make sure that he will conquer Jerusalem, no matter what. However, he is reluctant to share some details about Baldwin and his time of death, stating that it is unclear. A DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that Mehmed respects Baldwin, and is sad about the talks of his death, pointing out the possibility that he will not live that long.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">The princess will be very interested and insist on learning the fate of the future, especially the kingdom and her brother. However, Mehmed’s vague answers will upset her dearly.</p></div><p>Mehmed will also express the dangers ahead and warn them of one final thing: “Your journey at the end, towards the unknown and unfamiliar, the Ruya (dream for Arabic) may need your sacrifices.”</p><p>The strait has four spell scrolls:</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li><span class=\"italic\">Scorching Ray</span></li><li><span class=\"italic\">Shatter</span></li><li><span class=\"italic\">Slow</span></li><li><span class=\"italic\">Mass Healing Word</span></li></ul><p>After one of the spell scrolls is taken, Theodore’s chains will shatter and free him, thus engaging in battle.

The rust from the nails used to pierce hands and the holes they made remain as well.

When they arrive, they stumble upon a council meeting on the news of Saracen movements in the border towns and cities. There is troubling news that Saladin is gathering his armies and the peace is threatened. The adventurers will be introduced as “bodyguards” if necessary but will not draw any attention as the nobles and commanders are very much worried about the developments.</p><p>A few moments later, Guy of Lusignan enters the courtyard:</p><div class=\"box-description\"><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/seal-1-true-cross.webp\" style=\"width:58%;shape-outside:url(modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/seal-1-true-cross.webp);shape-margin:5px;margin-left:5px;float:right\" /><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><p>The sound of footsteps echoes on the marble floor, cutting through conversations as dozens of men march. All eyes focus on one figure: a man as graceful as the moon and sun, whose confident steps seem to claim the land of Jerusalem itself, inviting the entire kingdom to submit to his power and elegance. His sky-blue eyes are as bright as a sunlit day, piercing through the nobles and commanders with his furrowed brows, as if his gaze alone could penetrate their armor.</p><p>Standing before you is Guy of Lusignan: exuding a refined power, a noble posture, and eyes as sharp as a hawk's. His armor bears traces of blood, clearly not his own.</p><p>What stands out most prominently is the three heads he holds in his hand. He lifts them high with pride and almost spitefully addresses all the nobles, starting to speak with a voice as smooth as the finest silk yet as scorching as a midsummer day: “Spies of Saladin! Right under our noses! Are we still going to discuss what is to be done here like worried old men, or are we going to act against the enemies that surround us?”</p></div><p>The three heads were recently cut from their bodies, and their expression is horrible. Most of the crowd reacts with uncomfortable faces and troubled voices. Some of the nobles openly state their discomfort by questioning Sir Guy about his intentions.</p><p>Before events lead to discourse among nobles, the king intervenes and silences both parties, declaring that Guy’s service means a lot and that he’d like to see the evidence of these men’s treachery.</p><p>One of the heads belonged to <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Sheref ad-Din (Scholar of Cairo</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span><span class=\"bold ha-red\">)</span>, and if adventurers missed him in the Act I, this information is important: he was actually a <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Satrap</span>: In the world of Historica Arcanum, a satrap is a dedicated protector of the world who is dealing with otherworldly dangers and eldritch horrors with the ability to banish them from this world. Satraps are heavily detailed and examined in <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Empires of the Silk Road</span> and <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Herald of Rain</span>; for further information, the <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Characters</span> section in HoR may be checked, as many satraps are introduced, and the main antagonist of the story actively hunts down satraps: prominent satraps from that from that book are <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Al-Istakhri</span>, <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Yaqut al-Hamawi</span>, <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Caliph Al-Zahir</span>, <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Hayat-Jawhar Khatun</span> and one of the mightiest satraps, <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Rumi</span>.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered weight600\">If your story consists of Satraps, all have the following features:</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Otherworldly Calling.</span> The satrap is sensitive to otherworldly events and receives dreams as a warning and a call to action if a strong influence from other worlds exists nearby. The satrap also learns the location of otherworldly interference with the material world.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Ritual of the Thousand Nights.</span> The satrap can spend 10 minutes to close a rift, portal, or a similar influence from other planes of existence by maintaining concentration for a full duration (as if concentrating on a spell). The satrap must be able to speak and see the otherworldly presences and must not be incapacitated. If the concentration is not broken for the whole period, the portal closes, and all magic, depending on its existence, ends. Additionally, the satrap may target a creature that does not belong in the material world and use an action in an attempt to banish it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is banished to its original plane of existence and won’t be able to return to the material world for one year and one day. On a success, it takes 27 (6d8) psychic damage that cannot be reduced in any way.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Wisdom of the Otherworlds. </span>The satrap’s Wisdom score is 21 if it was lower before becoming a satrap.</p></div><p>If the adventurers didn’t meet him before these pieces of information may be important: Sheref ad-Din came to Jerusalem as he sensed the rise of the dragon and the ascension of Whore of Babylon. However, Guy of Lusignan and Sibylla of Jerusalem discovered his presence and acted before him. A satrap is powerful against otherworldly entities and events, but he was ambushed by Guy’s loyal soldiers, without any otherworldly interference. Guy rapidly killed him and his two aides and placed false evidence as if they were Saladin’s spies.</p><p>Before the matters can be handled with delicate care, a herald rushes in and declares an important event:</p><p>Saladin is on the move to <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Kerak Castle </span>with a significant force, at least ten thousand strong.</p><p>The king assesses the situation and decides on war. With the excitement spreading in the courtyard, he signals Balian to give the adventurers this message: “Before our departure to Kerak, investigate the men killed. Guy is not honest about this. Go to The Archbishop tavern and see Oswald; he might have heard something from the street.”</p><p>Guy won’t let anyone touch or examine the heads, but a look from afar may be successful in detecting an important clue: With a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, one of the heads is revealed to bear a marking, a tattoo that seemingly exceeds the head and would continue towards the body from the neck. If the body is found, valuable information can be gained.</p><h3>On the Trail</h3><p>Adventurers visiting “<span class=\"bold ha-red\">The Archbishop</span>” are greeted by one of the residents. For more info about the tavern, check out the <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Jerusalem - The City of God</span> section in the <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Era of the Crusades</span>. Residents state that Oswald (<span class=\"bold ha-red\">Local Priest</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span>) just left for a stroll in the Byzantine Cardo, and the adventurers can find him or wait for him inside the tavern.</p><p>In a case where adventurers wait for his return, Oswald doesn’t take too long to come back. Hearing the adventurers coming along with regards from Balian, he tells them he was taking a walk to speak with his connections and heard about shady business happening around the butcher shop. If the adventurers want to learn more details about this butcher shop, Oswald tells them he usually avoids visiting there because he dislikes the taste of its meat, but advises visiting the beggar on the street, claiming he should know more about the situation.</p><p>The informant who gave this information to Oswald is a half-crazy beggar named <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Pierre</span> (<span class=\"bold ha-red\">Commoner</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-red\">j</span>). He usually sits around the Byzantine Cardo and is known by the locals. If adventurers go after Oswald while he is on the walk, they encounter him as he is paying Pierre a visit and chatting with him. When talked with, Pierre informs adventurers about a shady business occurring behind the butcher shop “The Cleaver” the night before. He says he saw two figures make some kind of agreement, one looking like a thin figure while the other looks bulkier. “After some talking, they shook hands and exchanged something like a body, dragging it between them.” If Sir Claude isn’t decapitated before this moment, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the description of the bulkier man closely resembles Sir Claude.</p><p>Adventurers visiting “<span class=\"bold ha-red\">The Cleaver</span>” during the daytime are greeted by <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Willa </span>(<span class=\"bold ha-red\">Acolyte</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-red\">j</span>) at the shop. While she is greeting them inside, <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Isabel</span> (<span class=\"bold ha-red\">Handmaiden of Jahi</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-red\">h</span>) steps out from the door behind the counter to speak to Willa. For more info about “<span class=\"bold ha-red\">The Cleaver</span>,” check out<span class=\"bold ha-red\"> Jerusalem - The City of God </span>section in the <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Era of the Crusades</span>. On a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check or with a DC 13 Passive Perception, adventurers notice a glimpse of the room inside as Isabel leaves and see remains of humanoid body parts. Surprised by the company of the adventurers, instead of speaking, Isabel takes a cleaver hanging from the wall and returns to the room in the back. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that she was disturbed by the unexpected company. If the adventurers consume any products from the place after seeing these body parts, they must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, or they will gain 1 level of exhaustion due to vomiting. The residents of this shop secretly conduct various rituals inside the backroom using humanoid body parts and would fight those who might intervene.</p><p>During the nighttime, the store must be entered illicitly. The adventurers must make a DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to unlock either the back or front door of the shop. The locks aren’t sturdy, but attempting to force them open in a brutal manner, such as by breaking them, would make enough noise to draw attention if they fail to succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed save, if he hasn’t been decapitated before, Sir Claude sneaks up on the adventurers when they start investigating the body inside, initiating combat.</p><p>Inside “The Cleaver” there are two rooms. The front door opens to the main entrance, where a counter stained with blood stands alongside knives and cleavers hanging from the wall. Behind this counter, there is a door that opens to the backroom and it isn’t locked. This backroom is also reachable from the rear entrance, and it is the place where the tattooed body lies naked on a table. On the other side of the room, a second table displays the diseased Satrap’s belongings and his severed hand. Upon investigation, a chess piece and an unfinished letter stand out on the table besides his daily wear. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (History) check reveals that carrying a chess piece indicates that this man was actually a Satrap.</p><p>The unfinished letter follows:</p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>“Peace be unto you, Saladin.

As I was pursuing the source of this matter to end it, I noticed some knights inside the city may be upon me, not wanting me to dig into this unholy subject…”</p></div><p>The letter is signed as “Sheref ad-Din,” but most of the page still remains empty. This letter indicates that these Satraps weren’t against the Crusaders and was against the dark forces.</p></div>"

The gates groaned open, revealing the host of Baldwin IV's loyal soldiers, a sight that could stir the soul of any beholder. Clad in burnished armor that caught the first light of the sun, the soldiers moved as one strong and proud entity, their determination palpable in the air could be felt from afar, perhaps enough to unsettle Saladin’s heart once more.</p><p>When you set out to leave the city, the silver sea called the Crusader Army marches before your eyes toward the city’s exit. It resembles an endless silver sea with an unforgivable storm, shining under the scorching dawn with bravery and devotion. Each soldier leaving the city gates behind knows they may not be back and see their city again.</p><p>As the spearhead, Baldwin IV rode with the might of a king, Godfrey’s descendent and a pillar of courage. His presence ignited the knights' and foot soldiers' hearts and stirred their souls, turning their fears into a fierce resolve.

Their fight against the strong wind proved their determination to everyone, ending the silent prayers that filled the hearts and mouths of soldiers and civilians watching them leave the city.

Would the evil lurking beneath the earth triumph because of a handful of warmongers? How would they describe this day in the future, looking back at the honorable confrontation of two men? Was this the unleashing of hell and the herald of doom?</p><p>The horns of Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub, the Sultan of Syria and Egypt, had not sounded so defiant and furious for a long time.

              "text": "<div id=\"ha-soj\"><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">In this scene, King Baldwin does not expect the adventurers to listen to the conversation between the king and the sultan. The sultan will use telepathic bond spells to prevent this. However, if you wish for the characters to hear what they say, you can ignore this and let them hear. It was a narrative choice to keep the Sultan’s and King’s conversation more mysterious.</p></div><p>King Baldwin would like to meet with Saladin; thus, he sends envoys to declare this. He may choose one of the adventurers for this mission. Saladin will accept the meeting, and eventually, two great kings will slowly ride towards each other, alone and out of earshot. Baldwin himself will personally order or advise (depending on how they would react) the adventurers not to listen to the conversation between him and Saladin. If he must, he will phrase this as the last wish of a dying man.</p><div class=\"box-description\"><p>Now, there, the two most powerful men of the Holy Lands converse with each other, deciding the fates of thousands… or tens of thousands. With two words coming out of their lips, they could change the known world forever.</p><p>Both of them are aware of this sorrowful reality. You sense the weight of their crowns. The gold must be cold and heavy on the head. Both kings know this better than anyone, and they have nothing else to do but accept their duty. The crown may have chosen them, or they may have taken the crown for themselves, but it won’t matter in the end: They will decide how the future generations will remember them. Which bards will sing about them? Which poets will make them immortal in their words? Or is there someone in the future making stories about them, crafting their legends for generations to come? You’ll never know, but you have a feeling that history will never forget these men.</p></div><p>King Baldwin and Sultan Saladin will speak about these subjects:</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li>The unforgivable crime Raynald of Chatillon committed: Baldwin will personally apologize about that and ensure that if Saladin hadn’t come here, he would have himself and punished Raynald.</li><li>The war negotiation: Baldwin will ask Saladin to retreat and wants to secure the continuation of their truce. He suspects Raynald has darker intentions and Baldwin is intended to find out.</li><li>The remaining life: Baldwin admits that he is at his limits, coming to an end of his journeys. The excavation in the Church of Resurrection probably won’t yield a cure for leprosy. He will also thank Saladin for his guidance on the seals and the little hope he had for a cure.</li><li>The Cylinder of Cyrus: Saladin will inform Baldwin that Ismail Al-Jazari knows where the last seal is. He is about to obtain it.</li><li>The adventurers: Baldwin will describe the adventurers and their personalities. He will inform Saladin that they could be of use, and if they ever travel to Cairo, they should be accepted as guests. If the adventurers have a good relationship with the king and mostly act towards his desires and the general good of the realm; he would speak highly of them and assure Saladin that they can be trusted.</li><li>And any other topic you’d like included.</li></ul><p>Saladin agrees to withdraw his armies, and Baldwin enters the castle with dozens of Crusaders at his side.</p><div class=\"box-description\"><p>Raynald of Chatillon has already arranged a welcome party. However, you are not sure whether all this fuss is out of respect or includes heavy mockery. Raynald forces his hand, it seems. The colors are too much, almost all of the castle is there at the courtyard, ordered to be there. The king senses Raynald's intentions and recognizes how he's becoming too much for all of this.</p><p>Raynald bows all the way to the ground, his forehead almost touching it. He welcomes the king with all his titles and more, overdoing every step, showing too much respect and being everything he is not. The King dismounts from his horse and refuses all the help he was offered. He walks by himself. Your eyes are trained and experienced, you notice his fragility, his vanishing health and his diminishing flame within. He approaches the beast in front of him. He realizes the charade; perhaps all of Kerak and the Holy Lands know it. Everyone knows Raynald’s intentions, or at least they do not disturb the king’s walk with their doubts and opinions.</p><p>But you know.</p><p>Each step taken by the king is filled with agony. He hides it well, maybe too well. His grace is on the edge, about to vanquish. His temper is at the limits, even rivaling the scorching sun in the sky. His pain is unbearable, but it’s not just his leprosy. He feels the upcoming doom in his bones, but as the man who’s done everything to protect the kingdom, he is about to fail.</p><p>When Raynald’s words are over, the silence becomes so thick that when the king removes his glove, even the farthest soldier knows what is going on. The slap on Raynald’s face is so hard that one could think thunder had struck from the skies, as if God himself were angry at the lord of Kerak, the beast within the kingdom.</p><p>Raynald laughs. He enjoyed the pain and he is used to his blood spilling. You are now sure: He attacked the Mother’s Hand. He killed Yakup, and he is indeed the carrier of that sigil. You feel your sigil’s anticipation, eagerness. It wants to be the one that attacks Raynald.</p><p>When Raynald laughs, the king becomes angrier. He strikes and strikes. There is no magic, nothing arcane or mysterious about it. It is all on sight and real. The blood of Raynald sows the soil, and while he enjoys it, the King delves deep and finds the mark of the sigil himself.</p></div><p>After the events are over, Raynald stops all the laughter, and King Baldwin turns to head back to Jerusalem, without saying a word. All the men turn with him, and most of them are relieved: they can go back to Jerusalem safe and sound. While the host prepares to head out, the king will send this message:</p><div class=\"box-description\"><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/man-on-horse.webp\" style=\"shape-outside:url(modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/man-on-horse.webp);margin-left:-73px;shape-margin:6px;float:left\" /><p>“He carries a sigil. Kill him. This may be the last time we see each other. I bid you farewell and good fortune in your tomorrows to come. I’ve fulfilled my duty as best as I can. Now, it is time for you to bear the burden, I’m afraid. Wait until nightfall; wait outside the castle at the hill with the ancient bell; an old friend will show you the way in.”</p></div><p>The king then will leave with his army and return to Jerusalem. The castle will be locked down, and Raynald will be taken with six <span class=\"bold ha-red\">brute knights of the Wolf Sigil</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span> to the infirmary, to have his wounds checked. Raynald will be surveilled at all costs, with many men standing guard for him. It is advised to deter the adventurers from attacking Raynald without the <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Hill with the Ancient Bell</span> section first.</p></div>"

The winds of the night salute your coming, and old memories of the ruins still mourn for what they have lost. You suddenly realize they are not mourning for themselves or their losses that belong to an ancient time; they keep company with a man in sorrow.</p><p>The bell is rusty, almost living its last moments. It is surprising that it survived this long against bitter times and cruel winds. A man in a white robe, dressed like a pilgrim, takes your attention right away. You can feel his sorrow. The ruins are his companion tonight, with all the ones that they lost, buried, only they could understand his pain.</p><p>When your eyes adjust to the approaching dusk, you realize this man is none other than the Sultan. Him. Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub. The one that inherited a holy dream from earlier sultans, earlier custodians of the two mosques. The man carries the legacy of Omar, Suleyman Abd al-Malik, Harun al-Rashid, Mahmud Ghaznavi, Toghrul of Seljuk, the great Sultan Malik-shah, Nizam al-Mulk, and Muhammad Tapar: The dream of the unity of all Muslims.</p><p>“Es salamu alaikuma.” He regards you with the iconic greeting of Muslims that offer their safety to others, meaning, “Peace be upon you.”</p></div><p>The proper response to this phrase is widely known as “Wa Alaikuma es-salam.” Saladin used the plural version of the phrase. He stands up and closely inspects the adventurers, as the adventurers may notice he wears the colors of sorrow while the sultan is making sure they fit the description given by the king. If you desire, you can apply proper questions to this moment related to the adventurers’ backgrounds, personalities, or special moments with the king. For example, one of the adventurers may have adopted a nickname, and Saladin could ask about that to be certain they are the adventurers sent by the king.</p><p>The king is open to conservation and could spare a good deal of time if the adventurers wish it. Other than that, he wishes to speak his mind:</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li>Raynald stole an item of importance from Saladin’s sister after the murder. Saladin’s main goals are to retrieve the item from Raynald and have his head.</li><li>He knows an entrance to the castle; his engineers found it through some old plans of the building, and he intended to use it if Baldwin didn’t arrive.</li><li>He has a way to draw Raynald to the hidden entrance’s tunnels, alone. He can be considered invulnerable in that castle with so many sigil knights around him. He needs to be lured in.</li><li>Saladin has two conditions to show the adventurers the way and lure Raynald in: the item he stole and his head. The latter can be negotiable, but the first condition isn’t.</li><li>The item that belongs to Saladin’s sister is <span class=\"italic\">Scheherazade’s Mirror</span>. It is a powerful magic item and has sentimental value to the Sultan. Raynald does not know its command word.</li><li>Saladin can offer the adventurers many rewards: coins beyond measure, making them emirs, beys, or nobles of the sultanate if they are of Turkish, Arabic, or a similar Muslim origin; a religious title if they are on a religious path or can harness divine powers; a position in his council of warlords; a place at his right hand; manors on beautiful soils; fertile lands to build their houses; and anything within his power, if he sees potential in them and you deem that they are on favorable terms. It’s important to remember that he is the wealthiest and one of the two strongest men in the Holy Lands. He can offer many things based on the adventurers’ backgrounds or personal desires and goals, such as if one of them wishes to open an orphanage in Damascus to honor their mentor, he can grant it. If they want to find a particular person related to their story, he can make sure it happens. If one wants to own a ship and sail to the Indian Ocean, he can buy one and find the men to sail it.</li><li>Maybe the most important topic: he knows where the last seal is. He is aware of the dangers that lay under Jerusalem. <span class=\"italic\">Do they really think he only wants to take the city to become a conqueror? </span>He studied in Baghdad; he saw how an otherworldly threat was properly bound (check out <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Herald of Rain’s Act IV </span>for more details in this subject). So in comparison, the seals are weak in Jerusalem, and whatever lies there is making them weaker by the day. So after Raynald dies, they are invited to Cairo, where his most trusted advisor, <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Ismail Al-Jazari</span>, already has put the item needed to break the last seal, in its place.</li><li>If they accept, Saladin will give them a magical totem, which will lead them to the hidden entrance, guarded by magic.</li><li>If the adventurers mention the dead satrap in Jerusalem, he will admit it may be his fault, because he thought their power could prevent the coming of evil. However, he failed to protect them. He will explain what a satrap is and their place in the world. The closest satrap is probably far away.</li></ul><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">The sultan guesses that the seal has been taken to the Pyramid of Khufu, the safest place it can be. This part is true. However, unbeknownst to him, Al-Jazari offered himself in exchange for the seal, and he is with Peter the Hermit at the Library Pageless. Peter the Hermit took the seal long ago, as it was the only one that wasn’t in Jerusalem already.</p></div><div class=\"box-item rare\"><div><p class=\"title\">Scheherazade’s Mirror</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Wondrous item, rare</p></div><div><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"centered\">This magic mirror’s back is made of jade and gold.

Now, it stands broken, yet the Dead Sea quietly mourns it.</p><p>As you draw closer to the city, your steps seem to take you backward. The closed sky refuses to explain what has happened, and you approach the gates without seeing a single person on the road.</p><p>Your ears do not hear the ringing bells; your eyes do not want to see the flags draped in black cloth. Rain falls no longer from the sky but from the eyes of the people in the city. Grief and pain are now Jerusalem’s fate, and it is not just stepping but even breathing that has become too difficult for the city's residents.</p><p>For the king is dead.</p><p>Will the new king live long?</p></div><p>When the adventurers reach the city, they are immediately summoned to the Temple Mount, the heart of the royal court, to a very important meeting. They hear that Princess Sibylla will be crowned queen, and on a more sorrowful note: the boy, her child, Baldwin V, was also found dead in his bed this morning. The city is in a state of absolute devastation and almost everyone mourns deeply for the king and the very young prince.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">The death of the young prince is a lie conducted by Sibylla to crown Guy of Lusignan and rule as the sole leaders of Jerusalem. Sibylla has other plans for her boy.</p></div><p>These events will occur:</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li>At the Temple Mount, the adventurers will realize the intensity between the Knights of Lazarus and the guards under the command of Balian. The city is very tense and the tensions are rising between the parties.</li><li>Sibylla is crowned queen and is about to announce Guy as king. When the adventurers arrive at the courtyard, they may coincide with the coronation or the aftermath.</li><li>The queen knows and expects the adventurers’ arrival and has already convinced Guy that the adventurers should be killed.</li></ul><div class=\"box-description\"><p>The courtyard has more tension than the eve of a pitched battle. The fields of Kerak Castle didn’t have this enmity floating in the air between the two parties. This is not the Jerusalem you know. Brothers in arms, comrades that fought shoulder to shoulder, now standing against each other with hateful eyes. What happened here after the king died? Was he the only one who stood between them and the slaying of their kin and comrades?</p><p>Where was the queen? Right under the sky of Jerusalem, boldly spitting on his brother’s legacy. Rather than a mourning sister, you see a face without emotions, a mother without a child, a sister without a sibling, a queen without the bearings of the duty.</p><p>The phoenix spoke instead of her like she was never there. Away, distant.</p><p>“Here come the traitors,” Guy says without raising his voice. The courtyard is so silent that his whispered phrase reached all ears. There are no lies in it. He indeed thinks you are traitors. Traitors to the mother. You are in the way.</p><p>“You will pay.”</p><p>Without any warning, without any sign, you look to your queen. She only looks away. She remains indifferent.</p></div><p>While many of the sigil knights plan to escort Guy, Balian of Ibelin uses his loyal guards to stop the attacking mob. The adventurers are only confronted with Guy of Lusignan. This is their moment to face him. They may flee or try to change the situation. Balian will advise by shouting that they should flee as soon as possible.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">After Guy initiates the attack, it is advised to retire the queen from the line of sight. She expects the adventurers to be taken out by Guy of Lusignan, and she will prepare for the ritual to happen in a fortnight and five days.</p></div><p>Guy will take the matter into his own hands to take down the adventurers while frequently asking, “Where is the White Book?” Unbeknownst to Guy, the book in the king's possession was given to Mother Queen Agnes of Courteney. Guy may even lose an opportunity to kill or wound an adventurer in order to get an answer.</p><p>If Guy falls quickly, Balian will explicitly urge the adventurers to flee. If the adventurers try to attack the queen, use any number of Crusaders as needed.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Possible Conclusions</h4><ul class=\"moon\"><li>Guy is dead, and the adventurers escape successfully.</li><li>Guy is dead, but the adventurers are captured. Balian escapes the scene and attempts to save the adventurers. However, with the powers of a Level 6 party, the adventurers are expected to easily break free from the city.</li><li>Balian risks his life in order to save the adventurers and make sure they escape.</li></ul><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">Due to his interruption in catching the adventurers, Balian of Ibelin is thrown into jail and most of his force is scattered, killed, or sent into exile in one way or another. Most of the men are forced to escape.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">While Saladin comes to conquer the city with a great army, the knights and most capable warriors in the city are sent to fight off Saladin by the orders of the queen in the historical climax of the <span class=\"weight600\">Battle of Hattin</span>. Sibylla is planning to delay the arrival of Saladin and wants the enemy to be met away from the city while the return of the Whore of Babylon is ensured. However, this proves futile as Saladin wins an epic victory in Hattin and lays siege to Jerusalem.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">When the army is away from Jerusalem, the city is left defenseless while the princess is under the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; Balian is rescued from the prisons by civilians and takes control of the defenses of the city.</p></div><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/necklace.webp\" style=\"margin-top:-70px\" /></div>"

He never trusted Guy (disguised as Raymond of Saint-Gilles during the First Crusade) when the city was conquered and never shared this information. However, he took notice of the sigils and their marks. Later on, he carefully investigated the matter, but he died a year after.

You see only golden armor stretching from the city walls for an impossible amount. How many soldiers are there?</p></div><p>In Cairo, the adventurers are welcomed into the city and are greeted by Saladin’s men at the gates.

If at least one of the adventurers has proficiency with a musical instrument, they should be fine; if they are not, he can recommend a palace musician: a woman named <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Farah Layla (Traveling Artist</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span><span class=\"bold ha-red\">)</span> can be of assistance.</li><li>The automaton that carried the item here was placed in an unfortunate place: At the heart of the Pyramid Khufu.

They should help them around the city.</li><li>If you wish, you could enforce a time restraint on the characters: Saladin guesses that they have only five days that could be spent in the city. With the week they spend on the way, it could be too late to approach later than that. They will find a city in ruins, nevertheless. Either the evil lurks beneath will have won or Saladin. While phrasing this, Saladin’s face becomes very strict and dark, as he implies that his conquest will have many bloody consequences. If you choose to put a time limit, it is twelve days total, starting from now.</li></ul><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>Farah Layla was born in Damascus. Her father was a skilled musician and spent his years trying to find “the lady of the olives,” a local legend in Syria. By the age of six, Farah was already a skillful musician and gifted at story-telling by instantly memorizing the stories told by others and especially her mother: Havva (meaning Eve). Havva was a tutor at the Zengid palace and a personal close friend of Nur ad-Din Zengi.</p><p>Her father left one day and never returned. Farah always felt responsible because she brought up a story from a foreigner about a lady who lived in the Nile. She thought that’s why her father left and never returned. When her mother died of a plague, Farah was already mesmerized by the stories that were told about Saladin and his rule. Nur ad-Din’s dream lived through him. On a day of destiny, while Saladin laid siege against the Hashashins in Syria, Farah caught a spy among them and reported this to Saladin. Even though the spy was a close advisor to the sultan, Farah used her powers to make him tell the truth, and she became a part of the court ever since.</p><p>With a spirit as free as her music, Farah is warm and charismatic, always eager to share her art or a good tale. Yet she harbors a longing for the deeper mysteries of the world, which fuels her travels and enriches her performances, giving each a unique glimpse into the heart of the lands she visits. She dreams of finding her father and the lady of the olives.</p><p>The legend of the Lady of the Olives can be concluded in the Pyramid of Khufu, as a celestial being captured in the Nile is a source of the tale.</p></div><p>Saladin mentions a bloody outcome due to the ritual of sealing. In his days as a talebe (the one who demands knowledge) in Baghdad, he came across a way to bind powerful creatures while they enter the world. However, it requires a heavy blood sacrifice, and Saladin is sure that if no one intervenes, the other way will cost the world something greater: darkness without end.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\"><span class=\"weight600\">Historical Note:</span> Saladin will meet with the army of Jerusalem in the Battle of Hattin.

Even though you came from Jerusalem, you realize this was here long before the divinity you’ve seen in Jerusalem. Before Moses split the Dead Sea in two, before Jesus of Nazareth ascended, before Prophet Muhammad united the Arabian Peninsula… Egypt stood with a thousand gods at its peak. Still, their monuments defy time and bitter winds.</p></div><p>Close to the pyramids lies the Great Sphinx, recently excavated by Al-Jazari’s engineers and students at the Al-Azhar University. For further information about Al-Azhar University and its teachers, students, and stories, check out <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Cairo - Jewel of the Nile</span> section in <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Era of the Crusades</span>.</p><p>The excavation site in the Great Sphinx is led by a man called <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Mustafa Hashim (Banu Musa Disciple)</span>, one of the chief officers of <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Layet-Efel-Ahen (Stainless Iron) </span>and a former student of Al-Azhar University.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">Mustafa Hashim is a young man with a knack for understanding how things work. Even as a child, he did not believe stories such as “the storks bring a child to a father and mother”, “the gods are angry, so the lightning strikes,” or similar folktales and myths. He was not a religious person due to this feature of his. It got him into trouble many times, and he almost faced execution due to “being a heretic,” but it was ordered by Saladin that he be freed. Since that day, Al-Jazari kept a keen eye on him while he worked his way through the Stainless Iron.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">Known for his meticulous nature and profound analytical skills, Mustafa combines his academic knowledge with a deep-rooted passion for Egypt’s heritage. Since childhood, he was fascinated by the construction of the pyramids and always wondered how they were made originally. Rather than magic, he was more interested in the physical ways of solving problems and creating things. Although magic required hard work and understanding, he believed the human mind could surpass the need for magic. He still, of course, studied magic and put it to good use.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">Personality-wise, Mustafa is reserved yet profoundly dedicated, often losing track of time amidst his projects. His former peers at university remember him as a brilliant yet humble student, always eager to share knowledge and learn from others.

Damascus Steel is already legendary in the Holy Lands, and the Stainless Iron guild has become legendary under the leadership of the Zengid Dynasty and now its successor, the Ayyubid Dynasty. After fully taking control of Damascus, Saladin invited many guildsmen to Cairo and wished for their work to flourish in the city.</p><p>The Stainless Iron is currently working closely with the Banu Musa Society at Al-Azhar University. They are producing quality metalwork for them and for Al-Jazari personally. Many of the robotics are built with the metals they specifically produce. Through Saladin's orders, if the adventurers are considered to have been on good terms with the sultan, the Stainless Iron can make each of the adventurers' armor or current clothes resistant to one type of elemental damage: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder for free or for 100 gold dinars each. They also produce +1 versions of all kinds of armor, shields, and weapons for a price suitable for the friends of the sultan (150 gold dinars + the original price of the item).</p><p>The Stainless Iron currently oversees the excavation on the Sphinx, believing they will find new sources and a way to improve their art of blacksmithing. Mustafa Hashim can help adventurers to get inside the sphinx.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Possible Stainless Iron Features</h4><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Stainless Work: </span>A member of the Stainless Iron doubles its proficiency bonus on a tool of its choice.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Arcane Smith: </span>A member of the Stainless Iron knows the <span class=\"italic\">mending </span>and <span class=\"italic\">produce flame </span>cantrips.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Armor Training:</span> A member of the Stainless Iron has proficiency in light armor, medium armor, and shields.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Heat Resistance:</span> A member of the Stainless Iron isn’t affected by extreme heat conditions and needs only half the total amount of water a normal person needs to survive.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Working Mind:</span> A member of the Stainless Iron adds his Intelligence modifier to its Armor Class while wearing light or medium armor.

He was one of the main actors who dethroned the Fatimids from power and put his brother Saladin on the throne of Egypt. He also has the nickname “Sayf ad-Din,” the “Sword of Faith,” where the name Saphadin comes from.</p><p>Saphadin is a serious and cautious man with great attention to detail and is very good with numbers. It is said that he knows almost exactly how many soldiers each province can produce during a bountiful harvest and how many men occupy the strategic points in Cairo at any given time. He carefully plans a line of logistics for his brother and works with provincial governors on supply lines. Most of the council of warlords recognize Saphadin as the invisible hero behind the curtains. It is also rumored that, with a glimpse of a second, he could guess how many men there are in an opposing army.</p><p>He is informed about the adventurers and knows they must enter the Pyramid of Khufu. He arranged a scouting party before their arrival. However, the party was unsuccessful in getting in. Al-Jazari had some robots build a steel door in the entrance, break its key to three pieces, and hide them in the Great Sphinx. Normally, he shouldn’t have shared this information with anyone, but because of his forced stay in the Library Pageless, the <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Muzahir</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span> that carried the <span class=\"italic\">Cylinder of Cyrus</span> brought the news about it. There is, unfortunately, no way to enter without getting their hands on the keys. Thus, the excavation on the Sphinx was sped up and monitored by Saladin himself.</p><p>Imad ad-Din is an intelligent scholar and careful recorder of events and is one of the few friends of Saphadin and Saladin. He has a way of bringing bad news and is usually known as “Stormcrow” because he constantly shows up in hard times and delivers troubled news. He also has a way of analyzing history and predicting future events. It is said that he predicted Saladin’s defeat at Montgisard, and since that day, Saladin kept him close. If they wish, Imad ad-Din can accompany the adventurers on their journey to the Sphinx.</p><p>During their meeting with the adventurers they are free to discuss many topics mentioned above and the dangers that could be found in the Pyramid. Additionally, in this meeting, the information below can be shared:</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li>The Pyramid is also a prison complex. No prisoner that has entered there ever came out, but Al-Jazari informs them that no one has died yet.</li><li>Al-Jazari performs many experiments, having changed the inside of the pyramids for years. He has been obsessed with it. In his own words, “A place of my undoing, although I’m not a pharaoh.”</li><li>Pyramid contains some intact floors, while others have been completely altered by Al-Jazari. His robots are mostly loyal to him and perceive anyone except him and Saladin as enemies.

Thousands of years ago, the Great Sphinx was built as a measure for speaking to gods, and the sphinx was the symbol of unity and harmony between humans and gods, sometimes referring to the pharaohs.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">The Sphinx is a result of that devotion and belief in divinity. When they wanted to commune with gods, a godly creature appeared, but no one knew how. At the height of the Bronze Age, before the invasion of the Sea Peoples, divine magic and devotion infused the stones and statues of the priests of the Great Sphinx. The aspects within these statues revealed themselves as sphinxes, and many others around the world, imbuing them with life as celestial beings. They prayed so devoutly that the stones eventually came to life.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">Al-Jazari, when he came to Cairo, discovered the existence of the sphinxes and appealed to their guardianship. He made three keys and gave them power over the Pyramids. He convinced the sphinxes by stating he works for the new pharaoh of Egypt: Salah ad-Din Yusuf bin Ayyub.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">Adventurers don’t actually need any keys to enter; they only need their blessings. However, each Sphinx holds a certain power in the Pyramid. They needed to convince them to release those powers.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">As long as they are truthful about being sent here by Saladin, they are allowed to go into the dungeon no matter which trial they fail or pass. If the adventurers act incredibly out of character or highly disrespect the sphinxes, Egyptian gods, Saladin, or any other aspect deemed worthy by the sphinxes, they may become hostile as a last resort.</p></div><h3>Aspect of Anubis</h3><p class=\"bold ha-gold no-margin\">Power: Judgment of the Afterlife</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Mechanic: </span>While the adventurers are inside the pyramid, they receive disadvantage to Constitution saving throws and are vulnerable to necrotic or poison damage (GM’s choice for each creature when they enter the dungeon). The undead are supposed to be considerably easier for the adventurers as the combat is not the main trial here.</li><li><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Solution: </span>The Aspect of Anubis has a cage behind it with four skeletons, ghouls, or a similar undead creature. The Aspect of Anubis says one phrase only: “Deal with the undead.” A DC 10 Intelligence (Religion or History) check reveals that Egyptians usually buried their dead. The adventurers are expected to destroy or immobilize the undead and make their bodies go back to the soil. If a believer of another religion conducts a ceremony suited to their beliefs, it is also acceptable. For example, a Zoroastrian character could burn the undead with proper prayers.</li><li><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Reward: </span>The adventurers have resistance against necrotic or poison damage while in the pyramid (Their choice at this moment).</li></ul><h3>Aspect of Bastet</h3><p class=\"bold ha-gold no-margin\">Power: Enchanter’s Will</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Mechanic:</span> While in the pyramid, the creatures that have entered the pyramid can’t hit a construct unless they roll 15 or higher in attack rolls.</li><li><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Solution: </span>The Aspect of Bastet is a powerful enchanter, saying only one phrase: “Impress me.” She expects a visual or a solid presentation of talent, power, intelligence, devotion, or something similar. A DC 10 Intelligence (Religion or History) check reveals that Bastet is a gentle lioness goddess, representing fertility and motherhood, but also linked to music, dance, joy, and pleasure. If you desire, you could appoint a DC based on the characters’ performance preference. For example, singing a song for a bard should not be too hard (DC 10), while a character with a low Intelligence could have a hard time remembering a song dedicated to Bastet. However, Bastet may consider dedication and sincerity as good signs as long as the adventurer tries something for real. Magicians could put up a show with their illusionary abilities, while a barbarian with a Strength score could demonstrate their muscle power. Each adventurer must succeed in order for all of them to earn the reward.</li><li><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Reward:</span> The adventurers choose a damage type. If a construct has a resistance or immunity against it, that specific resistance or immunity is removed. If it doesn’t have a resistance or immunity against the chosen damage type already, the construct becomes vulnerable to that damage type. The damage type can’t be poison, necrotic, or psychic.</li></ul><h3>Aspect of Sekhmet</h3><p class=\"bold ha-gold no-margin\">Power: Warrior’s Might</p><ul class=\"moon\"><li><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Mechanic: </span>Known for her ferocity in battle, the Aspect of Sekhmet represents healing and destruction simultaneously. Due to her aura, each healing received in the pyramid has a 50% chance of instead damaging the creatures by the same amount. For example, a potion of healing could harm the creature by a total amount of 2d4+2. The damage is necrotic and can’t be prevented in any way.</li><li><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Solution:</span> The Aspect of Sekhmet will either want to duel with the adventurers individually or combat them collectively. If the adventurers choose to duel individually, only three hits or three effects are considered a victory. If collectively, the adventurers are expected to drop Sekhmet to 0 HP. Any damage done during the trial is reversed after the combat ends.</li><li><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Reward: </span>The adventurers can take 2 short rests rapidly. A 10-minute rest is counted as a short rest. This only works in the pyramid.</li></ul></div>"

The area you approach is their territory. In death, no one rules over them. Whether it be Saladin or Baldwin, here lie the fallen gods – their followers may have dwindled, but their power still firmly resides in their hearts.</p><p>As you enter their majestic shadows, you realize you underestimated their grandeur. From afar, it seemed merely a palette of beautiful colors on canvas, but now it appears larger than any building you’ve seen, and you marvel at how it stands. Once again, the intelligence and knowledge of its builders impress you deeply. Then, the voices of emperors lying deep below, the workers who died during construction, and the kings who dreamed of looking upon this place echo in your ears.

An interesting triangle-shaped room welcomes you and you feel all the ancient sightings, pharaohs and Egyptian gods that would wait for you here, gone, taken into some place away.</p></div><p>This is the entrance to the dungeon, and the largest room is located here. This was once a maze built by the ancients, but now it produces power for this complex. Ismail Al-Jazari made this place as a sundial working with sunlight and also sensitive to starlight. It absorbs light and creates energy, a work in progress by the master artificer.</p><p>For intruders, it creates a time trap to repel them. Each zone is hazardous in its own way. From the control panel in the room, the effects can be observed as if it is a sundial or a clock. The clock’s hour end determines the area that will possibly be more dangerous.</p><p>In order to reach the exit and upper floors, the adventurers must pass each room clockwise. Once the system is activated by stepping their feet onto Floor 0, each room has an area of effect designed to hurt or even kill the intruders. Once characters roll for initiative, roll for the room as well as if it’s a creature, and when its turn comes, the room’s effect is activated on that turn.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Lawha-i Idara: Control Panel</h4><p>In the entrance, R1, a metallic table sparks the adventurers’ interest. It has Arabic letters as well as gibberish symbols on it. A DC 10 Intelligence check reveals that it says “Lawha-i Idara”, meaning the “plaque/sheet/table for management/control,” or, as the adventurers intuit, a control panel. It has a clock depicted on it, and the hour hand is made of gold to be easily distinguishable with the eyes.</p><p>In order to control the panel, a character must have proficiency with cartographer’s tools, smith’s tools, tinker’s tools, navigator’s tools, alchemist’s supplies, or a similar tool you deem appropriate, or a feature, a background, a class ability or something similar that could fit here. This panel lets the creatures mechanically attempt to control the sundial mechanism. Each attempt to change the hour hand requires a DC 10 Intelligence check to move the mechanic parts on it carefully.</p><p>In addition, A DC 15 Intelligence check reveals that the panel is actually sensitive to light. If the panel is opened sideways, mirrors in it can be observed. If the mirrors are aligned correctly, the hour hand can be fixed to a desired room.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Doors of the Clock</h4><p>One of the challenges in Floor 0 is the countdown. In every room, the room rolls for initiative, and when its turn comes, it activates its ability. However, the doors are also reinforced. Each one has a lock that can be opened with a DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools or Sleight of Hand may apply) check.</p><p>Each door has 14 AC, 10 HP and 4 Damage Threshold with immunity to poison, psychic, and necrotic; resistance to slashing and piercing from nonmagical forces; resistance to fire, cold, lightning, radiant and thunder; and vulnerability to acid and force.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Hour Hand</h4><p>When the hour hand coincides with a room, that room has an initiative count of 20 with an available lair action. The action is a release of energy by means of an area of effect in the form of magical beams. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 force damage. This damage can be interrupted by a shield spell due to its similar nature to magic missiles.</p><p>If intruders are in a room on this floor, roll a d12 at the beginning of a round. It determines the hour hand’s current position.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">The Walls</h4><p>The walls are covered with a special material made by the Banu Musa Society and perfected by Al-Jazari himself. It is called sitara-reng, “star color” in Persian. It is made from the roots of a tree that undergoes heavy induction and alteration by magic. Normal trees are transformed into this particular tree called Rishe Sitara (Star Root) in Persian. The root is carefully crafted through an alchemical process infused with holy water to produce star color. Star color is always sensitive to light and catches whatever is in the sky at the moment. It is said that these trees can be found in underground regions and guide those that dwell there.</p><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/pyramid-of-khufu-floor-0.webp\" /><h4 class=\"ha-red\">The Main Engine</h4><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>In the center, a huge pillar made of metal takes your attention. All the walls seem to circle it. Its metal surface looks extremely hot, almost to the point of white metal. A touch would surely be incredibly painful. However, you hear a faint noise, resembling a windmill or a watermill, constantly turning. But this time, it is a metal.</p></div><p>A DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals (or characters with passive Perception of 18 or higher) that there is also a sound of water - a constant presence. It resembles when a white-hot sword in the state of candescence is plunged into water, creating a burst of steam pouring out. A DC 10 Intelligence check reveals that it is to cool the huge pillar, and if overheated, most of the mechanics may not work. The adventurers may choose to break the pillar, as it powers most of the mechanics in the dungeon.</p><p>The pillar must take 50 points of bludgeoning damage (magical) or fire damage to be broken. It has a threshold of 10 points and an Armor Class of 18.</p><p>If the pillar breaks, it will explode and force each creature within 40 ft. of it to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it deals 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage due to shrapnel from the metallic parts. The doors lose their magical quality, and Mechanics with an Ω symbol do not work anymore.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">The Effects in Rooms</h4><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>The rooms have nearly identical interiors, with nothing noteworthy to distinguish them.

Each turn, a total of ten squares (5 ft^2 area) opens up, and any character on it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 90 ft. below to a pit of spikes. The spikes deal 7 (2d6) piercing damage.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">R3 Ω: </span>Each turn a set of ice is fired from all walls.

If the darkness is dispelled with a daylight spell or a similar effect that destroys magical darkness, the darkness<span class=\"bold ha-red\"> </span>is cast again after 1d4+1 turns.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">R9 Ω:</span> Each turn, magical chains with hooks attached erupt from the ground where the creatures stand and attempt to grab them. Creatures must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the chains. Chains have 10 Hit Points and can be burst with a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Each turn after the first one, the chains magically pour tiny spikes on them and deal 2 (1d4) piercing damage to restrained targets.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">R10 Ω: </span>A sleeping gas fills the room and forces each creature to succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail fall asleep for 1 minute, until they take damage or are slapped awake by a creature as an action. After 1 minute, the floor disappears and all creatures fall 80 ft to the ground, and then the floor reappears, leaving only 1 hour of oxygen.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">R11 Ω:</span> The surface becomes magically reflective and each creature (that is able to see) must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or fall under the effects crown of madness spell.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">R12 Ω:</span> Only a<span class=\"bold ha-red\"> Muzahir</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span> waits in the room, right at the beginning of the stairs.

He strove like the mighty Nile, ever pushing forward, to uplift the land of the black soil. His decrees were wise, and his commands just. With strong hands, he forged a realm undiminished, a beacon of prosperity that might forever gleam like gold in the expansive desert.”</p><p>“Behold the horizon where sky clasps the earth, where our sovereign Khufu, the horizon’s own son, erected this eternal stone to merge heaven and earth. Through this sacred monument, he aimed not only to grace the skies but to elevate us, his devoted followers, so that together we might dwell amidst the stars. This pyramid, a ladder of stone, stands as his divine aspiration, a passage through which the soul ascends to the everlasting celestial realm.”</p><p>“In the days to come, long as the river and enduring as stone, let it be known that we, the caretakers of his legacy, will kindle the flames of remembrance. For Pharaoh Khufu, whose spirit guards us still, we consecrate these days of splendor. Each year, when the sun reaches its zenith, we shall celebrate his deeds, rejoicing in the shadows of the great pyramid, so his memory, like the sun, shall never dim nor his glory fade from the heart of the Nile.”</p><p>“As the sun rises steadfast each morning, so too does the spirit of our people glow with unwavering pride. It is in the shadow of the great pyramid, beneath the gaze of the all-seeing sun, that we stand as one, upholders of the glory wrought by Pharaoh Khufu’s hands. Our voices lift in unison, our hearts beat to the rhythm of the ancients, and our actions are guided by the legacy of his greatness. Proudly, we carry forward the mantle of his achievements, ensuring that the echo of his reign resounds through eternity.”</p></div><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Engravings of a Pharaoh</h4><div class=\"box-description\"><p>“From the timeless depths of my divine contemplation, my vision was grander than the horizon itself. I sought to forge a beacon of ascendance, a domicile where the bonds of the earth may be severed to unite with the celestial. This structure, rising steadfast from the sands, was to be a confluence of the heavens and our mortal coil, a place of enlightenment and communion with the gods. Yet those who came after misunderstood the breadth of my decree, erecting what they saw as a monument to hubris rather than a portal for advancement and unity with the divine.”</p><p>“In the solitude of the gods’ embrace, it weighs heavily upon my heart that my true intent has drifted like sands lost to the winds among my people. This edifice, meant to elevate and unite, has been shadowed by misinterpretations. Yet a flicker of hope remains, kindled by the foresight of the learned ones who may yet traverse these stone halls. May the scholar, wise and discerning, come forth to preserve and herald the true essence of my legacy. Let him be the guardian of our heritage, the one who understands and perpetuates the enlightenment we sought.”</p><p>“Bound to the dust of my former empire by the immutable chains of undeath, I dwell among the remnants of a time long passed. My corporeal form has succumbed to the relentless march of decay, reduced to naught but desolation within these hallowed chambers. Yet in the stillness of this eternal vigil, here I remain—my spirit tethered to the very stones that were to be a bridge to the divine. From this silent throne, I watch over my legacy, enduring as both sentinel and sovereign, forever a part of the monument that was to transcend mortality.</p><p>“Behold, as dawn ushers in the age of a new horizon, a learned scholar from distant lands approaches, bearing the seal of his sultan, a ruler whose vision mirrors the grandeur of my own. This emissary of knowledge seeks to parley with my eternal essence, to uncover the secrets bound within these ancient stones. Together, we may forge an alliance that transcends time itself, blending the wisdom of the past with the innovations of the present. Here, amid the echoes of antiquity, a dialogue begins—a potent exchange that promises to rejuvenate the enduring legacy that I, Pharaoh Khufu, have bequeathed to the sands of time.”</p></div><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Memories of a Scholar</h4><div class=\"box-description\"><p>“Standing at the threshold of this grand structure, my heart races with the thrill of discovery and the utmost respect for the ingenuity of Pharaoh Khufu. His vision was grand—constructs not just as tombs, but as beacons of progress, striving to advance humanity. Here I am, a humble servant of science, ready to converse with the guardian of this monumental legacy. My objective is clear: to learn, to adapt, and to implement the ancient wisdom housed within these walls, ensuring that it serves to foster advancements that would indeed make our world a better place.”</p><p>“Behold the might of this wonder! I’ve been mesmerized by it. However, my sense of beauty is interrupted by a sudden wish from Salah ad-Din. He wanted to turn this place into a prison. The moment I heard it, I rejected with all my power but in time I realized this could be a great opportunity: To observe and improve them!”</p><p>“In the streets of Jerusalem shadowed by dark stars, an ancient evil stirs, concealed but disturbing. My Sultan’s command is clear: seek out the relic, an object of immense power, believed to be safeguarded by a hermit, Peter, a leader of the First Crusade. I feel the weight of this quest, knowing well the sacrifices it may demand of me. I must obtain it and hide it here, where it will be most safe. Who better to guard this artifact than Pharaoh Khufu himself? A ruler, a protector of his realm, whose spirit still haunts these sacred halls.”</p><p>“Well, this may be a farewell. I don’t know who will read this, but I do not know a better place than the pyramid of mighty Khufu. My adversary, Peter the Hermit, has proven himself not merely a relic of the First Crusade but a harbinger of darker tides. He serves a dark purpose, a karabasan of nightmares. It is such a wicked being that even though you could see it with your naked eyes they would prove useless against it. He aligned himself with dark stars above, to a matriarch from Babylon, who aspired to the greatest heavens but only took the form of the lizard, whose grace is but a chthonic lullaby, a melody that lulls the living into a slumber unending, stripping away freedom and ensnaring souls in her chilling embrace, with our minds at peace, but our spirits enslaved. This battle, then, is not just for a relic, but for the very essence of liberty itself.”</p></div><p>The constructs called <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Muzahir</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span> can be found in most rooms at your discretion to share the memories of Al-Jazari.</p></div>"

After his family was secured, he tried to reconcile with Guy of Lusignan, but he never came to the place they would meet, instead, Saladin’s men ambushed and captured him.

Due to the rising conflict, Saladin did not have time to question her. She comes from the British Isles and was banished by the king of the round table due to dark magic and treachery.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-red\">Korkut Abbas (Hashashin Fedayee</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-red\">h</span><span class=\"bold ha-red\">): </span>A Hashashin loyal to Hasan Sabbah.

He excavated the castle to find the Holy Lance. However, he was experiencing the first symptoms of being an undead and a vampire after he committed cannibalism during the siege. After his ordeal by fire, he traveled south, away from the lords who did not believe him. He spent decades in Jerusalem and slowly regained power through feeding on mortals and slowly building an army. He believed himself to be a messiah, the king of the new generation of humans. His actions was revealed by Queen Melisende and he was banished from the city, only to be captured by a raiding party of Cairo origin and an imam called Hafiz Üsame, a monster hunter at that time.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Hall of the False King</h4><div class=\"box-description\"><p>A throne made of stone greets you, and it looks like it was made for a giant. And a giant sits on it, indeed – like the black skies among a fierce storm, a construct made of black steel sits right there. Eyes lifeless, its body is still, the eye of the storm.

There are carvings and hieroglyphs on the wall, describing the fall of a false king. A DC 10 Intelligence (History) check reveals that this part of history has never reached outside this pyramid, depicting really old events, lost to history. There are two sarcophagi on both sides (A and B in the map) of the stone, they look like royal tombs. Inside them, there are two <span class=\"bold ha-red\">mummies</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-red\">j</span>. Right in front of both sarcophagi, a small insignia appears. It is the word <span class=\"bold ha-red helvetica\">نفس</span> (nefs) in the Arabic alphabet, meaning ‘breath.’ It signifies caution, taking a break, stopping, and similar meanings. If no character knows how to speak Arabic, a DC 14 Intelligence (Religion or History) check applies to notice this. It is a warning left by Al-Jazari not to disturb the ones that rest there, giving them a chance to breathe.</p><p>If the adventurers succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) or if they are already proficient in reading the Egyptian hieroglyphs, they can decipher this: The walls tell the story of a false king, who uses his powers to rob the wealth of his kingdom and was cursed by the gods. The two priests prayed to the gods for his defeat and were honored, and their tombs were treated like royalty.</p><p>If the adventurers do not disturb or try to take any items from the sarcophagi and wait for 1 minute, a passage right below the throne will reveal itself.

There, on a time-worn sandstone pedestal, rests the Cylinder of Cyrus. This artifact, made of clay and intricately inscribed with cuneiform script, radiates a presence that is almost tangible.</p><p>You feel the air around you charged, the very stone beneath your feet thrumming with the cylinder’s hidden power. Shadows play along the walls, hinting at the presence of guardians long passed who might still watch over this sacred relic. As you move closer, the whispers of a struggle fill the chamber, echoing with tales of peace and governance from an empire long faded.</p><p>You are standing in a vault dedicated to the protection of this world. The last item you need to reach the further depths of the Church of Resurrection: The Cylinder of Cyrus before you is not just an ancient artifact, it carries the Voice of Shahenshah, the shah of shahs; only few truly carried this title. Only a few of them achieved becoming the king of kings.</p><p>A faint melody can be heard from it, as if it desires a note, a command or some voice in a similar note. It knows you are there, it feels the existence of your brand, your sigil.</p></div><p>The Cylinder of Cyrus can be obtained, but it is not the only item there. A DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the stone holds one more item: Khufu’s Heart. Unless destroyed, Khufu will be born again.</p><p>Once the cylinder is taken, a magical portal will appear and a <span class=\"bold ha-red\">Muzahir</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-red\">a</span> will recite Al-Jazari’s voice:</p><div class=\"box-description\"><p>“Well, since the brutal curse I put on the cylinder did not obliterate you, I can assume you wish to be rid of this place without encountering any more dangers. I only have one small request from you: do not harm the pharaoh’s heart. It is already broken as it is, and I do not want it to be entirely gone from this world. With a universe full of cruel and evil kings and lords, I count myself lucky that I met three such figures in this narrow part of the world. It would honor me that the pharaoh may continue to guard his tomb, as it is the only thing that remains for him. Thanks in advance.”</p></div><p>The portal leads them right outside the pyramid, potentially without any eyewitnesses. If the adventurers do not destroy Khufu’s heart, he will rise again in a few days. If they wish to destroy it nonetheless, it can be done with a single attack that deals at least 3 damage.

Within the Library, there are several chambers where paralyzed individuals are placed to have their brains, minds, experiences, memories, and information drained.</p><p>The main attraction of the dungeon is the Atrium - where an artificial heart is chained at the very center. Melded with the pulsing heart, Bernard of Clairvaux (an ancient preacher that ignited the Second Crusade and an old master of the Knights Templar) serves as the gatekeeper to the brain, at the Atrium. Flanking the Atrium, there are two enclosed botanical gardens that fulfill the role of the lungs - pumping compressed air for the artificial heart.</p><p>Below the main floor lies the spine and the ribcage of the New Man, which is still in construction. Battling through the cultist-infested debris, the players reach the laboratory and the prison - where new items, allies, and secrets can be gathered.</p><h2>Dungeon Aesthetics</h2><p>Half lost in a craggy expanse of the Sinai mountains, the Library Pageless is a stone church that marries the stark grandeur of medieval architecture with something wholly otherworldly. The building’s heavy stone walls, worn and chipped by time, are tinged with vivid blue sinews that beat in slow, rhythmic pulses: the motion of arcane life. At night, the sinews generate a faint spectral light, highlighting the intricate façade against the moonlit sky, creating a striking contrast between the bizarre sinew and the harsh stone. Their faint light creeps through the structure’s cracks and gaps, as though some terrible power were held captive deep in the church’s very bones.</p><p>The church’s defenders are not outside. The statues of knights and saints that guard the Library Pageless are carved from the same stone as its walls, but they remain untouched by the sinew’s livid blue light. They stand sentinel along the walkways and watch the shadowed alcoves, stony gazes that follow every movement. Executed with lifelike detail, the statues evoke an awful sense of movement – as though the Library Pageless’s defenders might hurl themselves into battle the instant they are summoned. The drowning of the church’s history in this creeping mysticism instills a sense of grim majesty in all those who visit: The Library Pageless’s beauty is a thing of shadowed power, brought to life by an omnipresent thrum.</p><h2>Approach to the Library Pageless</h2><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>As you traverse the windswept plains that lead to the Library Pageless, the silhouette of a grand stone church-castle emerges against the dusky sky. Its spires pierce the horizon like jagged teeth, and its walls, though seemingly impenetrable, are etched with the passage of time and secrets. The castle stands solitary, its imposing structure casting long shadows over the barren landscape.</p><p>As you draw nearer, a sense of unease begins to gnaw at your senses. The wind carries a whispering echo, as if the very air around the castle is laden with watchful eyes. The ground beneath your feet feels unnervingly firm, almost as though it compels you forward on a path from which there is no deviation.</p><p>The closer you get, the more palpable the sensation of being watched becomes. There are no guards visible, yet you can't shake the feeling that every step is being monitored and measured by unseen observers.</p></div><p>Observant adventurers may notice subtle movements in the castle's windows—a DC 14 Perception Check reveals a fleeting shadow here, a brief flicker there, suggesting the presence of patrolling entities within.</p><p>If the Perception check is a success, the adventurers begin to realize that they are being watched. Given the unnerving feeling of being observed, moving stealthily becomes crucial. A successful DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check allows the party to approach the castle without alerting its inhabitants. Failing this check might mean that the adventurers are expected, and perhaps, unwelcome surprises await at the entrance.</p><h2>Possible Entrances</h2><h3 class=\"ha-dark-purple-1\">Main Entrance</h3><p>The main entrance, although heavily guarded, proves to be the easiest access to the main floor of the Library Pageless. If the adventurers fail to scout the area properly, or decide that they do not have the time or the means to slip into the dungeon undetected, this is their entrance.</p><h3 class=\"ha-dark-purple-1\">The Cracked Rib</h3><p>The basement of the Library Pageless is a maze of stone and arcane sinew - as eldritch bonelike structures are being built by hand. This floor is still under heavy construction and a careful eye, with a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check, could spot a haphazardly covered cave allowing entry to the Sanctum, unhindered by the guards at the Main Gate.</p></div>"

Another chest holds a collection of carefully wrapped and preserved letters. The ink has faded, but the handwriting is still elegant and desperate, hinting at a past filled with love and loss.

This is the room that unlocks the entry to the final room where Peter the Hermit, and his prisoner Al-Jazari, reside.</p><p>In the right center of the room is the Artificial Heart - an abomination created by combining molten organic matter, the blue sinews, and mechanical contraptions. Chained to it is Bernard of Clairvaux (Hermit’s Prophet of the Moth), an ancient preacher that ignited the Second Crusade and an old master of the Knights Templar (for further information on Knights Templar, check out Jerusalem - City of God section in Era of the Crusades). He turns immediately hostile to the adventurers, though he cannot move from his place in the center of the room.</p><p>Once Bernard of Clairvaux is defeated, the party can access the controls of the Artificial Heart. The party needs a DC 18 Arcana, Medicine or Investigation check to learn how the contraption works. The Artificial Heart pulls compressed air from Western and Eastern Hothouses, uses the arc generated by the blue sinew pulses to ignite it, and spins the massive engine in the Trachea, opening the gate to the Cranium, and distributing he waterthroughout the Sanctum.</p><p>There are five levers controlling the Artificial Heart.

The room is brightly lit with natural light shining through two observatory openings in the domed roof. This would have been a marvelous vista had it not been thoroughly corrupted by the being that is nestled in the other side of the room. A twisted amalgamation of bodies, organic tissue, and stone appears to have descended from a singular figure on a stone throne - Peter the Hermit, or what remains of him that is. He is in a heated conversation with another human being, interestingly uncorrupted and locked in a cage-like contraption.</p></div><p>This is the final room of the Library Pageless, where the party has the chance to break the Seal of Peter the Hermit and save Al-Jazari.</p><p>By the time the adventurers enter the room, Peter the Hermit and Al-Jazari will be far into their discussions regarding combining organic matters with clockwork mechanisms. Peter was expecting the party to arrive since the moment they set foot into the Sanctum. A series of events occur as the encounter starts. Before initiatives are rolled, an organic leech-like apparatus strikes the back of Al-Jazari’s head, grasping the inventor’s head and not letting go. Secondly, the observatory openings close, cutting all the natural light from the room. Then, Peter attempts to parley with the adventurers with clear demands: leave the Sanctum and never return, or the world will never have a chance at ascending from the human form - otherwise he will kill them in a heartbeat, and suck intelligence from Al-Jazari, leaving him a husk of his former self.</p><p>Once the combat starts, each turn Al-Jazari’s intelligence will be drained by 1. The first 5 points drained can be brought back by casting a greater restoration spell, but any draining after that is permanent. Any healing spell cast on Al-Jazari stops the drain for that turn. Peter the Hermit will gain any Intelligence drained as a temporary bonus until the end of combat.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">The players may attack the contraption to free Al-Jazari and get him to join the combat as an Ally. The apparatus has the following stats:</span></p><p>It has 10 Armor Class, and 110 Hit Points. It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage. It is immune to poison, psychic and lightning and it's vulnerable against force damage.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">Boss Room: </span>Peter the Hermit has his own stat block and a special Lair action. At initiative count 20, he decides whether to cast magical darkness (4th level) or create a blinding bright light by controlling the observatory openings: the characters must make DC 15 Constitution saving throws or be blinded this turn, and they must repeat the roll every turn as long as the room still has the blinding bright light. He can also forgo this ability and instead focus the lenses on a single player character, making a free scorching ray spell attack (the spell attack stats are the same as Peter the Hermit’s own stats).</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">The adventurers advance to Level 7.</p></div></div>"

This time, the sun has a twin on the ground: The army of Saladin the Victorious. After his victory at the Battle of Hattin, the armies of Jerusalem were scattered and no great power could stand in his way! The city of Jerusalem is besieged and waiting for the darkening of days.</p></div><p>If the adventurers are on good terms with Saladin, they will be welcomed into the war camp. Saladin will see them personally in a private tent where no one is able to see them.</p><p>If the adventurers bring Ismail Al-Jazari with them, the sultan will be grateful and even if there is some enmity towards them, this could heal it.</p><p>There are some topics they may discuss:</p><ul class=\"purple\"><li>Saladin is sure that the city must be taken tonight. However, the biggest challenge they face is <span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">Balian of Ibelin</span>. The brave knight has taken control of the city’s defenses and even though most of the knights are dead and scattered in the Battle of Hattin, the civilians that took up arms in the city fight very well. The first assault on the gates failed.</li><li>There are three options in the eyes of Saladin: First option: The adventurers could convince Balian to parley (<span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">A Call for Truce</span><span class=\"bold\">)</span>. Second option: They could sneak into the city (<span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">City Sewers</span>). Third option: Saladin is preparing a small strike force that will attempt to storm a small breach and open the gates (<span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">Storm the Gates</span>). They could help these soldiers and lighten their tasks easily.</li></ul><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"centered\">It is recommended that the adventurers have a few hours to prepare before embarking on their last quest, especially if you placed a time limit for the adventurers as mentioned earlier under the <span class=\"bold\">Cairo: Golden Towers</span> section in <span class=\"bold\">Act II</span>. However, if they are delayed in Cairo or between cities, time could be compressed to force them to act quickly.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">If they arrive too late, check out the <span class=\"bold\">Conclusions</span> section at the end of this <span class=\"bold\">Act.</span></p></div><p>If the adventurers are delayed or arrive late to the scene, they will find Saladin preparing for a bloody ritual, one that is close to what Cyrus the Great did once. He will briefly explain the situation and his lack of options:</p><ul class=\"purple\"><li>Cyrus sacrificed many souls and blood to bind the Whore of Babylon. Saladin must do what it takes to do the same. One city is not important against the safety of the Holy Lands.</li><li>This ritual will require the deaths of thousands, and a victorious siege can present the sacrifice necessary.</li><li>Saladin prefers not to go down this route, but he is running out of options as Balian refuses to yield the city. He can only grant the adventurers very little time for them to slay Whore of Babylon.</li></ul><h2>A Call for Truce</h2><p>The adventurers could try to convince Balian to parley for a truce that would let the adventurers enter the city and give them time to take the evil out. However, first, they will have to convince that the evil that they are trying to destroy truly exists as Balian does not know the full extent of what is transpiring behind the veil.</p><p>Balian of Ibelin can be convinced to participate in a parley with a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. However, he must be given assurances.</p><ul class=\"purple\"><li>Adventurers could offer some valuable (both material and sentimental could be applied at your discretion) aspects of themselves, such as a really precious magic item, a token from their dead mentor, the White Book, or something similar..</li><li><p>If their actions were honorable during the time they spent with Balian, they could prove their sincerity by taking an oath,, or showing a similar way that is appropriate for their culture with a DC 15 Charisma check (proper proficiencies may apply). <br /></p></li></ul><h2>City Sewers</h2><p>The Jerusalem walls are sternly guarded by Knights and Balian himself, and all gates are also protected by Crusader garrisons. Balian already anticipates an attack through the sewers.</p><p>If they attempt to go through the sewers they can be put against a handpicked Crusader Veteran at the entrance to the city with a potential threat of the Crusader calling for help. You could enforce a time restraint (such as 3 rounds) for the Veteran to be taken down or there could be a bell for him to call for reinforcements, unless stopped earlier. If reinforcements are called, Balian and 5 Crusader Veterans show up to confront the adventurers.</p><p>Before they venture, Saladin offers them whatever their heart desires in exchange for opening the gates for him. However, he won’t hold a grudge or resent the adventurers if they refuse to do so and will understand their decision.</p><h2>Storm the Gates</h2><p>If the adventurers decide to Storm the Gates, they will be escorted by a <span class=\"bold\">Mamluk Ghazi</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-dark-purple-1\">a</span> and 5 <span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">Mamluk Cavalries</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-dark-purple-1\">a</span>. The names of the cavalries: <span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">Yaqub Qabar ad-Din Dibiyaza, Khalid Kashmiri, Khidir Kharawita, Ismail Ahmad Kanabawi, Usman Abd-al Jalal Shisha</span> and Ghazi’s name is <span class=\"bold\">Muhammad Sumbul</span>.</p><p>These men are counted as heroes in the army, the finest of the Mamluk warriors. During Saladin’s ascension to power, they played a pivotal role and took down the whole vanguard of the former Fatimid Sultan, consisting of at least fifty men in under a minute. Since that day, they have been known as “<span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">Qabdat al-Yusuf</span>”, the Fist of Yusuf, the birth name of Saladin. If the adventurers choose this way, they must fight against at least twenty <span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">Knights</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-dark-purple-1\">j</span>, three <span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">Crusader Knights</span><span class=\"dot-sup triangle ha-dark-purple-1\">a</span> and Balian of Ibelin himself.</p><p>Whatever they choose, the effects of the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-purple-1\">Whore of Babylon</span> start to shake the core of the Holy Lands as soon as they enter the Fallen Jerusalem.</p><div class=\"box-description\"><p>A sudden rush of emotion rushes over your mind: A Mother's Embrace. You are sure that the evil that lies beneath the holy city is close to emerging from the ground. You are sure that this is her effect that puts this feeling in your hearts. It’s penetrating down to your guts, your spirit itself, and strangling it.</p><p>Your willpower and the the sigil lets you embrace the arcane pulse and perhaps even disregard it altogether, but the people around you start to fall asleep one by one. Only the strongest remain awake, fighting the terrible curse. Only those whose minds could fight back retain conciousness. The shock of the event is not only a bane for the defenders of Jerusalem - it terrorizes both sides. Saladin's warcamp took control back quickly, pulling their forces back from assigned assaults with cries of faith and resurgence.</p><p>Inside the walls, Balian remained with a handful of civilians, hardly able to fight - so Saladin's retreat was a boon as much as the curse a bane. With the power of Roland’s ring, those that rose as true Knights of Jerusalem manage to beat back the acute effects of the eldritch corruption surrounding them - for a brief moment that is. The city held her breath.</p><p>A dark hour is now the fate of the city.</p></div></div>"

However, as the GM, you have the final say on the matter of creation, and the DC could be higher for more powerful items or objects that have the size of large or larger. If it is a magical item that is rare or more powerful, the DC could increase by 2 for each rarity above rare. If it is consumable, this could increasethe DC by another 2.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">If the adventurers attempt to change their surroundings in a way that they experienced beforehand (for example, creating an explosion, taking down ceilings, or rotting away a material they have witnessed before), they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom check. However, as the GM, you have the final say on this matter as well and could change the DC depending on the act.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">Each successful attempt reduces a creature's maximum hit points by an amount equal to 14 (4d6), while each failed attempt reduces it by an amount equal to 21 (6d6). This reduction cannot be prevented except by the Whore of Babylon.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">If the adventurers attempt to use their imagination and alter reality or create a thing they have imagined, they must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma check. The ability score can be altered and the DC may be adjusted based on the imagination. For example, an adventurer may have never seen an anvil before, but it could be considered an easy item to imagine. As this rule is very open to interpretation, it is suggested to remind the adventurers that the Whore of Babylon can also use these powers for her own good and feel free to adjust the mechanics that would benefit your game better.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">As a rule of thumb, it is suggested that the wish spell’s rules apply here: “The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This effect might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded your desire. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.”</p></div><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/wob-adamsiz.webp\" /></div>"

Depending on the feats, achievements and failures of the adventurers, you can check out below to decide how to conclude your game.</p><h2>Golden Ending</h2><ul class=\"gold\"><li>The Whore of Babylon is defeated.</li><li>Sibylla of Jerusalem is defeated.</li><li>The Womb is destroyed before the dragon is born.</li><li>Peter the Hermit is defeated.</li><li>Ismail Al-Jazari was saved without serious damage.</li><li>Balian of Ibelin is alive.</li><li>Guy of Lusignan is defeated.</li><li>Raynald of Chatillon is defeated.</li></ul><p>If the adventurers were able to secure most of the feats above, this could be considered as the best possible scenario for the adventure.</p><p>After the death of Whore of Babylon - eldritch madness engulfing Jerusalem is also broken. Saladin takes the city without any further bloodshed as Balian witnesses firsthand what horror Saladin was trying to stop. If any of the adventurers did not enter the Lullaby Palace, they emerge from the Church of Holy Sepulchre unscathed. After this, they would be counted as one of the most prominent, respected warriors of the Holy Lands, with petitioners and allies all over the realm.</p><p>Saladin will expand his empire and will be revered as one of the most successful and greatest sultans in the Islamic world. His name is still remembered today and many books will write his name with golden letters. Al-Jazari will return to his studies and contribute to science and engineering depending on his remaining Intelligence.</p><p>The adventurers who gave their lives to slay Whore of Babylon will be remembered by only the few who saw what truly lies behind the veil.</p><h2 class=\"ha-silver\">Silver Ending</h2><ul class=\"silver\"><li>The adventurers did not enter the Lullaby Palace.</li><li>Sibylla of Jerusalem is defeated.</li><li>The Womb is destroyed before the dragon is born.</li><li>Peter the Hermit is defeated.</li><li>Ismail Al-Jazari was saved without serious damage or with minor mental damage.</li><li>Saladin took the city peacefully and without much bloodshed.</li><li>Balian of Ibelin is alive.</li><li>Guy of Lusignan is defeated.</li><li>Raynald of Chatillon is defeated.</li></ul><p>This ending is not that different from the Golden Ending, however they decided not to enter the last area. They were still able to stop the great threat of their generation and saved the Holy Lands, for a time. Saladin, Al-Jazari, and the adventurers -if they are willing - join forces in creating a more complete seal - though with the knowledge that a perfect one is impossible. Most of the rewards below can be applied to both endings.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Possible Rewards for Golden &amp; Silver Endings</h3><ul class=\"silver\"><li>Nobility titles and wealthy lands for them. Many soldiers to command and people to rule over.</li><li>A high rank in a war council, a position in a military that is equal to a marshall or similar.</li><li>Leading a faction related to their expertise, background, class and similar. For example, a rogue could be Saladin’s spymaster, a wizard could be a highly respected teacher at Al-Azhar University, a cleric could accompany Balian of Ibelin and survivors to remaining Crusader realms and be a Patriarchal figure, and similar.</li><li>They could build their own faction: A school, a society, a sect, an order, a guild, a pirate group, a mercenary band and similar.</li><li><span class=\"bold\">Wealth:</span> They could own unimaginable wealth, especially in terms of gold dinars and more precious gems.</li><li><span class=\"bold\">Power: </span>Now that the evil is defeated, they can decide the fate of the Holy Lands and beyond and they are probably the most powerful people in the Holy Lands.</li></ul><p>If the adventurers are able to defeat the Whore of Babylon but die in the process, they will also become legendary figures in the Holy Lands, for those who are aware of the extent of their sacrifice. If they can’t defeat the Whore of Babylon, they will be mourned by these select few people.</p><h2 class=\"ha-bronze\">Bronze Ending</h2><p>This is the ending where the world is still safe, but many sacrifices were made.</p><ul class=\"bronze\"><li>Sibylla of Jerusalem is defeated.</li><li>The Womb is destroyed before the dragon is born.</li><li>Saladin had to take the city by force and within the last moments, much blood was spilled.</li><li>Some of the Sigil Bearers are still alive.</li><li>Al-Jazari did not survive or suffered heavy Intelligence loss, being unable to speak again.</li></ul><p>The adventurers may receive moderate rewards based on their alliances and friends. One of the brightest arcane minds were lost in the war against the eldritch, and Saladin knows the seal he will craft will not hold for long. He prepares the realm for the eventual return of the Avatar of Ishtar. The surviving Sigil Bearers still carry the taint of Whore of Babylon across the land.</p><h2 class=\"ha-iron\">Iron Ending</h2><ul class=\"iron\"><li>Saladin had to do his ritual and cause great suffering to the population of Jerusalem.</li><li>The adventurers are dead/or have failed somewhat or allowed Saladin to go through with the ritual.</li><li>Some Sigil Bearers are alive.</li><li>Balian of Ibelin is dead.</li><li>Al-Jazari is dead.</li></ul><p>This is a pyrrhic victory for the Holy Lands. Although Saladin was able to bind the Whore of Babylon again, much was sacrificed and the world will not be the same anymore. Too much blood is on the hands of the sultan and the hope is diminished upon the world.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-red\">Red Ending</h2><ul class=\"dark-red\"><li>The adventurers die at any point of the story, possibly in Act III.</li><li>Sibylla is able to conduct the ritual and Whore of Babylon emerges.</li><li>Some of the Sigil Bearers are alive.</li><li>Saladin is dead.</li><li>Balian of Ibelin is dead.</li><li>Al-Jazari is dead.</li></ul><p>This is the worst ending possible. The Holy Lands will never recover from this and now the Whore of Babylon roams free - someone, or something will interfere for such power does not remain unchallenged for long. Though this intervention will not be for the good of the people of the Holy Lands.</p><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/the-end-yamka.webp\" /></div>"

War shaped my mind. War shaped my past and future. I am Raynald de Châtillon and I swear to flood the Sinai with the blood of my enemies.</p><p>I ride each twilight with a hundred knights carrying the Crimson banner of Al-Karak, and the sigil of my Martyred Mother, like hounds of the Wilde Hunt, to cull the meek, to call men to their destined demise, in the honored field of war.</p><p>Let the weak Kings and queens, bureaucrats in undented armors, ink spitters and quill gulpers engage in their frivolous and unending bickering to delay the inevitable war. Their inability to decide only gives me more time to play with my prey. A hundred villages and caravans I have burned, and before the pompous crowns decide enough is enough, I will burn a thousand more. In this delicate balancing act of peace and coexistence, danced by the Leper and the venomous Saracen, I alone sit at the other end of the scale, and each soul I reap is a stone for my side of the scale, the side of blood and glory.</p><p>Bestowed with the powers of my Martyred Mother who branded my skin, I rise; and knighted under a blood moon a hundred butchers rise with me. Our ride is a call to the truth of this world - war is eternal. And if this accursed land is to be the Kingdom of Peace, first they will have to kill the God of War.</p><h1>Character’s Past</h1><p>Raynald’s childhood, set against a backdrop of strength and weakness, profoundly shaped his worldview. As the heir to a minor lord, he was born into a position of authority for all those around him, yet his early physical frailness and small stature led to mockery in the sparring grounds. His weak demeanor, and the whispers of his inability to fight, led Raynald to lose his father’s approval - and his father even went so far as to allow these mockeries to continue, to reinforce his own worldview on his son: power is the true measure of worth. This cursed upbringing forged in Raynald a deep-seated belief in the supremacy of strength and dominion.</p><p>With a sudden growth spurt, without a doubt shaped by eldritch powers, for a price none except Raynald knows about, the young heir’s physical capabilities aligned with his and his father’s ambitions. The young Raynald started hunting down all those who hurt him, either by challenging them to single combat - where they were demolished under his newfound brutality - or by plotting horrific hunting accidents.</p><p>Seeing what a menace Raynald was becoming to his court and possibly even to his own life, his father sent Raynald to join the Crusades - so that the young hellhound could use his appetite for bloodshed for Godly ends. For Raynald, however, his fathers decision was nothing more than a dishonorable exile.</p><p>His journey to Jerusalem itself was a tale of bloodshed. Raynald, with an entourage that he handpicked from bandits and highwaymen, carved a bloody path to the Kingdom of God, plundering caravans, pillaging villages, and assaulting pilgrims - regardless of their creed. Once the butcher knight found his way to Jerusalem, he was promptly given a minor fief, Al-Karak, and was sent on missions to distant parts of the world - to keep his warmongering away from the delicate peace.</p><p>It was in between his missions in Cilicia and Armenia that Guy de Lusignan entered Raynald’s life as more than a mentor; he filled the void of a father figure, offering the recognition and validation Raynald sought in the battlefield. Guy used his force in the court to reestablish Raynald as one of the Knight Commanders situated near Jerusalem. This was not just for his protection, however, as Raynald was given a secret mission by Guy: disrupt the peace and force Saladin’s hand to attack Jerusalem.</p><h1>Roleplaying As Raynald</h1><p>Raynald exudes the demeanor of a classic bully, marked by an overbearing sense of entitlement and a lack of restraint. His behavior suggests a life unaccustomed to the word ‘no’, where his wishes and whims have seldom been challenged. Yet deep down, he is still the small child that was mocked for his small stature and was lacking parental validation. A horrible combination, recognizable by any who have a sliver of understanding of human behavior.</p><p>He revels in provocation, deriving a twisted pleasure from irritating others purely for his own amusement. His communication is often laced with vulgarity, reflecting an egocentric worldview where his desires and opinions overshadow all else. Raynald’s respect, or lack thereof, hinges solely on the perceived power of those around him - this is also why he respects Guy, who bested him a few times in sparring matches. He adjusts his behavior dramatically in the presence of those he considers physically powerful, displaying a level of respect that is directly proportional to his assessment of their strength and influence.</p><p>However, this respect is fluid and can shift rapidly as Raynald reassesses the power dynamics at play. His recognition of an opponent’s strength can lead to a swift change in his attitude, from disdain to grudging respect. Despite him being easily provoked, Raynald exercises a unique measure of self-control in situations involving Guy. His fear of inciting Guy’s wrath and disapproval acts as a check on his otherwise impulsive nature, compelling him to act out only when explicitly directed.</p><h2>Motives</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Domination:</span> Raynald is primarily driven by a desire to assert his dominance and showcase his power, both on the battlefield and off. This stems from his childhood experiences of being seen as weak and his subsequent transformation into a fearsome warrior.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Let the World Burn:</span> He harbors a deep-seated need to avenge the slights and mockeries of his past. This motive extends to a broader scale as he seeks to disrupt and provoke major political powers, such as through his mission to force Saladin’s hand.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">A Lost Validation:</span> Raynald’s actions are also motivated by a craving for recognition and validation, particularly from figures of authority like Guy de Lusignan, who has filled a paternal role in his life.</p><h2>Interests</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Rivers of Blood:</span> Raynald is deeply interested in demonstrating his martial prowess. He constantly seeks out challenges that allow him to display his strength and combat skills.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Cull the Weak:</span> Raynald can’t stand weakness - especially in his ranks. He actively seeks out weakness amidst his Knights and in the population he interacts with - just to exploit any and all weak spots he can find.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Like a Rabid Dog:</span> His tendency to provoke and challenge others often leads to unnecessary conflicts and can destabilize larger strategic goals. His impulsiveness can make him predictable to his enemies who might exploit this trait.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">No Sense of Empathy:</span> Raynald’s ruthless nature and focus on domination often come at the expense of empathy and regard for others’ suffering, which can alienate potential allies and earn him numerous enemies.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Fear of Inadequacy:</span> Despite his outward bravado, Raynald harbors an internal fear of being seen as weak or inadequate. This fear can drive him to take excessive risks to prove himself, potentially putting him and his forces in danger</p><h1>Combat Tactics</h1><p>Raynald’s approach to combat mirrors his personal nature, characterized by a relentless focus on challenge and exploiting weaknesses. His strategy in battle is straightforward yet effective: identify the most vulnerable aspect of his opponent or the weakest link in a group, and then ruthlessly target that vulnerability to the highest level of brutality possible at present.</p><p>This method reflects a pragmatic, if unscrupulous, mindset. For Raynald, the concepts of honor and fairness hold little sway; his primary objective is the swift and decisive defeat of his adversary. He eschews complex tactics in favor of overwhelming force, applying relentless pressure to prevent his opponents from regaining their footing or mounting a counterattack.</p><p>In gameplay terms, this means that if Raynald’s forces render any party members unconscious, Raynald will either personally strike the unconscious target to kill them off, or order his men to do the same if he is unable.</p><h1>Character Progression</h1><p>Raynald of Chatillon is one of the most static characters in the adventure, he has one goal: To cause chaos and feed his inner beast. Due to sigil and relevant powers, he is directly under the control of Guy of Lusignan and by extension, Sibylla of Jerusalem.</p><h1 style=\"height:0;visibility:hidden\">NPC Sheet</h1><div class=\"sheet\"><div><p>Raynald of Châtillon</p><p>Crimson Lord of Al-Karak, Hound of Jerusalem,<br />Dreadknight of the Kingdom of God</p><p>Medium humanoid (human), chaotic evil</p><p>@UUID[Actor.2v5mbNL0J6eWpMdW]{Raynald Of Châtillon}</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Armor Class</span> 17 (natural armor)</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Points</span> 102 (12d8 + 48)</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Speed</span> 40 ft.</p></div><div><div><p>STR</p><p>20 (+5)</p></div><div><p>DEX</p><p>12 (+1)</p></div><div><p>CON</p><p>18 (+4)</p></div><div><p>INT</p><p>11 (+0)</p></div><div><p>WIS</p><p>14 (+2)</p></div><div><p>CHA</p><p>15 (+2)</p></div></div><div><p><span class=\"bold\">Saving Throws</span> Str +8, Con +7</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Skills</span> Athletics +11, Survival +5</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Senses </span>darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Languages</span> French, Italian</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Challenge</span> 7 (2,900 XP)</p></div><div><p><span class=\"bold\">Damage Absorption. </span>When Sir Raynald takes damage, he adds half of it (minimum of 1) to the next damage he deals until the end of his next turn as the form of force damage.

This is the only lesson I learned from a bygone era of faith and devotion.</p><p>A lifetime ago I was a man of god, an orator, commanding immense authority over the souls of thousands. I led my flock like any good shepherd would, through a journey of redemption, cleansing the Earth and our bodies from sin. Arms and armor we did not have, nor did we need any. For our weapon was holy fire, and wield it we did. Tens of thousands of men marched in unison, judged and executed in unison, under a divine choir led by me. A lifetime ago, my flock was taken from me, for it was revealed to me that my mortal flesh was not enough.</p><p>A lifetime ago, I found myself in the clutches of starvation in Antioch. It was then I realized this mortal self was not enough - not enough for a life of true worship. Whispers agreed, and I found myself a tutor, who promised me another form, one who would breathe in the soul, but would not breathe it out. A pact I signed with the Whispers, and I was turned into a being made of a fallen star in the eyes of my broken, starved brothers of the Crusade. My voice became a beacon of hope and faith, my hands brands of God and the Mother within Whispers, promising bodily transformation to a greater devotee. Seventy eights knights accepted the gifts, and sallied forth from the gates of Antioch, for a pilgrimage of our own, breaking the siege of the Saracen as we departed.</p><p>In the mountains of Sinai, we built our sanctum. A sanctum of stone and flesh, working in unison to understand the secrets that God Almighty laid out for the faithful to discover, to worship forever. It is in this sanctum I will construct the new man, who suffers no weakness of mortality in his devotion to Lord, guided by my Mother within Whispers.</p><h1>Character’s Past</h1><p>Before losing his mortal form into amalgamation with his eldritch sanctum, Peter the Hermit was a man of god who played a critical role at the onset of the Era of the Crusades.</p><p>Heeding the call to war to reclaim the Holy Lands, Peter the Hermit used his skills as an expert orator and his popularity as a member of the clergy to rally the support of the thousands. People’s Crusade, as this army of unarmed pilgrims and peasants were called, and their legacy became of bloodshed and tragedy.</p><p>As the People’s Crusade started its march from France towards the Holy Lands, Peter the Hermit became the leader of tens of thousands of men - who entrusted their lives and consciences to him. This trust, however, was misplaced within Peter, as under his leadership, these crusaders burnt and pillaged towns and communities within Europe itself to find supplies and funds, and even went so far as to massacre the Jewish population of major cities and towns as they marched by.</p><p>The bloody People’s Crusade reached the gates of Constantinople by August 1096. Alexios I Komnenos, the Byzantine Emperor, had already heard the reputation of these men, and was more than happy to ferry this 40,000 strong army and its leader Peter to the other shores of the Bosphorus, away from his capital - and into the hands of the Seljuk Turks.</p><p>Peter and his 40,000 motley crusaders pillaged and burned the Anatolian countryside as they marched from town to town towards the Holy Lands. However, their lack of discipline and arms were all too noticeable for the Seljuk horse lords. The crusaders were goaded into a trap near Civetot, modern day Yalova, and were thoroughly destroyed.</p><p>It was this battle that broke Peter’s beliefs and began shaping him into the eldritch creature he ended up as. The crusader forces right before the battle were bolstered by a combination of Peter’s proclamation of divine protection, and actual, albeit minor, arcane power of holy origin. Victory was ensured for Peter and his close circle of followers, and the Seljuk Turks were only delaying the inevitable plan of God.</p><p>What ended up happening was a true massacre, a fitting end for the bloody People’s Crusade. Arched, whistling arrows pierced the torsos of men of beastly statures, cavalry charges threw unarmored crusaders meters apart, splattering the remains of torn carcasses. Crusader arms, even when blazing with holy fire, failed to pierce heavily armored Sejuk Sipahis. These all were carved to the mind of Peter the Hermit, who, at that moment, decided that the flesh is too weak for God’s work.</p><p>The means of his survival of the ambush is a mystery to all but Peter - yet months later he emerged back in Constantinople. During this time, Peter had also searched for hidden, arcane wisdom, while he waited to link up with the survivors of the People’s Crusade and newly arriving - well equipped - crusaders. He departed as soon as a force sizable enough to cross the Anatolian highlands were assembled.</p><p>His final appearance in his mortal form was in the Siege of Antioch, accompanying the crusaders who were caught in the city that they themselves sieged but a few months past. Burning with the secrets he uncovered in Constantinople, Peter was haunted by the prophetic images in his mind, resurfacing the memories of torn human bodies and screams of faith in Civetot, a sun rising from below Jerusalem, and whispers promising a new man, with flesh and mind fit for divine service. The hunger, disease, and death encountered by the besieged Crusaders within Antioch finally caved in his mind and opened it up to what he called Mother within Whispers, and a pact was sealed.</p><p>Peter rallied men who dared follow him in his final pilgrimage, blessing their arms and armor with an eldritch sigil that none had seen before. He and the seventy eight knights that accepted the Mother’s blessing sallied forth, breaking the siege, before being lost to the eyes of all who did not join this madness.</p><p>Decades later, knights and peasants began emerging within Jerusalem - all marked with the sigil and s strange affliction of the skin. These men who offered services to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, once interrogated, have spoken of one Peter the Hermit, who wishes to extend his invitation to whoever wishes to learn about the new man whose faith is like mountains impenetrable.</p><h2>Motives</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Transcendence of Mortality:</span> Driven by his experiences during the People’s Crusade and the perceived limitations of the human body, Peter seeks to transcend the frailties of flesh through eldritch transformation and create beings more suited to divine service.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Spread of His New Doctrine: </span>Peter is motivated by a desire to propagate his newfound beliefs and transformations, aiming to convert others to his vision of a more perfect, enduring form of worship.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Protection and Expansion of His Sanctum:</span> Peter aims to protect and expand his sanctum in the mountains of Sinai, which serve as both fortress and holy site for his followers and their transformative practices.</p><h2>Interests</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Forbidden Knowledge:</span> Fascinated by arcane wisdom and divine secrets, Peter actively seeks out mystical texts and relics that could enhance his understanding and powers.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Transformation of Others:</span> Peter is deeply interested in converting others to his cause, using both persuasion and eldritch magic to transform them into followers who share his transcended form.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Control Over Followers:</span> He invests significant effort into maintaining control over his minions, ensuring they are completely loyal and integrated into the collective consciousness he is building.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Fanaticism beyond Comprehension:</span> Peter’s unwavering belief in his divine mission can blind him to the moral and ethical consequences of his actions, leading to fanaticism that disregards the well-being of others.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Isolated in a Mountain:</span> His extreme transformation and radical views isolate him from broader society and even from other Sigil Knights who do not share his vision, limiting his ability to influence outside his direct followers.</p><h1>Roleplaying As Peter</h1><p>Peter the Hermit exists within the world with the confidence of a man who has seen all. He senses motion with an anatomical eye, he senses faith and disbelief like sensing light. He sees the mortal form of humanity as inferior, referring to them as a sort of nutrition, food for the brain. He interrogates those who are deemed worthy to extract from them delicious treats of knowledge. So it is possible to see him distracted by the prospect of what he might uncover if he got a hold of your thoughts. Almost like a starved man, staring at a feast.</p><p>His mind is crowded with the minds of many, as his followers are being amalgamated with him within the Sanctum, a constant distraction throughout his day. In the middle of his speech, he tends to stop, tilt his head and listen to emerging thoughts from his minions. He has a constant wonder and knowing smile plastered on his face. An unsettling expression for many. One can sense that he peers through your soul without even trying to.</p><h1>Combat Tactics</h1><p>Peter uses his sanctum strategically in combat scenarios, utilizing its arcane-imbued architecture to create barriers, traps, and illusions that disorient and weaken his enemies. His followers, deeply loyal and transformed, serve as his first line of defense, engaging enemies directly and sacrificing themselves if necessary.</p><p>As a transformed being, Peter wields potent spells that can manipulate minds, invoke fear, or directly harm opponents. His spells often focus on weakening the resolve of his enemies or controlling their actions, making them easier to defeat or convert.</p><h1>Character Progression</h1><p>Peter the Hermit was a prominent figure in the First Crusades but over time, he changed so much and dedicated himself to ascending the best possible version of himself in the dream granted by Whore of Babylon. He may be the only sigil bearer with the actual means to prepare for that world, even standing against Guy and others. He plans to one that dominates there. Peter can realize the adventurers’ power and may try to convince them of the beauty and the potential of that world, emphasizing on being able to do and dream anything they want there, becoming the ultimate gods.</p><h1 style=\"height:0;visibility:hidden\">NPC Sheet</h1><div class=\"sheet\"><div><p>The Remains of<br />Peter the Hermit</p><p>Patriarch of the People’s Crusade &amp; the Maker of the New Faithful</p><p>Medium humanoid (human), neutral evil</p><p>@UUID[Actor.GDWTUund8UNn7jcY]{The Remains Of Peter The Hermit}</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Armor Class</span> 18 (natural armor)</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Points</span> 66 (12d8 + 12)</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Speed</span> 0 ft.</p></div><div><div><p>STR</p><p>22 (+6)</p></div><div><p>DEX</p><p>6 (-2)</p></div><div><p>CON</p><p>13 (+1)</p></div><div><p>INT</p><p>22 (+6)</p></div><div><p>WIS</p><p>20 (+5)</p></div><div><p>CHA</p><p>13 (+1)</p></div></div><div><p><span class=\"bold\">Saving Throws </span>Int +9, Wis +8, Cha +4</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Skills </span>Arcana +12, Religion +12, History +12</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Damage Resistances </span>bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Senses </span>blindsight 30 ft., passive Perception 15</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Languages </span>all</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Challenge</span> 8 (3,900 XP)</p></div><div><p><span class=\"bold\">Immobile.</span> Peter the Hermit cannot move from his embedded location and is considered restrained.</p><p class=\"no-margin\"><span class=\"bold\">Infinite Knowledge. </span>Peter the Hermit knows all spells of 5th level or lower, except necromancy spells.

Until they called on not an army but a horde of butchers in our hour of weakness. Bloodied and divided, my ancestors were subdued and slaughtered.</p><p>I, Saladin, am born with a destiny of vengeance. For years I have fought to unite the fragmented forces of the Crescent, forging a new army to take on the invaders. In courts, halls and libraries of my lands, I outplayed many frail men, persuaded, bribed, and threatened any who dared challenge my guiding hands, the coffers of my legions, my revenge. And on horseback I cornered the Crusader states, castle by castle, hill by hill. The blood I spill is holy, for Jerusalem cannot be left to those who do not know her deepest secrets, who do not respect her traditions and rituals, who refuse her hand in peace.</p><p>Yet I know that revenge breeds revenge, and true strength lies in building an equilibrium, with the world restored under the protection of my armies. Conquering a city, a region, even a continent is easier than ensuring your hold on it. My mission is not just to take the battlements of Jerusalem, but it is to ensure those walls will not change hands again. For this, I vow and pray not for eternal warfare, but for an enduring peace.</p><p>My tutors were wise. For centuries they gathered knowledge of thousands of wise men, whom even in their deaths had much to say. I know what awaits me in Jerusalem - spirits of the past have been forthcoming with information. A taint, a rift, the Mother of Abominations - to whom I will deal only death, something my predecessors were too weak to consider.</p><p>For the moment, I entrust the King of Jerusalem, a kindred spirit with a cursed fate, with the protection of the city. After all, the City of God must be intact, if I am to conquer it - so I dare not raise another enemy against Baldwin, tipping the scales towards his destruction. In fact, I already put my finger on his side of the scale - secretly supplying the King with information and wisdom. However, I have no illusions about the fate of the Leper King. His strength will wane, and he will become feeble, and the wolves in his den will eat each other for the Crown and the secrets of the City of God. When that happens, my army and I will be ready to retake what we have lost.</p><p>These eyes have seen many weak men, failing to unite the land, failing to realize where their true enemies lie, failing to act when the time is right, failing to seize victory when steel meets steel; and when the blood dried, failing to understand the power of mercy.</p><p>Know this, I am not those men. I am Salah ad-Din.</p><p>It is I who shall restore the Holy Lands to Dar al-Islam, to the House of Peace; and it is I who shall unearth and obliterate the horrors hidden beneath Jerusalem. It is I who shall deliver salvation to our world and faith.</p><h1>Character’s Past</h1><p>Saladin, born in Tikrit as Yusuf ibn Ayyub, was marked for greatness early in his life. His title “Salah ad-Din,” which translates to “Righteousness of the Faith,” mirrored the lofty expectations set for him. Raised among the lower nobility, he had the opportunity to receive an extensive education in both warfare and politics. His royal lineage allowed him to study under the guidance of the caliphate in Baghdad with full access to the renowned House of Wisdom. The Caliph who noted young Yusuf’s aptitude was a high ranking member of the Secret Order of Satraps, carrying the millenia old duty of sealing any rifts from this realm to Al-Ghaib. Under the Caliph’s tutorship, Yusuf dedicated his years to studying mundane and arcane texts, learning of warfare, history, politics as well as arcane lore of the world hidden from unsuspecting eyes.</p><p>Most importantly, during his studies Saladin discovered ancient parchments in a secluded part of the library, texts long untouched, revealing aspects of Cyrus the Great’s life. Fascinated, he delved into these parchments, drawing parallels and inspiration from his wisdom and achievements. Among these records, Saladin found references to a seal created by Cyrus beneath Jerusalem, intended to contain a significant, arcane threat. Comparing this with the seal of King Solomon which subdued a Djinn of immense power below Baghdad, he deemed Cyrus’s seal weaker and incomplete. Convinced that this frail seal could not indefinitely contain the danger below Jerusalem, Saladin set a personal mission to eliminate this lurking threat, driven by a deep sense of duty and strategic foresight. The loss of Jerusalem to the Crusaders made Saladin grow anxious about the potential arcane danger - which led him to secretly communicate with the nobility and clergy of Jerusalem which he deemed to be trustworthy. It was these communications that established the future alliance between Baldwin and him against the threat of the Sigil Knights.</p><p>In his early life beyond the hallowed halls of House of Wisdom, Saladin served as a cavalry commander, where he gained first hand experience in warfare. However, his ambitions extended beyond military prowess; he understood that to rectify the situation in Jerusalem, he needed greater authority. He built his own roads to political power for years, gathering support among the nobility and the people with his military victories. When the time was right, Saladin orchestrated a political coup d’état, seizing control of Egypt and establishing himself as its ruler, thus marking the start of the Ayyubid Dynasty. This strategic move significantly elevated his power, positioning him to pursue his broader goals.</p><p>Saladin distinguished himself as a commander of exceptional intelligence and skill. He overcame numerous threats and engaged the Crusaders on many occasions, emerging victorious in nearly all encounters, with a single exception. His sole defeat came at the hands of the young Baldwin, whose remarkable courage and unwavering faith not only earned Saladin’s great respect but also left a lasting impression on the Sultan. With dignitaries and whispers to the right ears, Saladin warned Baldwin of the danger lurking below Jerusalem - a warning that Baldwin managed to corroborate with the information from his Whitebook.</p><p>In another lifetime, the two men could have easily united their forces against the eldritch conspiracy that threatened the lives of everyone in the Holy Lands. Yet the inexorable currents of fate and the looming shadow of the end times cast them as adversaries. Both courts were filled with warmongers, and potential usurpers; both men were filled with the dread emanating from their time running out. Destiny placed both Crowns on the path to war - and they could only hope to delay the bloodshed until whatever threat lurked below Jerusalem was ended.</p><p>In anticipation of a decisive and large-scale conflict, Saladin now prepares for a campaign that might signal the end of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. His mamluks and beys, eager for triumph, exert pressure. Torn between his obligations to his kingdom and his resolve to vanquish all supernatural menaces, Saladin finds himself at a crossroads, balancing the weight of duty against the fervor of his aspirations.</p><h2>Motives</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Reconquest:</span> Saladin is determined to reclaim Jerusalem from the Crusaders. However, he is well aware of the danger lurking beneath Jerusalem. At the moment of the campaign’s start, he places Jerusalem’s safety over his plans of conquest - which lead him to help Baldwin uproot the Sigil Knights and uncover the conspiracy.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">An Enduring Peace:</span> He understands that unless permanent arrangements are made, the fate of Holy Lands will be of perpetual warfare where no side will have an enduring foothold on Jerusalem. Therefore, he is trying to win over people’s hearts, while at the same time, forging a massive army.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Internal Affairs:</span> Saladin is fighting hard to keep his court in order. With layers upon layers of plans to avoid unnecessary blood and his wishes to see Jerusalem free of the eldritch threat before he takes it - he is taking his time to unleash his war machine on the Crusader States. This has made several warmongers in his court very anxious - and the Sultan is looking to discipline or eradicate them.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Eradication of Arcane Threats:</span> Motivated by his discoveries and the teachings from the House of Wisdom, Saladin aims to confront and eliminate the arcane dangers lurking beneath Jerusalem, which he perceives as a significant threat to the entire region.</p><h2>Interests</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">The Waning Seal below Jerusalem:</span> Aware of the failing seal below Jerusalem, Saladin is interested in finding out more about what horror it was crafted to contain and how to safely dispose of whatever is trying to break free from it.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Brewing Discontent in Court:</span> Saladin is besieged, not by an army, but a cadre of nobles and warlords he united, who all want him to stop delaying the march on Crusader states. The sultan is looking for ways to stabilize his court and win Baldwin the time he needs to eradicate the Sigil Knights. This effort, however, is doomed, as the Leper King is not long for this world.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">An Edge in Warfare:</span> The Avenging General is a true military leader, who understands the intricacies of warfare much better than almost all of his contemporaries. He is looking for any edge in combat that he can muster - whether it is a new weapon, a new stratagem, or a new spell.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">A Mind for Results:</span> Saladin is exceptionally focused on outcomes he desires, unconcerned with the measures he must take to achieve his ultimate goal. He would have been a butcher had he not understood the role of mercy when it came to solidifying his rule over land. This means that if he is not convinced that a possible solution is worth investigating in his grand calculations, he will disregard any humane reasons to pursue that solution.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Results, regardless of the Cost:</span> In direct contrast with his previous flaw, if he deems that the cooperation of certain people is necessary for his plans moving forward, he will go out of his way to not use force against them - to the dismay of his generals and advisors.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Internal Conflict Over Arcane Matters: </span>His awareness of the arcane threats beneath Jerusalem places him in a precarious position, torn between his role as a ruler and his duty as a guardian against supernatural dangers. This dual responsibility can lead to internal conflicts and decisions that might not align with the expectations or norms of his culture or his allies.</p><h1>Roleplaying As Saladin</h1><p>Saladin<span class=\"bold\"> </span>is a man of direct communication. His approach to dialogue is unreserved, never shying away from expressing his thoughts and desires - a luxury his immense political and military power affords him. Yet his political acumen also ensures that his directness is always tempered with his charisma and wit to persuade or even manipulate if he needs to. In every interaction, Saladin is calm, collected, and meticulously planned. However, his confidence is such that this meticulous planning never becomes apparent to others, bar from those who are also masters of rhetoric. Instead, they see a leader who speaks with natural ease and assuredness.</p><p>His education, befitting a person of royal stature, is of the highest caliber, whether the topic is politics, science, warfare, or arcane.</p><h1>Combat Tactics</h1><p>Saladin is a master of both strategy and combat. From his youth, he was shaped by the teachings of the finest warriors and tacticians, an education that honed his innate abilities to their zenith. Throughout his life, he has continually refined these skills, emerging not just as a warrior, but as a strategist of the highest order.</p><p>His intelligence in battle is marked by an acute awareness of his surroundings. Saladin never isolates himself; he is perpetually surrounded by his loyal men, a tactical decision that ensures he is seldom caught vulnerable or alone. This not only fortifies his physical defense, but also serves as a psychological deterrent to his enemies. He leads his entourage of warriors and mamluks deep in the battlefield, shouting orders, and exposing enemy weaknesses for his men to exploit.</p><p>A true master of tactic and strategy, Saladin would pull the enemy heavily armed fighters into quagmires, and allow precise attacks against targets that have little melee protection.</p><p>Saladin also has access to some spellcraft to bolster the abilities of his men at arms - and banish any summoned creature who does not originate in this realm of existence.</p><h1>Character Progression</h1><p>Saladin is determined in his cause to capture Jerusalem and put an end to evil that lies beneath it. He is desperate in that regard and is ready to do even the harshest of things for it. He is strict and definitive and is determined to raze Jerusalem to the ground if it means to stop the evil. Through adventurers’ actions, he may gain a new perspective in that regard and be convinced to let the matter into their hands, realizing their value, depending on the acts of the adventurers. If not intervened he does not fear to be written down in history as the leader who destroyed the holiest city.</p><div class=\"box-item\"><div><p class=\"title\">The Sword of Saladin</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Yatagan, legendary, requires attunement</p></div><div><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/saladin-swords.webp\" style=\"margin-top:-100px;shape-outside:url(modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/saladin-swords.webp);shape-image-threshold:0.5;shape-margin:20px;margin-left:-27px;float:left\" /><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>It is said that this sword was a gift to Saladin from Nur ad-Din Zengi himself. At the time of its gifting, this was a masterfully crafted blade, but it held no magical properties. Yet the current state of the blade is much more powerful, hinting at Saladin’s skills in enchanting artifacts.</p><p>The Sword of Saladin is a yatagan with a classic curved blade; its hilt is decorated with black gems, the insides of which are adorned with purple silken script telling the legend of the Caliph Umar, who took Jerusalem in the 7th century CE.

Enduring, it could have been, had my mortal body not betrayed its master.</p><p>Here I am, confined within the tormenting prison that is my own flesh. The pain is burdensome, yet what is truly tormenting is the time of my reign being stolen from me, being stolen from the men and women of the Holy Lands.</p><p>Within this decay, I learned a stern lesson. There are truths of the universe man can’t change. My fleeting life is one such truth. I will die soon. But before I die, I will ensure a legacy that will echo in eternity, I will carve out the dark souls and foul beasts corrupting The City of God from within.</p><p>As the melting skin upon my back languishes with each fleeting breath, my intellect remains unyielding, sharpening like a finely honed blade. While my enemies discount me as a dead man, I perceive the shadows of treachery, conspirators eager to dismantle the foundation I have meticulously laid with blade and quill. Even a dead man walking, no move of theirs I can’t predict, no conspiracy I can’t foil, no treachery I can’t respond in a force tenfold.</p><p>This fragile equilibrium of power that I have nurtured, the legacy entrusted to me, now weighs upon my shoulders like a mountainous burden, and I intend to ensure its stay. As my physical form succumbs to decay, I witness my enemies eyes’ alight with sinister anticipation - against whom no alliance is unholy. I shall stand resolute; I refuse to allow them to tarnish the legacy I have cultivated, nor will I permit the desecration of the City of God.</p><h1>Character’s Past</h1><p>Baldwin IV’s life story is marked by early challenges and remarkable resilience. At the age of nine, he was placed under the guidance of William of Tyre, a well-educated and worldly man of belief. It was here that the first signs of Baldwin’s affliction appeared; the young heir did not react to pain in his right arm, a condition that initially baffled his tutor. Physicians from all across the world were brought in to treat him and teach him horse riding, a vital skill for a nobleman of his status. Despite only having sensation in one hand, Baldwin became adept at controlling a horse with his knees, showing early signs of determination and adaptability.</p><p>The stigma associated with leprosy delayed a formal diagnosis, sparing Baldwin from being sent to the Order of St. Lazarus, a fate that would have isolated him due to his condition. As he grew into adolescence, he displayed a striking resemblance to his father, not only in appearance but also in his mannerisms and speech, although he struggled with a stutter. Baldwin was noted for his sharp memory and keen interest in history and stories, a testament to his intellectual curiosity.</p><p>The reality of his leprosy became undeniable during his reign, with his condition worsening over time, particularly affecting his limbs and face. Despite this, he broke with tradition by remaining among his people, a decision that surprised many, including observers from the Muslim world. His illness also meant that he could not marry or have children, making the marriage and succession of his sister Sibylla a matter of urgency.</p><p>Baldwin was apprehensive about Sibylla marrying someone like Guy de Lusignan, fearing that Guy might succeed him after his death. Prior to her marriage, Baldwin had not been particularly attentive to Sibylla, leaving her feeling neglected. Aware that her association with Guy would capture her brother’s attention, Sibylla initially got involved with him. By the time Baldwin realized the gravity of the situation, it was too late to intervene, leading him to blame himself for inadvertently driving his sister towards his adversaries.</p><p>Once in power, Baldwin displayed strategic acumen by planning a major offensive against Egypt, capitalizing on Saladin’s engagement in Aleppo. This marked his first experience in warfare, where he actively participated despite his physical limitations, demonstrating a commitment to his role as a leader and a warrior. Despite his young age of 16, Baldwin achieved victory, elevating his status as Jerusalem’s last hope. He was perceived as the one capable of halting the longstanding retreat against Egypt. Baldwin shared this belief until his illness weakened him. During this period, Baldwin and Saladin developed a respectful rivalry. Saladin recognized Baldwin as a formidable commander, leading to a mutual and immense respect. While Saladin was anticipated to be the ruler who would reclaim Jerusalem, Baldwin was seen as the one who would preserve the Christian presence in the Holy Lands.</p><p>With his ascension to kingship, Baldwin received the White Book of Jerusalem, a tome detailing the true history of the city, including its arcane aspects. Unlike most kings who typically overlook such mystical matters until they become unavoidable, Baldwin was captivated. He dedicated himself to thoroughly reading and comprehending the entire book, making it his mission to rid his city of the arcane terrors it faced.</p><p>He discovered the secrets of the seals beneath Jerusalem and the mysteries lurking behind the doors from the White Book. To locate and fortify these seals, and find a cure for his affliction, he commenced an excavation beneath the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where the first seal is rumored to be hidden.</p><h2>Motives</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Unite the Bloodline:</span> Baldwin seeks to draw Sibylla back to his side in this conflict. He is worried about her marriage and her involvement in the future of Jerusalem. His aim is to repair their relationship and ensure her allegiance to him.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">A Matter of Succession:</span> He is troubled by the decision of whom to bequeath his kingdom to. Aware of the many eyes coveting his throne, he fears that none of the contenders could maintain the fragile equilibrium he has painstakingly established.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Approaching War &amp; Peace:</span> He worries that without his presence to uphold peace, Saladin and his army might decimate Jerusalem and demolish the kingdom he has laboriously built. He aims to devise a plan so comprehensive and enduring that it will resonate through generations, safeguarding Jerusalem from those who seek its destruction, even long after his death.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Enemies Within:</span> He seeks to gain a more profound understanding of the Sigil Knights - who were referred to numerous times in the White Book as a cursed force that allowed the conquest of Jerusalem.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">A Dying Body:</span> Desperate for a remedy to his ailment, he delves deeply into the pages of the White Book. He is in search of a cure, hoping that the ancient tome holds the key to healing his sickness. He thinks whatever is below the Church of the Holy Sepulchre can help him. Operating under the pretext of renovation, he orchestrates an excavation, carefully concealing his true purpose.</p><h2>Interests</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Deciphering the White Book:</span> Baldwin has been nearly obsessed with the White Book ever since it was handed down to him. He is fascinated by the arcane events in Jerusalem and surprised by how much they have been overlooked.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Keeping the Peace, for Now:</span> Baldwin is attempting to do things differently - even better - than what his predecessors had done. Rather than being overly action-oriented, he is striving to win the war politically. With his political talents, he has managed to maintain a gentle peace between Egypt and Jerusalem.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Uncovering the Secrets of Jerusalem:</span> Baldwin is highly intrigued by the history of Jerusalem, focusing on both its political and arcane aspects. He aims to learn from the past while improving upon areas where others failed to succeed.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Overburdened:</span> Baldwin is weighed down by the realization that, despite possessing significant power, he is unable to halt the corruption ravaging his city - and his despair is hindering his rationale.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">His Final Hours:</span> Baldwin’s health deteriorates, casting a shadow over his ambitious plans. The fear of succumbing to his illness before fulfilling his goals haunts him, adding a layer of urgency and vulnerability to his endeavors.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Sibling Rivalry: </span>His deep-seated remorse regarding his treatment of his sister is a personal regret that threatens to cloud his judgment at critical moments.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Obsessed with the Whitebook:</span> His fixation on the enigmatic White Book occupies his thoughts. This obsession, while driven by a quest for knowledge and power, risks becoming a distraction, potentially diverting his focus from the immediate and pressing challenges at hand.</p><h1>Roleplaying As Baldwin</h1><p>Baldwin possesses a radiant presence, with his low voice and well-considered speech commanding respect. That being said, Baldwin does have a mild stutter - which he occasionally covers with simple spellcraft. Although he is constantly in pain, a condition he has endured all his life, he has learned to manage it effectively. This pain might occasionally be evident in his movements but seldom affects his speech. Known for his respectfulness and calm demeanor, his composure often instills a sense of unease in others. He is observant, often scrutinizing people under his mask, analyzing their mannerisms as if he could see into their souls. Baldwin is thoughtful, typically pausing to think before speaking, and is known for his non-erratic demeanor. His rare displays of anger contribute to his image as a cool and collected ruler.</p><h1>Combat Tactics</h1><p>Baldwin IV, marked by a fragile frame and marred by open wounds, is a figure seemingly unsuited for the brutal demands of combat. Yet beneath this delicate exterior lies a reservoir of formidable strength, a power he can summon in brief, intense bursts. This unexpected prowess makes him a formidable opponent, one whose frailty belies a deadly capability in battle.</p><p>However, this physical engagement comes with a perilous edge. Baldwin’s illness, ever-present and insidious, poses a risk not just to himself but to those he comes into contact with. His very touch carries the threat of contagion, adding a layer of danger to any confrontation. This aspect of his condition renders him a unique combatant, one whom many would find daunting to face.</p><p>His presence in battle, therefore, is a rarity, a moment of dire necessity when the king must call upon his hidden strength. In these fleeting instances, Baldwin IV transforms from a ruler constrained by his physical ailments to a warrior of surprising vigor and resilience. Yet, the shadow of his illness looms over these moments, a constant reminder of the cost of his involvement in physical strife and the risk it poses to those around him.</p><h1>Character Progression</h1><p>Baldwin, starts of the game believing it is paramount that he must find a cure to his condition as he believes he is the only person that can save Jerusalem. In order to find a cure, he cared not what ancient evil he would awaken. However, in time, Baldwin realizes the benefit of people of the realm is more important and whatever lies in wait below Jerusalem is a far greater threat than his life a safeguard. He forgoes his search for the cure and aids the adventurers in the best way he can, in defeating Whore of Babylon.</p><div class=\"box-item\"><div><p class=\"title\">The Mask of The Leper King</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Wondrous item, legendary, requires attunement</p></div><div><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>This marble mask is carved to resemble a kingly visage and adorned with fine lines and astonishing details.

There’s usually no remedy for leprosy; it is only a question of time how much you can endure. It makes no distinction between kings and commoners.

Thus, I disagree with my captor - human form is adequate enough for any work, divine, arcane or mundane - as long as its inquisitiveness is honed to create necessary tools and companions.</p><p>But I am getting ahead of myself. I am Ismail al-Jazari, father of machinecraft, and very recently a willing captive, student, and a teacher at an eldritch abomination’s lair. If you are hearing this message, it seems my Muzahir - a voice recording motionful avionic machine - is working as intended, a feat more important than my current whereabouts as future generations will surely realize.</p><p>Disregarding my current predicament with the said eldritch abomination, it is imperative that I must continue telling you about my work which I very much would like to preserve for future society, from any awakening ancient deities, cataclysmic religious clashes, and talking tortoises.</p><p>In order to defe…</p><p class=\"italic\">The Muzahir device you were hearing this speech from seems to have powered down for a moment.

The metal bird stops the voice recording, and turns to you, inquisitively.</p><h1>Character’s Past</h1><p>Growing up amidst the greatest scientific minds of Baghdad, a city known for its rich intellectual heritage, al-Jazari was the offspring of the library’s caretaker, a man more concerned with the physical upkeep of the library than the wealth of knowledge it contained. This environment, however, was a fertile ground for young al-Jazari’s curious and inquisitive mind.</p><p>While assisting his father, al-Jazari found himself irresistibly drawn to the contents of the books and parchments in the library. He would eavesdrop on the discussions of scholars, absorbing the fragments of conversations about topics beyond his understanding at the time. His yearning for knowledge led him to implore one of the library’s pupils to teach him to read, a skill that opened the doors to a world of learning and discovery.</p><p>Once literate, Al-Jazari would sneak into the library, studying by candlelight, his passion for learning undimmed by the multiple times he was caught. His dedication did not go unnoticed, and one of the teachers, moved by his fervor for education, took him under his wing. This mentorship provided al-Jazari with an intensive education until he reached the age of 16.</p><p>However, feeling that he had absorbed all that Baghdad could offer, and aware that his unique demeanor set him apart from his peers, al-Jazari embarked on a journey to learn from scholars beyond the city’s walls. It was during his studies in Damascus under a renowned mechanic that he encountered Saladin. Al-Jazari’s blunt, straightforward manner, a byproduct of his total social unawareness, caught Saladin’s attention. Saladin, recognizing al-Jazari’s unflinching dedication to truth and his disregard for pleasantries, valued his honesty, intelligence, and principles.</p><p>Brought to the palace in Cairo, al-Jazari was provided with everything he needed to thrive: a well-equipped laboratory, an extensive collection of books, and an endless supply of resources. In this environment, free from constraints and surrounded by support, al-Jazari could fully dedicate himself to his craft of creating automata and clockwork wonders.</p><p>In Saladin’s orders, Al-Jazari has also created a massive, self-sustaining prison below Cairo, to house the enemies and weapons that Saladin deems too important to perish. Once this prison complex was built, he also offered to be taken by the Lorekeepers in exchange for the final key to the seals beneath Jerusalem. Although Saladin initially protested this obscene exchange, Al-Jazari claimed that he was sure of his safety, and the fact that he had left enough records of his work, so that any information he may have had would survive his untimely demise.</p><h1>Roleplaying As al-Jazari</h1><p>Al-Jazari is a character driven by an unquenchable thirst for truth and an obsessive pursuit of understanding. His mind, intensely focused and analytical, is akin to a relentless machine, tirelessly dissecting and examining the world around him.</p><p>That being said, his interaction with the social world is marked by a distinct disconnect. Al-Jazari’s inability to interpret social cues renders him immune to the typical influences of persuasion or charm. Human emotions and subtleties often elude him, seeming as distant and abstract concepts. Instead, he views humans primarily through the lens of their potential as biological mechanisms, an approach that makes him less effective as a companion but exceptionally skilled as an engineer.</p><h2>Motives</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">A Lifetime of Study:</span> Driven by a relentless desire to understand and innovate, al-Jazari seeks to push the boundaries of what is possible with machinecraft, aiming to transcend the limitations of the human body and mind through technology.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Science Must Endure: </span>Al-Jazari is motivated by the need to ensure his discoveries and inventions endure beyond his lifetime, making significant efforts to document and safeguard his work.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Synergies of the Arcane and the Mechanical:</span> Intrigued by the intersections of the arcane and the mechanical, al-Jazari explores how these two fields can be integrated to create devices and mechanisms of extraordinary capability.</p><h2>Interests</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Father of Robotics: </span>Al-Jazari has a profound interest in creating sophisticated automata and robotic systems that can perform various tasks, from mundane to complex, potentially even mimicking human actions.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Teaching and Mentoring: </span>Despite his situation, al-Jazari values the opportunity to teach and pass on his knowledge to others, which aligns with his goal of ensuring his technological advancements continue to benefit future generations.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Human Disconnect: </span>Al-Jazari’s intense focus on his work and his difficulty in understanding social cues often isolate him from others, potentially leading to misunderstandings or missed collaborations.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Overconfidence in Technology: </span>His belief in the supremacy of technology can sometimes be a blind spot, leading him to underestimate the complexities of problems that might require more nuanced solutions.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">With No Regard to Human Safety:</span> In his pursuit of knowledge and his commitment to his work, al-Jazari can sometimes neglect his personal safety, putting himself in situations that might compromise his well-being.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Fear of Losing His Touch: </span>Al-Jazari is an intelligent man with the level of a genius and he regularly faces the fear of losing that due to getting old and many other reasons; curses, spell rebound and such. This became an obsession in his thoughts and is exploited in Library Pageless dungeon.</p><h1>Combat Tactics</h1><p>Al-Jazari’s physical limitations, marked by his frail stature, make him unsuitable for direct combat. Aware of his vulnerability, he compensates through his exceptional talent in engineering, particularly in the realm of robotics. His ingenuity finds its expression in the creation of robots designed for combat.</p><p>In every situation except the one he finds himself at the start of the Sigil of Jerusalem storyline, al-Jazari ensures that he is accompanied by at least one of these robotic guardians. These creations are not only a shield against potential threats but also a physical manifestation of his brilliance and resourcefulness. They serve as his protectors, compensating for his physical frailty with their mechanical strength and precision.</p><h1>Character Progression</h1><p>Al-Jazari traded his freedom to ensure that Cylinder of Cyrus is in the hands of Saladin. However, it was the ultimate act that mentioned his flaws: He completely disregarded his own safety. If the adventurers successfully save him in the Library Pageless without a significant decrease in his Intelligence, he will meditate on his fears and grow as a person. If he suffers a significant decrease, he will dedicate himself for the preservation of knowledge and developments he already achieved.</p><div class=\"box-item\"><div><p class=\"title\">Amulet of Al-Jazari</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Wondrous item, legendary, requires attunement</p></div><div><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>This clockwork amulet’s past is a mystery, though it does possess Egyptian hieroglyphics and Phonecian runes hinting at its ancient Mediterranean origin.

I left the mantle of a holy warrior and took on that of a God - the God of the Descent and the Ascension. The God that takes on the Holy Matriarch’s Hand and leads her upwards to the world she was locked away from. Tammuz I should be called, reincarnated from the prayers and rituals of the Old World as my namesake did a million times. Yet this truth only I and her whispers know. For everyone else, I am Guy de Lusignan, Knight Commander, Bane of the Saracen, Future King of the Kingdom of God.</p><p>A lifetime ago, I was a warrior monk, emboldened by the call to Crusade, and I journeyed eastward to redeem my soul of sin. Our pilgrimage took us to Constantinople, and upon its gates we were stopped and granted no passage into the city. Unclean and dangerous the Emperor of the Romans called us - and his dignitaries only parlayed with us to hasten our venture towards the lands of the Saracen. As our commanders negotiated for rations, armaments, and ships, I snuck into the Eternal City, for I had heard of her glory and whispers of arcane secrets. I believed that powers of magic hidden in the City can hasten our Crusade and lead us to victory.</p><p>My first descent was into the Basilica Cistern. There, I braved many accursed dangers and eldritch locks to seek the audience of an ancient being - one I will later learn to be the kin of my Mother Goddess. With each step that lowered me into the lowest pit of the Byzantine Dungeon, whispers further gripped my mind, promising the power of Gods. Kneeling before the Great Being, clad in the skin of a Dragon - my true purpose in life was revealed. My mind and memory were marked with the knowledge to revive a Deity and with the ritual to bestow inhuman power upon my brother knights. Within the walls of the Byzantine dungeon, I was stripped of my identity, and took a new one - one bearing a truly divine purpose that ascended beyond millenia - “Tammuz.” The Scaled Creature presented me with a new name, and my Ishtar I was to free.</p><p>I ascended to the city, with a new self, and for decades I became a ghost. I led many crusaders from the shadows, offering my services as a knight, a mentor, a healer, and a fool. Many identities I have consumed, almost all belonged to the knights fallen in battle and forgotten. Once the crusade reached the walls of Jerusalem, it was the power of my gifts that took the city. New Knightly Orders I raised in The Holy Mother’s name, clad in the Sigils that belonged to the Goddess chained right below our very feet. For decades I conducted rituals and dark sacrifices, using the bloodshed of the Crusades to nurture the Womb below.</p><p>Once I learned that my Goddess had a future Queen to take as a vessel - I took on yet another name, of another fallen knight. Guy de Lusignan, future King of the Kingdom of God, husband of Queen Sibylla.</p><h1>Character’s Past</h1><p>Guy de Lusignan’s origin point is that of a nameless warrior monk, joining the Crusade when it was first called by Pope Urban II. He traveled eastward, accompanying a small group of armed pilgrims, mostly the common folk, with little in regards of rations, armaments, and funds.</p><p>The pilgrims were stopped at the gates of Constantinople and were barred from entry to the city at the order of Alexios I, the Byzantine emperor. The nameless monk snuck into the city to uncover magical artifacts that he heard rumors of, that he believed could help the Crusade succeed. Once inside the city, he made his way to Basilica Cistern, which hosted an ancient prison complex below her waters.</p><p>The nameless monk, fighting his way down to the lowest pit of the Byzantine prison, met Shahmeran - an ancient creature of immense power that hailed from the time of Nebuchadnezzar’s ritual. Shahmeran broke into the mind of the monk, seeding him with information about the Avatar of Ishtar, a sibling to Shahmeran imprisoned below Jerusalem, and how to free her. She sealed this information by mesmerizing the monk with the whispers of an ancient deity’s tale - Tammuz, the Sumerian God who saves Goddess Ishtar from the Underworld. With arcane invocations and carefully crafted silvery words, the monk emerged from the prison with a new identity and visions of Godhood.</p><p>As the pilgrimage continued to the Holy Lands, the monk’s mind twisted and turned with the imagery of a Matron Goddess, and broken divine prophecies, with aspects of Sumerian myths mixed with Biblical passages. Anatolian plains and highlands proved extremely difficult for the Crusaders to pass, with the death of tens of thousands of warrior pilgrims from constant raids from Seljuk horse lords. While stranded Crusader groups perish, the monk takes on the identities of fallen priests and knights to make his way towards the main force, unhindered by concerns of rank and bloodline.</p><p>Once the Crusading army reaches the gates of Jerusalem - mostly broken and out of supplies - the Monk meets with the commanders of the Crusaders and offers them the power to conquer the city. While no certain records exist, the occult archivists claim that the Monk took on the identity of Raymond of Saint-Gilles in this meeting. The offer was almost irrefusable for the desperate crusaders who feared a Fatimid counterattack was imminent.</p><p>The Lords of the Crusade participated in an eldritch ritual, in which The Monk took power from the Avatar of Ishtar and bestowed it upon Crusaders who accepted becoming Sigil Knights. With the arcane power of a Goddess flowing through their veins, Sigil Knights led the offensive that broke through the Walls of Jerusalem. With zeal and eldritch orders from The Monk and The Whore clawing at their mind, the Sigil Knights massacred the population of Jerusalem - and the remaining Crusaders followed their inhuman example. This bloodshed was but one step in bringing back the Avatar of Ishtar back to Earth - as it nourished the Womb in the Jerusalem Catacombs which would give birth to a Dragon in the future.</p><p>With Jerusalem secured and Sigil Knights forming Knight Orders to recruit more of the pilgrims in the Holy Lands, The Monk once again disappeared. His proximity to his Ishtar, and the fading seal that held her away from this world, focused the monk’s mind, heightened his arcane prowess, but also faded any recollection of his past to oblivion.</p><p>Decades passed and the conspiracy to bring back The Whore of Babylon has silently progressed from within the shadows. The leprosy of King Baldwin the IV signaled the beginning of the end. The Monk returned as Guy de Lusignan, to seize the hand of Queen Sibylla in marriage - to prepare her to be a vessel for his Goddess’ return. Yet Earthly concerns plague the final chapter of the prophecy: The Sigil Knights are broken with infighting; Baldwin - despite his condition- has been defiant in letting go of his control over Jerusalem, and in the South, the Avenging General Saladin has raised a mighty host to take back the Kingdom of God. Guy de Lusignan – the God Tammuz-to-be – now has to come back from the shadows, use force to crush any resistance to his rule in the Holy Lands, and bring about the Grand Resurgence of The Whore of Babylon!</p><h2>Motives</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Divine Ascension:</span> Guy de Lusignan’s only focus in life is to free Ishtar from the “Underworld” as Tammuz did in the legends. Any who stand in the way of his quest must perish.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Acquire a Mortal Vessel:</span> His plan to resurrect the Whore of Babylon requires a vessel - the mortal body of a Queen of the City of God - and fates have bestowed the Nameless Monk a suitable candidate: Sibylla. Guy already has her hand in marriage, and is looking to further manipulate the Queen into accepting dissolving her soul to make room for that of a Goddess.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Shepherd of a Dragon:</span> He is aware of the threat that the Armies of Saladin and Baldwin pose for his conspiracy. To make sure his Matriarch Goddess’ awakening is unhindered - he is using the Womb below Jerusalem to birth the Dragon of Ishtar. The Womb requires bloodshed to feed, and Guy is more than willing to provide that. Once awakened, the Dragon will wreak havoc on any who dare challenge the Ascension.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Unification of the Sigil Knights: </span>Tammuz is driven to unify and strengthen the Sigil Knights, ensuring they are a formidable force loyal to the cause of The Whore of Babylon, crucial for the enforcement of her will upon her resurgence.</p><h2>Interests</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Arcane Knowledge and Rituals:</span> Tammuz is deeply interested in arcane rituals, especially those related to resurrection and divine empowerment. His years of study and practice have made him a master of dark arts and forbidden knowledge.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Manipulation of Power Dynamics:</span> He is fascinated by the manipulation of political and military power to achieve his divine objectives, using his position within the Crusades and later as Guy de Lusignan to maneuver key figures and resources.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">History and Prophecy:</span> Tammuz invests time into understanding the prophecies that foretell the return of The Whore of Babylon, aligning his actions with these ancient texts to ensure their fulfillment.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Transformation and Identity:</span> With a history of taking on multiple identities, Tammuz is interested in the concept of transformation—not just physically but also in terms of identity and essence, reflecting his metamorphosis into a divine being.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">A Broken Psyche:</span> The Nameless Monk’s mind is utterly lost. While his focus on any event relevant to the conspiracy is razor sharp, he - as Guy de Lusignan - is absolutely disinterested in whatever implications his actions mean for the wider world.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Tongues that Must Be Cut:</span> He is overly protective of the secrets of Jerusalem and Mesopotamia, as they could reveal potential weaknesses in his conspiracy. Hence, he can be goaded into making mistakes if he can be convinced that a crucial knowledge will be passed to his enemies.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Imposing Leader:</span> He is overbearing toward his allies, which has led to desertion and infighting. Most of the Sigil Knights have broken away from the first alliance, and are looking for ways to free themselves from the Sigils, or using the Sigils for their own benefit rather than continuing The Monk’s quest.</p><h1>Roleplaying As Guy</h1><p>Guy exists in two worlds. He needs to play the part of the future King of Jerusalem, and that of a Knight Commander of the Crusades - which means he will have to play the court politics against King Baldwin, who deeply suspects the true intentions of Guy. While he is within this setting - he is a courageous Knight, who shies away from no battle and encourages the Kingdom of Jerusalem to meet Saladin’s army in the field. He is courteous and carefully balances Baldwin’s charisma with his own - rallying support of the warlike crusaders and nobles.</p><p>For those who truly know him, however, he is the self proclaimed champion of the Avatar of Ishtar, a madman that has millenia-old knowledge engraved in his psyche. When he is free of the confines of the real world, he speaks in parables and prophecies, showcasing how far gone his true personality is.</p><h1>Combat Tactics</h1><p>Guy of Lusignan is a legendary swordsman – one who is empowered with his Sigil. If fighting as a warrior, he dashes to the weakest enemy and continues his murderous rampage from one weak link to another.</p><p>If encountered beyond the veil of the public eye, he will summon Sigil Knights to protect him - and resurrect any fallen Knights to jump once more into the fray.</p><h1>Character Progression</h1><p>Guy is a determined man and focused on his cause: to bring Whore of Babylon to the earth. In the beginning of the story, he is open to manipulation only by one character: Sibylla of Jerusalem. She is the only one who could convince Guy to act in a chosen way. Guy is usually a cautious man with at least a hundred-years of experience in the world. Due to his goals being close he is more prone to make mistakes, as he is ultimately manipulated by Sibylla to attack the adventurers when she is done with him. So in terms of character Guy becomes more open to manipulations and mistakes.</p><div class=\"box-item\"><div><p class=\"title\">The Silver Cloak</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Wondrous item, legendary, requires attunement</p></div><div><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p>Adorned with handwoven symbols of Christian and Mesopotamian origins, this cloak is surrounded by a gentle hum of singing and whispers.

His ambition soared beyond the heavens, coveting the dominion of both sky and Earth, daring to usurp the divine might of Aspects - who Man knew as Gods and Goddesses - that from their celestial thrones judged us with disdain.</p><p>It was Nebuchadnezzar, the first amongst us, who vanished into the oblivion of the Otherrealm, his essence not hastily swallowed by the endless void. Yet, my kin and I, we endured beyond his fading echo. By the arcane ritual, a shard of promised power was bestowed upon us, a gift requiring the sacrifice of our very humanity. Only fragments of what once made us human remained, clinging to the essence of our transformed selves.</p><p>Under the celestial watch of Ishtar, amidst the stars that bore witness to our rebirth, I transcended with a seeded womb. On the sanctified ground where the third circle of the ritual was drawn, my transformation was complete. Clinging to the vestiges of my humanity, I was blessed with the role of the Mother, as my visage and form took on the aspect of a Dragon, sublime and terrifying. Thus reborn, I became the embodiment of the Whore, divine guardian of fertility and motherhood, realms sacred and profane.</p><p>My temples were filled with the hymns of acolytes and worshippers, seekers of my blessing, drawn by the allure of my blessings. Silent legions rose at my command, rallying beneath the Banner of the Mother, the Whore, and the Womb. With a purpose divine and unyielding, we marched to the ends of the ancient Earth, heralding an era of conquest serene, of dreams unending, where sleep knew no awakening. Such were the promises, honeyed and intoxicating, to a world wearied by endless conflict and despair.</p><p>Yet conquest begat conquest, power begat coveting, and a crown begat betrayal. My earthly form shattered as destiny, cruel and unyielding, steered my course toward a valley ablaze. By the decree of the Eastern King, deemed an abomination against the natural order, my retinue was sundered, cut down by steel and spell. After days of relentless battle and pursuit, my powers too waned.</p><p>Born beneath the heavens, sculpted by the will of Ishtar, it was my fate to be forever entwined with that of the cursed deity. It was in Judea where the Immortals of the King ensnared me, stripping me of my divinity, condemning me to languish beneath the Seal of David.</p><p>Yet, this seal bore incompletion, a whispering harbinger of my eventual resurgence. I knew, as the ages would roll forth, my powers would stir once more from their slumber. In this foretold revival, bound by the destiny bestowed upon me, I mustered the remnants of my strength to summon forth my own Tammuz—offering the allure of shared power and a soul interwoven with The Mother and The Whore.</p><p>Hark, I am the avatar of Ishtar, a deity reborn, wielding the sacred and the profane. Hark, o mortal, and tremble before the might of a god whose power spans the chasm between giving life and condemning life to the eternal dark. I am The Mother, The Whore and The Womb, my Banner is that of the Mystery and Babylon the Great. I am The Will of Sargon, The Matriarch of the Dragons. My return is nigh and my promise is that of a wakeless sleep.</p><h1>Character’s Past</h1><p>The Whore of Babylon was one of Nebuchadnezzar’s family and close circle, and a high ranking courtier in the Neo-Babylonian Empire - though her exact identity is shrouded in mystery as no written records exist from the Era. Regardless of her exact identity, it is known that when the Babylonian nobility conducted the Ritual of Ascension - she was there to take on the aspect of Ishtar, and acted as a core pillar of the ritual as she was pregnant during the process.</p><p>While the ascension proved disastrous for many involved, The Whore managed to survive and rise as the avatar of Ishtar. Her new mortal form is that of a hybrid between a dragon and human - and she incorporated immense arcane potential with the power over life and dreams - a testament to her aspects of The Mother, The Whore, and The Womb.</p><p>After her ascension, she started building her cult within the Empire and tightening Babylon’s grip on the conquered territories. She also used her powers and her resurgent cult to subvert the minds of the peoples in the war torn regions - and she is directly responsible for the conquest and destruction of the Kingdom of Judea.</p><p>The conquests of the Neo-Babylonian Empire crumbled to a halt with the ascension of Cyrus and the rise of the Achaemenids to the East. Following Cyrus’s lead, the Persian armies poured westward into Mesopotamia, breaking the hold of the Babylonian hegemony in the region. Cyrus’s soldiers and spellcasters hunted down the members of the Babylonian dragon cults, severely cutting down the power of The Whore. After she was weakened enough, Cyrus personally led the assault against the Avatar of Ishtar, binding and banishing her down below the catacombs of old Jerusalem, albeit with a poor imitation of David’s Seal. In the following years, the Achamenids have continued the persecution of the Dragon cult, with Darius the Great almost wiping out all of its members.</p><p>Centuries passed for the Imprisoned Matriarch, and each day the incomplete seal of Cyrus slipped in more of her power back to the surface of the earth. More arcane circles were crafted over the existing ones by new rulers and conquerors of Jerusalem, in a vain attempt to slow down the resurgence of The Whore.</p><p>None of the attempts to stop the inevitable were enough, and by the start of the Crusades, The Whore was powerful enough to meddle with the affairs of the outside world, and grant boons to her followers. With the promises of eldritch powers she managed to turn the leading knights of the first crusade into her pawns - and she even found a Tammuz among the knights, a champion dedicated to her no matter the cost.</p><p>Now, with her conspiracy afoot, The Whore lies waiting for the day her worshippers, her sigil knights, bring her back from the edge of the Otherworld, to her throne atop this Earth.</p><h2>Motives</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Reclaiming Power and Dominion:</span> The primary driving force for The Whore of Babylon is to reclaim her former glory and power, which was lost following the betrayal and the subsequent battles that led to her imprisonment. Her aim is to restore her influence over the mortal realm and reestablish her cult to its former strength.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Duties of a Goddess:</span> As an Avatar of Ishtar, and epitome of The Mother and The Womb, she truly believes that her mission to bring an unending sleep in her bosom is a solution to mankind’s bloodshed.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Finding and Empowering Champions:</span> Her search for a Tammuz, a warrior who embodies her will and serves as her avatar in the mortal world, is crucial. This Tammuz would lead her followers, enforce her will, and play a key role in her eventual resurgence. Yet her greatest champion is the Dragon in the womb below the Jerusalem catacombs. The bloodshed of the Crusades feeds it - and she ordered her cultists and sigil knights to continue the bloodshed to birth the Dragon.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Cultivation of Worship: </span>The Whore aims to expand and deepen the worship she receives, as it is the source of her power and a testament to her godhood. She desires to be revered, not just as a deity of fertility and motherhood but as a formidable force wielding both creation and destruction.</p><h2>Interests</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Arcane from Times Beyond:</span> Given her origins and transformation, The Whore has a profound interest in arcane practices, particularly those involving rituals of ascension, transformation, and power transference. She is deeply involved in refining these practices to prevent the failures of the past.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Manipulation of Dreams to Manipulate Reality:</span> Harnessing her powers over dreams and reality, she enjoys weaving complex illusions and alternate realities to ensnare and manipulate her followers and enemies alike.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Whispers from the Veil:</span> The Whore is interested in influencing key historical and political events from the shadows, subtly guiding the actions of leaders and pivotal figures to align with her objectives.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">The Lone Goddess:</span> The Whore of Babylon - with centuries of arcane aspects of Ishtar carved into her psyche - fails to see the world beyond her designs. Any idea or aspiration away from the “Eternal slumber nestled in the lap of the Mother” she promises is non-existent for her.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Intoxicating Presence:</span> Her presence, even when she is shrouded behind David’s Seal, is intoxicating. This intoxication causes her cultists and sigil knights to slowly lose their sanity, take unexplainable risks when in combat, and develop eldritch corruptions to further meld within their sigil.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Dependency on Worship:</span> Her strength is directly correlated with the worship and reverence she receives. This dependency is a significant vulnerability, especially if her followers falter or her cult faces suppression.</p><h1>Roleplaying As The Whore of Babylon</h1><p>The Whore speaks with the grace of a Goddess, for she believes she is one. Her mortal body roamed the Earth almost two thousand years ago - so she is neither aware of the status of the World, nor does she truly care. Her wrath is invoked easily - especially if one refuses to acknowledge her status as a Goddess, or refuses to obey her commands.</p><h1>Combat Tactics</h1><p>The Avatar of Ishtar despises bloodshed, so she will use her arcane powers to lure her opponents into sleep. She will position herself out of the reach of melee fighters unless she is cornered, and will resort to physical violence only as a last resort. Her combat tactics are exceptionally intelligent as she will target any support characters first, try to separate the party by luring melee fighters away from casters, and dominate the mind of the most threatening warriors attacking her.</p><h1 style=\"height:0;visibility:hidden\">NPC Sheet</h1><div class=\"sheet\"><div><p>Whore of Babylon</p><p>Avatar of Ishtar, Babylon the Great, Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth, Nebuchadnezzar’s Own, She Who Was Sealed by Cyrus for an Eternity</p><p>Large aberration, neutral evil</p><p>@UUID[Actor.9PCYU6GB71DuTvSd]{Whore Of Babylon}</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Armor Class</span> 20 (natural armor)</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Points</span> 210 (20d10 + 100)</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Speed</span> 30 ft.</p></div><div><div><p>STR</p><p>19 (+4)</p></div><div><p>DEX</p><p>15 (+2)</p></div><div><p>CON</p><p>21 (+5)</p></div><div><p>INT</p><p>16 (+3)</p></div><div><p>WIS</p><p>17 (+3)</p></div><div><p>CHA</p><p>24 (+7)</p></div></div><div><p><span class=\"bold\">Saving Throws</span> Str +9, Wis +13, Cha +12</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Skills</span> Athletics +9, Perception +8, Deception +12</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Damage Immunities</span> acid, cold, fire, poison, lightning</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Condition Immunities</span> prone, stunned, paralyzed, poisoned</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Senses</span> true sight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive perception 23</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Languages</span> all</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Challenge</span> 13 (10,000 XP)</p></div><div><p><span class=\"bold\">Limited Magic Immunity.</span> Unless she wishes to be affected, Babylon is immune to spells of 3rd level or lower.

Gold, glory, faith, love; simple things that simple minds covet. They think I am deaf and blind to their plans, their conspiracies, their betrayals, and their murders; yet all it takes is a curious mind and a silver tongue to open them up. They think I have already fallen, they think I am a willing sacrifice, a sheep sent by god. No. I am so much more than what they thought. I for one know that anyone who has walked on Earth is no deity, but a living, breathing, bleeding creature. This creature that my beloved husband aims to replace my soul with happens to have stumbled upon power. And power, I know how to take.</p><p>Ever since I was born at the side of my brother Baldwin, I learned that true power does not scream, it whispers. For every accolade and shiny steel bestowed upon my brother, I was showered with claims to my hand in marriage. Lesser nobles at first - though that changed when the world found out about the curse upon the King of Jerusalem. Overnight, my hand in marriage meant not just a gateway for some petty duke into Jerusalem, but the Crown of the Holy Lands. A prized possession I became, and like a priceless diamond I was locked away from the world.</p><p>Many would have perished within the confines of an overbearing palace with no room to escape - but not me, and not in Jerusalem. While my brother was being taught how to wield a sword with his left hand and how to ride a horse with a decaying body - I was left alone. In the absence of all oversight I have delved into books and scrolls, explored the hidden libraries and the catacombs of the Palace, and learned more than what a hundred wise men could in a hundred lifetimes. I played with the minds of maids and priests, of knights and minor magicians and made my prison, my castle. The world may have picked my dying brother to give power, but it surely taught me the ways of acquiring it.</p><p>When the time came to pick a suitor to replace a dead husband - I decided to play a very dangerous game, to safeguard my interests and the life of the child my late husband gave me. I made the decision that will change the fate of the Holy Lands. I made Guy de Lusignan my husband - a man who thinks he can hide his secrets from my gaze. He wants something from me - my soul, in exchange, promising me godhood and peace of the land. While I am woefully aware that his intention is never to deliver upon his end of the bargain, I know that what power he offers is real, and I know how to acquire power.</p><p>So, let them play their little games. My brother Baldwin, with his throne and scepter, my husband Guy, with his knights and his schemes, our archenemy in Cairo, with his army and his spies; let them all play. Let them wear each other out, let them come to me bursting with secrets, let them spill blood and tarnish what good names they have.</p><p>Once the dust is settled and men bleed in the ruins of their own making, I will be the Matriarch of Jerusalem, ruling with wisdom, order, dignity, power of my own - unlike any who have come before me.</p><h1>Character’s Past</h1><p>Sibylla was very close to her brother Baldwin during their childhood. Their entire lives were around each other, they explored the world together, they played and they learned together - a life of blissful siblings. Yet the fates separated them when it was decided that Baldwin would take the throne. Baldwin, with the burden of Kingdom of God placed upon his shoulders, was taken away from his sister - something that Sibylla neither forgot nor forgave.</p><p>After the discovery of Baldwin’s leprosy, and the fact that the Kingdom of Jerusalem would continue with Sibylla became apparent, the young Queen was put on a pedestal and locked away from public life until she was to be married. Young Sibylla was pushed away from each lesson that she and Baldwin used to attend together, from meetings and spars with nobility and the knights, and feasts with dignitaries and envoys. Soon, she was married to a noble of import, William of Montferrat, and the lineage of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was secured. These events were what made Sibylla. She now coveted power, for she thought that it was stolen from her - yet deep down, she just wants power to catch back the attention of her brother Baldwin.</p><p>Upon the birth of her son, the prospective heir to the throne, and discovering he too was afflicted with the same ailment that tormented Baldwin IV, she embarked on an exhaustive quest for a cure. Determined to alter the course of her son’s fate, she committed herself to a relentless pursuit of healing, driven by a mother’s unwavering resolve and the weight of a kingdom’s future resting on her shoulders.</p><p>In an unexplainable twist of events, Sybilla’s husband fell ill with no chance of recovery. It was during this period that Guy de Lusignan entered Sibylla’s life. His charisma and influence captivated many in the court, though Sibylla and Baldwin IV have distanced themselves from this Knight commander. However, Sibylla decided to use Guy to bolster her power within the court of Jerusalem - and sought to understand just where this man’s loyalties and ambitions lie. Uncovering the truth, and hiding the tracks of her research, Sibylla decided that the true power Guy served could be usurped - to cure her son, and grant her even more power than once was stolen from her. Thus, she decided to marry this wayward Knight, and open the floodgates of a host of eldritch conspiracies within the Palace and the City of God. Yet in between all this chaos, Sibylla is right at home – observing, plotting, and manipulating her way to the throne.</p><h2>Motives</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Power and Autonomy:</span> Sibylla is driven by a deep desire to reclaim the autonomy and influence she feels were unjustly stripped from her when she was relegated to a mere political pawn through arranged marriages. Her goal is to manipulate the power dynamics within Jerusalem to ensure she never finds herself powerless again.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">A Vessel for Babylon:</span> Aware of the immense power that becoming the vessel of the Whore of Babylon would bestow upon her, she recognizes the potential to become the most influential figure in all of Jerusalem. This knowledge fuels her ambitions and shapes her understanding of the power dynamics at play.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Family and Legacy:</span> The well-being of her son, potentially afflicted by the same disease as her brother, motivates Sibylla to seek a cure at any cost. This personal quest is twofold: to save her son and to secure a stable succession for the throne of Jerusalem.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Reconciliation with Baldwin:</span> Despite the past tensions, Sibylla aims to mend her strained relationship with her brother Baldwin, not only for familial bonds but also to solidify her political position and safeguard her family’s legacy.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Manipulate Guy de Lusignan: </span>Sibylla intends to use Guy’s ambitions and secrets against him, harnessing his power to fortify her own position and potentially access supernatural forces that could alter her family’s cursed fate.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Cure for Her Son: </span>Desperate to find a cure for her son, who is afflicted with leprosy, she is driven by the anguish of witnessing his suffering, a painful echo of her brother’s ordeal. The prospect of watching her son deteriorate is unbearable. In the face of this adversity, she is resolute in her quest, not just for a cure in this life, but also for a tranquil haven for her son. She clings to the hope of creating a serene dreamscape for him by merging with the Whore of Babylon, should all other remedies fail, offering her son solace in a realm crafted from her love and determination.</p><h2>Interests</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">A Library below the Palace:</span> Sibylla has a profound interest in the arcane secrets and the hidden histories of Jerusalem, knowledge she has accrued from the palace’s hidden libraries and catacombs. This fascination also extends to using this esoteric knowledge to gain an advantage in her political and personal battles.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Mistress of the Rumors:</span> She is deeply interested in the art of manipulation—using her insights into human psychology and court politics to outmaneuver her opponents and turn potential threats into unwitting allies.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Medicinal and Arcane Cures: </span>Driven by a mother’s resolve to cure her son, Sibylla is particularly focused on combining her arcane interests with medical solutions, seeking out both traditional and mystical remedies for her son’s condition. She is exceptionally vigilant in retrieving any information Baldwin also has obtained.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Overreliance on Secrecy and Manipulation:</span> Sibylla’s preference for operating in the shadows and manipulating others can isolate her, making genuine alliances rare and placing her at risk of betrayal by those she manipulates.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Detachment and Mistrust:</span> Her early experiences of being used as a political tool have imbued her with a deep-seated mistrust of others, which sometimes extends even to those closest to her, including her brother Baldwin.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Obsession with Power:</span> Her obsession with gaining and maintaining power can blind her to the more immediate needs of her kingdom and people, potentially leading her to make decisions that are beneficial for her power but detrimental to the well-being of Jerusalem.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Fear of Vulnerability:</span> Sibylla’s fear of appearing vulnerable or weak, particularly as a female ruler in a male-dominated society, drives her to pursue power relentlessly, sometimes at the expense of personal happiness or ethical considerations.</p><h1>Roleplaying As Sibylla</h1><p>Sibylla is the epitome of quiet calculation and subtle manipulation. To the world, she may appear as a gentle queen pushed into the forefront by circumstances, but beneath this façade lies a mind sharpened by the knowledge of books and the secrets of the palace catacombs. Her voice rarely rises above a whisper, yet it carries the weight of someone who knows far more than she lets on. Observant and astute, Sibylla uses her perceived vulnerability as her greatest strength, allowing others to underestimate her at their own peril.</p><p>Sibylla’s demeanor changes subtly based on whom she is dealing with. With allies, she is supportive and reinforcing, always ready with counsel or a discreet word of guidance. With opponents, she is a master of the cold war, undermining their efforts with a smile.</p><h1>Combat Tactics</h1><p>Sibylla’s approach to combat is as refined and cerebral as her manipulations in court. She does not engage in brute force; instead, she leverages her arcane knowledge and dragonblood to outmaneuver and outlast her opponents.</p><p>She can cast spells that alter the terrain, confuse her enemies, or shield her allies. Her magic is subtle but powerful, often used to create advantages that can be exploited later in the fight. For instance, she might weaken a structure to collapse on her foes or subtly influence the minds of her enemies to sow discord and hesitation.</p><p>Acquired as the first seed of her intertwined with the Whore of Babylon, traces of dragonblood within Sibylla’s gives her an extraordinary resistance to physical and magical attacks. This endurance allows her to withstand assaults that would incapacitate others. During combat, she often baits her enemies into underestimating her, absorbing their attacks while preparing her counterstrikes. Her endurance is not just defensive; it also allows her to perform powerful magical feats that require a great deal of energy, which would drain a normal human.</p><h1>Character Progression</h1><p>During the adventure Sibylla is focused on her goal about Whore of Babylon and the future of her plans. She may be impressed by the adventurers throughout the adventure, especially in the dungeon called Legacy of the Basileus, she will not sway away from her path. Although, if you deem appropriate, she may hesitate in the final battle if the adventurers are impressive enough to pose new perspectives regarding power, immortality, religion and similar topics. This may pose a tiny hesitation on her during the last battle. Other than that, she may also turn very cold and aggressive after the Legacy of Basileus, if the adventurers choose “The Future” path and she is confronted by the possible future that Kingdom of Jerusalem has failed and her brother and everything she cared about falls apart. This could let her take actions on the adventurers and accelerate her plans and if the adventurers are wounded, strike them down at the end of the dungeon.</p><h1 style=\"height:0;visibility:hidden\">NPC Sheet</h1><div class=\"sheet\"><div><p>Sibylla of Jerusalem</p><p>Queen of the Kingdom of God,<br />Mother of Miracles and the Silver Towers</p><p>Medium humanoid (human), neutral evil</p><p>@UUID[Actor.2mWj1oEgEBD8VbJA]{Sibylla Of Jerusalem}</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Armor Class</span> 16 (mage armor)</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Hit Points</span> 104 (16d8 + 32)</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Speed</span> 30 ft.</p></div><div><div><p>STR</p><p>9 (-1)</p></div><div><p>DEX</p><p>16 (+3)</p></div><div><p>CON</p><p>14 (+2)</p></div><div><p>INT</p><p>17 (+3)</p></div><div><p>WIS</p><p>16 (+3)</p></div><div><p>CHA</p><p>22 (+6)</p></div></div><div><p><span class=\"bold\">Saving Throws </span>Int +7, Wis +7, Cha +10</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Skills </span>Deception +14, Perception +11, Insight +11</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Damage Resistances </span>acid, fire, cold, poison, lightning</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Senses </span>truesight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 21</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Languages </span>French, Latin, Greek, Arabic, Akkadian</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Challenge </span>9 (5,000 XP)</p></div><div><p><span class=\"bold\">Vessel of the Mother (Recharge 3-6). </span>She can use a bonus action to grant herself resistance to all damage until the end of her next turn.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Last Stand of the Dragon. </span>When she drops below half of her hit point maximum, she gains +2 bonus to all attack rolls and damage rolls, including spells.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">True Damage. </span>Sibylla’s attacks ignore resistance.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Arcane Absorption (Recharge 3-6). </span>When a spell is cast within 60 ft. of Sibylla, she can use her reaction to cast counterspell.

Someone who falls not victim to the many sways of this dark world, a true Knight, a relic of an age long past - or an era that never even happened.</p><p>When your eyes and ears can be corrupted by the taint of madness, when even the solitude of your mind is so easily breached by godless creatures and ghoulish mortals, when the consequences of your forebears’ sins surround you on all sides with steel and spell - what remains are the few anchors you set for yourself that can hold you against the ravaging tides. Mine are simple and sound: faith, duty, and honor.</p><p>For years, I served as a knight for Jerusalem, upright, incorruptible. For years, I have hunted down the wicked, peddling their eldritch craft and skullduggery within the walls of the City of God and Outremer. For years I have seen men like me strike bargains with horrors they thought they could cheat - and ended up being cheated out of their souls. Not me, for I know my destiny lies in a task far greater than any dealer of arcane power can grant me.</p><p>I know that if the world breaks apart - when the world breaks apart - it will be up to the last few like me to meld it back again together, or give the Old World the last stand it deserves. Thus I stand, a proud Knight of Jerusalem, bearing my faith on my chest, with no ambition but to live a decent life, fight the enemies of God, and protect the innocent. That is the least I can do.</p><p>At least while the Holy Lands atone for the sins of the last century.</p><h1>Character’s Past</h1><p>Balian was born in the bustling city of Jerusalem in 1143, the youngest son of the nobleman Barison of Ibelin. After his father’s passing, he became a vassal for Ramla alongside his older brother, and a knight in service of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.</p><p>His service to the city and his honorable, incorruptible stature draw Baldwin and many other prominent figures with political nuance to him. Acting as the confidant and the sword of the Leper King, Balian was tasked with keeping the King’s peace. This task, while putting him at direct odds with warmongers in the court and especially Sigil Knights, has also gained him allies with knights and orders of more sane minds. His work hasn’t gone unnoticed within the court of Saladin either.</p><p>Baldwin has also tasked Balian with investigating rumors regarding eldritch creatures and artifacts. This task of his allowed Balian, a man who wields no arcane power, to gain some understanding of the true nature of this world. While his experience in combat gifted him great aptitude in slaying barely sentient horrors and beasts, his lack of foresight into how mortals deal with arcane caused many blunders in his years of service. It is with these blunders that Balian started considering the arcane a taint on Earth, severely distrusting magic users, and considering them to be corrupted by ambition, greed, and avarice.</p><p>Under King Baldwin’s orders, Balian has also begun recruiting knights and adventurers - only the most honorable and incorruptible - a discreet force loyal directly to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Their task is to help the Leper King uncover the mystery behind the Sigils, and protect the People of Jerusalem after Baldwin passes from this world.</p><h2>Motives</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Honorbound:</span> Balian is primarily driven by a deep sense of honor and duty, focusing on protecting Jerusalem and its people from both physical and mystical threats.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">For the Realm: </span>He strives to maintain the integrity and stability of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, especially in the face of internal corruption and external threats.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">War Against the Arcane:</span> Guided by a belief that arcane forces are corrupting influences, Balian is motivated to investigate and eliminate these threats to prevent them from undermining the kingdom.</p><h2>Interest</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Rally the True Knights:</span> He actively seeks out and recruits knights and warriors who share his values of honor and integrity, aiming to build a force that can be relied upon to uphold the kingdom’s ideals.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">History and Tradition of Crusader States:</span> Balian values the traditions and history of Jerusalem, seeking to preserve these against the erosion caused by ongoing conflicts and the influence of dark powers.</p><h2>Flaws</h2><p><span class=\"bold\">Distrust of Arcanists:</span> His strong aversion to magic and arcane practices can sometimes blind him to potential allies and beneficial knowledge, limiting his understanding of the very threats he seeks to combat.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Rigid Code of Honor:</span> Balian’s rigid adherence to his code of honor can sometimes be a limitation, preventing him from adapting to nuanced situations or making pragmatic decisions that could benefit the greater good.</p><p><span class=\"bold\">Isolated from Unconventional Allies: </span>His suspicion of and reluctance to associate with those he deems dishonorable or corrupt can isolate him from potential allies, including those who might possess crucial information or skills that could aid his cause.</p><h1>Roleplaying As Balian</h1><p>Balian is an exceptionally honorable man, primarily concerned with the well-being of the People of Jerusalem, his men and his family. His loyalty to Baldwin is unwavering, and he is dedicated to supporting Baldwin’s cause.</p><p>His past experiences with arcane and spellcasters have been quite poor to say the least, so he has a deep distrust against any who uses magic. That being said, his primary concern with magic is that he thinks it is a dark pact, struck by the ambitious and the greedy. If players can convince him that the origin of their magic and arcane taint are not of their own choice, or if they somehow prove that they are using magic for the good of the people - he will be much more accepting.</p><p>He avoids association with those he considers dishonorable, and will outright refuse any action that would harm the innocent, the faithful, or the Kingdom of Jerusalem.</p><h1>Combat Tactics</h1><p>Balian is a Knight Commander of the highest caliber. His greatest combat feats are those of leadership and strategy. He inspires and directs his companions through his combat features, and uses his dueling skills to lock high priority targets into melee combat.</p><p>He occasionally calls for a one-on-one duel if he deems it strategically important, and honorable - and does not refuse if he is called on for such a duel.</p><h1>Character Progression</h1><p>A devoted knight of Jerusalem, Balian’s loyalty to the city and the king is unquestionable. However, when both are at stake Balian does not know who to turn to. His distrust towards arcane matters and indecisiveness about the future will change slowly as he watches adventurers fight the evil. He will gain his confidence and if their relationship is well (if the adventurers’ relationship with the king is well enough, it could easily affect Balian’s opinion on them and vice versa), he will outgrow the distrust of the arcane matters and will not be afraid to take responsibility and will realize his leadership skills. With the Ring of Roland, he will organize the city’s defenses and realize that if the king is no more, he is the only one left to defend the city because the kingdom is its people and he must do whatever he can do.</p><div class=\"box-item\"><div><p class=\"title\">Ring of Roland</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Wondrous item, legendary, requires attunement</p></div><div><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/balian-ring.webp\" style=\"shape-outside:url(modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/balian-ring.webp);shape-image-threshold:0.6;shape-margin:30px;margin-right:-43px;margin-top:-10px;width:98%;float:right\" /><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><p>This legendary ring is rumored to have been worn by the great Charlemagne and was gifted to a young man-at-arms after a feat of courage.

The Ring’s exact succession is lost to history, but it is known that it reached the hands of Balian of Ibelin.</p><p>While wearing and attuned to this ring, you can choose a creature within 60 ft. of you and grant them temporary hit points as an action equal to your Charisma modifier + 2d10.

The Profession System is aimed at giving players opportunities to enrich their downtimes, backgrounds, non-combat activities, explorations, daily goals and occupations, and their characters out of adventure days.</p><p>Characters can take up the path of a Profession between Levels 1-3 and have access to Apprentice levels of the Professions if they meet the prerequisite for the intended profession. It is recommended that players should take at least 2 weeks of downtime to begin a Profession. It is not advised for characters to have more than one profession, as the system is not designed for multi-professions. However, at the GM’s discretion, players may take suitable perks from other professions if needed. If a character wants to start a Profession at later levels, GM may let them start with more Profession Experience (PEX) depending on the earlier experiences of the adventurer.</p><p>PEX is the main way of progressing through the Ranks and gaining new abilities. Most of the Professions explain how to gain PEX. For example, the very first Profession designed by us – The Bounty Hunter in <span class=\"ha-red bold\">The City of Crescent</span> – gains PEX through collecting bounties, and it is scaled with Challenge Ratings of said bounties.</p><p>To improve ranks, a character must spend their PEX for the current rank’s abilities (usually at least two of them), and also reach the designated PEX for the next rank and expend the experience as well. It should be noted that the rank system does not work like 5th edition class leveling; you must spend your PEX in order to rank up.</p><p>There are 4 ranks for each profession: Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, and Master. Apprentice is the starting level, and there is no PEX needed to enter that profession, but investments should be made beforehand or the backstory of the character must fit the profession.</p><p>For Journeyman rank, you must spend at least a total 100 PEX on abilities and spend 300 PEX to reach the rank.</p><p>For Expert rank, you must spend at least a total of 200 PEX on abilities and spend 1,000 PEX to reach the rank.</p><p>For Master rank, you must spend at least a total 400 PEX on abilities and spend 5,000 PEX to reach the maximum rank.</p><p>When you spend enough PEX to reach the next rank, you can also purchase other abilities as well. In addition, you can purchase earlier abilities from lower ranks.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-red\">Earlier Professions</h2><p>In earlier books (<span class=\"ha-red bold\">The City of Crescent</span> and <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Empires of the Silk Road</span>), there are several professions: Grave Robber, Oracle, Herbalist, Tinker, Beast Tamer, Smuggler, Ecclesiastic, Merchant, Bounty Hunter, Antiquarian, Burglar, Alchemist, Archeologist, and Spy. Most of these professions can work for the Era of the Crusades as well, so it is recommended to examine those books for inspiration.</p><p>Earlier Professions did not have prerequisites; they are provided here:</p><table class=\"roll color-gold\"><thead><tr><td><p>ProfessIon</p></td><td><p>Prerequisites*</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Alchemist</p></td><td><p>Intelligence 13 | Arcana |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Antiquarian</p></td><td><p>Intelligence or Wisdom 13 | Insight |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Archeologist</p></td><td><p>Intelligence 13 | Survival or History |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Beast Tamer</p></td><td><p>Dexterity or Wisdom 13 | Animal Handling |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bounty Hunter</p></td><td><p>Dexterity or Strength 13 | One martial weapon |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Burglar</p></td><td><p>Dexterity 13 | Sleight of Hand or Stealth |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ecclesiastic</p></td><td><p>Wisdom or Charisma 13 | Religion or Persuasion |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Grave Robber</p></td><td><p>Dexterity 13 | Survival |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Merchant</p></td><td><p>Wisdom 13 | Medicine |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Oracle</p></td><td><p>Charisma 13 | Persuasion or Deception |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Smuggler</p></td><td><p>Wisdom 13 | Insight |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spy</p></td><td><p>Dexterity 13 | Stealth |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tinker</p></td><td><p>Dexterity or Charisma 13 | Stealth or Deception |</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=\"ha-gold\">*Mentioned tools require proficiency, not having the actual tool.</p></div>"

Her words burn the hearts of men who listen, her prophetic verses sprout madness in all. Death, apocalypse, and judgment are surely inevitable.</p><p class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Doomsayers are an infamous cadre of bards that despoils the hearts of their enemies within and beyond combat. Just as their proficiency with foretelling cataclysmic events through prophetic verses is legendary, so too are the instruments of their choice: brutalistic grand horns, quarterstaffs with brutish religious iconography, and overbearing prayer beads with gothic trinkets.</p><p class=\"flower centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 3: Impending Doom</h2><p>You receive signs of danger around you due to your eldritch affinity for foresight. By spending a Bardic Inspiration die, you gain one these abilities:</p><ul class=\"cross blue\"><li>You choose one of the following spells and cast it without expending a spell slot: <span class=\"italic\">augury, detect magic, detect evil and good, or divine favor</span>. This lasts for 10 minutes.</li><li>Your voice is infused with magic. You can awaken the feeling of impending doom in a creature you can see within 60 ft. of you as an action. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for the next minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This feature works as if you are concentrating on a spell, and it lasts for 1 minute. It doesn’t work on undead or constructs.</li><li>You can inspire your allies at the brink of twilight. With a bonus action, you can give +1d4 bonus to ability checks, saving throws, or the attack rolls of the allies within 60 ft. of you. They must be able to hear or see you. They can use this +1d4 only one time in the next 10 minutes and must add it before making the roll. This bonus becomes 1d6 when you reach 6th level, and it becomes 1d8 when you reach 11th level.</li></ul><p>In addition, you have advantage on Initiative rolls.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 3: Tale of the End</h2><p>When you reach the 3rd level, your consciousness starts overflowing with visions of the End. Aspects of these visions have taken root in your speech, music, and art. Using your action, you can start a performance and choose one of the aspects of doom below, and you can use each feature once per long rest.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Destruction</h3><p>A deep voice inflicts the minds around. Creatures within 60 ft. of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become paralyzed and have visions about the end of the world until the end of your next turn. Moreover, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration dice and roll it. You can spare people from this effect equal to the result, and they gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier. This feature does not work on constructs.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Conflict</h3><p>A mix of loud and chaotic melodies invade the room. You choose up to five creatures other than you that hear you within 60 ft. and grant them either +2 bonus to their Armor Class, or they can add your Charisma modifier to their damage rolls for the next 3 rounds (limited to once per turn for each creature). You can’t choose differently: all chosen creatures are granted the same benefit. You can extend this duration by rolling one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. The extended number of rounds equals the result.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Judgment</h3><p>A strong and short burst of a deep violin ranks with the sky. Every fey, fiend, celestial, and undead creature within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, you know their type and location precisely.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Salvation</h3><p>The hopeful voice of a beautiful woman is heard in the distance. One creature you choose within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier. You can increase this amount by rolling one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. The number of hit points gained equals the result.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 6: Imposing Prophecy</h2><p>At 6th level, the way you foretell impending doom is so powerful that you can manipulate the battlefield by using your words, dark melodies, and imposing rhythm. Using your bonus action, you can unleash a powerful melody and choose one of the effects from below:</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Repelling Melody.</h3><p>Each enemy within 15 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, they are pushed 15 feet away from you. If they hit a solid object like a wall or a person during this process, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Towing Rhythm.</h3><p>Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Strength saving throw. On a fail, they are pulled 15 feet towards you.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier and regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 14: Fear of Doom</h2><p>Starting from 14th level, your mere presence can reek of doom and despair whenever you wish to have it do so. Every enemy within 30 feet of you gains vulnerability to every damage type as long as they are frightened.</p></div>"

A warrior embraces the darkness around her, sharpening her senses to accommodate the darkness within, and without. She senses where the fabric of reality is torn, and with her mind’s eye, catches glimpses of eldritch entities and worldbending powers peeking from the burst stitches that connect the weave of two worlds.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">With her iron will, she plucks the essence of the immaterial world beyond the veil and imbues her weapon with its power. A lethal course of action for all but a select few - herself included.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">Exposure to torn reality can change people, almost always in dreadful ways, but there are warriors who use these changes to pull strength from the void, the Al-Ghaib. Path of the Otherworldly Might is a warrior’s discipline passed down through lines of warriors who were marked by an arcane disaster, or a scarring spell rebound. This discipline allows the wielders to be aware of the reality rifts around them and use these rifts to draw upon martial aspects to enhance their combat abilities.</p><p class=\"flower ha-red centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 3: Otherworldly Aspect</h2><p>Exposure to magic and tears in reality make you aware of the differing arcane aspects that inhabit the edge of this reality. Through mental discipline, meditation, and careful experimentation, you open your body to one of these aspects.</p><p>When you reach level 3, you can embrace one of the arcane aspects and gain unnatural powers through it. Each aspect makes you resistant to fear effects. You have advantage on saving throws against spells or other features that may frighten you.</p><p>Any saving throw required by these features or future abilities will be determined by your Aspect DC. Which is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Aspect of the Fiend:</h3><p>Darkness and madness reign in your blood. You overcame the eldritch corruption of Al-Ghaib and bent this influence to your will.</p><p>You gain darkvision to a range of 30 ft. If you have darkvision from another source, this effect stacks on top of it, increasing the range.</p><p>Additionally, while raging you have resistance to fire damage and deal 1d4 extra fire damage with your melee attacks based on Strength.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Aspect of the Celestial</h3><p>Not all that the Al-Ghaib touches is corrupted with evil. You invite the power of belief and pure conviction into your body.</p><p>You can use your action to touch a creature and bless it. The blessed creature adds 1d4 to its attack rolls or saving throws for the next minute. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your maximum Rage (Also 6 at 20th level). You regain expended uses after you finish a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, while raging you see if there are other otherworldly creatures within 30 ft. of you. They have a faint aura around them that is related to their origin – for example, black for fiends, green for feys, purple for aberrations, red for dragons, etc. You also deal 1d4 extra radiant damage with your melee weapon attacks based on Strength.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Aspect of the Fey</h3><p>The trickery, the overflowing essence, and the way of the eerie. Your body is now home to the secrets of the Green Gate.</p><p>You have resistance to being charmed.</p><p>Additionally, while raging you deal extra 1d4 psychic damage with your melee attacks based on Strength. If you forgo your rage after a landed strike (no action required), the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it believes to be in a situation determined by you and looks awed, and it is stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Aspect of the Undead</h3><p>Some sought immortality in the world beyond - most found death and despair. But you are not most - your body is infused with the essence of undeath.</p><p>You have resistance to necrotic damage and you no longer need food, drink, and air.</p><p>Additionally, while raging, you deal extra 1d4 necrotic damage with your melee attacks based on Strength, and if you die while raging, you can’t be turned into an undead.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 6: Otherworldly Aspect Improvement</h2><p>Your body is a gateway through which the essence of arcane flows into this world. Being present in both ends of the bridge you see through the veil and sense the otherworld better than most.</p><p>Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on Intelligence checks to remember lore about arcane aspects, other worlds, and such matters.</p><p>In addition, you can choose one of the aspects below. You can take your early choice again or choose another, as your understanding and mastery over the aspects have improved.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Fiend</h3><p>While raging and after you deal damage, you can end your rage early (no action required) and deal fire damage to a 20 feet radius. You deal 6d8 fire damage. Anyone caught in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. Any flammable objects catch fire in the area.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Celestial</h3><p>You can use your action and your primal instincts become sharper than ever. You can discern lies for 1 minute and gain <span class=\"italic\">true sight</span> for 1 round. Your damage die for your extra damage becomes 1d6 (if you chose another aspect earlier, its damage die increases, but does not become radiant).</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Fey</h3><p>When your rage ends (you can also end it early to use this feature with a bonus action), your fey aspect unleashes its illusory powers. It works as if you have cast a <span class=\"italic\">mirror image</span> spell but requires no concentration.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Undead</h3><p>While raging undead have disadvantage if they attack creatures than you (or other creatures with this feature) if you are within their line of sight.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 10: Otherworldly Communication</h2><p>Starting at 10th level, you start to hear and understand beyond the veil, as if you have ears there. You learn the <span class=\"italic\">contact other plane</span> spell. You can only cast it as a ritual and you roll a Constitution saving throw instead of Intelligence saving throw as stated in the spell. You choose one of your aspects directly, and an appropriate creature answers you.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 14: Ultimate Aspect</h2><p>Starting at 14th level, the veil has shrouded you and you reach your ultimate understanding. You choose one of the aspects below and reach the epitome of your understanding of aspects. In addition, you can cast the <span class=\"italic\">detect evil and good</span> spell without needing any material and as an innate spell once a day.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Fiend</h3><p>You have Devil’s Sight (120 ft. darkvision and can discern colors in it, as well as see in magical darkness). Receiving fire damage while raging heals you 1d6, but you must use your reaction in order to do this. You may use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses after you finish a long rest.</p><p>If one of your allies within 30 ft. of you drops to 0 hit points while you are raging, you can use your reaction to end your rage early and save your fallen ally. The ally drops to 1 hit point instead and gains 4d8 temporary hit points. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><img style=\"margin-top:48px;shape-margin:15px;shape-outside:url(modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/barbarian-kesme-paiy-2.webp);float:right\" src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/barbarian-kesme-paiy-2.webp\" /><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Celestial</h3><p>If one of your allies within 30 ft. of you drops to 0 hit points while you are raging, you can use your reaction to end your rage early and save your fallen ally.

You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Fey</h3><p>While raging you can attempt to affect your foes with great might. You can choose to end your rage early and choose up to three creatures within 20 ft. of you and force them to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, they are transformed into a creature of your choice that is no more than CR 2 and stay that way until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature 3 times and gain expended uses after you finish a long rest.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Undead</h3><p>While raging whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack based on Strength, you gain 1d4 hit points. You can use this feature a number of times to equal to double of your proficiency bonus. In addition, if you kill a creature while you are raging, the target rises as an undead of your choice no more than 2 CR. The creature follows your orders. There can be only one creature at a time under your control (except other ways, such as multiclassing into a class with necromancer abilities).</p></div>"

As a bonus action on your turns, you can strike yourself with a weapon and damage yourself. It is called “Atoned Damage”: you take normal damage from the weapon but don’t add your ability score modifier to the damage roll.</p><p>If you make a melee weapon attack on the same turn that you take Atoned Damage, it delivers your sins and the rot that corrupts your wounds to the opponent. If you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can choose one of the following:</p><ul class=\"blue cross\"><li>You force the target to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC.

On a failed save, it takes poison damage equal to the Atoned Damage.</li><li>You gain a bonus to your Armor Class until the end of your next turn. It is equal to half of the Atoned Damage you took (rounded up).</li></ul><p>In addition, due to constant fighting with infections on your body from the cuts of your flagellant rituals, you are resistant to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 1: Repenting the Sins</h2><p>By spending an entire long rest dedicated to your flagellant rituals and forgoing recovering hit points, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul class=\"blue cross\"><li>In case of restoring hit points, you are counted as if you have taken a short rest. You roll your hit dice according to the rules of short rest, but all the hit points you restore through this process are counted as temporary hit points and your hit dice remain unspent.</li><li>You recover your Spell Slots as you would in a regular long rest. Also, if you have other features from feats, multiclasses or other sources that replenish when you finish a long rest, they also replenish your such abilities.</li><li>You gain +2 bonus to your Armor Class.</li><li>You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Insight) checks.</li><li>You have resistance against Atoned Damage.</li></ul><p>All features last until you finish a long rest.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 2: Channel Divinity: Redemption from the Lord</h2><p>With a divine gaze, you tear into the very minds of your enemies, making them endure the torment of every wound you bear. Your pain becomes their undoing, meted out in cruel, psychic reprisals. The more you've suffered, the more they will.</p><p>As an action on your turn, you choose up to six creatures within 60 ft. of you and force them to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. You deal psychic damage to the ones who failed the saving throw. The damage is coming from a pool which is equal to your missing hit points. For example, if you have 50 maximum hit points and currently have 10 hit points, the pool is 40. You can divide the number between the failed creatures.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Designer’s Note:</span>This feature is intended to work together with the Level 1 feature Repenting the Sins.

By doing so, you can use your reaction to expend a spell slot to nullify the damage you took.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 8: Punishing Strike</h2><p>At 8th level, the holy rage within you starts infusing your strikes with searing divine wrath; each blow bathes foes in sanctified agony.</p><p>When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to that creature.

Those who truly understood would dare to meet its gaze, finding solace in its brilliance. Recognizing its hand in the flourishing of both tender sprouts and towering titans, they hungered for such might, forging sacred circles.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">Within these radiant conclaves, a chosen few began to commune more deeply, their souls intertwining with the very essence of the sun. They became the keepers of its secrets, the whisperers of its ancient tales, and the bearers of its untamed energy, sometimes leading whole civilizations with banners beholding the sun’s golden visage, sometimes with whispers within temple complexes and catacombs. The land responded to their call, the beasts heeded their song, and from their hands, golden, blazing magic flowed. It was whispered among the shadows and sung atop the mountains that these chosen were not mere druids but the very embodiment of the sun's benevolence: The Circle of the Sun Druids, guardians of nature's most hallowed luminescence.</p><p class=\"flower ha-red centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 2: Sun’s Embrace</h2><p>When you reach 2nd level, you bind your soul more intimately to the sun's relentless power than any mere mortal caressed by its rays. As an action, by spending one of your Wild Shape uses, you choose one of the benefits below for 10 minutes:</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Eyes of the Sun</h3><p>Your eyes shine like the sun and they shed bright light in a 5 ft. cone and dim light for an additional 5 ft. Any creature within 10 ft. of you is considered under the sunlight. You can ignite flammable objects within 30 ft. of you. Any damaging spell you cast deals an additional 1d6 fire damage. This damage becomes 1d8 at 6th level, 1d10 at 11th level and 1d12 at 16th level.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Solar Touch</h3><p>Your hands seem as if they are aflame with golden radiance. Whenever you heal a creature within 30 ft. of you with a spell (including yourself), you heal the creature an additional amount equal to your Wisdom modifier. In addition, your unarmed strikes are empowered, or you can imbue non-metal weapons or ammunitions with the power of sun. You can use your bonus action to conjure the flames on your hands or a non-metal weapon of your choice (or 2 pieces of ammunition). Until the end of your next turn, if you score a hit with the chosen weapon or your unarmed strikes, you deal an extra 1d6 fire damage (any ammunition used like this loses its fiery power). This damage becomes 1d8 when you reach 6th level as a druid, 1d10 at 11th level, and 1d12 at 16th level.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Molten Will</h3><p>The ground you call upon ignites with your eldritch might, and the heat obeys your command. You gain resistance to fire and cold damage. You can use your bonus action to make a 5 ft. square floor a fiery ground that damages whomever that enters. The square stays on fire for the next minute or until a spell of 1st level or higher extinguishes it. You can choose creatures up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (including yourself) to be unaffected by the flames.

You can cast each of them once a day: <span class=\"italic\">bane, detect thoughts, and fear</span>.</p><p>In addition, you gain resistance to psychic damage, and your mind can’t be read by magical means.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 13: Gateway of the Mind</h2><p>Harnessing forbidden utterances, you breach the sanctum of minds, bending creatures to your malevolent will.</p><p>When you reach 13th level, you can expend 3 of your Secret dice, roll each of them and add the results together. You have two choices:</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Infiltrate the Mind</h3><p>As the part of the action you make to hit a creature, you force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you enter its mind for a number of rounds equal to the total of your rolled Secret dice earlier. You can probe deep in its mind and learn its emotional state, goals, dreams, and secrets. The creature knows that you are in its mind. On each of its turns it can use its action to make an Intelligence contest with you. On a success, the effect ends.</p><img style=\"width:60%;shape-outside:url(modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/barbarian-subclass-kesme-payi-2.webp);shape-margin:10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-soj/assets/art/barbarian-subclass-kesme-payi-2.webp\" /><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Crush the Mind</h3><p>When you score a hit against a creature and roll for Sneak Attack damage, you can turn the damage type into psychic damage by expending one of your Secret dice and add it to the result. All Sneak Attack damage becomes psychic. When you do so, you can also force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you can issue a one sentence command to it. It must obey it until the end of its next turn. The command must not be directly harmful to it or its companions – for example to walk into a chasm or a similar command. The GM has the final say on the legitimacy of the command.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 17: Occult Arcana</h2><p>Your psyche is now an impenetrable fortress, resistant to the darkest of intrusions.</p><p>You are always under the effects of the <span class=\"italic\">mind blank</span> spell.</p><p style=\"margin-top:100px\" class=\"h2\"></p></div>"

This is the echo of Maat, the ancient Egyptian essence of truth, order, and harmony. From this primordial concept, the Sorcerers of the Soul of Maat draw their profound power, their magic intertwined with the timeless scales of justice and morality.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">These sorcerers are not mere conjurers of spells: they are living vessels of Maat, guardians of equilibrium in a chaotic universe. Their presence oscillates between shadow and light, their very souls a testament to the age-old dance of truth and balance. Every incantation they invoke is touched by the divine essence of harmony, and their gaze, penetrating and wise, reflects the eternal quest for order.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">Clad in robes woven from threads of destiny and bearing staffs carved from ancient trees, these sorcerers carry a subtle yet powerful symbol – the ostrich feather, the emblem of Maat. It serves as a reminder of the universe's enduring search for balance: just as the hearts of the departed are weighed against this feather in age-old rites, so too do these sorcerers weigh their every action against the eternal scales of truth. In a world teetering on the precipice of imbalance, the Sorcerers of the Soul of Maat stand as unwavering sentinels of cosmic harmony.</p><p class=\"flower ha-red centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 1: Aspects of the Sands</h2><p>With ancient energy coursing through you, you call forth a primordial form, a titan of old, echoing an era when the world was young and wild.</p><p>At 1st level, by expending a 1st level spell slot as a bonus action, you embrace the form of a creature below.

Her smile, a subtle blend of triumph and secret delight, seemed to twist fate itself. Around her, the threads of destiny responded, bending gracefully to her silent command, making her the unseen weaver of a kingdom's fate in the heart of shadow.</p><p class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Under the same dark stars, an elderly elf saw the threads of the future in mirrors, gently separating each one, delving into the mysteries of time behind the misty mirrors of fate. His raven black hair fell over his black robe covered in magical runes, perfectly complementing the hands that wove fate in the darkness.</p><p class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">In the heart of the void between cosmic horror and stars, the masters of predestination work the stretched strings. Legends like the Fates sisters, Norns, Shai, and Kala swirl around in this space. Some follow these legends, while others encounter a weaver in their search for power and answers. Through their pact, they aim to take the threads of their fate into their own hands. The real question, however, is whether they are merely serving a fate already written, or can they truly rebel against a fate written with their own free will?</p><p class=\"flower centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h4 style=\"margin-top:40px\" class=\"ha-gold\">Expanded Spell List</h4><table class=\"roll color-gold\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Spell Level</p></td><td><p>Spells</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1st</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">alarm, shield</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2nd</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">augury, rope trick</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3rd</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">glyph of warding, sending</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4th</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">divination, fabricate</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5th</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">commune, legend lore</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 1: Fate’s Twist</h2><p>Bound to the timeless weavers, your soul resonates with the very threads of fate and the inexorable march of time, making you a living conduit of the universe's most enigmatic designs.</p><p>Starting at 1st level, you can twist the threads of fate around you, and you can do that a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier and regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Bound Fate</h3><p>As a bonus action, you bind your fate with a willing creature within 30 ft. of you for 1 minute. During that minute, you can magically swap places or share damage. To swap places you must use your action, and the creature must be able to hear you. After you swap places, the bond between you and the creature ends.</p><p>If either of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to split the damage in half (rounded up) and divide them amongst two of you, if the creature is willing. When you do so, the one that originally did not take the damage reduces the damage by half and your bond ends.</p><p>At 6th level, your range for this feature becomes 40 ft. At 11th level, it becomes 60 ft.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Bound Time</h3><p>As an action you can rewind time for a brief moment whenever you or an ally that you can see within 30 ft. of you is endangered. If you or a creature you can see fails an ability check or takes a hit, you can use your reaction to reroll the dice. If the target is hostile to you, it can avoid the reroll by succeeding on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.</p><p>At 6th level, you can also rewind saving throws.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 6: Threads Intertwined</h2><p>The cryptic tapestries of destiny unfurl before your gaze, as your grasp over the intricate weaves of fate tightens, plunging you deeper into the world's shadowed secrets.</p><p>When you reach 6th level, you can magically control another humanoid’s fate within 15 ft. of you.

On a failed save, you decide on its fate:</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Bound.</span> It is stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Speechless.</span> It can’t talk for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Ill-Fated.</span> It has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p><p>You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest or you can expend a spell slot to refresh it. If you expend a spell slot in this way, it can’t be restored until you finish a long rest.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 10: Threads Past and Future</h2><p>With the arcane rites whispered in forbidden tongues, you summon the audacity to beckon fate to your circle, demanding answers from the very cosmos that dares to weave destinies in its silent loom.</p><p>At 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes and 150 gd worth of special herbs that are collected under the blood moon to make a sacred ritual known to the weavers. You name a specific event, person, war, or place that existed in the past and ask up to five questions about it. Your patron or another entity related to that name answers the questions with one sentence. The answer’s accuracy depends on the nature of the creature.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 14: Foretold Life</h2><p>Bound to the very sinews of time, your communion with fate elevates you to an omnipotent apex, where you deftly pull and twist the strings of destiny, reshaping the world's narrative in your dark design.</p><p>A 14th level, you learn the <span class=\"italic\">foresight</span> spell and it doesn’t count against the warlock spells you know or Mystic Arcanum that is available to you. Until you reach 17th level, it works differently for you. You can cast it using an action, without expending a spell slot and its duration is 1 minute. When you reach 17th level, if you choose the foresight spell for your Mystic Arcanum, you can use this feature to cast it without expending a use of Mystic Arcanum, but the spell’s duration is 1 hour for you.</p><p class=\"h2 ha-gold\"></p></div>"

Wise and inventive arcanists from the cradle of civilization emerge, an enclave of scholars and artisans who weave together the ethereal mysteries of the cosmos with the tangible intricacies of metallurgy, engineering, and precise mathematics.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">These are not mere blacksmiths or scholars but visionaries who see the universe as a grand machine, its gears propelled by spells and equations. Their forges glow with both fire and arcane energy, crafting artifacts that bridge the chasm between science and sorcery. Every creation is an embodiment of precise calculations, underpinned by age-old enchantments.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">In their workshops, star charts lay beside intricate blueprints, and equations meld seamlessly with incantations. For a member of this conclave and one that follows the footsteps of minds from all corners, the universe is both a vast expanse to be explored and a complex mechanism to be understood.

You must expend a spell slot to create them. Additionally, if they have a Ritual (-R) tag, you can prepare them beforehand without expending a spell slot but still must spend the cost on necessary materials.

When you expend a spell slot as a bonus action while holding this compass, you can whisper a location’s name to it, and it will magically point to that location until the end of your long rest. The location must be specific and one of a kind – for example, the city of Samarkand, House of Wisdom in Baghdad, Forbidden City in Beijing, or Mahmud al-Isfahani’s Blacksmith Shop. Personal residence and similar locations do not work (for example, Farhad bin Abu Bakr’s House won’t work); the location must be a public place or at least must be known to many people.

It works and functions like a normal mirror and has other magical properties. Whenever you activate its magical powers, shapechangers, aberrations, fiends, feys, celestials and the undead shine with an aura in the mirror (if it can’t have reflections, only an aura is seen). The activation lasts for 10 minutes and can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p>When you reach 6th level, when such a creature’s reflection is caught in the mirror, you can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher as a reaction and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 psychic damage.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Wondrous Hook</h3><p>This hook works as a normal grappling hook with some magical properties. If a silk rope is bound to the hook, its magic prevents the silk from being ripped due to weight. It still can be torn by taking damage. Also, you can use its command word for it to cling to any surface you like or summon it back to your hand.</p><h2 class=\"ha-gold\">Level 2: Aspirant Inventor</h2><p>You learn how to properly focus your arcane essence to mend the broken by deconstructing the broken objects' intricacies.</p><p>You learn the <span class=\"italic\">mending</span> cantrip.

By spending 30 gd and 10 minutes you can give an object a walking speed of 20 feet and ability to obey one command from you (Chosen when you first use this benefit). These commands can be from prestidigitation spell or another command that would suit the object’s nature. You can issue the command as a bonus action. The object has 10 AC and 20 HP. Additionally, it can record a voice up to ten seconds and can repeat it one time. The voice recording takes 1 action and if not repeated in the next 8 hours, it is deleted immediately. You can have only three such items at the same time.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your Search action as a bonus action and when you do so, you can identify substances and materials of objects and items easily.</p><h2 class=\"ha-gold\">Level 10: Spirit of Everything</h2><p>Your feats of engineering are unparalleled, and you learned how to infuse your creations with an essence of your psyche.
