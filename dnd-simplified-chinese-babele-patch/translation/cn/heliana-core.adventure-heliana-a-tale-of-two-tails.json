      "description": "<p>Greetings, hunter! What you have here is a monster hunt from <em>Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting</em>. Heliana's hunts require your players to find the monster, picking up clues along the way, and then defeat it in an epic multi-wave boss battle. Be<strong> really obvious</strong> with the clues; make sure to give out the associated handouts. After the clues have been collected, but before the boss fight begins, the players should always have a chance to long rest and use what they've learned to prepare for the fight ahead.</p><p>This hunt makes full use of the Tracking, Harvesting, Crafting, and Cooking rules from Heliana's—be sure to read up on those! Using the Cooking rules to prepare magical meals is a great way the players can monopolise on the clues! Each of these Foundry Adventures comes with:</p><ul><li><p>PDF of the hunt.</p></li><li><p>Three clue handouts to be given to the players before they meet the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Handouts of the fantastical things the players might see along the way.</p></li><li><p>Walled and lit scenes, with each wave's monsters separated by level.</p></li><li><p>Actors with original tokens.</p></li><li><p>Lair actions given their own actor (be sure to put it at initiative count 20!).</p></li><li><p>Magic items that can be found during the hunt, as well as those that can be crafted from the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Spells that the monsters and magic items use.</p></li></ul><h3>About This Hunt</h3><p>This hunt, <em>A Tale of Two Tails</em>, is intended for 3 to 7 characters and is optimised for a party of 4 with an average party level (APL) of <strong>6</strong>, <strong>13</strong>, or <strong>18</strong>. Characters who complete this hunt should earn enough experience to progress one-third of the way to 7th, three-fifths of the way to 14th level, or three-quarters of the way to 19th level. The adventurers must locate the lair of mob boss Tony Two Tails, and rid the desert of his infernal influence.</p><p>After tracking down Tony’s location in the Lotof’s End Desert, the party must contend with his magic-subverting traits and horde of bestial swarms, devils, and undead. Offensive spellcasters will be at a disadvantage in the final fight; a means of dealing radiant damage, abilities that target fiends and undead, and characters experienced in tracking will be of use in this hunt.</p><h3>Credits</h3><p><strong>Lead Designers</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Lead Writer</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Rule Development</strong>: Max Wartelle, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih</p><p><strong>Additional Writing</strong>: João Araújo, Mage Armoire, Tony Casper, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Jethro Mellors, Duncan Watson</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Phylea, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Formatting</strong>: Sally Kay Clark, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Proofing</strong>: João Araújo, Sally Kay Clark, Jessic Gombart, Victor Matyiku</p><p><strong>Art Directors</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Layout</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Cover Illustrator</strong>: Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Interior Illustrators</strong>: Diogo Assunçao, Hannah Elizabeth Baker, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Luciano Javier Carreira, Ivy Dolamore, Aleksa Drageljevic, Sam Jumisko, Michelle Mueller, Derek Murphy, Mikhail Palamarchuk, Joris Sanchez, Ognjen Sporin, Bryan Syme, Chaouki ‘’Ciao’” Titouhi, Denis Zhbankov</p><p><strong>Cartographers</strong>: Cze &amp; Peku, Mad Cartographer</p><p><strong>Cacophonics the Bard</strong>: Jack Patchett</p><p><strong>Ambience</strong>: Michaël Ghelfi Studios</p><p><strong>Marketing Consultant</strong>: Ricardo Evangelho</p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong>: Ethen Adams, Sally Kay Clark, Ricardo Evangelho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Piotr “Narb” Wiśnios</p><p><strong>Playtesters:</strong> A11star, Adam Bohkari, Addy, aj, alpha_spark, Alzebub, Balbowa, Blanket, Buront, Catbath, Constantine, cypheur, Danger7778, Derpy, Douglas, Erunas, Feria, Ghost, GremlinRemy, GrimOptimist, Igris, Jambo Kaka, jasoncelic, Jesse Marek, JonDemand, junkdroid, Kaniki, Kensho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Kobe Montour, Korren, Kristjan the Necrom, luke4495, Megan Pisarik, MementoMorrie, MonoXideAtWork, MrMonneypenny, Naming Fae, narnia3756, NeK0z, Neldu, NickWolf8 , One True Doge, Osirusblue, Phillip , PulsarCologne, RabidAmazonian, Relle, Rohdry, RutledgeHusband, SendHelp, Shadowpaine, Siggy, Sir Mk, SleepySpartan, Solo, Stevie Friesth, Taoko, teepea298, TheNewBadHombre, TinyKitty, Toria, Truwolf, Ulysses, victorcree, Victor Matyiku, vivacia, Watermelon, wyvernvalet, Zachary Nix</p>",
