While many of the wicked and crooked denizens of the realm turn the might and magic of the eternal night toward sinister machinations that bring horror, death, and destruction, just as many would-be heroes take up these powers to protect their homes and loved ones. However, when it comes to the strange and often grim abilities wielded in Druskenvald, morality is never clear, and there is always the chance that they can lead toward a path of darkness despite the best intentions.</p><p class=\"p3\">Native inhabitants of Druskenvald are more naturally inclined towards these powers, but outsiders who travel to the realm through the Shroud can just as easily discover and harness them. This has led to a wide variety of folk from across the realm and even in the lands of the living that embrace and unleash these fearsome abilities.</p></div></div><h2>Folk Horror Subclasses</h2><p class=\"p2\">This chapter presents Folk Horror subclasses for each of the 12 core classes, weaving the themes and inspirations of the genre into characters who can serve as protagonists of their own dreadful folktale. You can find a list of these options and a brief summary of each listed below.</p><h3><strong>Folk Horror Subclasses</strong></h3><table class=\"foundry-header-red\" border=\"0\"><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Subclass</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Path of the Experiment</td><td>Unleash strange modifications to the body</td></tr><tr><td>Bard</td><td>College of Whistles</td><td>Whistle up ghostly companions</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Harvest Domain</td><td>Channel the divine through harvest cycles</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>Circle of the Old Ways</td><td>Unleash the primeval forest’s power</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>Circle of Wicker</td><td>Weave primal magic through wicker effigies</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Barrow Guard</td><td>Command prowess from beyond the grave</td></tr><tr><td>Monk</td><td>Way of the Pestilent Haze</td><td>Harness plague against your foes</td></tr><tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Oath of Castigation</td><td>Burn away wickedness with righteous fire</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Grim Harbinger</td><td>Mark foes with a hound of doom</td></tr><tr><td>Rogue</td><td>Sinner</td><td>Bend fate and hex foes through jinxcraft</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>Crimson Dynasty</td><td>Manipulate blood and vitality of allies and enemies</td></tr><tr><td>Warlock</td><td>The Great Fool</td><td>Harness chaotic laughter to confound foes</td></tr><tr><td>Warlock</td><td>The Horned King</td><td>Practice witchcraft to deliver curses and boons</td></tr><tr><td>Wizard</td><td>Occultism</td><td>Draw power from forbidden knowledge</td></tr><tr><td>Wizard</td><td>Philosophy</td><td>Master fundamental truths of creation through alchemy</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Folk Horror Class Theming</h2><p class=\"p2\">If you do not wish to select one of the aforementioned subclasses, there are numerous ways to flavor any subclass with the themes of Folk Horror to ensure that your character feels thematically appropriate in the setting and story of the Crooked Moon.

We appease it.”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>- Mayor Wendel Somerton -</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>An isolated and superstitious folk live in the village called Wickermoor. Having survived for centuries by heeding nature in its bounty and wrath, these simple folk have a certainty in their beliefs and an assurance that all will be well, despite the strange, supernatural, and often violent happenings around them. It is here where the characters must learn to live and find their place.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>Wickermoor Village is the oldest settlement in Wickermoor Hollow, the valley for which it’s named. The circumstances of its founding are as forgotten as its founder, but the people that live there take comfort in the Old Ways they adhere to, which haven’t changed in many generations. While the village is simple and rustic, many comforts and services offered in other small towns can be found here, and things have been relatively prosperous for the community even in the face of the occasional death or terror.</p><p>Despite being so isolated from the rest of Druskenvald, the people of Wickermoor Village are welcoming to outsiders, though they secretly try to persuade newcomers to join the community and worship the Old Ways.</p><p>To the unwary visitor, the town seems uneventful. However, it harbors a secret. A wicked cult operates in the shadows, communing with the malevolent specter known as the Crooked Man and the trio of revolting hags called the Vermintoll Coven. They seek to unleash Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen, and bring about the incarnation of her consort, the Horned King. If not stopped, their scheming will lead to the disintegration of all Druskenvald.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Wickermoor Village will serve as the central hub for <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign, from which frequent excursions will take the characters to various settlements throughout Wickermoor Hollow. Phillip and Adela Druskenvald will reside here for much of the adventure.</p><p>The village contains several NPCs and locations central to the events of the adventure’s main plot, as well as suggestions for various side quests. Many other NPCs have little direct bearing on the narrative of the adventure, but you can use them to expand upon your own subplots and encounters. Most NPCs can interweave with characters’ stories and goals through Fateweaving (see chapter 9).</p><img src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Leafs%2001.webp\" width=\"250\" class=\" centered\" style=\"border:0\" /></div>"

A ritual sacrifice, intended to save the town from danger, is playing out.</p><h2>The First Sacrifice</h2><p>When the characters arrive at Wickermoor Village, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>You finally arrive at Wickermoor Village and find a quaint town comprised of humble, timber-framed buildings with shingled roofs. You walk through empty streets and hear the tolling of bells from the clocktower that rises up from a large building at the center of town. You enter the circular town square, where a weathered statue of a featureless man stands across from a huge, gnarled oak covered in hundreds of carved faces.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Suddenly, a shrill shriek shatters the quiet, and you notice a struggling human shape at the base of the tree, bound and staked to the ground. Then, you hear deep, guttural growling from across the square. A pack of wolves led by a huge, shaggy pack leader approaches the squirming figure, their jaws slavering and eyes filled with bloodthirst.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The pack of animals entering town from the east contains six <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.yawTeS8u2FCfzzZH]{Wolves}</strong> led by a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.EYiQZ3rFL25fEJY5]{Dire Wolf}</strong>. They’ve been attracted by the shrieks of the bound sacrifice. Filled with the hate of the Crooked Queen, they are supernaturally aggressive and can’t be calmed or tamed by nonmagical methods.</p><p>The characters begin the encounter 120 feet from the tree to the west, and the pack is 120 feet east of the tree. The sacrifice is pinned by ropes to the ground to the north of the base of the Oak of Many Faces (area V10) and cannot escape without assistance. This encounter uses map 11.1.</p><h3><strong>Get Your Goat</strong></h3><p>When a character gets within 30 feet of the bound form, if they succeed on a [[/check INV DC 15]] check, they realize the form is not a person after all. They automatically succeed if they move to within 5 feet of the form.</p><p>A human-sized fabric doll made to look like a person is staked to the ground, and a smaller lump within the doll is struggling to get free.</p><p>A character can cut, tear, or rip the ropes or the doll itself to free the creature within. When they do, a baby <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.y8sRU8Ks2lcrGsaf]{Goat}</strong> (Tiny with no Ram attack) struggles free of the fabric and runs in a random direction to escape the area. A character can catch the baby goat as an action with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, or by grappling the goat. If the goat escapes while the wolves remain a threat, there is 50 percent chance that the wolves attack the goat or the characters.</p><p>If the characters do not interfere, the wolves devour the baby goat from within the fabric doll and then leave. Phillip and Adela look on in horror as this happens but do not pressure the characters to intervene.</p><h2>A Wickermoor Welcome</h2><p>Once the wolf attack is dealt with, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The door of a large building facing the town square opens, and a short and portly middle-aged man emerges.

We were not expecting you this evening, and you caught us in the middle of one of our sacred traditions.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Please accept my sincere and heartfelt welcome to Wickermoor Village. I am Mayor Wendel Somerton. I am so pleased you’ve finally accepted my invitation to our humble community.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Mayor Somerton welcomes the characters and the Druskenvalds with grace and warmth, explaining that the attempted sacrifice they stumbled upon was a yearly ritual to feed the beasts of the woods and the roots of the great oak with an offering of lifeblood. Such a sacrifice in honor of the Green Queen (see “Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen” in chapter 8) ensures bountiful hunts and healthy livestock for the coming year.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/11-1_The_Founders_Round.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h3><strong>Sacrificed the Goat?</strong></h3><p>If the characters allowed the wolves to devour the baby goat, Mayor Somerton thanks them for not disturbing their customs and assures them that the Green Queen has witnessed their deference to the Old Ways and has granted them her vitality. The characters gain [[/damage 1d12 healing]]{6 (1d12) temporary hit points}.</p><h3><strong>Saved the Goat?</strong></h3><p>If the characters intervened and saved the goat, Mayor Somerton brushes off the interruption of the ritual and claims, “the oak still feeds on the blood of the stalking beasts.” However, a character who succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 17]] check can tell he is disturbed by the disruption but is feigning otherwise due to his desire to ingratiate himself with Phillip and Adela.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Mayor_Wendel_Somerton.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><h3><strong>What Wendel Knows</strong></h3><p>Mayor Somerton is pleasant and welcoming but carries himself with reserved poise. Use the details below to guide the conversation with him:</p><ul><li><p>He assures Phillip and Adela that the Druskenvald Estate (area V24) is in pristine condition and its servants are ready to fulfill their every want and need.</p></li><li><p>He shares the town’s history and provides a brief insight to the methods of the Old Ways (see chapter 8).</p></li><li><p>He suggests establishments the characters should visit (see “Wickermoor Village” later in the chapter) and recommends the Green Queen Inn for lodging.</p></li><li><p>He presents Wickermoor Village as a prosperous and happy town, but if pressed by a character who succeeds on a [[/check PER DC 15]] or [[/check ITM DC 15]] check, he admits that there have been more disappearances, illnesses, and deaths than usual.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Time to Traverse Town</strong></h3><p>When the conversation with Mayor Somerton winds down, Phillip bids the characters farewell.</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>“We’ve had some adventures, eh? Adela and I are exhausted, and I need to see whether this mayor is telling the truth about the state of this manor I apparently own. We’re going to go settle in now, but do come visit tomorrow for dinner!”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>If the characters state they want to stay with the Druskenvalds, Phillip politely declines. He says that he doesn’t know the situation at the estate, and the characters have done enough already. A character who succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 15]] check can tell there is a clear unease about him after the harrowing trip and perhaps more.</p><p><em><strong>Parting Ways.</strong></em> Phillip gives each character [[/award 10gp]] and tells them to get rooms at the inn for the evening—his treat. Then, he and Adela take the path up the hill toward the Druskenvald Estate.</p><p><em><strong>Watchful Eyes.</strong></em> Many townsfolk watched the attempted sacrifice through shuttered windows and cracked doors. Some devout Followers of the Old Ways (see chapter 8) may be offended and feel hostile toward the characters if they disrupted the ritual. Others may be more forgiving and see this as an opportunity to persuade them to convert.</p><p>Some of the townsfolk recognize Phillip and Adela, but most are unaware of life outside of Wickermoor Hollow. The malevolent cultists in service of the Crooked Queen can see their presence strongly, and the more worldly Newcomers (see chapter 8) know of and admire Phillip’s lordship over Druskenvald.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/maps/map%20region/MAP_11_2_Wickermoor_Village.webp\" alt=\"\" /><p><em><strong>First Night in Town.</strong></em> If characters arrive in the Evening Hour, most businesses are closed. However, the characters can walk the streets to see what’s in town—and they can visit many of the locations and NPCs during the following night before their dinner with the Druskenvalds (see chapter 12).</p><p><em><strong>Getting Rooms.</strong></em> The only place that rents decent rooms in Wickermoor Village is the Green Queen Inn. Alda Farnum, owner and proprietor, offers single rooms for [[/award -1gp]] per night, or triple rooms for [[/award -2gp]] per night, which includes a hot bath and a hot breakfast in the Twilight Hour. The first night’s sleep for the characters is peaceful and uneventful.</p><p><em><strong>What Now?</strong></em> From this point forward, you are encouraged to play out the story based on your own inclinations and preferences, as well as the actions and goals of the characters. If you incorporate Fateweaving (see chapter 9) into the adventure, find reasons for the characters to run into their Connection NPCs (see “Wickermoor Village” below).</p><p>Once the characters are ready to accept the Druskenvalds’ dinner invitation, they can travel up the hill on the northwest side of town to the Druskenvald Estate, which is ready to turn crooked (see chapter 12).</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter11_Wickermoor_Village.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div></div></div>"

This plot is woven throughout the chapters of this adventure, with each new foe defeated bringing their plan closer to fruition. Refer to the “Back in Wickermoor Village” section of subsequent chapters to see how the town will be affected by the story’s development.</p><p>However, the information earlier in this chapter includes just a handful of the people, places, and plots that are possible in Wickermoor Village. This town should provide the framework to create your own adventures that you can interweave throughout the events of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>. Use the details below as inspiration for fleshing out the adventure and making it truly your own.</p><h2>Subplots</h2><p>If you wish to give the characters some downtime from the main plot and steer them toward some lower stakes side quests, you can use the subplots below. You will need to create hooks to draw the characters’ attention to these plots and decide on the details to fit them best in your story. They can be used in between any adventure chapters when the characters return to Wickermoor Village.</p><h3><strong>The Return of Gory Gus</strong></h3><p>A year ago, the cold, calculating killer Gus Strong—called “Gory Gus” by the population—was tried and then beheaded before the Oak of Many Faces (area V10) as punishment for his crimes. On the anniversary of his beheading, one of the townsfolk is murdered in the same way that Gus killed his victims. Evidence points to one of the characters being the killer. Clues can be found and followed to exonerate the character, showing that Gory Gus’s apprentice has picked up her master’s gory trade.</p><h3><strong>A Bad Seed</strong></h3><p>Villagers begin falling ill under mysterious circumstances during a special picnic celebrating a recent rich bounty of fruit, honey, and dairy. Clues at the picnic point to cursed apples being the culprit. The characters can investigate the apple orchard, where one of the townsfolk has entered a pact with Fiends in return for riches and power. The diabolist and the Fiends must be killed to break the withering curse that is affecting the picnic attendees.</p><h3><strong>The Bloody Cup</strong></h3><p>The village hosts an annual sporting and gaming event where teams from different parts of Wickermoor Hollow come together to compete. This year, the events of the competition turn bloody—or bloodier than normal—as “accidents” begin to plague the competition. The characters can compete on behalf of Wickermoor Village or watch, but without their intervention, the competition turns into a bloodbath.</p><h3><strong>The Play’s the Deadly Thing</strong></h3><p>Hickock and Company, a traveling troupe of actors led by the flamboyant George Hickock, comes to town to perform a play in the Green Queen Inn theater at the request of Alda Farnum. A cast member dies under mysterious circumstances. Can the characters solve the murder? More importantly, can they finish the play titled <em>The Prince in Gold?</em></p><h3><strong>The Lottery</strong></h3><p>A stranger comes to town, promising a great prize for people who willingly take part in a lottery. The stranger fails to reveal that, while the winner does receive a grand prize, someone—or several folks—lose the lottery and must pay a terrible price. The characters can intervene at risk of paying the price themselves.</p><h2>Town with a Secret Cult</h2><p>A secret cult operates within the shadows of Wickermoor Village, and behind every kind, smiling face could lurk one of its members. You can use the NPCs showcased earlier in this chapter as written, but are encouraged to adjust their alignments, allegiances, and goals in ways that best enhance your unique adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>.</p><p>Because of the secretive and deceptive nature of the cult that serves the Crooked Queen and its direct connection to the prominent faith of the Old Ways, any NPC can secretly be a villain for the characters to uncover in a shocking twist. Alternatively, conniving NPCs that the characters believe to be sinister can be revealed to have been subtly working against Kehlenn’s minions all along.</p><p>For ease of reference, below are the various groups of people in Wickermoor Village as written for the baseline adventure. Feel free to rearrange these lists as best suits your needs, keeping in mind the impact on Fateweaving Threads (see chapter 9) and future quest hooks. You are encouraged to prepare for the climactic confrontation with the cult of the Crooked Queen atop Rowan’s Rise (see chapter 23), making sure to foreshadow and consider the connections that the characters make with NPCs throughout the adventure.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap25 middle-page\"><p class=\"h2\">What's Become of Wickermoor?</p><p>After the defeat of the Horned King and the Crooked Queen, the characters leave the Wytchwood to find Wickermoor Hollow forever changed by their time in the valley. Although its people have grown accustomed to difficult lives filled with hardship and horror, the events in the recent weeks have deeply shaken even the hollow’s hardiest folk.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s5\">Of all the places in the valley, Wickermoor Village has suffered the most since the characters first arrived from beyond the Shroud. Following the chaos unleashed by the minions of the Crooked Queen, some people search for a scapegoat to blame and exact vengeance upon, while others hope to leverage the instability to gain power. Most of the townsfolk, however, simply want to get their old lives back and return to some form of normalcy.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">How the specific NPCs have been affected is largely dependent on the connections and choices that the characters made and how you chose to incorporate them throughout the adventure, especially during the burning of the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise.</p><p class=\"p6\">As the characters spend time in Wickermoor Village to wrap up their unfinished business, make sure to tie up plot lines and provide closure with the surviving NPCs that became important to the characters. The people of the various ideologies and groups of the village respond to the recent horrors in the following ways.</p><h3><span class=\"s7\"><strong>Followers of the Old Ways</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">With the cult of the Crooked Queen exposed and almost entirely wiped out, the followers of the Old Ways who revered the Green Queen and never fell to wickedness become more entrenched in their superstitions and beliefs, blaming the corruption of their kin on the influence of new and profane ideals brought to the valley over the years. They become more distrustful of nonbelievers and anyone outside of their community, even going so far as to drive off members of the other groups. Wickermoor Hollow and its settlements retreat into the comfort of the old ideals.</p><h3><span class=\"s7\"><strong>Fold of the Patient Lady</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Many adherents of the Patient Lady see the apocalyptic inevitability of magic and strange supernatural power and conclude that they must escape this doom, trusting that the wilds will provide for them. They chase off their own members who have magical abilities, leave the settlements of Wickermoor Hollow, and relocate to the natural world they view as a paradise, even if they do not have the survival skills to withstand the harsh conditions that await them.</p><h3><span class=\"s7\"><strong>The Brightsingers</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Unlike the Fold of the Patient Lady, the Brightsingers do not lose hope in their community, seeing the recent disasters as proof that the bizarre superstitions and grim rituals of the valley are heretical acts that nearly brought about the doom of Druskenvald. Energized with a zealous desire to convert the folk who hold outdated beliefs to their newer religion filled with light, love, and truth, they call more missionaries to the valley and begin to aggressively spread their faith.</p><h3><span class=\"s7\"><strong>The Newcomers</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The death of Phillip Druskenvald represents the crumbling of everything he stood for. All his vision, forward thinking, progress, and enlightenment could not save him from the hate of the old things. The newcomers in the valley see that there is little left for them, and what little hope they had was foolishness. Most of these folk will leave Wickermoor Hollow behind and seek civilizations that share their ideals, perhaps even seeking passage aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> to discover new horizons beyond Druskenvald.</p></div>"

They may want to go home and put the horror of Druskenvald behind them, they might want to discover what awaits in the other provinces of the land of eternal night, or they could seek new horizons in other strange worlds within the Shroud. The possibilities are endless, but what matters is that their part in this story is over.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">There’s an Old Black Train A-Comin’</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">During the Midnight Hour, when the characters are ready to depart Wickermoor Hollow, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The darkness of the Midnight Hour surrounds you as a heavy fog shrouds the valley in an eerie gloom. A faint, distant music sails through the air—a single fiddle. Then a shrill whistle that sounds of wailing souls pierces the quiet of night, heralding the rumbling, chugging, and scraping of a locomotive. A single circle of ghastly blue-green light grows larger in the fog as the engine of the Ghostlight Express thunders out of the gloom on rails of mist. It slows before screeching to a halt in front of you.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p11\"><em><strong>The darkened windows of the passenger car flank the single side door that opens with a creak. Out hops the Vagrant, a sprig of wheat in the corner of his mouth and his trusty fiddle in the back pocket of his patchy trousers. His sly smile is followed by a knowing wink. “Y’all didn’t think I forgot about ya, did ya? All aboard!”</strong></em></p></blockquote><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_EPILOGUE_Woodcut.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">The characters once again realize that they each have a one-way ticket for the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, but this time it says, “Destination: Unknown.” The Vagrant casually apologizes for how long it took him to fix up the locomotive, claiming that he ran into some complications that he will not elaborate on. He tells them that he owes them a ride and asks where they’re headed.</p><p class=\"p6\">If Phillip and Adela are mentioned, he briefly removes his hat for a moment of silence before stating that he’s sorry to have heard what happened to them, but he shrugs and claims that death comes for everyone, even the deathless. He shares rumors that the power vacuum in the Crescent Court has led to a power struggle among the lords and ladies of the court, intensified by the recent increase of wicked activity from the Coven of the Midnight Moon.</p><p class=\"p6\">When the characters give the Vagrant their tickets and tell him where they’d like to go, he agrees and welcomes them aboard the passenger car, which has no spectral passengers this trip. As the characters get settled, the frogman hops off to his cab to prepare to move on.</p><p class=\"p6\">When the time has come to conclude the session, the adventure, and the campaign, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Following a single burst of the locomotive’s ghastly whistle, the Ghostlight Express lurches forward into the fog.

This adventure, <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, is a folk horror story applied to 5E, a game of heroic fantasy. Interweaving these themes is no small challenge, but this chapter and the stories ahead are written to provide you with the tools you need to achieve a thrilling and haunting campaign.</p><p>As the Game Master (GM), it is your role to play as the world of Druskenvald itself and everything else within it. You are the deep woods, the shadows between the trees, and the monsters that stalk the eternal night. You are the folk, both sinister and sincere, that inhabit the sleepy villages and remote homesteads on the fringes of civilization.</p><p>You are also guiding your friends, who take the role of Player Characters (referred to as “characters” in this adventure). They are the protagonists of this horror story, and you are responsible for being their senses; they cannot fully experience the terror of Druskenvald without knowing what they see, hear, smell, and touch—and sometimes taste. To refresh yourself on how to run folk horror and instill dread and tension, refer to the Introduction of this book.</p><p>While the previous chapter overviewed the story of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, this chapter highlights the relevant features and mechanical details of the campaign, as well as tips and tricks for reading the book. Most of the features and systems below are entirely optional, and the adventure is written so that none are required. It is up to you to determine what to implement to run a game that is best suited for your table.</p><h2>Adventure Features</h2><p>Each chapter in the adventure includes background information, general guidance, and location features, as well as how encounters, NPCs, and monsters should be presented and where their treasure might be found.</p><p>Pay close attention to the formatting and cross-references throughout each chapter. When a creature’s name is bolded and marked with a * symbol (for example, the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.zCFEcKc4a46mHGjB]{Hypnovulfen}</strong>*), the creature’s stat block can be found in Appendix A: Bestiary. When a magic item’s name is italicized and marked with a * symbol (for example, the <em>Scythe of the Harvest Terror</em>*), the magic item’s details can be found in Appendix B: Treasury. Backgrounds, spells, and other options from within this book are also marked in this way.</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Boxed text that appears like this is meant to be read or paraphrased aloud.</strong></em></p></blockquote><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:6px;bottom:6px;left:6px;right:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:relative;z-index:3\"><p><strong>GM Sidebar</strong></p><p>Text that looks like this is for advice or other helpful information that will help you run the adventure.</p></div><h3><strong>Lost in Isolation</strong></h3><p><em>The Crooked Moon</em> assumes that the only means of traveling in and out of Druskenvald is through the Shroud with the guidance of entities like The Vagrant—soul shepherds called “Strangers” (see chapter 1). Additionally, once the characters arrive in Wickermoor Hollow with Phillip and Adela Druskenvald, the ancient power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen, ensnares them and prevents them from leaving the province. Wickermoor Hollow has the following features if you wish to keep the characters trapped and alone:</p><p><strong>In the Mist.</strong> No magic, such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]{Plane Shift}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsterfeatures.Item.PPzVD90vab60FqCt]{Teleport}</em>, can transport a creature beyond the borders of Druskenvald without being shepherded by a Stranger.</p><p><strong>Crooked Grasp. </strong>Physical and magical travel out of Wickermoor Hollow is made impossible by ancient wards. When a creature tries to exit, it gets lost and ends up being teleported to a forest within the valley.</p><p><strong>Cut Off.</strong> Any attempts to communicate magically with creatures outside of Wickermoor Hollow automatically fail.</p><h3><strong>Fear of the Dark</strong></h3><p>In a horror campaign, requiring all characters to deal with the aspects of night that instill fear in humanity can increase the tension and dread. You can use the following optional rules to limit certain characters’ features to make the sleeping hours more horrifying. If you wish to implement them, be sure to discuss the details with your players ahead of the campaign to ensure it enhances the fun for your table.</p><p><strong>All Must Sleep.</strong> While in Druskenvald, characters who don’t need to sleep during long rests in other realms must sleep to stave off exhaustion, though they can still resist magic that might put them to sleep, if able.</p><p><strong>Creeping Dark.</strong> Characters who benefit from darkvision find this trait suppressed, though magic that grants darkvision such as from a spell or magic item still functions. This does not affect monsters or NPCs.</p><h3><strong>Time in Druskenvald</strong></h3><p>As a realm of eternal night, Druskenvald’s unusual time cycle (see chapter 1) is an essential part of the setting’s atmosphere. While a sun never rises above the horizon, the amount of light and the color of the sky change throughout each night, from the purple of Twilight Hour, through the orange glow Dusk Hour, to the blues of Nightfall Hour and Evening Hour, and finally the pitch black of Midnight Hour and Witching Hour.</p><p>Note the time when describing the land’s natural light and weather, and reflect it through the dialogue of NPCs who have an intuitive sense of Druskenvald’s unique night cycle. While it can be tricky to enforce this language throughout the game, and it’s fine to refer to real-world time periods for clarity, using cues like “We leave at the Twilight Hour” or “Let’s settle in before the Witching Hour” makes for a more immersive experience.</p><h4><strong>Time in Druskenvald</strong></h4><table border=\"0\"><thead><tr><th>Period Name</th><th>Equivalent Time Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Twilight Hour</td><td>Morning (7 to 11 a.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Dusk Hour</td><td>Midday (11 a.m. to 3 p.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Nightfall Hour</td><td>Afternoon (3 to 7 p.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Evening Hour</td><td>Evening (7 to 11 p.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Midnight Hour</td><td>Late Night (11 p.m. to 3 a.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Witching Hour</td><td>Early Morning (3 to 7 a.m.)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Overland Travel</strong></h3><p>Wickermoor Village serves as the hub of the adventure, and most chapters involve the characters traveling from what little safety is offered there to another remote location within Wickermoor Hollow. Though travel in the valley is rarely straightforward, you may pick up each chapter where it begins and convey the characters back to town after each chapter by briefly narrating the travel in between.</p><p>If you choose to simulate overland travel between each location, the following options can help your players get a better sense of Wickermoor Hollow’s size:</p><ul><li><p>Use the map of Wickermoor Hollow to estimate travel distances. The map of this province is deliberately not to scale, and the details on it are not precise, which allows for flexibility in this folktale adventure. However, an easy shorthand in determining travel distances is that most of the areas throughout the valley are a three-to-five night trek from Wickermoor Village, depending on how treacherous and overgrown the terrain is. Exceptions to this include Foxwillow and Maidenmist Cemetery, which are a one-to-two night walk on foot.</p></li><li><p>No journey is a direct route, and there are few well-traveled roads in the valley. It is up to your discretion how many nights it takes to follow the valley’s winding paths to the characters’ destinations.</p></li><li><p>Change the weather and vary terrain to create a feeling of distance. Successful Nature, Perception, and Survival checks can aid travel and avoid dangers.</p></li><li><p>You can add combat encounters with creatures featured in Appendix A or other sources to reinforce the coming chapter’s themes and make the valley feel dangerous. These encounters should serve the narrative and not feel random.</p></li></ul><p>Overland travel can give characters time to reflect, interact, and plan. Strategically allot moments for travel when the story has an opportunity to slow down; it can make the valley feel alive and hint at the horrors that await. But, do not dally when precious game time is limited—jump to the next step with a brief description.</p><h3><strong>Mortality</strong></h3><p><em><strong>Death is never far in Druskenvald.</strong></em> When a character dies, their spirit lingers in Druskenvald until the Crooked Queen is defeated. At your discretion, if there is little chance for resurrection, you may offer players a chance to deny their character's death by accepting a Dark Bargain of your choice (see chapter 6), which restores the character to life with all of their hit points. This is a great narrative opportunity to add additional consequences aside from what is included in the features of the Dark Bargain.</p><p><em><strong>Deaths of the Druskenvalds.</strong></em> Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are two key NPCs whose fates play a pivotal role in the climax of the adventure. Their deaths are fated to occur in chapters 24 and 23, respectively. Any attempts by the characters to kill Phillip and Adela fail, and the ancient power of Kehlenn teleports them to safety so they can be sacrificed at the right moment.</p><h2>Character Advancement</h2><p><em>The Crooked Moon</em> takes characters from 1st level to 14th level. The campaign is designed with specific story moments for character advancement instead of awarding XP. Nearly every chapter advances the characters’ level at its conclusion. Use the table below to guide level advancement throughout the adventure.</p><p>If you and your players wish to continue the dreadful folktale past the primary storyline of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, refer to the rules and guidance in Chapter 26: Moonfall.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter8_Ghostlight_Express.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div></div><h1>Campaign Overview</h1><table border=\"0\"><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Chapter</th><th>Villain</th><th>Content Warnings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The Ghostlight Express</td><td>The Ghostlight Locomotive</td><td>Corruption, train accidents</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Wickermoor Village</td><td>—</td><td>Community conflict, harm to animals, medical trauma, religious conflict</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>The Crooked House</td><td>The Weasel Hag</td><td>Body horror, family trauma, harm to children, suicide</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Fields of the Crow</td><td>The Harvest Terror</td><td>Adultery, demonic possession, family trauma, harm to animals</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The Crimson Monastery</td><td>The Crimson Abbot</td><td>Burning alive, devil worship, execution, kidnapping, religious conflict</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>The Drowned Crossroads</td><td>The Grinning Sinner</td><td>Curses, firearms, hedonism, gambling</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Skitterdeep Mine</td><td>The Centipede Hag</td><td>Body horror, claustrophobia, disease, insects</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Memory’s Rest</td><td>The Weeping Widow</td><td>Body horror, hospitals, illness, kidnapping, mutation, needles, surgery</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Hartsblight Forest</td><td>The Beast of Blight</td><td>Disease, hallucinations, harm against animals, rot, wilderness</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Maidenmist Cemetery</td><td>The Chained Reaper</td><td>Claustrophobia, corruption, graves, harm against animals</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>The Roving Rookery</td><td>The Pigeon Hag</td><td>Body horror, community conflict, corruption, mass hysteria</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Fool’s Day</td><td>The Lord of Fools</td><td>Clowns, hallucinations, hedonism, subjugation</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>The Crooked Nightmare</td><td>The Vermintoll Abomination</td><td>Burning alive, child endangerment, family trauma, kidnapping, self-harm</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Wicker’s Vigil</td><td>The Wicker Man</td><td>Burning alive, community violence, religious conflict, ritual sacrifice</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>The Crooked Tree</td><td>The Horned King</td><td>Apocalypse, corruption, devil imagery, harm against animals, wilderness</td></tr></tbody></table><img style=\"border:none;margin:1.5em auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Tarot_Book_Title_Logo%20copy.webp\" alt=\"Section Art\" width=\"250\" /><div style=\"border-top:4px solid white;width:80%;margin:1em auto 0.3em auto\"><p> </p></div><h1>Fated Tarot Reading</h1><div style=\"border-top:1px solid white;width:60%;margin:0.3em auto 1.5em auto\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"max-width:750px;margin:0 auto;font-size:1.05em;text-align:justify;text-indent:2em\"><p>When the characters first meet Phillip and Adela Druskenvald aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> in chapter 10, Adela offers to give the characters a tarot reading. Simplified guidance for performing this reading is provided in the chapter, but below are rules to enhance the experience in a way that affects the adventure and foreshadows what’s to come.</p><h2>Fabled Rewards</h2><p>Many Fabled Heirlooms—magic items that level up with the characters—are presented in this book and can be found throughout the adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>. However, provisioning the characters with a veritable treasure trove of powerful items could quickly trivialize the threats that await them.</p><p>Therefore, the Fated Tarot Reading provides a method to determine which of the Fabled Heirlooms the characters can acquire. When Adela performs the reading aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, she uses only a portion of a full 78-card tarot deck. Instead, she shuffles the 22 most important cards, known as the Major Arcana, and pulls one for each character. Each card corresponds to a Fabled Heirloom or a powerful boon that can be found at specific points throughout the adventure (see “Major Arcana” below).</p><p>When the reading is complete, make note of which cards were pulled. Then, as you run the adventure, keep an eye out for sections titled “Fated Tarot Reading,” each of which features a Major Arcana card, its corresponding item or boon, and the location it can be found or the circumstance needed to achieve it. Only implement the features of these sections that include the cards that were drawn during the reading. Ignore all other instances of these chapter sections.</p><p>To determine these randomly, you can use your own tarot deck, shuffling the 22 Major Arcana cards and pulling them at the table. Alternatively, you can roll on the Fated Tarot table below. If you wish to equip the characters with items that are fitting for their abilities or story, you can simply choose a card for each character instead of drawing randomly.

You can implement this system to provide each character with a call to action, rewards tied to narrative progression, and the opportunity to experience a full personal arc.</p><p>These character arcs all end with the climax and conclusion of the main adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, and the narrative results that the characters achieve are often immense and intended to come with the end of a protagonist’s story as a player character. Fateweaving is written with the intention that your campaign concludes in the Epilogue and does not proceed into the events of Moonfall (see chapter 26), though you can adjust to allow for play beyond the scope of the adventure.</p><h2>How to Use Fateweaving</h2><p>You can incorporate Fateweaving into your adventure by taking the following steps, each of which is expanded upon later in this section:</p><p><strong>Select a Goal.</strong> Have each player pick a Thread of Fate from the list of thirteen presented below, which provides a specific goal for their character. Each character should follow a different Thread so they can experience their own unique story.</p><p><strong>Personalize.</strong> Work with each player to incorporate the Thread of Fate into their character’s backstory and motivation. They (or you) will need to make one major choice to customize the Thread to the specific character.</p><p><strong>Review Touchpoints.</strong> Once the Threads of Fate are selected and personalized, review the six major Narrative Touchpoints for each Thread that you will weave into your adventure. These are the key story moments that provide each character with a complete arc.</p><p><strong>Follow Symbols.</strong> Each Thread of Fate has a unique symbol associated with it. As you read through the adventure, keep an eye out for the symbols connected to the characters’ Threads, each instance of which marks a location or moment when and where a Narrative Touchpoint occurs.</p><p><strong>Implement Touchpoints.</strong> As you run the adventure, incorporate each character’s Narrative Touchpoint at the appropriate place, and make it clear that the relevant character has the spotlight when this occurs.</p><p><strong>Distribute Rewards.</strong> Each time a character completes a Narrative Touchpoint, reward them with its respective boon listed in the following section.</p><p><strong>Finish the Story.</strong> Continue this process until the adventure concludes, where you can deliver the final emotional Catharsis of each character’s arc.</p><h2>Narrative Touchpoints</h2><p>Fateweaving provides a full narrative arc for each character’s personal journey that unfolds in six major moments throughout the adventure called Narrative Touchpoints. These take each character from the Incitement of their quest all the way through the Catharsis at the end of their story. The location of each Narrative Touchpoint within the adventure differs depending on a character’s Thread of Fate.</p><p>Each of the Narrative Touchpoints are written to be open ended and not prescriptive so that they are easily customizable for a wide variety of backstories. It is up to you how to tailor each one to the specific character. Each Touchpoint should be accessible without ability checks and should not be easily missed.</p><p>Familiarizing yourself with the six types of Narrative Touchpoints and their associated rewards will help you interweave each progressive step along every character’s journey.</p><h3><strong>Incitement</strong></h3><p>The first Narrative Touchpoint connects a character’s Thread of Fate with the story of <em>The Crooked Moon</em> and affirms that the goal of their personal quest lies ahead in Druskenvald.</p><p><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This inciting moment can occur either aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> (chapter 10) or in the Crooked House (chapter 12).</p><p><strong>Reward.</strong> A character who encounters their Incitement receives inspiration.</p><h3><strong>Connection</strong></h3><p>The second Narrative Touchpoint takes the form of meeting a villager from Wickermoor Village who bears a particular connection with a character’s Thread of Fate and offers clues, aid, and guidance. Make note of how this Connection NPC's partnership with the character might affect their allegiances and potential involvement in future plot developments, particularly during the events of Wicker’s Vigil (see chapter 23).</p><p><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This NPC can be found in Wickermoor Village (chapter 11) and should only be encountered after the character has completed their Incitement Touchpoint but before they follow a quest hook that leads to their Discovery Touchpoint.</p><p><strong>Reward.</strong> In addition to gaining an ally whose attitude becomes friendly, a character who meets their Connection gains the effects of the <em>Bless</em> spell for 24 hours.</p><h3><strong>Discovery</strong></h3><p>The third Narrative Touchpoint involves the character achieving the first key victory of their quest and learning a shocking truth or obtaining hidden knowledge about their Thread of Fate that points them toward the major Confrontation of their arc.</p><p><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This moment of Discovery occurs while the characters explore one of the following locations during chapters 13–17: the Fields of the Crow, the Crimson Monastery, the Drowned Crossroads, Skitterdeep Mine, or Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</p><p><strong>Reward.</strong> A character who uncovers their Discovery gains a Twist of Fate that lasts until it is expended. Once per turn, when a creature the character can see makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, the character can expend one Twist of Fate to replace the d20 roll with a 1 or a 20.</p><h3><strong>Confrontation</strong></h3><p>The fourth Narrative Touchpoint involves confronting a major challenge, threat, or dilemma that was pointed to in the knowledge gained from the Discovery Touchpoint. This allows the character to achieve a victory crucial to their Thread of Fate and to learn of one final objective they must complete in order to finish their personal quest.</p><p><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This momentous Confrontation can occur during chapters 18–22 when the characters face the horrors of Hartsblight Forest, Maidenmist Cemetery, the Roving Rookery, Fool’s Day, or the Crooked Nightmare.</p><p><strong>Reward.</strong> A character who prevails after their Confrontation increases one ability score of their choice by 2. This increase can’t raise a score above 24.</p><h3><strong>Climax</strong></h3><p>The fifth Narrative Touchpoint is the grand finale of the character’s story arc, where they complete the final objective of their Thread of Fate and fully realize the goal they sought to achieve in Druskenvald.</p><p><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This epic Climax occurs during chapter 24, with the character’s ultimate objective intertwined with the defeat of the Horned King and the Crooked Queen.</p><p><em><strong>Reward.</strong></em> In addition to finally accomplishing the goal of their personal quest, a character who resolves their Climax gains a feat of their choice.</p><h3><strong>Catharsis</strong></h3><p>The sixth and final Narrative Touchpoint is the conclusion of the character’s personal story arc, resolving their Thread of Fate and providing the outcome that results from achieving their goal.</p><p><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This final Catharsis occurs at the end of the adventure during the Epilogue.</p><p><strong>Reward.</strong> The emotional Catharsis achieved through the resolution of a character’s story arc.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Edwadia_%20Sister%20Serenade%20Art%20Nouveau%20book%20cover.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" /><h2>Threads of Fate</h2><p>Threads of Fate are thirteen possible personal story arcs that can be woven into the adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>. Each Thread provides a goal for a character to pursue, plot elements to incorporate into their backstory, player choices that personalize the experience, the call of adventure that sets the character on the path to Druskenvald, and six Narrative Touchpoints throughout the adventure that provide a full character arc and rewards for resolving each step.</p><p>For ease of use, each Thread of Fate has thematic and narrative connections to one of the thirteen new backgrounds included in this book (see chapter 4). However, any character can select any Thread regardless of their background. Share these Thread options, their initial story elements, and any starting questions with your players, but keep the details of the Threads’ Narrative Touchpoints (presented in the following pages) a secret. You can also use these as inspiration to create your own Threads of Fate.</p><hr /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.sItP7SvfJmsxzfP7]{Thread of Apocalypse}</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20icons/ICON_Fateweaving_Amnesiac.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" /><p>A character bound by the Thread of Apocalypse has lost their memories and forgotten a large portion of their past.

Which genre of music is it? What are the lyrics about? How does the song relate narratively or thematically to the character? What hints about a past life are in the song?</p><p><strong>Call to Adventure.</strong> The character inadvertently hears the triggering song, which is unknown to them but sounds strangely familiar. They are stricken with a vision of an entire world and the countless souls within being disintegrated and reformed into twisted abominations, followed by the premonition of a ghost train emerging from the fog wherever the adventure begins.</p><p><strong>Associated Background.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.eXiYn1EUZb40Xbbs]{Amnesiac}*</p><h3><strong>Narrative Touchpoints</strong></h3><p><strong>Incitement.</strong> While in the Sleeper Car aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> (area G2), the phonograph suddenly plays a new yet eerily familiar rendition of the prophetic song. This initiates another apocalyptic vision that ends with a scene of a porch with a group of masked nurses surrounding a stranger in a rocking chair, muttering the character’s name.</p><p><strong>Connection.</strong> While visiting the Apothecary Shop (area V6), Morgan is quick to share that they have also lost their memories, finding kinship with the character. They mention that they had received a pamphlet for Memory’s Rest Sanatorium, which claimed that the hospital could help with finding one’s identity, but Morgan never made the trip.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> On the Moon Porch of Memory’s Rest Sanatorium (area L3), a patient sways in a rocking chair with wild eyes, muttering the character’s name. When they see the character, they recognize them and repeatedly say, “The calliope! The hidden moon! The last mistake!” but cannot be shaken from their stupor.</p><p><strong>Confrontation.</strong> While in the Festival Square of the Festival of Fools (area C2), the character is drawn to a strange calliope. They discover a moon-shaped button hidden behind a panel and words etched in their own handwriting: “The Goat Lies.” When pressed, a discordant but familiar version of the song plays, provoking a vision that ends with a large goat’s skull and someone screaming “Sacrifice it!”</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> Following the triumph over the Horned King and the sacrifice to burn the Crooked Tree, the character’s original memories return. Remembering endless variations of the Crooked Queen’s victory, the character realizes that in their past, they unlocked the ability to manipulate time. Through time travel, they worked through several timelines to guide this version of the character to succeed. With this newly remembered power, they have the opportunity to create a new timeline that avoids all the previous deaths.</p><p><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character decides to attempt an even greater victory with less bloodshed, they disappear in a flash of light, and their companions never see them again in the current timeline as they travel through time to prevent as many deaths as possible. If they decide to remain in this timeline, they believe they can use their temporal powers to help those beyond Wickermoor Hollow.</p><hr /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.psCGfrWoVB58MC2y]{Thread of Ascendancy}</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20icons/ICON_Fateweaving_Reveler.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" /><p>A character bound by the Thread of Ascendancy strives to rise to greatness and become an otherworldly monarch. They are guided by the inane ramblings of the spectral head of a fool, imperceivable to anyone else, whose cryptic rhymes contain surprising wisdom and even a prophecy of an ascendant rebirth.</p><p><strong>Goal.</strong> The character must decipher the ramblings of their fool and discover what must be done to ascend beyond mortality and be reborn into a powerful supernatural entity.</p><p><strong>Personalization.</strong> Determine the otherworldly nature of the desired ascension. Does the character wish to become a lord of the heavens, the hells, the Fey lands, or the deathly realms? Did they seek this type of ascension before encountering their fool or was it instigated by the spirit? Why does the character pursue such a transformational rebirth?</p><p><strong>Call to Adventure.</strong> The character is present during or even accidentally causes the beheading of a fool, whose bodiless spirit haunts them. They soon realize there is truth and prescience woven through the specter’s often incoherent ramblings, and a single strange rhyme of fools, monarchs, rebirth, and ascension points to a particular gloomy time and place where the adventure begins.</p><p><strong>Associated Background.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.nhHq0RtlwSi7KbIP]{Reveler}*</p><h3><strong>Narrative Touchpoints</strong></h3><p><strong>Incitement.</strong> In the Circus Car of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> (area G7), a large poster showcasing the Festival of Fools draws the character’s attention. Their spectral fool looks at it wildly and babbles: “In paradise, the angels hang upside down and the fire shoots right side up, but the bells still ring in silver!”</p><p><strong>Connection.</strong> While in the Green Queen Inn (area V1), Innkeeper Alda Farnum can sense the haunting fool and is drawn to the character. She herself seeks to ascend to a great green Fey queen to ensure immense wealth and power for eternity. Throughout the adventure, she can point out sources of interplanar meddling, hoping to hear secrets she can use.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> While in the Watchful Belfry of the Crimson Monastery (area M14), the character’s spectral fool’s head dives into a hellfire brazier and gains a ghostly body before proclaiming: “In paradise, the fools are lords and the lords are fools, but all must die for a dream of kings and queens!”</p><p><strong>Confrontation.</strong> After the death of Chuckles during the Festival of Fools, the character’s fool claims the remnants of the wooden puppet and is reborn into a new otherworldly body. Its new form takes on the visage of the same type of entity that the character seeks to ascend to. It bows before them and exclaims: “In paradise, a herald needs some good shoulders under their head to usher in the monarch, but there can only be one, and goats are for supper!”</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> Following the death of the Horned King and the burning of the Crooked Tree, the character’s fool appears and presents a crown-like jester’s cap made of ash and horn. The fool bellows: “In paradise, a fool for a day is a monarch for all time, but who shall wear the bells and leave their friends behind?” The character must choose to ascend to transcendent power or remain mortal and crown the fool instead.</p><p><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character is crowned, they undergo a transformation into a powerful, otherworldly monarch exactly how they envisioned. As the character ascends to their desired “paradise,” they leave behind their former companions and the fool. If they reject the crown, the fool undergoes this ascension instead, and the character can bring the wisdom from their strange journey to lands beyond Wickermoor Hollow.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Picco_Maxima%20Moon%20Sister%20Antic%20Marionette.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.jSkoau2kD1pXlyNj]{Thread of Deliverance}</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20icons/ICON_Fateweaving_Ghostlight%20Passenger.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" /><p>A character bound by the Thread of Deliverance seeks an inherited family heirloom of great importance and power that was broken apart and lost during a previous trip they took aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>. They follow a soul-powered compass that they hope will lead to the artifact’s pieces and the truth behind its fateful purpose once made whole.</p><p><strong>Goal.</strong> The character must find all three of the pieces of the fractured artifact and restore it to discover its origin, true power, and how to harness it for themselves.</p><p><strong>Personalization.</strong> Determine what type of item the family heirloom is and why it’s special to the character. Who was the family member they inherited it from, and what was their relationship like? Which Druskenvald province was it retrieved from and how did they first find it?</p><p><strong>Call to Adventure.</strong> After the character retrieved the inherited heirloom from Druskenvald, their return trip aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> was interrupted by a hooded, lantern-bearing figure that stole the artifact, split it into three pieces, and ejected the character from the train into the Shroud. The character miraculously survived and emerged somewhere in the mortal realms with a strange, broken compass in their possession. Time has since passed, but one night, the compass glows with ghastly energy, its needle pointing toward wherever the adventure begins.</p><p><strong>Associated Background.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.yXDj2J5izzGu6Xtm]{Ghostlight Passenger}*</p><h3><strong>Narrative Touchpoints</strong></h3><p><strong>Incitement.</strong> While in the Passenger Car of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> (area G1) after the attack of the Phantom Trainhopper, the wisps of the Shroud cause the compass to whirr to life. Its needle points toward the spectral firebox in the Tender (area G8), directly at the name stamped in the metal: Stranger Ferryworks.</p><p><strong>Connection.</strong> While visiting Tolliver’s Trading Post (area V5), Baltus Tolliver shows a keen interest in strange artifacts from across Druskenvald and beyond the Shroud. He knows of another engine in the valley from Stranger Ferryworks, aboard the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> riverboat. Throughout the adventure, he suggests where strange items might be found.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> In the Boiler Room of the Dead Man’s Hand riverboat (area B4), the first piece of the character’s family heirloom can be found tucked behind or beneath the boiler. Retrieving it causes the compass to pulse with soulfire and point toward Maidenmist Cemetery.</p><p><strong>Confrontation.</strong> While in the Shadestone Sanctuary of Maidenmist Cemetery (area Y9), the compass points toward a statue of a hooded figure with a lantern, exactly like the one who attacked the character. The second piece of the artifact is held in its stone grasp. When the character takes the piece, their name suddenly etches itself in the base of the statue, and the compass spins wildly.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> If the characters are victorious over the Crooked Queen in the Wytchwood, the compass vibrates and points into the barrow. Within, entangled in roots, is the final piece of the character’s artifact. When all three pieces are assembled, a fog rolls in and the hooded figure emerges, revealing themselves as the relative who left them the artifact. They have become a Stranger (see chapter 1) and offer the character the same opportunity.</p><p><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character accepts the offer, they become a ferryman of dead souls, and the artifact becomes the primary instrument of calling their vehicle or warding against the Shroud. They leave into the mist with their family member to continue their duty. If they do not accept, the character can use their artifact to help lost souls outside of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><hr /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.ok2mzY0o9A4PP619]{Thread of Duality}</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20icons/ICON_Fateweaving_Reflected%20Wanderer.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" /><p>A character bound by the Thread of Duality has a soul that they severed in two in the hopes of expunging their mortal sins, vices, and flaws. A near-exact duplicate born of sin itself commits increasingly wicked acts under the guise of the character, working toward a nefarious goal that only the character can stop as they communicate with their doppelganger through mirrors and other reflections.</p><p><strong>Goal.</strong> The character must track down their sinful duplicate, uncover the nature of the copy’s wicked plot, and find a way to mend their severed soul to bring an end to their counterpart’s vile and catastrophic machinations.</p><p><strong>Personalization.</strong> Determine how the duplicate both mirrors and differs from the character in appearance and behavior.

How does the character now behave differently?</p><p><strong>Call to Adventure. T</strong>he character receives news of or discovers heinous acts allegedly committed by them. Following the trail of sin, they eventually see a reflection of themselves, but something is off, and the eyes are full of menace.

Behind them lies a field of butchered corpses. The doppelganger states that, as a being born of sin, they can consume sin itself to grow stronger, and Druskenvald is filled with it. They claim murder alone is insufficient; sin must also include vices and base pleasures. The reflection then returns to normal.</p><p><strong>Connection.</strong> Near Wickermoor Schoolhouse (area V8), Finneas Trout approaches the character, noting their resemblance to a stranger who passed through weeks before a string of grisly murders, after which they headed northeast. Fascinated by the character and their double, Finneas, who studied “The Grey” curse of his home province of Edwardia (see chapter 1), offers insights on instances of duality throughout the adventure.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> In the Gambling Hall of the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> (area B3), the riverboat’s tall windows reflect the character’s doppelganger, who is surrounded by mountains of gold, food, drink, game pieces, and other tokens of indulgence. The copy claims to be nearly ready to become a god of sin and mocks the character’s ignorance of souls. They flash a grin of razor-sharp teeth before vanishing.</p><p><strong>Confrontation.</strong> After arriving at the Great Sepulcher in Maidenmist Cemetery (area Y2), Yorgrim sees the severed soul and explains that the character must reunite both souls to stop the doppelganger’s actions. He shares that, just like his Fallen friends, every soul must be accepted with both the good and bad. The process of reigniting the Balefire Beacons grants the character a sufficient understanding of soul magic to defy their copy and rejoin the souls.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> After destroying the Horned King and burning the Crooked Tree, the duplicate emerges from the tree line, visible to all for the first time, with a maw of crooked sharp teeth. The copy sucks in the black ash from the Horned King’s remains, turns into smoke, and declares that sin never ends and that the Horned King will return one day more devastating than before. This presents an opportunity for the character to fuse the souls together or let the duplicate go.</p><p><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character fuses the souls, all the wickedness and sin that was purged returns through tendrils of smoke. While the character retains control, they are never the same. If the character rejects the use of soul magic, the doppelganger laughs and dissipates. In twenty years, a new Horned King will return to Druskenvald. Until then, the character can bring their virtue and positive traits to help the lands beyond Wickermoor Hollow.</p><hr /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.sIN94qlGh8qBsSYN]{Thread of Evolution}</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20icons/ICON_Fateweaving_Experiment.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" /><p>A character bound by the Thread of Evolution believes themself to be the next stage of evolution for mortal species, having undergone a transformational experiment to become closer to “perfection.” However, they are still not satisfied and follow the notes of a renowned researcher to transcend the limitations of natural biology.</p><p><strong>Goal.</strong> The character must unlock the potential of the experiments conducted on them, discover how to blend science and magic to achieve the final stage of evolution, and become the ultimate lifeform.</p><p><strong>Personalization.</strong> Determine the nature of the experiments conducted on the character.

Among several empty medicine vials, a few crumpled notes reveal they were losing a battle with an ailment after the “enemies of progress” destroyed their lab. The only option left was to seek experimental medicine at an “unorthodox hospital.”</p><p><strong>Connection.</strong> While visiting A Stitch in Time (area V18), Thomasin Ardor is drawn to the character, recognizing the results of the experiments done to them. Having gained similar results from the procedure that saved her life as a child, her curiosity of how new and advanced techniques and materials can be used to improve quality of life is unbound. Throughout the adventure, she never misses an opportunity to point out any such developments.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> In the Crematorium of Memory’s Rest Sanatorium (area L18), the character finds the ashes and last effects of the researcher. Their notes reveal that combining magic and science showed great promise, but the critical missing ingredient is a powerful inorganic material to replace the “weakness of flesh.” Although they knew death was imminent, they were overjoyed to have deduced this missing material: stardust from a fallen star.</p><p><strong>Confrontation.</strong> At the Smoking Crater in the Crooked Nightmare (area N4), the character realizes their medically altered nature allows them to deconstruct the meteor with the union of magic and science. They can replace biological parts with this stardust, which can be greatly duplicated. However, to grant this evolution to others, the lingering crooked corruption over Wickermoor Hollow must be eliminated.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> After Kehlenn’s banishment following the burning of the Crooked Tree, the haze of corruption is removed, and the character gains full control of their discovered evolution. They can replace the organic bodies of anyone who wishes to escape the weakness of flesh by fully evolving themselves and becoming entirely made of stardust. To retain any original biology would be to not claim full mastery of the stardust and interrupt their personal evolution.</p><p><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character fully evolves into a being of inorganic matter, the stardust spreads across Wickermoor Hollow, enabling the sick and dissatisfied to abandon their humanity to join the character’s evolution. If the character rejects the final stage of evolution, they can make a difference on a smaller, targeted scale in places beyond Wickermoor Hollow.</p><hr /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.PMWLA9rJem82lQgg]{Thread of Immortality}</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20icons/ICON_Fateweaving_Crimson%20Aspirant.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" /><p>A character bound by the Thread of Immortality seeks a remedy for an incurable, magical disease through the lost arts of blood, vital energy, and the soul-stuff of anima.

It guides the character to a crypt that holds its former apprentice, who had prepared for the creation of the grand remedy by being buried alongside pure gold, celestial water, quicksilver, rare herbs, and other reagents to be infused into it. The final step requires a massive transmutation circle at a place of power.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> Once the Crooked Queen is defeated, the oddity emerges from the flask and creates a transmutation circle where Kehlenn’s primal magic ring had been.

The final etching references being covered by centipedes in the deep.</p><p><strong>Connection.</strong> While visiting Roderick Masonry (area V12), the character is drawn to strange statues behind the counter that match descriptions in the dream journal. Solomon Roderick reveals he’s had nightmares of a Crooked Man since childhood, and his account is similar to what the character’s family member experienced. Throughout the adventure, he can help guide the character toward the operations of the servants of the Crooked Man and the Vermintoll Coven.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> While in Stonoga’s Laboratory within Skitterdeep Mine (area S7) after the death of Stonoga Blackstinger, the character finds a cage with more effects belonging to their family member. Among them is a log revealing the relative was kept there and experimented on, with notes stating they are an “ideal vessel” and are “prime for crookedness.” It mentions preparations are underway for the “final nightmare.”</p><p><strong>Confrontation.</strong> While in the Dark Wood of the Crooked Nightmare (area N2), the character hears their family member crying out in the darkness. Drawn to the voice, the character finds them wandering the woods with a crooked neck and crooked gait. Terrified, the family member says they are being prepared for something at a crooked tree. Suddenly, they shriek and are dragged off into the darkness.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> After the Crooked Queen is vanquished, the character’s family member screams from the barrow below, trapped where Kehlenn’s bones once were. The family member sobs that their blood has marked them as a replacement for the Crooked Man and that they must work to restore Kehlenn. The character can only save them by taking their place as the successor of the Crooked Man themselves. However, because they were not warped by the coven, they retain their morality and free will.</p><p><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character offers to take their family member’s place, they change places in the roots, are fully consumed, and transform into a powerful crooked spirit bound to Druskenvald. The family member returns home with any other surviving characters. If the character allows their family member to be consumed, they witness the transformation and they know they must work against this new spirit outside of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><hr /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.KNmsLbPSpc0Rj6RN]{Thread of Liberation}</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20icons/ICON_Fateweaving_Crossroads%20Gambler.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" /><p>A character bound by the Thread of Liberation has made a deal with a powerful entity that now owns their soul, and what awaits them in death is not pretty.

Her commitment to her children has prevented her own trip there.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> In the Gambling Hall of the <em>Dead Man’s Hand </em>(area B3), the character is drawn to a special table that offers a prize of a uniquely hexed set of cards that can be played with otherworldly beings. When they play, their shadow may cheat in the game so that the character wins. The dealer tells them the best lucky charm is to find a “Wild Joker” and add it to the deck.</p><p><strong>Confrontation.</strong> While at the Prize Counter during the Festival of Fools (area C3), the character sees a gleaming joker card that costs “infinity tickets.” Their shadow may steal the card, and when it is placed in the deck, the Wild Joker speaks. It exclaims how the deck is now lucky and the character cannot lose, but the wager better be a huge one, like the rulership of an entire realm of death.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> After the encounter with the Horned King, the death of Phillip has left a vacancy for lordship of Druskenvald. The shadow draws the Wild Joker from the lucky deck and gestures that it can be used to kill the owner of the character’s soul. When the character announces a challenge and wagers the lordship of Druskenvald, the entity appears for a card game. The character can win their freedom using the rigged deck or take revenge by destroying the being.</p><p><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character pierces the entity with the Wild Joker, whether thrown or stabbed, the being is destroyed and the character’s soul is free. If they play and win the game, the entity honors the deal, dissolves the bargain, and frees their soul, allowing them to pursue other gambles outside Wickermoor Hollow. Either way, the shadow transforms into a person.

It tells of a curse that matches theirs and illustrates parts of an incantation, though there are many blank pages. A note is scribbled in the margin that mentions secrets collected by demons and includes symbols of eyes and wings.</p><p><strong>Connection.</strong> While visiting the Antique Bookstore (area V23), Eleanor Heyling senses the character’s inquisitive nature and confides her interest in strange, occult, and forbidden knowledge, especially in the eyes of the Old Ways. She offers to help research for the character, and throughout the adventure, she can offer locations where hidden knowledge might be found.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> While navigating the Fields of the Crow (see chapter 13), the eyes between the stalks watch the character intently and whispers call them over, telling them that the knowledge they seek exists only beyond the stars. Some of the tome’s empty pages fill with demonic script, continuing the incantation.

Their tome fills with the remaining incantation, detailing how the final step requires that character to breathe the “Ashes of a God” before reciting it.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> Once the Crooked Queen is defeated and the Crooked Tree is burned, the character inhales the ashes and surges with eldritch power. By reciting the full incantation from the tome, their curse is broken, and unlocked cosmic power allows them the chance to seek more knowledge beyond this reality. They have a moment to decide if they will leave this dimension behind.</p><p><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character decides to travel beyond the stars, they blink away in a burst of stardust and spend millennia navigating strange new cosmic worlds, gaining knowledge unthinkable to mortal minds.

The loci of corruption must be cleansed to allow for the countless crooked souls to find rest.</p><p><strong>Connection.</strong> After the events of the Crooked House, but before Fields of the Crow (chapter 13), Mori Shade approaches them, sensing their connection to spirits. She shares her sacred charge of the dead bodies and spirits, and she is curious about the character’s practices for performing rites. Throughout the adventure, she brings attention to areas of corrupted and tormented souls.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> Following the defeat of Raum and the banishing of the Fields of the Crow from the farmland around Foxwillow (see chapter 13), the souls corrupted by the demonic influence still linger in the fields. The character must erect their first monument to cleanse the demonic spirits. The following augury shows signs of a tide of shrieking souls erupting from a crumbling ruin.</p><p><strong>Confrontation.</strong> After defeating the Vermintoll Abomination in the Crooked Nightmare, the surge of shrieking souls that erupts from the ruins of the Crooked House beg for peace from the character. To cleanse the spirits, they must erect the second spiritual monument on the site of the Crooked House. The subsequent augury shows the true source of that site’s corruption: a gnarled and twisted tree in the darkest forest.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> Once the Crooked Queen is bested, the character can feel the torment of countless souls across Wickermoor Hollow that have been twisted by Kehlenn. The third monument must be erected to initiate the final cleansing. The connection of the three monuments is so strong that the character gains the option to rebirth every soul and give them another chance at life.</p><p><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character decides to initiate this rebirth, countless once-human souls across Wickermoor Hollow are born again into a variety of the thirteen reborn species of Druskenvald.

The character’s deity confirms this is the next step.</p><p><strong>Connection.</strong> While traveling near the Abandoned Church in Wickermoor Village (area V19), Weston Murdoch approaches the character, recognizing them as a missionary. While he encourages them to worship the Brightsinger, he simply appreciates “new godliness” coming to Wickermoor Hollow. Throughout the adventure, he can direct the character to worshipers of a variety of faiths.</p><p><strong>Discovery.</strong> After the defeat of the Crimson Abbot at the Crimson Monastery (see chapter 14), many followers of the Crimson Faith become disenfranchised or emboldened to escape the faith. Many approach the character and quickly convert to their deity. They agree to spread word of the new faith throughout the valley. This grants more power to the character’s deity, who tells them that the Shroud repels the divine, and this barrier must be addressed.</p><p><strong>Confrontation.</strong> Following the defeat on the Chained Reaper in the Tomb of the Shrouded of Maidenmist Cemetery (area Y15), the character feels a connection to their deity, who commands them to sanctify this original source of the Shroud in the valley to allow their god to pierce through. Following a blessing by the character, their god tells them that a complete antithesis to godliness stalks the realm and must be destroyed.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> Following the destruction of the Horned King and the burning of the Crooked Tree, their deity confirms that the primary enemy of the gods has been destroyed and, with the character’s invocation, the divine intervention will begin.

Use the information below to guide the conversation with the Vagrant:</p><ul><li><p>The shadowy stowaway they just fought let the misty Shroud into the train, which corrupts spirits.</p></li><li><p>There are six haints aboard who are more prone to corruption, which is dangerous, as they are the base source of the ghost train’s fuel.</p></li><li><p>The haints must be released from the train before they can be corrupted, either by resolving the unfinished business from life that fetters them or by destroying them if necessary (see “Unfettering a Haint” above).</p></li><li><p>Once the haints are released one way or the other, the characters should check the Tender (area G8) for any corruption, as it contains the train’s fuel stores.</p></li><li><p>The Vagrant must stay in his cab to keep any lingering Shroud mist from the locomotive.</p></li><li><p>The Vagrant asks the characters not to alarm Phillip and Adela Druskenvald if they run into them. “Ain’t no call to rile up the Lord and Lady over a scuffle.”</p></li></ul><p>With one final crackle, the Vagrant’s voice fades from the Passenger Car, and the characters can’t interact with him again until later (see “Off the Spectral Rails” later in the chapter). The characters can begin their journey through the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Lingering Curse.</strong></em> After the battle, characters who succeed on a [[/check PRC DC 13]] check notice wisps of ghastly blue-green mist shot through with black root-like veins lingering in the air—remnants of the clouds that billowed in. The mist slowly snakes forward and slinks under the forward vestibule door. It can’t be dispersed or affected in any way, and they lose sight of it once it slips away. This is the lingering curse of the Phantom Trainhopper that aims to reach the Tender (see area G8) to corrupt the fuel of the Ghostlight Locomotive.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/10-1_Passenger_Car.webp\" alt=\"\" /></div>"

The solemn notes of a lone fiddle followed by the bellowing sound of a train whistle means you possess a one-way ticket into the unknown. Those sounds herald the arrival of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>. It only stills and quiets for a transient moment before it lurches forward once more into its eternal voyage between life and death, so hop aboard.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> is more than a mere vessel. It is a living, breathing entity offering its departed passengers their final journey to life after death. For many, this trip is their last fleeting taste of civilization before being plunged into the terror of what waits beyond the reach of both the hallowed and profane.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is the introductory adventure to <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign, but it can also be played as a standalone one-shot. The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> can materialize anywhere it is required, always at night, and most frequently near graveyards or standing stones. The chapter’s thrilling conclusion can occur in any forest where the train crashes and transforms, leaving the characters stranded in isolation.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> thunders her call, ferrying wayward souls through the Shroud of death to the life that waits beyond. But among the spectral passengers bound for Druskenvald and restless spirits trapped aboard the ghost train is a crooked shade that plots to derail this fateful journey.</p><p class=\"p7\">Characters who find themselves aboard the ghost train through the Quest Hooks might initially only want to reach their destination, but they may soon have additional goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Free the haints—lost souls trapped on the train—by resolving their unfinished business, trapping them in a Soul Can, or destroying them.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Meet Phillip and Adela Druskenvald and possibly have their fortunes told.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Pursue the Phantom Trainhopper to the Tender.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Survive the battle with the corrupted Ghostlight Locomotive.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the key NPCs, locations, and concepts featured in this chapter and chapters 1 and 8 so you can deliver strong story moments and establish critical worldbuilding. A casual readthrough of each area of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> will help you improvise interactions. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “When It’s Time,” ensures a terrifying and tone-setting final encounter.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four 1st level characters. By the end of the chapter, the characters will have advanced to 3rd level. At your discretion, characters may also begin the adventure at 2nd or 3rd level. If the characters begin this adventure at a higher level (see “Quest Hooks” below), a few modifications are included in certain areas of this chapter.</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap00 middle-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Ghostlight Locomotive</p><p class=\"p5\">The Ghostlight Locomotive is an old black train engine that rides rails made of mist and pulls the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>. This ghost train has but one primary purpose: to ferry the souls of the dead to Druskenvald so that they might be reborn for a second chance at life. On rare occasions, it grants passage to living beings who wish to pass between the realms of life and death.</p><p class=\"p7\">To make this run, the train must travel through the Shroud, a shrieking eldritch fog that envelops numerous afterlives and realms of death. The passage is always dangerous due to the devouring nature of the ghastly mist that can obliterate any soul, living or dead.</p><h2>Ghosts in the Machine</h2><p class=\"p5\">To keep itself running, the train burns souls for fuel. Though this may seem a terrible truth, a balance is struck between the spirits that are ferried and those that are consumed. Souls unfortunate enough to become fodder in the ghost train’s firebox were once Wayward Haints—restless spirits that cannot rest or pass on due to unresolved affairs in life—but have deteriorated into soul coal (see “Haints” below) after spending years trapped on the train. This heavy toll ensures the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> can continue to serve its purpose as ferry for the dead, granting them safe passage from the enveloping annihilation of the Shroud.</p><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:6px;bottom:6px;left:6px;right:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:relative;z-index:3\"><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><p><strong>GM Tip</strong></p><p class=\"p11\">As you progress through this chapter, let the tension build slowly. Characters may be meeting each other for the first time. The modular encounters in each train car should not only challenge characters but also gradually build unease before the conclusion in the woods.</p><p class=\"p12\">If you are running the full Crooked Moon adventure, read through each adventure chapter at least once so you feel comfortable with any potential outcomes before you begin. Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are involved in multiple chapters; this is the characters’ first opportunity to learn about them and make their own first impressions. Their interactions will shape the characters’ relationships and decisions in future events.</p><p class=\"p13\">If you are running this chapter as a standalone one-shot, then you might allow the characters to rejoin the Vagrant on the train to head toward their next adventure, wherever that may be. You can also ignore the Fateweaving guidance that ties characters to the overarching campaign of The Crooked Moon.</p></aside></div></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap10 middle-page\"><p class=\"h1 section horned\">NPCs of the Ghostlight Express</p><p>In addition to the NPCs listed below, the train teems with the insubstantial souls of the departed. Some are on a path to rebirth in Druskenvald, while others are Wayward Haints (see “Haints” below) trapped aboard by their unresolved past lives.</p><h2>Phillip and Adela Druskenvald</h2><p>Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are going home. They ride the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> back to Druskenvald, the domain of death they rule together as husband and wife. Even at first glance, it is plain to see the loving bond between the pair.</p><p>Phillip is a man of vision who believes that keeping a forward-thinking attitude will solve any problem, championing “modern” ideals and striving for “progress.” Dapper, charming, and overconfident, the lord of Druskenvald is well-liked by the land’s people despite his general aloofness to their present struggles. He is a tall, thin man with dark, slicked-back hair and a pencil-thin mustache. He carries an ornate black cane topped with a silver goat skull.</p><p>Adela is outgoing, enthusiastic, and caring, always looking at the spiritual side of every situation. She does not need to look far, however, for even in a world filled with magic, she possesses a tether to the spirit world and formidable powers of divination that let her peer into the future with second sight. She is supremely supportive of her husband and believes her positivity helps him appreciate the amazing world he has fashioned for them. She is short and petite with wavy brown hair, almost always wearing a glamorous dress accented by a glittering necklace with a planchette hanging from its chain.</p><p>When the characters first encounter Phillip and Adela (see area G3), they greet the newcomers with warmth and curiosity. They may be willing to share details about the realm of Druskenvald and themselves (see chapter 1), but they frequently turn the questions back on the characters in genuine interest.</p><p>The Druskenvalds have one overarching goal: make both life and death a grand old time. Life here in the afterlife is sweet, and they do what they can to make sure it stays that way. While many afterlives strip away much of what it means to be mortal, Druskenvald does the opposite. Phillip especially finds beauty in the messy, imperfect, and oftentimes sinful nature of mortal folk and strives to maintain that in the realm he rules.</p><p>It is left to your discretion what business Phillip and Adela were attending to in the mortal realms—and if they are even willing to share. Regardless, by the time they appear in this story, the experience is happily behind them. With nothing but time to kill on the train, their recent past has melted away, and they welcome any distraction that might cheer the final stretch toward their destination: their sprawling manor home called Chateau Clair de Lune.</p><p>Use this opportunity to create a connection with Phillip and Adela, since these two NPCs will interact with the characters throughout <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_The_Vagrant.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><h2>The Vagrant</h2><p>The Vagrant, an amiable frogman with mottled green skin, serves as a “Stranger” (see chapter 1) who ferries the souls of the dead to the “other side.” The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> is his chosen vessel for this sacred responsibility, and he serves as the ghost train’s conductor and engineer. He wears the tattered garb of a vagabond, complete with a wide-brimmed hat where he always keeps three railroad spikes.</p><p>Bound by his eternal duty, the Vagrant offers safe passage to the souls of the dead who will be reborn in the realm of Druskenvald. A consummate storyteller, he believes each passenger that boards the ghost train has a tale to tell, which he is happy to do in the form of a song aided by his well-worn fiddle.</p><p>The Vagrant has a strange kinship with the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> as its sole caretaker. Through the eons, the few who have come to know this ferryman have wondered if the Vagrant himself is bound to the train just as much as the haints who cannot disembark. But none ever learned the truth of the frogman’s origins, and his story remains a mystery.</p><h3><strong>Story and a Song</strong></h3><p>Meeting the Vagrant is an otherworldly experience, heralded by the sound of his fiddle preceding the arrival of the train. The Vagrant has a fondness for all the souls he guides, so when the shock of his sudden appearance subsides, the dead and the living alike find themselves facing a cordial, smiling frogman ready with a story, a song, and a wink.</p><p>Though he may seem lighthearted and carefree, he holds his role as ferryman with immense gravity. The locomotive that pulls the cars of the ghost train cannot speak for itself, so the Vagrant speaks on its behalf. When conversing with the characters, he always maintains his friendly disposition, no matter the question or topic. Some things he might say include:</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong> “Well now, you can call me the Vagrant. Just a humble ferryman, guidin’ souls to the other side.”</p><p><strong>What is the Ghostlight Locomotive?</strong> “Ah, the heart of the train, it is. It’s no mere engine—no, it’s got a will of its own, you see. And only it can get us where we’re headed.”</p><p><strong>Where are we going?</strong> “Druskenvald, o’course! Or the lord and lady’s chateau to be specific. That’s where this line ends, for now. But the tracks . . . they ain’t always the same.”</p><p><strong>What are these spirits?</strong> “Passengers just like you, plain and simple.”</p><p><strong>What happens if we stop the train?</strong> “Heh, stoppin’ it? Well, that’d be stoppin’ fate itself. No more ticket holders from here ‘til the chateau. Ain’t no peace in derailing destiny—best you stay aboard.”</p><h2>Haints</h2><p>Haints are tethered apparitions, their lanky, ethereal forms shimmering a ghastly blue-green and floating slightly off the surface of the train car floors. Their clothes are worn and tattered, billowing as if caught in a perpetual breeze. Some haints repeat actions and phrases from their past lives, trapped in a loop of obsessive memories, while others might repeatedly relive moments of joy, sorrow, or fear.</p><p>A <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.rFMEL5osbYoxsJEZ]{Wayward Haint}</strong>* is a spirit trapped between the worlds of the living and the dead. They are not free souls, usually due to some lingering guilt or an unresolved connection to the mortal world. Not all haints are inherently wicked, but their lack of freedom to cross over into their next form of existence takes a toll on their psyche and disposition. As haints, they are tethered to the train forever until their burden is lifted or they deteriorate into soul coal and become fuel for the train.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_The_Phantom_Trainhopper.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><h3><strong>Bound Spirits</strong></h3><p>Haints that remain bound to the train become its minions if they have not been freed prior to its transformation into the corrupted Ghostlight Locomotive.</p><h3><strong>Vacant Vessels</strong></h3><p>Haints fear empty bottles and jars, which can be found in the Passenger Car (area G1) or Lounge Car (area G3), because they can be trapped inside of them with the proper technique. A character who contemplates the haints and succeeds on a [[/check HIS DC 16]] or [[/check REL DC 16]] check recalls the Bottle Trap trait in the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.rFMEL5osbYoxsJEZ]{Wayward Haint}</strong>* stat block. Bottles containing a haint count as Soul Cans (see “When It's Time” later in this adventure).</p><h2>Phantom Trainhopper</h2><p>There is one soul aboard the train who doesn’t have a ticket to ride: the Phantom Trainhopper (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.QGcQYZbVl4bWzi4E]{Shadow}</strong>). In life, they were a member of a secret cult in the living world that worships Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen. Tonight, they were ritually sacrificed so their spirit could sneak aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> on this rare evening that Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are passengers.</p><p>Granted exceptional power in death by Kehlenn’s chief minion, the Crooked Man, this malevolent shade carries a curse aboard to corrupt the spirits that the Ghostlight Locomotive uses for fuel. With help from the devouring Shroud, the Phantom Trainhopper turns the ghost train against the Vagrant and strands the Druskenvalds—and coincidentally, the characters—in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>Once the shade releases Kehlenn’s curse, it’s just a matter of time before that curse reaches the Tender (area G8), and, ultimately, the locomotive. Unwittingly, the characters likely play an integral part in bringing about The Crooked Queen’s goal by unsealing the final door and letting the curse in.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter8_Tarot_Reading.webp\" alt=\"\" /></div>"

They may be picked up together or individually, but if you are running this chapter as a standalone adventure, the characters should board as a group.</p><p>While the ghost train may itself provide enough interest for some to board on sight, others may desire some goal or justification to accept the Vagrant’s invitation. For a full-length campaign, talk with your players to establish the circumstances that lead their character to embark when the train arrives, even if begrudgingly.</p><p>You may choose whichever Quest Hook you feel will most enthrall the players. Here are a few examples:</p><p><strong>Fate.</strong> The characters have an exclusive invitation to ride the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, a rare and mysterious opportunity, because it is their destiny. Each character, unbeknownst to them, has a ticket in their pocket, and each has their own rationale for boarding the train.</p><p>Adela Druskenvald foresaw the characters’ arrival through her tarot cards and believes the travelers are here to aid them on their trip, though she cannot see why. The Vagrant may make knowing cryptic remarks but refuses to elaborate. If asked, circular logic abounds. The Vagrant is here to pick up the travelers because they have tickets, and they have tickets because Druskenvald is their destination.</p><p><strong>Death.</strong> The characters have died. They may have died all together, or they might have died at different times in different places. When the events of the adventure kick off, the Vagrant makes the rare decision to instantly reincarnate the characters into their new living bodies, which likely take the form of the reborn species of Druskenvald (see chapter 2). Alternatively, they can be reborn in their previous body or as a different species not native to Druskenvald. Either way, they find themselves standing together on the platform of a ghostly train station awaiting what comes next.</p><p>This unique hook can follow an existing campaign in which all the characters died, but the players want to continue with a new version of their existing characters. If the characters in this scenario are higher than 3rd level, you should adjust the difficulty of this chapter and the future events of the campaign, or alternatively, you and your players should agree that the experience of dying reduces all characters back to 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p><strong>Homeward Bound.</strong> The characters are originally from Druskenvald, but through strange circumstances they spilled out of the Shroud into the mortal realms. All they want is to get back to where they came from, and have finally found a location they believe the <em>Ghostlight Express </em>will be arriving so they can go home at last.</p></div>"

The frogman greets them amiably, introducing himself and the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>.</p><p class=\"p7\">A character who succeeds on a [[/check PRC DC 13]] check feels the unfamiliar ticket in their pocket or on their person. Otherwise, the Vagrant selects the character he feels is most likely to board the train and points out that they already have the ticket to ride. Once a character has found their ticket, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>A paper railway ticket trembles faintly in your grasp.

The Vagrant extends his hand and gestures to pass him the ticket.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p21\"><em><strong>“Best hurry now,” he says with a wink, “train won’t wait forever.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Ghostlight Express Features</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Unless otherwise stated, the train car areas of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> have the following general features:</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Ceilings. </strong>All cars have 9-foot-tall ceilings and are encased by steel support beams.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Lighting.</strong> Flickering brass lamps illuminate each train car, shedding bright light throughout.</p><p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Doors.</strong> Each car of the train has two interior vestibule doors, one at the front and one at the back, with two exceptions: the Passenger Car (area G1) has an additional boarding door on its right side, and its rear door is an exterior door that leads out the back of the train. Both are sealed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{Arcane Lock}</em> spells the Vagrant can bypass. The Tender (area G8) has no door at its front.</span></p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Spectral Passengers. </strong>Ghostly forms of passengers appear and fade away randomly throughout the train cars. They are moving on to the afterlife, avoiding the fate of becoming a haint. While they seem to sometimes watch the characters, they don’t respond to any attempted interaction.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Windows.</strong> The train’s windows don’t open and have AC 18, 30 hit points, and a damage threshold of 15. If a window is broken, the Shroud floods the car and affects spirit passengers as described in “The Shroud Beyond” below.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Shroud Beyond</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">In the unlikely scenario where the interior of the train is exposed to the Shroud, roll initiative! For each round the door, window, or breach remains open, the billowing mist of the Shroud devours a spirit passenger and turns them into a hateful <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.cwvrnt9tD9YI4vQX]{Specter}</strong>. These creatures are bloodthirsty and attack the characters until destroyed.</p><p class=\"p7\">[[/r 1d4]] rounds after the breach occurs, the Vagrant lets out a shrill whistle on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties). The breached door or window closes or reforms, and no more passengers are corrupted.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Haints on the Haunt</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">While most of the passengers are here to cross over into Druskenvald and be reborn, some are burdened by unresolved grievances from their past lives and are instead tethered to the train until they can let go of their attachment (see “Haints” above).</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Unfettering a Haint</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.rFMEL5osbYoxsJEZ]{Wayward Haints}</strong><span class=\"s12\">*</span> can’t leave the train car they are found within. Each of the bound spirits has a story to tell, though they may only remember vague details. To progress the adventure, the characters must free the haints from the train, which can be accomplished with two general methods.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Destruction.</strong> Destroying a haint breaks its bond to the train, though it leaves an echo of pain behind that comes back to haunt the characters later (see area G8).</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Resolution.</strong> Alternatively, the characters can help the haints resolve their unprocessed emotions toward their unfinished business. A haint’s binding is resolved either by helping it reach an understanding of its emotional bindings (see “Helping a Haint” below) or by bringing it the token that completes the missing piece of that understanding, as described in each haint’s entry in the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> locations. When a haint moves on and is freed from the train, each character regains [[/damage 1d6 healing]]{1d6 hit points}, gaining any excess beyond their hit point maximum as temporary hit points.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Helping a Haint.</strong></em> Bringing a haint their lost token is the safest way to achieve resolution, but there is a riskier alternative. A character can interact with a haint in some way and make an ability check, trying to help it come to terms with its unfinished business. Each haint has a list of suggested “resolution proficiencies” that have the best chance of helping it reach resolution. Ability checks using these skills are against DC 12. Other checks can work at your discretion, but these checks are against DC 15 unless you feel the justification is especially fitting.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\">Each time a check using a given skill or tool proficiency is successful, the DC of further uses of that proficiency to help the same haint increases by 2. Characters are better served by applying a variety of approaches.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s13\">Each successful ability check helps the haint reach a resolution, and after three successes, the haint is freed. However, with each failure, the haint grows more impatient and agitated. After three failures, it loses itself to rage and despair, becomes hostile, and attacks the characters. At that point, they have no choice but to destroy it.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Switcheroo!</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The first time the characters pass through the interior vestibule door at the front of a car, it leads to a random train car they have not yet visited. When this happens, characters who pass through the vestibule doors vanish through a portal of swirling mist and wait in limbo.

The ghostly fuel is burned up within the firebox, providing the spectral power needed to run the locomotive.

Deep parallel grooves can be plainly seen cutting through the soft earth, suggesting the turbulent path through the trees taken by the Ghostlight Locomotive.</p><p>The engine itself finally came to rest at the edge of a small clearing within the forest. Upon approach, it becomes obvious that after the crash, twisted roots have perplexingly snaked and snarled their way through its train wheels, locking them into place.</p><h3><strong>Back on Track</strong></h3><p>The calm, genial demeanor of the Vagrant has been replaced with rising panic. Though he is clearly doing his best to keep his wits about him on behalf of those he is charged to guide safely, this is clearly not a situation the Vagrant has had to deal with often. He knows that only a powerful malevolent force could interfere with the Ghostlight Locomotive’s transit.</p><p>When everyone is outside and the Vagrant has had a moment to survey the damage, he beseeches the characters for their assistance. He does not engage Phillip immediately out of respect. The Vagrant explains his three goals:</p><ul><li><p>If the locomotive can be freed from the roots that are entangling its wheels, it would be able to reassemble the full <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, train cars and all.</p></li><li><p>The furnace is no longer burning.

If the characters have any bottles that contain a haint (see “Haints” above), they can be used as Soul Cans.</p><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><h3><strong>What if the characters refuse to help or leave?</strong></h3><p>If the characters refuse to even attempt to find the spectral fuel, Phillip and Adela will seek them out instead. If the characters decide to abandon the train, Phillip, Adela, and the Vagrant opt to stay behind. The characters will then be confronted by the freed Ghostlight Locomotive after 15 minutes of overland travel, forcing them to confront the monstrous Construct. Should they survive, the Vagrant and the Druskenvalds soon find them, confused and displeased.</p></aside><h3><strong>A Chance for Valor!</strong></h3><p>Phillip and Adela were unscathed by the crash and join the characters. Once Phillip understands the nature of the problem, he springs into action. Raising his elegant cane, he first attempts to magically free the Ghostlight Locomotive from the ensnaring roots. He fails, exclaiming “Maybe that little tumble temporarily knocked out my lordly powers! No worries, I’ll roll up my sleeves and help however I can!” A successful [[/check INS DC 13]] check reveals that he is telling the truth. All attempts by Phillip, the Vagrant, or the characters to unloose the train from these roots also fail.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_GHOST_A_chance_for_valor_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /></div>"

To outsiders, it promises solace and a retreat from life’s troubles. But behind its iron doors lurks a nightmare. Beneath the polished facade and soft-spoken promises, Matron Lethica pursues her sinister ambition: the Lethic Serum. The concoction claims to cure all ailments—but at a terrible cost. Those who undergo its treatment lose more than their pain; their bodies mutate, their memories fade, and they become hollow vessels for Lethica’s cruel vision of salvation.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Memory’s Rest Sanatorium rises from the mists of Moonsong Lake, a sanctuary for those seeking relief from their troubles. Its founder, Matron Lethica, has transformed the Isle of Mourn into a place of healing—or so its reputation would suggest. In truth, the sanatorium’s wards are filled with pained silence and the anguished cries of those seduced by this mask.</p><p class=\"p7\">To perfect her serum, Lethica and her staff—the corrupted nurses, surgeons, and horrors born of her failures—have turned the sanatorium into a prison. Patients vanish often. Those who do not return have succumbed to the mutagenic effects of the Lethic Serum and have transformed into abominations in the image of the true source of the serum.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\">An eldritch horror known as the White Worm has been imprisoned by the matron in the caverns beneath the sanatorium. This otherworldly being’s ichor serves as the base of the Lethic Serum, and its alien mind gives endless inspiration for Lethica’s abominable experiments, treatments, and goal of twisting the bodies and minds of everyone. Only through the death of the widow can the people be spared this sickening evolution.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Memory’s Rest Sanatorium is a place of suffering, alchemy, and unspeakable transformation. The characters are tasked with uncovering its secrets and ending Lethica’s sinister dreams. To prevail, they must navigate the halls of the sanatorium, confront its many horrors, and face the Weeping Widow herself. Characters drawn to the sanatorium by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Learn what is happening to patients in Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Create an antidote to the Lethic Serum</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Find Lethica’s secret Laboratory (area L27) and the cavern below.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Slay Matron Lethica, the Weeping Widow.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, study its most important NPC, the Weeping Widow, to understand her motivations and methods. Familiarize yourself with the sanatorium’s layout, key areas, and inhabitants so you are prepared to run encounters in whatever order the characters explore. Finally, review the climactic battle, “The Chemical Evolution,” to ensure a satisfying and epic finale.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 7 characters.</p></div>"

She seeks to “free” all people from their pain and sorrow, believing that erasing suffering is the only path to peace.

Her duty was to heal those sick in body or mind, which she achieved through blessings from her goddess, as well as the brewing of natural remedies. She found joy bringing peace to countless souls, but her life would be made complicated when she encountered her husband-to-be.</p><p class=\"p7\">After meeting the traveling knight Sir Marius Renathyr, Lethica discovered a happiness greater than she ever thought possible. Their romance was passionate, and their marriage filled Lethica with purpose. Lethica believed she and her chivalrous love would make the world a better place.</p><p class=\"p7\">Fate had another plan. After her husband bared his vampire fangs and attempted to feed upon her (see chapter 14), he fled in shame. She followed him and uncovered the extent of his wickedness, shocked to learn his soul was damned and pledged to a devil. The knight she knew and loved was dead, and her new life as a widow was one of endless grief.</p><p class=\"p7\">To ease her suffering, she redoubled her commitment to the restorative pursuit that had once brought her such comfort. She found the Isle of Mourn, drawn by stories of crystalline pools in the caverns beneath the earth said to have miraculous healing powers. The legends were true, and after she verified the water’s potency, she began construction of a hospital on that very site, where she vowed she would bring an end to all pain.</p><p class=\"p7\">Lethica used the waters of the pools to heal the sickly, but her joy did not return. She was hollow and bitter, and she grew resentful of her goddess for failing to prevent her tragedy. Disavowing her goddess and the Nightborne name, she turned toward scientific practices that allowed her to develop more potent medicines as the hospital continued its construction.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Eater of Memory</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Lethica discovered she was a natural scientist and that her brilliance was unmatched. However, despite numerous breakthroughs, she could not cure every affliction. In particular, she found that several of her patients suffered from painful memories just as she did. This scientific dead-end troubled her until inspiration struck while she walked the endless caverns beneath the fledgling hospital.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">She came across the ruins of a dead civilization that worshiped an eldritch being from beyond the stars who endlessly hungers for memories. For years, she studied the etchings of a forgotten language, learning how to make contact with a being known only as the White Worm. Lethica had finally found the secret that would allow her to unlock the full potential of her medicine.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s8\">In the cavern beneath the hospital, she performed a ritual that summoned forth the White Worm. By accepting its parasitic offspring within her form, Lethica appeased the creature and formed a psychic bond with it. Her skin turned pallid, her blood violet, and her tears an inky black that forever ran down her face and stained her cheeks. Then, Lethica activated the trap she had set, using her potent science to imprison the weakened grub and constantly drain its alien gore. This ichor, infused with the water of the enchanted pools, formed the base of the Lethic Serum, her greatest work.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\">When injected, the serum removed a subject’s memories, feeding them to the White Worm to keep it alive. While it remedied physical afflictions, it also warped the body into something wholly alien. Lethica saw this transformation as a cure to suffering and committed to spreading it to everyone, whether they sought it or not. This became the sole purpose of the completed hospital, which she dubbed Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Despite her proclaimed noble goal of freeing her patients from their pain, Lethica is equally motivated by a hatred that others should enjoy a blissful life when she cannot. Her foul experiments seek to perfect the serum and produce it at such a scale that the waters of Wickermoor Hollow would transform all living things within. She has even created a variety of apparatuses to pump the serum into the pools below the sanatorium.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter17_Memorys_Rest.webp\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p></p></div></div><h2><span class=\"s5\">Parley with the Widow</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Matron Lethica spends her waking hours immersed in her alchemy and overseeing the operations of Memory’s Rest Sanatorium. She meets with visitors to offer reassurances, veiled in kindness and empathy, while quietly assessing whether they can be swayed, used, or eliminated. She is most commonly met in the Matron’s Office (area L4), presenting herself as a visionary who carries the burden of humanity’s pain. She spends the remainder of her time in her quarters (area L19) or her Laboratory (area L27).</p><p class=\"p7\">Any challenge to her authority or questioning of her methods is met with unwavering confidence. She maintains a calm and composed demeanor, speaking with the precision of a scholar and the gentleness of a healer. Do not be fooled, however; she is cold and ruthless, convinced her work will liberate the world from suffering—no matter the cost.</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters meet Lethica and speak with her, these are her answers to some common topics:</p><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>Who Are You?</strong> “I am Matron Lethica, steward of this hospital. You may think of me as a healer—one who is unafraid to confront the hardships others dare not face.”</span></p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Why Do You Operate this Place?</strong> “To salve the sorrows of this senseless world. I brew the antidote to pain itself.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What Set You on this Path?</strong> “My own loss drives me. My own sorrow. All the memories which I long to forget but mustn’t. I cannot be idle until I have erased the pain from others.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Why Do You Cry?</strong> “A side effect of my work. Nothing more.” A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check determines this to be a lie.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Have You Tried Lethic Serum Yourself?</strong> “I must not. I endure so others may heal.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What is the Lethic Serum?</strong> “An alchemical distillation of my own design. It has yet to fail to erase the pain of those who accept its tranquility. It is the key to salvation.”</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap17\"><p class=\"h1 section\">NPCs of the Sanatorium</p><p>The sanatorium’s staff and inhabitants form a tortuous hierarchy under Matron Lethica’s control. Unquestioningly loyal orderlies carry out their duties under the watchful eyes of Nurse Godlee. Doctor Belkin’s surgeons operate as a well-oiled machine of experimental horrors. Even Hugo, Lethica’s hulking enforcer, bears the scars of her cruel obsession.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Hugo, the First Experiment</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Hugo.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Hugo is Matron Lethica’s ward, bodyguard, and the ultimate proof of her alchemical ambitions. Born of a cursed fomorian bloodline, Hugo’s immense strength was overwhelmed by debilitating pain and horrific visions so severe that they harmed those around him and threatened to end his own life. His suffering drove him to Lethica during the earliest days of the hospital, where she promised comfort and relief through her alchemy. She kept her word—quieting the agony of his curse—but at the cost of turning him into a mutated servant entirely dependent on her.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\">The first step in silencing Hugo’s torment was to close his three eyes with needle and thread. In a short time, Hugo’s body became riddled with scars from countless surgeries. Metal tubes and implanted reservoirs ensure constant delivery of the alchemical cocktail that suppresses Hugo’s pain and emotions, though this was no mercy. Viewing Hugo as the perfect test subject due to his rapidly healing biology and seeming unwillingness to die, Lethica pushed his physical and emotional limits to advance her alchemical mastery. Despite this, Hugo’s devotion to Lethica is absolute—she soothed his pain and, in his eyes, everything she does is justified.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\"><em><strong>Meeting Hugo.</strong></em> Accustomed to his own form of veil, Hugo relies on his other senses to navigate the world. He is attuned to the sanatorium and immediately rushes to pacify any commotion within its walls, though he mostly stalks the Second Floor to avoid disturbing new arrivals.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Hugo’s Fate.</strong></em> Despite his near-death experience and agonizing transformation, fragments of Hugo’s sympathy and kindness survive. If he still lives when Matron Lethica is destroyed, Hugo is left adrift, overwhelmed by the loss. If approached with compassion and empathy, Hugo might abandon his violent ways and seek peace beyond the borders of Wickermoor Hollow, learning to forget the horrors he witnessed and discovering that he no longer needs Lethica to be free.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Sarah Godlee and the Orderlies</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Sarah_Godlee.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Nurse Sarah Godlee was one of the first to accept the Lethic Serum and serves as the second-in-command to Matron Lethica. Unlike the other orderlies, she wears no mask, as her form was only mildly contorted by the serum. Freed of the troubles that hindered her former life, she now runs the sanatorium’s night-to-night operations as its undisputed enforcer. While Matron Lethica cloaks her methods in gentleness, Godlee prefers intimidation, control, and cruelty.</p><p class=\"p7\">Godlee thrives on power, both over the orderlies under her command and the patients she claims to care for. She sometimes pilfers valuables from the patients to indulge her sense of authority.</p><p class=\"p7\">Nurse Godlee deeply admires Matron Lethica to the point of obsession, finding her employer’s decades-long grief over her husband a constant source of pain. She wishes for Lethica to let go of her past and forget Marius Renathyr just like the patients of the hospital. She believes removing collected mementos to be the right step, but would never dare cross her matron. However, she will find common cause with the characters if they can convince her they wish to help.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Meeting Nurse Godlee.</strong></em> When the characters first enter the hospital, Nurse Godlee is overseeing the patients’ mealtime in the Common Room (area L9) on the First Floor. During waking hours, she retires to her quarters (area L17) to watch over the Airing Grounds (area L10) or tour the sanatorium to instruct Hugo and the other orderlies.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>The Veiled Orderlies.</strong></em> All fifteen of the orderlies who now preside over the sanatorium were formerly patients. Each of them wears the same, matching uniform. They also don stark white porcelain masks to conceal the unsightly deformities left by the Lethic Serum. While they are still capable of reasoning, the orderlies obey the commands of Matron Lethica and Nurse Godlee without question.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Doctor Belkin and the Surgeons</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Doctor_Belkin.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Doctor Belkin is the architect of Memory’s Rest’s most horrifying experiments. When Belkin was first exposed to the Lethic Serum, its effects on him were unique. His mind opened to the White Worm’s influence, and he was found the following night in the caverns below the hospital having removed the top of his own skull—a colony of pale, writhing larvae now burrow within, driving his every thought. The White Worm had revealed the “truth”: salvation lies not in erasing trauma but in perfect symbiosis with the worm’s parasitic gifts.</p><p class=\"p7\">Belkin is a fierce disciple of Matron Lethica, and he believes in spreading the White Worm’s influence to elevate all beings to a higher state of existence. His experiments focus on creating mutated hosts for more worms, ensuring their spread to the wider world. His reverence for his alien deity is immense, and Belkin is always looking for new converts to worship the worm. He will find common cause with the characters if made to believe they are genuinely interested in serving the eldritch entity.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\">When operating on the first floor of the sanatorium, the doctor hides his exposed brain with a surgery cap, bringing a calming demeanor to his nervous patients. He will treat the characters with kindness, but if he perceives the characters as a threat to the White Worm, he will unleash his experiments and surgeons to eliminate them.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Meeting Doctor Belkin.</strong></em> Doctor Belkin spends most of his time in the Experimental Wing of the Second Floor monitoring his trials and testing subjects he thinks are strong enough to survive his extreme procedures. To maintain appearances, Belkin also conducts medical examinations for new admissions, using these moments to evaluate potential candidates for his operations.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>The Wormhost Surgeons.</strong></em> Belkin’s six acolytes have survived similar procedures under his scalpel. They are now extensions of his will, hosting their own colonies of parasites. To conceal their deformities, they wear bloodied surgical smocks, masks, and caps, though the faint squish of the larvae beneath their flesh often betrays them.</p><p class=\"p7\">The surgeons work in chilling synchronization, communicating in low, guttural gurgles. While outwardly loyal to Belkin, their true allegiance lies with the White Worm.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Patients of Memory’s Rest</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The patients (Neutral, human noncombatant <span class=\"s7\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoners}</strong></span>) of Memory’s Rest Sanatorium represent a wide spectrum of suffering from every corner of Wickermoor Hollow. Each has been admitted seeking relief, only to become unwitting subjects in Matron Lethica’s experimental pursuits. All patients within Memory’s Rest are under the effects of the Lethic Serum, which relieves whatever malady brought them here but erases their memories and identity. The patients in the Patient Register table could be met by the characters during their stay in Memory’s Rest, though it is not comprehensive.</p><p class=\"p7\">You choose where a patient is within Memory’s Rest at any given time, whether they are alone or escorted, and what their condition is.

Once this task is complete, they begin a thorough search through the sanatorium to find and eliminate danger and to communicate with senior staff like Nurse Godlee and Matron Lethica.</p><p class=\"p7\">Doctor Belkin and his surgeons congregate in the Experiment Lab (area L26) and Monster Containment (area L22) to keep their experiments out of danger during Lockdown.

Lethica calmly makes her way back to her Laboratory (area L27) in the event of a Lockdown to ensure her research is safe before returning to the sanatorium halls.</p><p class=\"p7\">During Lockdown, Memory’s Rest Sanatorium has the following features:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Creeping Dark.</strong> Magic that suppresses sight fills the hospital, halving the range of all light sources and Darkvision.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Self-Acting Locks.</strong> Closed doors lock themselves, or lock automatically when they are closed. Elevators cease to function.</p><p class=\"p5\">Only Lethica can authorize the end of Lockdown, which is typically performed by Nurse Godlee in the Engineering Room (area L20).</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Subdued and Sedated.</strong></em> If the characters are overwhelmed in combat, they are not killed. They awaken in the Sedation Hall (area L16), revived with 1 hit point. Their equipment is replaced with hospital gowns, and they are surrounded by Lethica and her orderlies. This is a disastrous scenario that can mark the end of the campaign without clever negotiation, luck, or external help.</p></div>"

Yorgrim, the necropolis’s caretaker, stands alone against a rising tide of undeath, slowly corrupted by the incessant whispers of the malicious, ravening spirits he has sworn to entomb and imprison. Unless aided by the characters, the jailer will break, and a wave of shrieking spirits will crash upon Wickermoor Hollow and devour every living soul within.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>Maidenmist Cemetery sprawls across the fogbound, rolling hills to the southeast of Wickermoor Village, riddled with headstones, crypts, mausoleums, and every other kind of grave marker. It serves as the final resting place for all mortal beings in Wickermoor Hollow and has done so for millennia. None know who first built the cemetery, for it has always been there. It is said that the wrought iron fence that surrounds it inches forward night by night, forever welcoming the endlessly increasing deceased.</p><p>For years, a ghostly orc known as Yorgrim has served as the sole gravedigger and sexton of the cemetery. However, he is not just a caretaker for the dead that he buries and for whom he performs the final rites. He also serves as a warden, for the cemetery’s true purpose is a prison for thousands of screaming spirits that seek only to corrupt and consume the souls of both the living and the dead.</p><p>The cemetery’s secret is that it was built upon a tear into the Shroud, which normally serves as an impenetrable barrier around Druskenvald, but here it serves as a gateway for the twisted spirits to cross over into the realm freely. These souls are filled with inhuman wrath for being deprived of a true afterlife; left unchecked, they would spill across the valley and the entire domain beyond, feasting upon the living.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>The haunted hills of Maidenmist Cemetery have never been safe for the living, but the warding lights of the necropolis have gone out, and their caretaker slowly succumbs to the corruption of the Shroud. Now, the cemetery is a prison overrun with rioting dead. Only the relighting of the balefire beacons and the sealing of the tear into the Shroud can stop the coming tide of death. Characters who are drawn to Maidenmist Cemetery by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p>Find Yorgrim, the Gravedigger.</p></li><li><p>Light the five extinguished balefire beacons.</p></li><li><p>Discover the source of the dead’s corruption within the sepulcher.</p></li><li><p>Destroy the Chained Reaper and seal the tear to the Shroud.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Yorgrim, the key NPC, to convincingly convey his grim duty and descent into corruption. Refresh yourself on the stories of the other Fallen (see chapter 8) to provide the characters with inspiration in performing their rites. Review the locations of Maidenmist Cemetery so you are prepared to improvise encounters as the characters explore.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 9th level characters.</p></div>"

Haunted by the failures of his past and the loss of his friends to their respective sins, he goes about his duties with grim determination, never relenting despite the constant cracking of his soul and the chains that bind the spirits he keeps imprisoned.</p><h2>The Penitent Pilgrim</h2><p>Before coming to Druskenvald, Yorgrim was a seer for his people, the orcs of the Shadestone Clan. He communed with the spirits of the deceased, performing their burial rites and guiding them to the afterlife. However, he was deceived by his chieftain and unwittingly performed a necromantic ritual that slaughtered his entire community and annihilated their souls with unspeakable and forbidden power.</p><p>Yorgrim took his vengeance, but it was a hollow victory. His people were dead, and their souls would never find peace. As a self-imposed penance, the seer etched the name of every fallen orc onto a heavy stone that he chained to himself, committing to carrying the weight forever as he sought to wander the land and bring peace to souls that were not yet beyond help.</p><p>For years, Yorgrim trudged across the land, a dour pilgrim performing burial rites for countless souls until his body finally gave out beneath the crushing weight of his penance. However, his spirit did not yield, and he arrived in Druskenvald not reborn but instead fated to forever exist as a ghost, still chained to the heavy gravestone even in death.</p><p>In this new realm, with so many restless dead in need of peace, Yorgrim wandered Druskenvald, performing rites alone until he finally made connections with five other souls as powerful and burdened as his. Despite his gloomy disposition, Yorgrim developed an affection for and eventual friendship with Ol’ Jericho Sticks, Sir Marius Renathyr, Captain Briggsy Kratch, Lethica Nightborne, and Farryn of the Greenwood, regularly visiting each throughout his wayward travels.</p><h2>The Shroud Warden</h2><p>Shortly after meeting his new friends and softening his stony heart, he discovered the mysterious Maidenmist Cemetery in Wickermoor Hollow. Deep within the sepulcher at the center of the necropolis was a small tear into the primordial mists of death called the Shroud (see chapter 1), and the shrieks and whispers of the tortured souls within concerned Yorgrim deeply. He feared an apocalyptic reckoning should the shrouded abominations freely pass into Druskenvald.</p><p>Feeling as if he had discovered his true purpose, he bound himself to the cemetery and took up the mantle of its sexton and gravedigger, performing the burial rites for the thousands of dead he found there. His duty was to provide this service for every new death in Wickermoor Hollow. This prevented the spirits of the Shroud from slipping through to possess and reanimate the corpses that lay within the earth of the necropolis.</p><p>However, as the years went on, the tear to the Shroud grew larger, and Yorgrim beseeched his friends for aid. All agreed, and each of the six unlikely companions offered a fragment of their soul to kindle great braziers of spectral balefire, the light of which repelled the Shroud and the abominable spirits within.</p><p>After parting ways, Yorgrim would never see his friends again; the lighting of the beacons bound him to the cemetery as a jailer and warden of the shrieking spirits and occasionally restless dead within. In his duty, he took up a lantern tethered to the anima of his soul that serves as his primary weapon and tool to keep the unruly spirits chained.</p><p>As each of his former friends fell one by one to the sin of the Horned King, the balefire beacons dimmed greatly, and Yorgrim’s nightly duties became far more challenging. When the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> crashed into Wickermoor Hollow, bringing the ghastly fog of the Shroud with it, the tear in the sepulcher grew immensely. And following the deaths of each of the Fallen, their respective balefire beacons have gone completely dark. Now, Yorgrim expends every measure of his being to keep the riotous and raging dead from spilling forth, his own soul weakening with every passing night.</p><h2>Parley with the Gravedigger</h2><p>Yorgrim is dour, grim, and stoic, but he is not cruel. He views the characters as the only hope to relight the balefire beacons and investigate the source of the Shroud. He is not talkative and speaks with few words but doesn’t withhold important information that the characters need to know.</p><p>These are some responses to common questions the characters may ask of this spectral sextant:</p><p><strong>Who Are You?</strong> “I am called Yorgrim. This is my cemetery. I serve the dead here.”</p><p><strong>What Is this Place?</strong> “The graves of Maidenmist bear the dead of the hollow. Centuries of souls rest here. It was here before me. It will be here after me.”</p><p><strong>Are You Dead?</strong> “My life ended long ago, but my duty did not. It persists until I atone for my sins and failures. This is my burden to bear.”</p><p><strong>Who Is the Dog?</strong> “This is Isolde. She is a grim, a spirit bound in duty to the dead. We are of a kind. She is my sole companion.”</p><p><strong>What Is the Shroud?</strong> “The Shroud is an element. Like the air you breathe and the earth you stand upon. It is death incarnate. It should not be here. Not even in an afterlife.”</p><p><strong>What Are the Shrouded?</strong> “Souls once living but devoured and corrupted by the Shroud. They have lost everything they once were in life. Abominations.”</p><p><strong>You Were Friends?</strong> “The monsters you killed were my friends. Before they succumbed to corruption, they had strong wills and good hearts, like you. They fell to their burdens, like you might yet. None are immune to the weight of failure.”</p><p><strong>Why Would We Perform Rites for Villains?</strong> “We will not perform the rites for the evil you faced. We do not mourn the Crimson Abbot, the Grinning Sinner, or the rest. I mourn who they were when there was light in their souls. It is for them we perform the rites. It is the only way.”</p><h2>Isolde, the Grim</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Isolde.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>After isolating himself, Yorgrim found companionship in <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.UCktkgladT4vEA8K]{Isolde (ih-ZOAL-duh)}</strong>, a type of guardian spirit known as a grim. These spectral watchers guard cemeteries, graveyards, and other burial sites and can take the form of any animal. Isolde (neutral good <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.qoFEjfrANBdrCP6m]{Ghost}</strong>) manifests as a black hound with bright white eyes. She is deeply loyal to Yorgrim, and carries in her mouth a hooded lantern lit with a spark of the gravedigger’s soul.</p><p>While Isolde is similarly bound to Maidenmist Cemetery like her master, she is able to exit its cold iron gates and walk beyond its borders. In recent years, she has served as the primary messenger between Yorgrim and Mori Shade, the undertaker of Wickermoor Village. With a supernatural intuition that only a dog can possess, she can sense that Yorgrim is suffering from the gibbering of the Shroud and is close to breaking.</p><h2>The Shrouded</h2><p>The shrouded are malicious, ravenous spirits entirely stripped of their anima—the soul-stuff that retains an individual spirit's essence and identity. Having lost whoever they might have been in life, the shrouded exist as devouring forces of the primordial element of death itself, filled only with the hunger to corrupt and consume souls that retain their anima, whether they be living or dead. They only feel rage and hate for those who don't share their fate, forever drifting through the Shroud and seeking new prey to corrupt into shrouded themselves.</p><p>In Maidenmist Cemetery, numerous shrouded have spilled forth from the tear in the depths of the great sepulcher, and some have even slithered out between the cracks of the ancient tomb. They drift through the ghastly rolling fogbanks or possess the corpses once interred in the earth but now shamble about the necropolis.</p></div>"

Alarm bells toll from the clocktower, and if the characters do not dispatch the Undead, the ghasts are brought down by a rallied militia of armed townsfolk (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS]{Guards}</strong>) led by Constable Doris Squire (lawful neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knight}</strong>), suffering heavy losses.</p><p>After the ghasts are defeated, a character who succeeds on a [[/check MED DC 10]] or [[/check INV DC 10]] check can deduce that the risen corpses had been dead for varying lengths of time, with the oldest ghast having been dead for centuries and the freshest one only several weeks deceased.</p><p>Mori Shade (see chapter 11) arrives shortly after the battle and recognizes the most recently deceased corpse as Gregor Bolton, a once-burly workman who died from a fall while repairing the roof of Mayor Somerton’s manor. She mentions that she had delivered his body to Maidenmist Cemetery shortly before the characters arrived at Wickermoor Village.</p><p>She is deeply concerned by the arrival of Undead creatures in Wickermoor Village, suspecting that something is wrong in Maidenmist Cemetery. She beseeches the characters to investigate to prevent more death and destruction from the walking dead. Use the details below to guide the conversation with Mori:</p><ul><li><p>The shambling corpses' aggressiveness and shrieking suggests they aren’t normal Undead.</p></li><li><p>From Yorgrim, she knows the Shroud can turn spirits and corpses into ravening monsters.</p></li><li><p>She has not heard from Yorgrim or seen Isolde since her delivery of Gregor Bolton’s body to the cemetery.</p></li><li><p>A pile of corpses from recent deadly events around town has accumulated near the funeral home.</p></li><li><p>She went to Maidenmist Cemetery a week prior to look for Yorgrim, finding the gates chained and the cemetery covered in a dense fog.</p></li><li><p>There was no sign of the blazing fires or Yorgrim and Isolde’s flickering lantern light, and her calls to them went unanswered.</p></li></ul><p>Mori implores the characters to see if they can find a way into Maidenmist Cemetery and discover what’s become of Yorgrim. She then works with the townsfolk to collect the corpses from the battle and the funeral home, piling them on the outskirts of town to burn them, ensuring that they do not rise in undeath. If the characters interrupt the burning, the ghasts rise once more during the Dusk Hour of the following night.</p><p>If the characters fail to act, another group of townsfolk volunteers to make the journey to the cemetery. They never return, and can be found shambling among the Endless Gravestones (area Y3) as <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW]{Zombies}</strong>.

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap19 top-page\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter19_Maidenmist_Cemetery.webp\" alt=\"\" /><p class=\"h1 section\">Maidenmist Cemetery</p><p>Maidenmist Cemetery sprawls across many miles of hilly land in southeast Wickermoor Hollow. It has existed for centuries, its original builders lost to time. Countless dead rest here through every manner of burial and interment, and each of the thousands of grave markers that cover the land is never more than a few feet away from the next.</p><h2>Through Cold Iron Gates </h2><p>It takes approximately half a night’s travel southeast at a normal pace to reach the edge of Maidenmist Cemetery from Wickermoor Village, crossing the Silverbell River by way of an old cobblestone bridge. With each passing mile, the landscape becomes increasingly foggy, and the air grows colder. When the characters arrive at the cemetery, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The night is strangely cold and quiet as you arrive at Maidenmist Cemetery. A tall iron fence stretches out on either side of you, with thick, tightly spaced pickets that look like prison bars. The gate, flanked by metal sculptures of hooded reapers, hangs askew, bent as if it had been smashed open from the inside. The landscape before you, dotted with thousands of tombstones, rises in elevation before disappearing into the dense fog that shrouds the hills, wisps of blue-green mist billowing amidst the gray. A faint wail sounds from somewhere in the rolling fog.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>A 15-foot-tall iron fence encircles the entirety of Maidenmist Cemetery, its base heavily reinforced with stone. A Tiny creature can pass through the fence’s narrow pickets.</p><p>A character who examines the bent gate and succeeds on a [[/check INV DC 13]] check finds a 50-foot chain in the damp earth, along with several broken links, as if it snapped from a single violent thrust against the inside of the gate.</p><p>A cobblestone path leads into the cemetery up the hill, but it disappears into the fog. The blue-green mist is reminiscent of the Shroud, which the characters experienced during their trip aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>.</p><h2>Maidenmist Cemetery Features</h2><p>Unless otherwise noted, Maidenmist Cemetery has the following features:</p><p><strong>Ghastly Mist.</strong> Eerie, billowing mist rolls across the landscape. The entire cemetery is lightly obscured out to 60 feet, and heavily obscured beyond that distance.</p><p><strong>Lighting.</strong> The light of the Crooked Moon is caught and refracted in the mist, bathing the cemetery in dim light.</p><p><strong>Shrouded Spirits.</strong> Corrupted spirits lurk in the mist, searching for souls to devour. Every hour that the characters travel through the mist, three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.S5NNrWLkqfQKTs1h]{Shrouded}</strong>* (one of each variant) attack until they are destroyed.</p><p><strong>Wails of the Damned.</strong> The mist of the cemetery is interwoven with the Shroud, and the shrieking souls within wail incessantly. Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration have disadvantage.</p><p><strong>Corrupting Shroud.</strong> If a creature that isn’t a shrouded dies in the cemetery, it is corrupted by the Shroud and rises 10 minutes later, hostile toward all creatures that aren’t Undead. A Humanoid rises as an Undead, as determined on the Restless Dead table below. An Undead creature rises as a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.S5NNrWLkqfQKTs1h]{Shrouded}</strong>* (random variant).</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.X9e27C3qbrYU6rOb]{Restless Dead}</strong></em></p><h2>The Phantom Gravedigger</h2><p>While Yorgrim clings to his identity and duty, the weight of his penance and the insurmountable struggle against the tide of undeath has taken a toll on the gravedigger. His spirit is weak, tired, and fated to become the malevolent Chained Reaper. Before this transformation takes place in the Tomb of the Shrouded (area Y15), his shade can barely interact with the physical world, with most of his remaining power focused in the spectral lantern he always carries.</p><p>Therefore, when Yorgrim (found in area Y2) joins the characters in Maidenmist Cemetery, he doesn't use a stat block, has immunity to all damage, and can’t be affected by spells or other magical effects. His size is Medium, and he has a speed of 30 feet. He can move through other creatures and can share a space with them.</p><h3><strong>Balefire Lantern</strong></h3><p>Yorgrim carries a spectral azure lantern that is as incorporeal as he is, which sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once all six balefire beacons are lit, the lantern dims, shedding bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.</p><p>The lantern has the following features:</p><p><strong>Azure Protection.</strong> Creatures in the lantern’s bright light are immune to the Shrouded Spirits and Corrupting Shroud features (see “Maidenmist Cemetery Features” earlier in this chapter) of the cemetery’s mist.</p><p><strong>Balefire Warding. </strong>All<strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.S5NNrWLkqfQKTs1h]{Shrouded}</strong>* cannot enter the lantern’s bright light. Shrouded in the lantern’s light have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.</p><h3><strong>Gravedigger Actions</strong></h3><p>While Yorgrim is generally unable to interact with the physical world, when the characters are in danger, he summons up what little strength he has left to help.</p><p>While carrying the balefire lantern, on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Yorgrim causes one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><p><strong>Balefire Burst.</strong> Yorgrim’s lantern erupts with balefire. Each creature of Yorgrim's choice within the lantern’s bright light must make a [[/save DEX DC 15]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 1d8 fire]]{4 (1d8)} fire damage and [[/damage 1d8 necrotic]]{4 (1d8)} necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Chained Phantom</strong>. Yorgrim hurls a spectral chain to bind a foe. One creature Yorgrim can see within the lantern’s light must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 15]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[restrained apply=false] for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. </p><p><strong>Garish Light.</strong> Yorgrim unleashes a blinding flare from his lantern. Each creature of Yorgrim's choice within the lantern’s bright light must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[blinded apply=false] until initiative count 20 on the following round.</p><p><strong>Grave Resilience.</strong> Yorgrim's lantern imparts vitality. Each creature of Yorgrim's choice within the lantern’s light gains [[/damage 2d12 temp]]{13 (2d12) temporary hit points}.</p><h2>Balefire Beacons</h2><p>Six beacons of balefire, each with its own hue, are meant to roar in braziers around the cemetery to ward it from the encroaching Shroud. Five have gone dark and must be reignited to banish the eldritch fog and the vicious spirits within from all outdoor locations of Maidenmist Cemetery. This is the only way to open the doors to the Great Sepulcher (area Y2) so that the characters and Yorgrim can investigate the growing tear in the Shroud deep beneath the cemetery.</p><p>The balefire beacons have gone out following the deaths of the Fallen, the powerful beings whose souls were used to spark the flames. To reignite these beacons, the characters must travel across the cemetery to assist Yorgrim in performing each of the Fallen’s final rites at their flame’s respective brazier. The beacons, their locations, and the Fallen whose souls they were sparked from are as follows:</p><p><strong>Crimson Beacon.</strong> Flame of Sir Marius Renathyr (see chapter 14), found in the Highborn Crypts (area Y4).</p><p><strong>Violet Beacon.</strong> Flame of Lethica Nightborne (see chapter 17), found in the Cremation Gardens (area Y5).</p><p><strong>Amber Beacon.</strong> Flame of Ol’ Jericho Sticks (see chapter 13), found in the Potter’s Field (area Y6).</p><p><strong>Magenta Beacon.</strong> Flame of Captain Briggsy Kratch (see chapter 15), found in the Mausoleum Lanes (area Y7).</p><p><strong>Emerald Beacon.</strong> Flame of Farryn of the Greenwood (see chapter 18), found in the Burial Mounds (area Y8).</p><p><strong>Azure Beacon.</strong> Flame of Yorgrim, found in the Shadestone Sanctuary (area Y9).</p><p>The Azure Beacon is the only one that remains ablaze. When each of the remaining five beacons is lit, its corresponding sconce above the doors of the Great Sepulcher (area Y2) and within the Balefire Chamber (area Y11) lights with the same-colored flame. When all six beacons are lit, the sepulcher's doors unseal.</p><h3><strong>Final rites</strong></h3><p>To perform the final rites of the Fallen, a 1-minute ritual led by Yorgrim must be conducted at a balefire brazier. During the ritual, the characters must slay the attacking monsters and succeed on six ability checks. The specific details to complete the ritual are as follows:</p><p><strong>Spark the Flame.</strong> Special kindling connected to the Fallen, kept entombed at the respective cemetery location, must be placed in the brazier and ignited, beginning the ritual. Roll initiative! If 1 minute passes without the beacon becoming fully lit, the flame goes out, and a character can offer a fragment of their soul to restore the kindling, gaining 1 level of exhaustion. The characters can then attempt the ritual again.</p><p><strong>Sacrifice a Soul.</strong> The ignition of the flame draws the attention of hostile cemetery monsters corrupted by the Shroud, committed to preventing the beacon from being lit. These monsters must be slain during the ritual as an offering to the balefire (see \"The Beacon is Lit\" below).</p><p><strong>Hold Back the Shroud.</strong> The ravenous Shroud is drawn to the ritual, kept at bay with immense effort from Yorgrim. It billows around the fringes of the light cast by Yorgrim’s lantern (see “Balefire Lantern” earlier in this chapter), waiting for the light to be snuffed out. Everything outside of the lantern’s light is heavily obscured. Additionally, any character who leaves the light and steps into the Shroud is attacked by three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.S5NNrWLkqfQKTs1h]{Shrouded}</strong>* (one of each variant).</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter19_Gravedigger.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div></div><p><strong>Honor the Fallen.</strong> Once the balefire flame is lit, it burns small and must be stoked. As an action, a character can make a contribution to the ceremony that honors who the Fallen were before they fell. The character makes a DC 15 ability check. Each of the Fallen has a list of suggested “resolution proficiencies” that have the best chance of contributing to the ritual. Other checks can work at your discretion, but the DC for such checks rises to 18 unless you feel the justification is especially fitting.</p><p><strong>Stoke the Fire.</strong> Each successful ability check is one step toward finishing a Fallen’s final rites (see \"The Beacon is Lit\" below). With each failure, tormented souls from the Shroud take on mocking shapes of the Fallen and unleash hateful words to torment the gravedigger and the characters. Each creature that can hear this verbal assault must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 13]] saving throw or take [[/damage 1d6 psychic]]{3 (1d6)} psychic damage and be &amp;reference[stunned apply=false] until the end of its next turn. A creature can choose to take an extra [[/damage 6d6 psychic]]{21 (6d6)} psychic damage to avoid the stunned condition.</p><p><strong>The Beacon Is Lit.</strong> After the destruction of the guardian monsters and six successful ability checks, the ritual concludes and the balefire beacon is fully lit, banishing the Shroud from the cemetery location. All shrouded in the beacon’s location are destroyed, and the area loses the effects of the Shrouded Spirits, Wails of the Damned, and Corrupting Shroud features (see “Maidenmist Cemetery Features” earlier in this chapter).</p><p><strong>Brilliant Success.</strong> How well the characters perform the final rites affects the encounter in the Balefire Chamber (area Y11) within the sepulcher. Each ability check during a ritual that succeeds by 5 or more is considered a Brilliant Success. The number of Brilliant Successes achieved during the ritual determines the balefire beacon’s intensity, as shown in the Beacon Intensity table below (important in area Y11).</p><p><em><strong>Beacon Intensity</strong></em></p><table border=\"0\"><thead><tr><th>Brilliant Successes</th><th>Beacon Intensity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2 or fewer</td><td>Glowing Beacon</td></tr><tr><td>3–5</td><td>Blazing Beacon</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Roaring Beacon</td></tr></tbody></table><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/19-1_Maidenmist_Cemetery.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>Maidenmist Cemetery Locations</h2><p>The following locations are keyed to map 19.1.</p></div>"

Yorgrim looks especially hollow and tired, failing to notice the characters’ arrival until they announce themselves or Isolde alerts him.</p><p>When the characters approach Yorgrim, he is surprised that mortals have made it to the sepulcher alive, but he’s relieved that they might be able to set things right in the cemetery and push back the Shroud. Use the details below to guide the conversation with Yorgrim:</p><ul><li><p>The tear in the Shroud within the sepulcher is growing, as shown by the shrouded trying to escape.</p></li><li><p>The balefire beacons that ward against the Shroud have gone out one by one in recent weeks.</p></li><li><p>Only one beacon remains lit, and its azure color matches his lantern.

After each challenge his fortitude lessens, his spirit appears more hollow, and the maddening voices of the shrouded affect him more and more, leading toward his inevitable transformation into the Chained Reaper in the Tomb of the Shrouded (area Y15). Once all six balefire beacons are lit, Yorgrim’s balefire lantern dims, shedding bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Loyal Hound.</strong></em> While Yorgrim and the characters explore Maidenmist Cemetery, Isolde is left alone to defend the doors of the sepulcher against the Shroud. She dutifully devotes herself to keep her balefire lantern lit, slowly draining her spectral essence.

Below are the suggested resolution proficiencies the characters can utilize to perform Yorgrim’s final rites:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Arcana or Mason’s Tools:</strong> Showcase his abilities in tending to the dead, performing burial rites, or communing with the spirit world.</p></li><li><p><strong>History or Religion:</strong> Recall his dutiful commitment to the Shadestone Clan and the performance of his ritualistic duties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance or Persuasion:</strong> Perform a funeral dirge and extol the bond he had with his people, his friends, or his hound Isolde.</p></li></ul><p>After six successful checks, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The azure balefire rages within the lantern, and you hear Yorgrim’s faint, distant voice. “Thank you.” A moment later, the lantern erupts into a blaze of soothing balefire, filling the tomb with light that becomes so bright it blinds you.

The solemn notes of a lone fiddle followed by the bellowing sound of a train whistle means you possess a one-way ticket into the unknown. Those sounds herald the arrival of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>. It only stills and quiets for a transient moment before it lurches forward once more into its eternal voyage between life and death, so hop aboard.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> is more than a mere vessel. It is a living, breathing entity offering its departed passengers their final journey to life after death. For many, this trip is their last fleeting taste of civilization before being plunged into the terror of what waits beyond the reach of both the hallowed and profane.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is the introductory adventure to <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign, but it can also be played as a standalone one-shot. The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> can materialize anywhere it is required, always at night, and most frequently near graveyards or standing stones. The chapter’s thrilling conclusion can occur in any forest where the train crashes and transforms, leaving the characters stranded in isolation.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> thunders her call, ferrying wayward souls through the Shroud of death to the life that waits beyond. But among the spectral passengers bound for Druskenvald and restless spirits trapped aboard the ghost train is a crooked shade that plots to derail this fateful journey.</p><p class=\"p7\">Characters who find themselves aboard the ghost train through the Quest Hooks might initially only want to reach their destination, but they may soon have additional goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Free the haints—lost souls trapped on the train—by resolving their unfinished business, trapping them in a Soul Can, or destroying them.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Meet Phillip and Adela Druskenvald and possibly have their fortunes told.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Pursue the Phantom Trainhopper to the Tender.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Survive the battle with the corrupted Ghostlight Locomotive.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the key NPCs, locations, and concepts featured in this chapter and chapters 1 and 8 so you can deliver strong story moments and establish critical worldbuilding. A casual readthrough of each area of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> will help you improvise interactions. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “When It’s Time,” ensures a terrifying and tone-setting final encounter.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 1 characters. By the end of the chapter, the characters will have advanced to level 3. At your discretion, characters may also begin the adventure at level 2 or 3. If the characters begin this adventure at a higher level (see “Quest Hooks” below), a few modifications are included in certain areas of this chapter.</p></div>"

          "name": "The Ghostlight Locomotive",
          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap10\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Ghoslight Locomotive</p><p>The Ghostlight Locomotive is an old black train engine that rides rails made of mist and pulls the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>. This ghost train has but one primary purpose: to ferry the souls of the dead to Druskenvald so that they might be reborn for a second chance at life. On rare occasions, it grants passage to living beings who wish to pass between the realms of life and death.</p><p class=\"p7\">To make this run, the train must travel through the Shroud, a shrieking eldritch fog that envelops numerous afterlives and realms of death. The passage is always dangerous due to the devouring nature of the ghastly mist that can obliterate any soul, living or dead.</p><h2>Ghosts in the Machine</h2><p class=\"p5\">To keep itself running, the train burns souls for fuel. Though this may seem a terrible truth, a balance is struck between the spirits that are ferried and those that are consumed. Souls unfortunate enough to become fodder in the ghost train’s firebox were once Wayward Haints—restless spirits that cannot rest or pass on due to unresolved affairs in life—but have deteriorated into soul coal (see “Haints” below) after spending years trapped on the train. This heavy toll ensures the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> can continue to serve its purpose as ferry for the dead, granting them safe passage from the enveloping annihilation of the Shroud.</p><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:6px;bottom:6px;left:6px;right:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:relative;z-index:3\"><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><p><strong>GM Tip</strong></p><p class=\"p11\">As you progress through this chapter, let the tension build slowly. Characters may be meeting each other for the first time. The modular encounters in each train car should not only challenge characters but also gradually build unease before the conclusion in the woods.</p><p class=\"p12\">If you are running the full Crooked Moon adventure, read through each adventure chapter at least once so you feel comfortable with any potential outcomes before you begin. Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are involved in multiple chapters; this is the characters’ first opportunity to learn about them and make their own first impressions. Their interactions will shape the characters’ relationships and decisions in future events.</p><p class=\"p13\">If you are running this chapter as a standalone one-shot, then you might allow the characters to rejoin the Vagrant on the train to head toward their next adventure, wherever that may be. You can also ignore the Fateweaving guidance that ties characters to the overarching campaign of The Crooked Moon.</p></aside></div></div>"

        "NPCs of the Ghostlight Express": {
          "name": "NPCs of the Ghostlight Express",
          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap10\"><p class=\"h1 section horned\">NPCS of the Ghostlight Express</p><p>In addition to the NPCs listed below, the train teems with the insubstantial souls of the departed. Some are on a path to rebirth in Druskenvald, while others are Wayward Haints (see “Haints” below) trapped aboard by their unresolved past lives.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Phillip and Adela Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are going home. They ride the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> back to Druskenvald, the domain of death they rule together as husband and wife. Even at first glance, it is plain to see the loving bond between the pair.</p><p class=\"p7\">Phillip is a man of vision who believes that keeping a forward-thinking attitude will solve any problem, championing “modern” ideals and striving for “progress.” Dapper, charming, and overconfident, the lord of Druskenvald is well-liked by the land’s people despite his general aloofness to their present struggles. He is a tall, thin man with dark, slicked-back hair and a pencil-thin mustache. He carries an ornate black cane topped with a silver goat skull.</p><p class=\"p7\">Adela is outgoing, enthusiastic, and caring, always looking at the spiritual side of every situation. She does not need to look far, however, for even in a world filled with magic, she possesses a tether to the spirit world and formidable powers of divination that let her peer into the future with second sight. She is supremely supportive of her husband and believes her positivity helps him appreciate the amazing world he has fashioned for them. She is short and petite with wavy brown hair, almost always wearing a glamorous dress accented by a glittering necklace with a planchette hanging from its chain.</p><p class=\"p7\">When the characters first encounter Phillip and Adela (see area G3), they greet the newcomers with warmth and curiosity. They may be willing to share details about the realm of Druskenvald and themselves (see chapter 1), but they frequently turn the questions back on the characters in genuine interest.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s8\">The Druskenvalds have one overarching goal: make both life and death a grand old time. Life here in the afterlife is sweet, and they do what they can to make sure it stays that way. While many afterlives strip away much of what it means to be mortal, Druskenvald does the opposite. Phillip especially finds beauty in the messy, imperfect, and oftentimes sinful nature of mortal folk and strives to maintain that in the realm he rules.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">It is left to your discretion what business Phillip and Adela were attending to in the mortal realms—and if they are even willing to share. Regardless, by the time they appear in this story, the experience is happily behind them. With nothing but time to kill on the train, their recent past has melted away, and they welcome any distraction that might cheer the final stretch toward their destination: their sprawling manor home called Chateau Clair de Lune.</p><p class=\"p7\">Use this opportunity to create a connection with Phillip and Adela, since these two NPCs will interact with the characters throughout <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Vagrant</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_The_Vagrant.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">The Vagrant, an amiable frogman with mottled green skin, serves as a “Stranger” (see chapter 1) who ferries the souls of the dead to the “other side.” The <em>Ghostlight Express</em> is his chosen vessel for this sacred responsibility, and he serves as the ghost train’s conductor and engineer. He wears the tattered garb of a vagabond, complete with a wide-brimmed hat where he always keeps three railroad spikes.</p><p class=\"p7\">Bound by his eternal duty, the Vagrant offers safe passage to the souls of the dead who will be reborn in the realm of Druskenvald. A consummate storyteller, he believes each passenger that boards the ghost train has a tale to tell, which he is happy to do in the form of a song aided by his well-worn fiddle.</p><p class=\"p7\">The Vagrant has a strange kinship with the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> as its sole caretaker. Through the eons, the few who have come to know this ferryman have wondered if the Vagrant himself is bound to the train just as much as the haints who cannot disembark. But none ever learned the truth of the frogman’s origins, and his story remains a mystery.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Story and a Song</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Meeting the Vagrant is an otherworldly experience, heralded by the sound of his fiddle preceding the arrival of the train. The Vagrant has a fondness for all the souls he guides, so when the shock of his sudden appearance subsides, the dead and the living alike find themselves facing a cordial, smiling frogman ready with a story, a song, and a wink.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\">Though he may seem lighthearted and carefree, he holds his role as ferryman with immense gravity. The locomotive that pulls the cars of the ghost train cannot speak for itself, so the Vagrant speaks on its behalf. When conversing with the characters, he always maintains his friendly disposition, no matter the question or topic. Some things he might say include:</span></p><p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Who are you?</strong> “Well now, you can call me the Vagrant. Just a humble ferryman, guidin’ souls to the other side.”</span></p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>What is the Ghostlight Locomotive?</strong> “Ah, the heart of the train, it is. It’s no mere engine—no, it’s got a will of its own, you see. And only it can get us where we’re headed.”</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Where are we going?</strong> “Druskenvald, o’course! Or the lord and lady’s chateau to be specific. That’s where this line ends, for now. But the tracks . . . they ain’t always the same.”</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>What are these spirits?</strong> “Passengers just like you, plain and simple.”</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>What happens if we stop the train?</strong> “Heh, stoppin’ it? Well, that’d be stoppin’ fate itself. No more ticket holders from here ‘til the chateau. Ain’t no peace in derailing destiny—best you stay aboard.”</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Haints</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Haints are tethered apparitions, their lanky, ethereal forms shimmering a ghastly blue-green and floating slightly off the surface of the train car floors. Their clothes are worn and tattered, billowing as if caught in a perpetual breeze. Some haints repeat actions and phrases from their past lives, trapped in a loop of obsessive memories, while others might repeatedly relive moments of joy, sorrow, or fear.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_The_Phantom_Trainhopper.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p7\">A <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aEPVMByT2COU30KF]{Wayward Haint}</strong><span class=\"s12\">*</span> is a spirit trapped between the worlds of the living and the dead. They are not free souls, usually due to some lingering guilt or an unresolved connection to the mortal world. Not all haints are inherently wicked, but their lack of freedom to cross over into their next form of existence takes a toll on their psyche and disposition. As haints, they are tethered to the train forever until their burden is lifted or they deteriorate into soul coal and become fuel for the train.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Bound Spirits</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Haints that remain bound to the train become its minions if they have not been freed prior to its transformation into the corrupted Ghostlight Locomotive.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Vacant Vessels</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Haints fear empty bottles and jars, which can be found in the Passenger Car (area G1) or Lounge Car (area G3), because they can be trapped inside of them with the proper technique. A character who contemplates the haints and succeeds on a [[/check HIS DC 16]] or [[/check REL DC 16]] check recalls the Bottle Trap trait in the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aEPVMByT2COU30KF]{Wayward Haint}</strong><span class=\"s12\">*</span> stat block. Bottles containing a haint count as Soul Cans (see “When It's Time” later in this adventure).</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Phantom Trainhopper</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">There is one soul aboard the train who doesn’t have a ticket to ride: the <strong>@UUID[Actor.UXvfXXYLkjrjVYGB]{Phantom Trainhopper}</strong> (@UUID[Actor.xA6qV8U9Cte3eGkC]{Shadow}). In life, they were a member of a secret cult in the living world that worships Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen. Tonight, they were ritually sacrificed so their spirit could sneak aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> on this rare evening that Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are passengers.</p><p class=\"p7\">Granted exceptional power in death by Kehlenn’s chief minion, the Crooked Man, this malevolent shade carries a curse aboard to corrupt the spirits that the Ghostlight Locomotive uses for fuel. With help from the devouring Shroud, the Phantom Trainhopper turns the ghost train against the Vagrant and strands the Druskenvalds—and coincidentally, the characters—in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p7\">Once the shade releases Kehlenn’s curse, it’s just a matter of time before that curse reaches the Tender (area G8), and, ultimately, the locomotive. Unwittingly, the characters likely play an integral part in bringing about The Crooked Queen’s goal by unsealing the final door and letting the curse in.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter8_Tarot_Reading.webp\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p></p></div></div></div>"

They may be picked up together or individually, but if you are running this chapter as a standalone adventure, the characters should board as a group.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\">While the ghost train may itself provide enough interest for some to board on sight, others may desire some goal or justification to accept the Vagrant’s invitation. For a full-length campaign, talk with your players to establish the circumstances that lead their character to embark when the train arrives, even if begrudgingly.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">You may choose whichever Quest Hook you feel will most enthrall the players. Here are a few examples:</p><p class=\"p16\"><strong>Fate.</strong> The characters have an exclusive invitation to ride the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, a rare and mysterious opportunity, because it is their destiny. Each character, unbeknownst to them, has a ticket in their pocket, and each has their own rationale for boarding the train.</p><p class=\"p17\">Adela Druskenvald foresaw the characters’ arrival through her tarot cards and believes the travelers are here to aid them on their trip, though she cannot see why. The Vagrant may make knowing cryptic remarks but refuses to elaborate. If asked, circular logic abounds. The Vagrant is here to pick up the travelers because they have tickets, and they have tickets because Druskenvald is their destination.</p><p class=\"p16\"><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Death.</strong> The characters have died. They may have died all together, or they might have died at different times in different places. When the events of the adventure kick off, the Vagrant makes the rare decision to instantly reincarnate the characters into their new living bodies, which likely take the form of the reborn species of Druskenvald (see chapter 2). Alternatively, they can be reborn in their previous body or as a different species not native to Druskenvald. Either way, they find themselves standing together on the platform of a ghostly train station awaiting what comes next.</span></p><p class=\"p17\">This unique hook can follow an existing campaign in which all the characters died, but the players want to continue with a new version of their existing characters. If the characters in this scenario are higher than 3rd level, you should adjust the difficulty of this chapter and the future events of the campaign, or alternatively, you and your players should agree that the experience of dying reduces all characters back to 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p class=\"p18\"><strong>Homeward Bound.</strong> The characters are originally from Druskenvald, but through strange circumstances they spilled out of the Shroud into the mortal realms. All they want is to get back to where they came from, and have finally found a location they believe the <em>Ghostlight Express </em>will be arriving so they can go home at last.</p></div>"

The frogman greets them amiably, introducing himself and the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>.</p><p class=\"p7\">A character who succeeds on a [[/check PRC DC 13]] check feels the unfamiliar ticket in their pocket or on their person. Otherwise, the Vagrant selects the character he feels is most likely to board the train and points out that they already have the ticket to ride. Once a character has found their ticket, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>A paper railway ticket trembles faintly in your grasp.

Both are sealed with <em>Arcane Lock</em> spells the Vagrant can bypass. The Tender (area G8) has no door at its front.</span></p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Spectral Passengers. </strong>Ghostly forms of passengers appear and fade away randomly throughout the train cars. They are moving on to the afterlife, avoiding the fate of becoming a haint. While they seem to sometimes watch the characters, they don’t respond to any attempted interaction.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Windows.</strong> The train’s windows don’t open and have AC 18, 30 hit points, and a damage threshold of 15. If a window is broken, the Shroud floods the car and affects spirit passengers as described in “The Shroud Beyond” below.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Shroud Beyond</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">In the unlikely scenario where the interior of the train is exposed to the Shroud, roll initiative!

These creatures are bloodthirsty and attack the characters until destroyed.</p><p class=\"p7\">[[/r 1d4]] rounds after the breach occurs, the Vagrant lets out a shrill whistle on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties). The breached door or window closes or reforms, and no more passengers are corrupted.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Haints on the Haunt</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">While most of the passengers are here to cross over into Druskenvald and be reborn, some are burdened by unresolved grievances from their past lives and are instead tethered to the train until they can let go of their attachment (see “Haints” above).</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Unfettering a Haint</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aEPVMByT2COU30KF]{Wayward Haints}</strong><span class=\"s12\">*</span> can’t leave the train car they are found within.

To progress the adventure, the characters must free the haints from the train, which can be accomplished with two general methods.</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Destruction.</strong> Destroying a haint breaks its bond to the train, though it leaves an echo of pain behind that comes back to haunt the characters later (see area G8).</p><p class=\"p15\"><strong>Resolution.</strong> Alternatively, the characters can help the haints resolve their unprocessed emotions toward their unfinished business. A haint’s binding is resolved either by helping it reach an understanding of its emotional bindings (see “Helping a Haint” below) or by bringing it the token that completes the missing piece of that understanding, as described in each haint’s entry in the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> locations. When a haint moves on and is freed from the train, each character regains [[/damage 1d6 healing]]{1d6 hit points}, gaining any excess beyond their hit point maximum as temporary hit points.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Helping a Haint.</strong></em> Bringing a haint their lost token is the safest way to achieve resolution, but there is a riskier alternative. A character can interact with a haint in some way and make an ability check, trying to help it come to terms with its unfinished business. Each haint has a list of suggested “resolution proficiencies” that have the best chance of helping it reach resolution. Ability checks using these skills are against DC 12. Other checks can work at your discretion, but these checks are against DC 15 unless you feel the justification is especially fitting.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\">Each time a check using a given skill or tool proficiency is successful, the DC of further uses of that proficiency to help the same haint increases by 2. Characters are better served by applying a variety of approaches.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s13\">Each successful ability check helps the haint reach a resolution, and after three successes, the haint is freed. However, with each failure, the haint grows more impatient and agitated. After three failures, it loses itself to rage and despair, becomes hostile, and attacks the characters. At that point, they have no choice but to destroy it.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Switcheroo!</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The first time the characters pass through the interior vestibule door at the front of a car, it leads to a random train car they have not yet visited. When this happens, characters who pass through the vestibule doors vanish through a portal of swirling mist and wait in limbo. Once all characters have followed, the door closes behind them and they arrive at a random car, as determined by rolling on the Random Car table.</p><p class=\"p7\">Once a car has been entered, it is locked into place, and the rest of the train behind it remains consistent until the train crashes (see “Off the Spectral Rails” later in the chapter). Additionally, vestibule doors already passed through can be traveled through as normal, with no need to gather in the swirling mist.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\">To determine the next car that the characters enter, roll on the Random Car table. Once a car is visited, reroll if its number is rolled when the characters visit subsequent cars.</span></p><p class=\"p22\"><span class=\"s14\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.n17REsHJpkanK7iV]{Random Car}</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p5\">The Random Car table doesn’t include the Passenger Car (area G1), which is always at the back, and the Tender (area G8), which is always at the front and can only be accessed once all six of the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aEPVMByT2COU30KF]{Wayward Haints}</strong><span class=\"s12\">*</span> have been saved or destroyed.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\"><em><strong>Level Up.</strong></em> The characters reach 2nd level, if they are still at 1st level, after they save or destroy three wayward haints.</span></p></div>"

He is happy to spare a moment to answer any questions the characters may have (see “The Vagrant” section earlier in this chapter) and offers the following:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">He warns the characters of the presence of haints within some of the train cars, admitting that—while he wishes he could do more to help them on their way—he doesn’t mind their presence.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">He tells the characters not to open exterior doors or windows, which keep out dangerous spiritual mist.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">He suggests they might enjoy the company of two more lively travelers on board: Phillip and Adela Druskenvald.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s11\">He then excuses himself to his cab in the Ghostlight Locomotive, which is attached to the Tender (area G8).

He simply and calmly explains the situation and asks for their assistance. Despite his voice coming from the train car itself, he converses with characters from his cab in the locomotive. Use the information below to guide the conversation with the Vagrant:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">The shadowy stowaway they just fought let the misty Shroud into the train, which corrupts spirits.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">There are six haints aboard who are more prone to corruption, which is dangerous, as they are the base source of the ghost train’s fuel.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s11\">The haints must be released from the train before they can be corrupted, either by resolving the unfinished business from life that fetters them or by destroying them if necessary (see “Unfettering a Haint” above).</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Once the haints are released one way or the other, the characters should check the Tender (area G8) for any corruption, as it contains the train’s fuel stores.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The Vagrant must stay in his cab to keep any lingering Shroud mist from the locomotive.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The Vagrant asks the characters not to alarm Phillip and Adela Druskenvald if they run into them. “Ain’t no call to rile up the Lord and Lady over a scuffle.”</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">With one final crackle, the Vagrant’s voice fades from the Passenger Car, and the characters can’t interact with him again until later (see “Off the Spectral Rails” later in the chapter). The characters can begin their journey through the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s11\"><em><strong>Lingering Curse.</strong></em> After the battle, characters who succeed on a [[/check PRC DC 13]] check notice wisps of ghastly blue-green mist shot through with black root-like veins lingering in the air—remnants of the clouds that billowed in. The mist slowly snakes forward and slinks under the forward vestibule door. It can’t be dispersed or affected in any way, and they lose sight of it once it slips away. This is the lingering curse of the Phantom Trainhopper that aims to reach the Tender (see area G8) to corrupt the fuel of the Ghostlight Locomotive.</span></p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/10-1_Passenger_Car.webp\" /></div>"

Once the Vagrant empties three Soul Cans into the firebox, the Ghostlight Locomotive suddenly roars with ghastly power and breaks free, sending the remaining three Soul Cans flying. Roll initiative!

Once a quiet town cradled by endless cornfields, now these fields devour any who dares enter. They belong to Raum, the Harvest Terror—a demonic scarecrow with the head of a crow, cursed with an insatiable hunger for secrets. His very being is nourished by forbidden truths, yet he doesn’t merely feed on them. He weaves them into chaos, turning neighbor against neighbor, sowing discord as effortlessly as seeds. Only the destruction of Raum can save this once-peaceful town.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>East of Wickermoor Village lies the town of Foxwillow, known far and wide as the breadbasket of Wickermoor Hollow. The people of this idyllic town are friendly, rural folk. They worship the Patient Lady, dutifully tend to the fields, help one another, and never speak ill of other souls… to their faces, at least. But evil lurks below the façade.</p><p>Secret resentments have multiplied in recent months, darkening Foxwillow like the shadow cast by a murder of crows. People have grown suspicious of others, certain their neighbors harbor vile secrets. Crops have failed (sparing only the corn), insects swarm, and cattle waste away and die, while the Foxwillow folk blame each other for negligence, laziness, and stupidity.</p><p>It began six months ago when Ol’ Jericho Sticks disappeared. A living scarecrow, Jericho had wandered Foxwillow for generations, crafting effigies for the fields and singing as evening fell. When he vanished into the corn, no trace of him remained. Whispers of murder spread, and hidden grudges tore the town apart.</p><p>As blame grew, the crops withered—except for the cornfields to the east. Worse still, more townsfolk disappeared, their places taken by grotesque scarecrow effigies (see “The Harvest Terror” later in this chapter).</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Foxwillow is a haunted husk of a town. None dare trust enough to band together, nor is anyone brave enough to venture into the corn where the lost have vanished. Characters drawn to the town by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p>Venture to Foxwillow with the quest-giver, William Lodge.</p></li><li><p>Stop the survivors in Foxwillow from turning on each other.</p></li><li><p>Offer secrets to Raum (their own, or secrets learned within Foxwillow) to gain entrance to the demonic corn maze demiplane known as the Fields of the Crow.</p></li><li><p>Survive the dangers of the Fields of the Crow and find Raum.</p></li><li><p>Destroy Raum, the Harvest Terror.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Raum, the key NPC, to infuse his menace throughout. A casual reading of the Foxwillow locations helps when you improvise interactions. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “The Wicked Harvest,” ensures a smooth and gripping final encounter.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 4th level characters.</p></div>"

The scarecrow, a wandering tunesmith, held a secret inside of him, literally and figuratively: a crow demon lurked within Jericho’s straw-stuffed body and was the true and terrible power that gave him life.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Raum_and_Jericho.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><h2>Ol’ Jericho Sticks</h2><p>Jericho was a haunted scarecrow—but a friendly one. He traipsed about the farmlands around Foxwillow, singing songs to drown out the sounds of sorrow within him. The people of Foxwillow loved the straw-stuffed drifter who wove through the rows of straw and stover, serenading the fieldhands on his banjo as they worked.</p><p>But eventually, even music was not enough to resist the voice inside his head. As the decades passed, the demon that Jericho called “Virgil” grew in power and slowly spread his discord to the people of Foxwillow. As a result, the townsfolk became more suspicious of him, filling the scarecrow with increasing self-doubt. Virgil preyed on this uncertainty, manipulating the wounded psyche of his host until Jericho gave in to the whispers.</p><p>When Jericho realized the demon inside him was gaining control, he retreated into the cornfields to keep his beloved Foxwillowers safe. Tragically, the struggle was short. His soul was devoured by Virgil, and the two merged into a new demon in the crumpled scarecrow body. He is now Raum, the Harvest Terror, a crow-like Fiend with a body of straw and rusted metal.</p><h2>The Scourge of Foxwillow</h2><p>Raum <em>(rah-OOM)</em> loves to destroy all that Jericho loved to create. He stalks the rural lands of eastern Wickermoor Hollow, wielding sharp blades and sharper words to drive fear into the hearts of all who live there. He takes special glee in luring people from Jericho’s beloved Foxwillow into his demiplane of endless corn mazes, the Fields of the Crow, to steal their bodies, souls, and secrets.</p><p>Jericho is gone forever, but tiny scraps of his kindly consciousness still cling like rotten flesh to Raum’s vile bones. If the characters learn the tender secrets of Ol’ Jericho Sticks, what’s left of him fights back and aids them (see “Gathering Information” and “The Wicked Harvest” later in this chapter).</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/MAP_41_Relationship_chart_crows.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><h2>Raum’s Curse</h2><p>Raum feeds on secrets and delights in destruction. Learning secrets sustains him and grants him greater power. Not only do they increase his demonic magic, but they also empower him to manipulate mortal hearts. He has two primary means of harvesting secrets:</p><p><strong>Black-Feathered Spies.</strong> Murders of crows gaze hungrily upon Foxwillow in numbers great enough to make bare trees look flush with black leaves when they gather. They are always listening, waiting to report back bits of information to Raum.</p><p><strong>Gateway to the Stalks.</strong> The second method is the gateway to the Fields of the Crow. All who approach it of their own free will are addressed by Raum directly. They are bidden to sacrifice a damning secret if they wish to gain entry to Raum’s domain. This sacrifice empowers Raum’s game statistics (see “The Wicked Harvest” at the end of this chapter). At your discretion, this secret sparks nasty rumors about the character who divulged it back in Foxwillow and Wickermoor Village.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter13_Foxwillow.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p> </p></div></div>"

Martha is at her wits’ end and inadvertently started a brawl in the Old Windmill (see “Foxwillow in Flames” later in this chapter) while William was out of town seeking aid.</p><h3><strong>Changing Martha’s Attitude</strong></h3><p>Despite the horrors occurring at her doorstep, Martha is easy to befriend.

She was a difficult child who played over-competitively with the other children and enjoyed morbid practical jokes to peeve her unpleasant father, like hiding rat carcasses in his boots overnight. Jericho was her best friend because she had a hard time making friends with other kids her age.</p><p>As she grew older, Adelaide’s antisocial behavior deepened. Jericho vanished on her twenty-fifth birthday, and ever since, she’s wandered into the cornfields after her nightly work, only returning when it’s time for bed. Some whisper she killed Jericho, while others claim she’s searching for her only friend. None who followed her into the corn have ever returned.</p><p>Three weeks after Jericho’s disappearance, she found him—now the monstrous, crow-headed demon, Raum. The Harvest Terror spoke with Jericho’s voice, calling himself her best friend, vowing to love her if she revealed her secrets. She confessed witnessing her father’s abuse and her mother’s fatal act.</p><p>The demon Raum told her that he is an angel sent to reveal the evil secrets in Foxwillow. Confused, but seduced by his words, Adelaide has spent recent months gathering secrets and luring folks into the cornfields, where Raum spirits them away to wander forever in the Fields of the Crow.</p><h3><strong>Changing Adelaide’s Attitude</strong></h3><p>Adelaide is fully in Raum’s thrall. She can’t be swayed from being hostile toward the characters.</p><h3><strong>Adelaide’s Secret</strong></h3><p>In her communion with Raum, Adelaide has learned William’s secret—that her brother Isaac is really her half-brother. She’s been manipulated into believing that her mother’s infidelity and her half-brother’s birth are the real causes of her fear and suffering in childhood. She was goaded by Raum into murdering Isaac, and she hid his corpse in the basement of the Old Windmill (area J1), where it is incubating a demonic servant of the Harvest Terror.</p><p><em><strong>Learning Her Secret.</strong></em> Adelaide’s murderous secret is revealed when the characters find her brother’s corpse in the Windmill Cellar (area J9b).

As Foxwillow’s butcher, he’s often seen in a bloodstained apron striding through town. His signature platform shoes, worn to keep his feet dry from pigs’ blood, earned him the nickname “Heels.” His only daughter, Liza, has gone missing in recent nights.</p><p>Though he’s truly not responsible for all Foxwillow’s ills, Jonah has been on edge lately, burdened by guilt over the town’s curse and the disappearance of his daughter. In a fit of rage, he cursed William Lodge, and his shame has made him antagonistic toward his neighbors (see “Foxwillow in Flames” later in this chapter).</p><p><strong>Changing Jonah’s Attitude</strong></p><p>Suspicious by nature, Jonah is difficult to befriend. If characters talk with him about breaking the curse, he asks if they think whoever caused the curse was evil, or just misguided. His attitude increases one step to friendly if they say they’ll be sympathetic to the curse-maker or that they’ll keep an eye out for Liza. If they suggest that they’ll kill the person who cursed Foxwillow, he becomes fearful and hostile, refusing to speak at length.</p><h3><strong>Jonah’s Secret</strong></h3><p>Jonah has harbored resentment for William Lodge for years, though he no longer recalls why. By all accounts, William is well-liked and even sells livestock to the butcher.

He had developed an especially intense dislike of manual labor after apprenticing as a butcher under Jonah Sawyer in his youth.

He was trying to convince his sister Adelaide to skip town with him when she killed him.</p><p><em><strong>Learning His Secret.</strong></em> Isaac’s duplicitous secret is revealed when the characters find his secret cache under a floorboard in the Hooded Lantern (area J4).</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_ADV_FIELDSOFTHECROW_Demon%20of%20secrets.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><h2>Scarecrow Townsfolk</h2><p>Most of Foxwillow’s people have vanished, lost in the Fields of the Crow. Their bodies, twisted under Raum’s control, are now grotesque scarecrows—burlap stuffed with straw and pumpkin heads carved into haunting mockeries of their former faces. Their spirits, however, are doomed to wander the endless maze of cornstalks. Only Raum’s destruction frees the lost spirits and turns the scarecrows back into people.</p><p>These scarecrows litter the town, sitting slumped in homes and shops, grim reminders of those they replaced. Descriptions of several scarecrows are found in each area.</p><h3><strong>Jumpscarecrow!</strong></h3><p>If the investigation of the town is slowing down, [[/r 1d3]] <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Jj23zmBla6ZrN6po]{Pumpkin Heads}</strong>* spring to life and attack.

If a pumpkin head is reduced to 0 hit points by fire damage (burning the body) or bludgeoning damage (squashing the pumpkin head), the mortal body is also destroyed in a similarly gruesome way when it reverts back to its original human form after Raum is defeated. Other types of damage typically just muss the straw or burlap, leaving the mortal body with scars but no lasting wounds once reverted.</p></div>"

Jeremiah asks William to repeat it and pleads with the characters to listen. William Lodge is a salt-of-the-earth, middle-aged farmer with a folksy accent and an earnest love for his village in his eyes. He lives on one of the failing farms on the outskirts of town, so he doesn’t know the whole story, but he explains what has happened as best he knows it,</p><ul><li><p>Ol’ Jericho Sticks, the living, singing scarecrow, vanished from town six months ago. Ever since, townsfolk have been accusing one another of murdering the beloved handyman and songster. (If asked for more information on Jericho, William explains that no one knows how the friendly strawman came to be, but he’s been beloved by Foxwillow since before William was born.)</p></li><li><p>After a few months, no one in town trusted each other, and recently everything started going wrong. All crops but the corn failed, livestock withered and died, and strange sigils started appearing in the cornfields.</p></li><li><p>Then, only weeks ago, townsfolk began going missing, seemingly replaced by mysterious scarecrows.</p></li><li><p>Hardly anyone is left in Foxwillow, and most everyone has barricaded themselves inside their houses. No one sets their suspicions aside to work together.</p></li></ul><p>Jeremiah explains that while the farmers of Wickermoor Village produce as much food as possible, they still rely on the grain Foxwillow produces to feed the town. If the characters break the curse upon Foxwillow, save its people, and salvage the harvest, Jeremiah rallies the town to chip in and pay them each [[/award 50gp]].</p><p>If Phillip Druskenvald is with the characters at the time or learns of the request from them later, he offers to match the [[/award 50gp]] from his own funds and says he wants to take a more active role in helping the people of Wickermoor Hollow since it’s technically his responsibility as Lord of Druskenvald.</p><p>If the characters have more questions, William says he’ll be happy to talk about the villagers and the specifics while they travel, offering passage on his horse-drawn cart; it’ll take them a couple nights to reach Foxwillow, so there’ll be plenty of time.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter13_Scarecrow.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p> </p></div></div>"

William turns to you, eyes wide with horror, and pleads, “By the Lady! Please save Foxwillow!”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The brawlers are all scarecrows of the townsfolk dressed in their clothes and with eerie carved or painted faces (see “Scarecrow Townsfolk,” earlier in this chapter), though their pumpkin heads are obscured by hair, hats, or bonnets from a distance. Characters can scrutinize the townsfolk and discern what the scarecrows are with a successful [[/check PRC DC 13]] check. A character within 5 feet of a brawler sees the truth automatically.</p><p>The solution to ending this brawl is to save the people who started it: Martha Langtree and Jonah Sawyer. They’re fighting in the Old Windmill (see “The Burning Mill”). Likewise, the town continues to burn until the windmill fire is put out.</p><p>The characters are under no obligation to stop the fight or put out the fires, but William urges them to help and mentions the pump west of the town square (see “Getting Water” below). It’s a good idea, too: they have an easier time entering the Fields of the Crow and finding Raum if they’ve met Martha.</p><h2>Navigating the Brawl</h2><p>Using map 13.1, the characters must pass through Magpie Square (area J2) to reach the Old Windmill (area J1). Each brawling townsperson is a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Jj23zmBla6ZrN6po]{Pumpkin Head}</strong>* animated by Raum’s demonic influence.</p><p>The scarecrows exclusively fight each other unless their attention is drawn by casting a spell, attacking one of the pumpkin heads, or putting out the fires in areas J5 and J8. During this event, scarecrows are found in:</p><p><strong>Magpie Square (area J2): </strong>Three pumpkin heads hurl each other about and kick up the mud in the streets, making the town square difficult terrain.</p><p><strong>General Store (area J5): </strong>Two pumpkin heads toss bottles and bags of cornmeal while the building burns around them. A creature that ends its turn in the store takes [[/damage 1d4 fire]]{2 (1d4)} fire damage.</p><p><strong>Town Hall (area J8): </strong>Three pumpkin heads smash chairs over each other. The fire hasn’t spread past the roof yet.</p><p>The scarecrows in other areas of town are inanimate.</p><h2>Firefighting</h2><p>Fire is raging in the General Store (area J5) and the Town Hall (area J8). If these buildings aren’t doused, the fire spreads through the densely packed town square and burns Foxwillow (and all the scarecrows in it) to the ground.</p><h3><strong>Putting Out a Fire</strong></h3><p>Putting out the fire in areas J5 and J8 requires at least 10 gallons of water to be hurled on each area’s blaze.</p><h3><strong>Getting Water</strong></h3><p>The best way to put out these fires is by casting the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.a3XtAO5n2GrqiAh5]{Create or Destroy Water}</em> spell or using other magic that creates water. There is also a water pump west of Magpie Square (area J2). William assists the characters by operating the pump to fill buckets of water. Characters who grab a filled bucket can take an action to douse an area’s flames with 1 gallon of water.</p><h3><strong>Drawing Attention</strong></h3><p>Putting out a fire causes all the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Jj23zmBla6ZrN6po]{Pumpkin Heads}</strong>* in that area to attack the characters responsible.</p></div>"

The outer edge of this cornfield is a supernatural border; everything within is a nightmarish, demonic demiplane that morphs according to Raum’s whims.</p><h2>Entering the Cornfield</h2><p>The Fields of the Crow are guarded by a looming and impenetrable wall of stalks. When approached, two large, orange eyes with pupils in the shape of four-pointed stars appear through the stalks and a raspy, croaking voice whispers:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>“Lay bare your secrets. Lighten your burden. Do this and you may enter my land of dreams.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>If a character tries to force their way through, they push into the corn only to find themselves emerging from the same spot they entered. The thing in the rows laughs gratingly and repeats its offer after the character is forced out. The thing recoils if attacked and retreats into the stalks for 1 hour, after which it returns to repeat its offer to any who approach.</p><h3><strong>Dark Wings, Dark Words</strong></h3><p>The cornrows are entered by revealing a dark, personal secret to the presence lurking within, or by slipping through with another who paid in secrets before the threshold seals. Sharing the secret feeds Raum, granting him greater strength and control over the character (see “The Wicked Harvest\" later in this chapter).</p><p>Those who share someone else’s secret can also enter. This grants Raum extra power, but no control over the character.</p><h3><strong>Sneaking In</strong></h3><p>When someone enters the Fields of the Crow, the stalks remain open for them, and only them, for up to 1 minute. However, those who make a successful [[/check STE DC 18]] check slip through unnoticed by Raum. If this check fails, they are ejected from the corn as described earlier.</p><h2>Fields of the Crow Features</h2><p>The Fields of the Crow have the following features:</p><p><strong>Impenetrable Boundary.</strong> The Fields of the Crow is a hellish corn maze. Trying to push through or damage the stalks causes the wind to howl and the stalks to thrash at the intruder. The stalks have immunity to all damage, and if the intruder is within 5 feet of the stalks, they are pushed 10 feet away and must make a [[/save STR DC 13]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 3d6 bludgeoning]]{10 (3d6)} bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Infinite Stalks.</strong> Corn stalks grow as tall as redwoods, and creatures that fly can soar upward forever and never reach the top. Despite constantly moving upward, every time a flying creature reaches 120 feet above the ground, they are suddenly 60 feet above the ground.</p><p><strong>Lighting. </strong>A nightmarish swirl of orange clouds stretches like writhing tendrils from an orange harvest moon that fills half the sky and obscures the stars. The entire area is bathed in dim light, tinged pumpkin-orange by the moon.</p><p><strong>Sounds of Murder.</strong> Hollow echoes of thousands of overlapping cawing crows fill the area.</p><h2>Navigating the Maze</h2><p>When the characters enter the Fields of the Crow, Raum’s voice rings out upon the wind:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>“Such strong wills have entered the rows. I can feel your souls struggle to cling to your flesh. Now you scurry like rats in a maze. No more than three creeping hours until you are lost forever. Come to me in the heart of the fields. Feed me your secrets and drift into eternal sleep.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>After entering the demonic realm of Raum, the characters experience a reality warp into a waking nightmare as they are trapped in an infinite corn maze. They must reach the center of the maze to find and destroy Raum. Along the way, they find wandering spirits of the people of Foxwillow. Destroying Raum saves these spirits, but freeing them from their listless wandering grants the characters boons in the final confrontation.</p><h3><strong>Time Pressure</strong></h3><p>While in the Fields of the Crow, the characters feel, with growing dread, their sense of self slowly slipping away. After three hours, the characters’ souls are ripped from their bodies, condemned to wander the Fields of the Crow for eternity. Their bodies transform into scarecrows, forever trapped in Foxwillow. This could mark the end of the campaign—unless a path to salvation remains. Perhaps a new band of adventurers is introduced, guided by the willful spirits of the fallen, or the Crooked Man, acting for the Crooked Queen, offers salvation at a dreadful price.</p><h3><strong>Which Way?</strong></h3><p>This maze has no map. Instead, those lost inside must choose the correct path at three Junctions to reach Raum. Each Junction is a 50-foot-radius clearing with three new paths to choose from: Left, Right, or Center. To discover which path is correct, a successful [[/check PRC DC 18]] check allows the characters to discern which path has the loudest cawing of crows. On a failure, they only learn which path is the quietest (narrowing their options down to two). If the check fails by 5 or more, the crass cacophony of the crows surrounds them, making it impossible to discern the paths. The correct order of paths to follow is:</p><ul><li><p><strong>First Junction:</strong> Left Path</p></li><li><p><strong>Second Junction:</strong> Right Path</p></li><li><p><strong>Third Junction:</strong> Left Path</p></li></ul><p>When the characters enter the maze, they travel through the winding, 5-foot-wide paths of the maze for 10 minutes before reaching a Junction with three paths and a random encounter (see “Random Encounters” below). If they choose the wrong path at any Junction, they wander for 10 minutes before reaching a Dead End (also a 50-foot radius clearing in the corn maze and a random encounter). They must then backtrack to the last Junction to choose again.</p><p>If they choose the correct path, they wind through the corn maze for 10 minutes before reaching the next Junction. When they choose the correct path from the Third Junction, they travel for 10 minutes before reaching the center of the maze. See “The Wicked Harvest,” for the final battle against Raum.</p><h3><strong>Random Encounters</strong></h3><p>Each time the characters enter a Junction or Dead End for the first time, roll once on the Cornfield Encounters table and once on the Cornfield Environment table below to determine what creatures are in that Junction or Dead End and what environmental effects are in play. Roll again if you roll a result that’s already been used. After all encounters and environments have been rolled, any further random encounter results in a Crowstorm with Disorienting Crowsong.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_FIELDS_FILLER.webp\" alt=\"\" /><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.iOAphQmx4wgwdntu]{Cornfield Encounters}</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Controlled by Secrets.</strong></em> Adelaide Langtree (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.IY9xoFINnJsrOXll]{Corvodaemon}</strong>*) is here.

Only one demon attacks the spirit each turn, and they only use their Feeding Frenzy action when attacking the spirit; the other demon focuses on the characters.

All that’s left to be done is disintegration. All that remains is annihilation.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\"><em><strong>- Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p4\">The Wytchwood bows to the Crooked Queen. At its heart stands a Crooked Tree, a barren oak that thirsts for revenge. The deposed queen need only wait a little longer. Her patience wears thin, and her old wounds still fester. It is in this dark wood that desperate bargains and sacrifices will be made, and only fate can tell the true cost.</p><p class=\"p6\">Now, Phillip Druskenvald, once the most powerful being in all the land, moves toward his sealed fate and certain doom. The final reckoning of Druskenvald is at hand, and the land itself holds its breath.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The end is coming to Druskenvald. With the sacrifices of the Fallen and the Lord of Fools, the Horned King is primed for his hellish birth, his influence now spreading beyond the tree line of the Wytchwood. At the gnarled forest’s heart, the Crooked Queen calls Phillip Druskenvald to her barrow so she may exact her vengeance and bring about the annihilation she has craved for millennia.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">The blazing ritual and massacre atop Rowan’s Rise have caused great turmoil within Wickermoor Village. With so many lost, townsfolk are looking for salvation. This is especially true of Phillip Druskenvald, who lost the love of his life to the burning Wicker Man and is now desperate to return her to life. He does not yet know that Adela’s soul is bound to Kehlenn as the final sacrifice needed for her escape from her tomb and prison.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">In his grief, Phillip has sequestered himself away in the Green Queen Inn. Now out of options, he desperately hopes to use the primeval magic of the Old Ways to bring his beloved back to him. This is doomed to fail, and the lord of the land will be utterly powerless. In his lowest moment, Phillip will finally hear Kehlenn’s call and will answer.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The time for the final confrontation with Kehlenn has come. Her vengeful designs have all worked toward this moment to ensnare Phillip within the Crooked Tree and transform him into the Horned King. Unless the characters stop the ritual, her consort will ascend to godhood, the Crooked Queen will be free, and all of Druskenvald will be annihilated and experience a horrid, crooked rebirth. Characters who enter the Wytchwood following the Quest Hooks later in the chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Search the forest for Phillip Druskenvald.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Defeat the Horned King, and prevent the Crooked Queen from returning.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Perform a sacrificial ritual to sever Kehlenn’s bonds with Druskenvald forever.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Before running this chapter, consider the wants, goals, and connections of the characters to present them with the most alluring offers from the Horned King. Reviewing the final battle, “Born King,” will help create a climactic and terrifying final encounter. Finally, refreshing yourself on the details of the setting and history of Druskenvald, as well as the key NPCs of the adventure, particularly Kehlenn and Phillip Druskenvald (see chapters 1 and 8), will ensure a satisfying and cathartic finale for <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">This chapter is designed for four level 13 characters.</p></div>"

          "name": "A Clash of Kings and Queens",
          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap24\"><p class=\"h1 section\">A Clash of Kings and Queens</p><p>Only three pivotal figures remain in this final climax: Kehlenn, the Horned King, and Phillip Druskenvald. Each represents a key fury in the characters’ journey through Wickermoor Hollow, their fates intertwined in the struggle for Druskenvald’s soul.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Kehlenn.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">In ages past, Kehlenn once ruled the domain now known as Druskenvald as an archfey goddess called the Green Queen. Her world of rebirth allowed for no sapient life, and reborn souls existed only in the wild flora and fauna. This new life was always brutal, short, and filled with terror, but wholly natural as she saw it.</p><p class=\"p6\">This untouched world of green changed forever when Phillip Druskenvald arrived. How he found her and where he received the power to depose her, she never learned, but it was not long before she was reduced to a pile of bones in a barrow and a weakened fey spirit bound to a single tree.</p><p class=\"p6\">As Phillip remade the domain in his image, Kehlenn remained. As Phillip forgot the violent conflict that usurped her, Kehlenn remembered. And with each passing year, her slow recovery from the crushing defeat brought greater awareness of the hubris of the man who named her domain after himself.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">She powerlessly witnessed the vile desecration of her once-green world with the introduction of sapient life using her stolen power. The resulting hatred consumed her entire being, and over the millennia, she was twisted into the Crooked Queen, a moniker she now bears with spiteful pride.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">The moment she has waited eons for has finally arrived. The sacrifices required to bring an end to Phillip Druskenvald and reclaim the power he stole from her have come to fruition, one after the other, just as she had planned for so long. All that remains is for Phillip to kneel, and she will remake him just like he remade her precious domain.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>All Will Be Crooked</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Kehlenn’s freedom is nothing short of apocalyptic. She seeks not only to reclaim Druskenvald but to reshape it in her twisted image. Her eons of solitude and imprisonment have spoiled her once-green nature and transformed her into vengeance incarnate.</p><p class=\"p6\">While she once sought to restore the natural cycle of life, death, and rebirth, she now only seeks the total annihilation of Druskenvald. Her ultimate goal is the corruption and disintegration of every sapient being, returning them to nature as she now defines it. She plans to rebirth them into crooked mockeries of what they once were—to live a terrifying, painful, and short life before perishing and being reborn to experience their horrible existence over and over again for eternity.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">Now that the final stages of the Crooked Queen’s plan are in motion, there is no need for subterfuge, and Kehlenn has no interest in hiding her intentions. She will be honest with the characters, offering up her tale to persuade them to see her side of the story and turn them against Phillip in his final agonizing moments as a parting knife in the back.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">The Horned King</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">The Horned King is Kehlenn’s cruel and powerful creation, made from sin itself. Through temptation and desire, he seeks to corrupt souls and bring about her vengeance. He is a monstrous shade of Phillip Druskenvald himself, woven from fragments of his very soul. This terrible entity intends to replace the lord of the land and sit at the right hand of his Crooked Queen.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">The Horned King remains bound within the Wytchwood, his incorporeal form unable to cross its borders. Yet with the sacrifice of the Lord of Fools, his influence has begun to creep into the lands beyond. He bides his time, stalking the forest and whispering temptations throughout Wickermoor Hollow, slowly ensnaring its inhabitants.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">The Horned King is subtle in his methods. His greatest pleasure lies in softly seducing the most disciplined and pious souls—those who believe themselves above vice—into giving in to their hidden desires. His whispers are a constant pressure, a slow unraveling of restraint. The more they resist, the deeper his influence burrows, until even the most virtuous souls find themselves standing before their own corruptive acts.</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">At the command of his Crooked Queen, the Horned King seeks to achieve physical form through the possession and metamorphosis of Phillip Druskenvald. After consuming Phillip’s soul and becoming corporeal, he plans to leave Wickermoor Hollow and siphon the energies of all of Druskenvald. If not stopped, he will use this immense power to finally free his queen from her prison to remake the domain in her crooked image.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Phillip Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Phillip Druskenvald is a broken man at his lowest point. He is consumed by guilt, desperation, and the agonizing pain of loss following the death of Adela. Despite having fallen for Kehlenn’s trap and acting as the architect of his own downfall, he is still filled with the misguided belief that he can somehow control or undo what he has set in motion.</p><p class=\"p6\">This mindset is what has led him to seek the power of the Old Ways. His forward-thinking obsession with progress and the future has brought him nothing but destruction, so his last hope lies with the primeval powers that existed before he brought civilization to the domain. However, his attempts to harness this power to resurrect Adela in the Green Queen Inn have failed, shattering him further.</p><p class=\"p6\">This humbled husk of a man is whom Kehlenn calls out to once the ritual fails, her whispers laced with the promises to return Adela’s soul and her life. With no further options before him, Phillip set off into the Wytchwood to seek the Crooked Queen in the desperate hope he can finally make things right. Like a sacrificial lamb, he is oblivious to his imminent slaughter and the ritualistic power his death will provide.</p></div>"

However, knowing that Phillip vanished after discovering Adela’s charred remains within the Wicker Man—hearing from villagers that he has locked himself away within the Green Queen Inn—may prompt them to seek him out.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">The Last Hope</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Wickermoor Village has been thrown into chaos in the aftermath of the massacre on the moors. The revelation that many townsfolk were behind the dreadful events has left the village divided and in disarray. Unrest simmers and power structures unravel. Some cling to old superstitions, while others look for new leadership, each with their own interpretation of what has happened and what must be done to make things right.</p><p class=\"p6\">If Mayor Somerton survived the events on Rowan’s Rise and did not fall in league with the nefarious cultists of the Old Ways, the panicked townsfolk blame him for everything that has happened and swiftly turn on him, imprisoning or even killing him. If Constable Doris Squire still lives, she is powerless to bring order to the chaos, disheartened by the evident betrayal of Deputy Howie Butterman.</p><p class=\"p6\">The characters may find themselves drawn into this turmoil, as various people vie for their favor or assistance. But nothing is more pressing than discovering the fate of Phillip Druskenvald. Some want him captured and punished for bringing suffering and death to Wickermoor Hollow. Others want him rescued, viewing him as the only possible authority figure that can prevent Wickermoor Village from falling to anarchy. Both sides implore the characters to investigate.</p><p class=\"p6\">After a brief inquiry, some townsfolk claim to have seen Phillip Druskenvald stumbling into the Green Queen Inn—his face pale and his eyes haunted.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chaos Reigns</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">If the characters choose to delay or ignore the rising threat of the Crooked Queen, time becomes their greatest enemy. The longer they wait, the stronger the Horned King’s influence grows. One by one, villagers begin to fall to their vices. Pure bedlam and pandemonium are but a few short nights away as even the most disciplined, chastened, and restrained people give in to their basest desires.</p><p class=\"p6\">The townsfolk that the characters confront discover the evil impulses that had once lain dormant in the corrupted villagers’ hearts. They also learn that the common thread among them was that all of them heard the seductive whispers of a three-eyed beast that stalks the dark woods. Those who confess and admit their transgressions, deeply shamed, plead with the characters to discover what is happening and put an end to it.</p></div>"

After Adela’s death, this tome became his last hope.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">Even with his shattered psyche, Phillip correctly deduced the location of the ancient book and performed the terrible rite within. The endeavor failed and opened the door to Phillip’s mind, welcoming Kehlenn in. Following the botched resurrection, the Crooked Queen sent a vision that implied the possession of Adela’s soul and the willingness to return her if he would only find her in the Wytchwood. Phillip immediately left the inn to find Kehlenn’s resting place beneath the Crooked Tree.</span></p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap24 middle-page\"><p class=\"h2\">Into the Dark Woods</p><p>The Wytchwood is a two-night trek from Wickermoor Village across the moors to the north. In his grief-stricken journey, Phillip has left an unmasked trail, not caring who might follow. The characters venture into the forest with one goal: to find the Crooked Tree, where Phillip has gone to confront the Crooked Queen.</p><p class=\"p6\">When the characters enter the Wytchwood, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The moment you step into the wood, darkness and quiet surround you. The pine and fir trees before you bend subtly at odd angles in an endless expanse that feels truly ancient.</strong></em></p></blockquote><h2><span class=\"s5\">Tracking Phillip</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The characters can follow the messy trail left by Phillip with relative ease. Upon first entering the Wytchwood and after each encounter until the characters arrive at the Crooked Tree, a character can make a [[/check SUR DC 13]] check to find muddy footprints, crushed pine needles, and snapped branches, which lead to the next encounter after an hour of travel. A character has Advantage on this check after an encounter if any of the characters successfully found Phillip’s Clue (see “Wytchwood Encounters” later in this chapter). Characters will always experience the encounters in order, and they always are at least one hour of travel through the wood apart.</p><p class=\"p6\">If the check fails, the characters lose the trail and wander for one hour until they are attacked by monstrous denizens of the forest. Roll on the Hungry Woods table to determine what creatures attack.</p><p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s12\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.PS4TYAewIXVGPtck]{Hungry Woods}</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p5\">After the characters defeat the attacking creatures, they may repeat the check to continue tracking Phillip. On a success, they proceed to the next encounter after an hour of travel. On a failure, they wander for another hour and are attacked by the monsters of the Wytchwood once more.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">On Cloven Hoof</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Horned King stalks the Wytchwood, an incorporeal spirit unable to take physical form until his unholy union with Phillip Druskenvald. His arrival is signaled by the snapping of branches under an enormous bulk, the rumbling of earth from heavy footfalls, and the hot, putrid breath of a huge panting beast.</p><p class=\"p6\">His form is that of a massive black goat with three ruby-red eyes. While stalking the characters, he never fully reveals himself, always keeping just beyond sight. The characters might catch glimpses of a bloody eye, some shaggy black hair, or a jagged gray horn between the trees.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Within Temptation</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">While the characters are traveling between encounters (see “Wytchwood Encounters” later in this chapter), the Horned King will make his presence known and call out in a low, rumbling, and seductive voice. His goal is to pry into the characters’ hearts to determine what they truly desire, erode confidence in their mission, plant seeds of doubt in their allies, and elicit curiosity for what he can truly offer them. To properly persuade the characters, have the Horned King visit them two or more times before Encounter 4.</p><p class=\"p6\">As a Study action, a character can gauge the intentions behind the Horned King’s words with a successful [[/check INS DC 18]] check. They sense that, while his words are carefully measured, he is earnest about learning their true desires and offering them what they want, but for a clearly ulterior purpose.</p><p class=\"p6\">The Horned King never answers the characters’ questions outright and continues to steer the conversation to the things they crave most, especially vices. Those who demand gifts or bargains are denied until he makes his final offer (see “Live Deliciously” later in this chapter).</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Impotent Wrath.</strong></em> Any attempts to engage the Horned King in combat are futile, but he won’t vanish simply because of an attempted ranged attack or spell. Any character who attempts to initiate combat with the Horned King before the final confrontation (see “Born King” later in this chapter) must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 18]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[frightened apply=false] for one minute. While frightened in this way, the character must drop whatever they’re holding, use their action to Dash, and use their movement to run away from the Horned King after being filled with the dread of what lurks in the hearts of mortals.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter24_On_Cloven_Hoof.webp\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p></p></div></div><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Conferring with the Horned King</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The Horned King thrives on sin and desire, with the power to turn mortals toward corruption (see “The Horned King” earlier in this chapter). He initiates conversations with questions that play into the characters’ wants, fears, and struggles in hopes to tempt them. Some example responses include:</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/MAP_35_Crooked%20Tree%20Flowchart.webp\" width=\"300\" /><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">“Why do you carry such a heavy burden alone? There are easier paths.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Do you wish to suffer forever? The pain can end with a spoken word.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Do you truly believe you have all the answers? There are many secrets yet to discover.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Why do you rush toward your fate? There is peace in letting time pass you by.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Why do you struggle against the inevitable? Lay down your weary head and rest.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Would you like to live deliciously? Life need not be filled with tragedy and loss.”</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">If asked questions by the characters, his answers are cryptic and always drive toward temptation. Use the following to guide responses if the characters speak with the Horned King:</p><p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>Who are you?</strong> I am he who stalks the deepest woods and darkest hearts. I am in the heart of every mortal. I am the very thing you desire most. I am the Horned King, consort of she who watches from the Crooked Tree.</span></p><p class=\"p14\"><strong>What do you want from us?</strong> I ask for nothing besides friendship and loyalty. And in exchange, I offer you the means to live deliciously. You come to my woods burdened, and I offer to alleviate that which weighs down your soul.</p><p class=\"p14\"><strong>Why should we trust you?</strong> Trust? You need not trust me to see the truth in my words. You need only walk the path I tender.</p><p class=\"p14\"><strong>What do you know of the Crooked Queen?</strong> She is the first, and she shall be the last. There is nothing but the forest. There is nothing but my queen.</p><p class=\"p14\"><strong>What of Phillip?</strong> He is an honored guest in these woods and has been given safe passage.</p><p class=\"p14\"><strong>What happens if we refuse you?</strong> It is your choice, but not one to be made lightly. Refuse, and nothing will protect you from what is to come. Accept, and you may find comfort and succor.</p></div>"

His low, seductive voice calls forth once more. “You have come so far, but for what? Tell me, what is it you truly seek? What does your heart desire? It shall be yours, and so much more.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_ADV_CROOKEDTREE_Horned%20King.webp\" width=\"100\" /><p class=\"p5\">While still an incorporeal spirit, the Horned King is the most visible he’s been since the characters entered the Wytchwood. It is here he makes his final offer before they face the Crooked Queen.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Heart’s Desire.</strong></em> The Horned King tailors his offering for each character, promising them whatever they wish for. This is his final gambit to make the characters fall, ensuring that the Crooked Queen can give him form and reclaim the dominion that was stolen from her.</p><p class=\"p6\">Characters who accept this offer may ask for anything their heart desires, effectively asking the Horned King to cast a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish}</em> spell for them. He will oblige but will do nothing that interferes with his or the Crooked Queen’s machinations. Characters who accept gain these additional benefits:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">They may choose a Dark Bargain (see chapter 6) for themselves. Moreover, they can choose which features of the bargain they wish to accept.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">They gain a level.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Only you can know what the characters in this story would desire most, and it is up to you to offer the most delicious option. Refer to what the characters have revealed about themselves throughout the adventure and craft an offer that appeals to their most amoral appetites. These offers should be nearly impossible to resist—something that might align with their goals, their fears, or their proclivity to sin.</p><p class=\"p6\">To the characters who accept his offers, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>“You have chosen wisely. Now, let us see this to its end.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">To the characters who resist him, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>“You would deny yourself that which you crave? Foolish. This path is all that remains to you. There is only me. There is only my way. There is only forest. There is only surrender.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>The Price.</strong></em> Any character who accepts the Horned King’s offer is cursed. While cursed in this way, the character deals half as much damage to the Horned King and his minions. Additionally, if the character targets the Horned King, the Crooked Queen (including the Crooked Tree), or their minions with an attack or spell, they must first succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be forced to choose a different target or waste the action. Only a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplWish000000]{Wish}</em> spell or Divine Intervention can lift this curse.</p><p class=\"p6\">Once the Horned King has finished making his final offers and the characters have either accepted or rejected him, he steps back into the shadows, his three eyes burning with hellish malevolence. Now, nothing stands in the way of the characters’ arrival at the seat of the Crooked Queen, and they can proceed to the finale without having to make a Wisdom (Survival) check (see “Tracking Phillip” earlier in this chapter).</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Phillip’s Clue.</strong></em> Once the Horned King leaves the characters, the glinting of silver on the forest floor draws their attention to Phillip’s cane, its goat skull topper tarnished with mud.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Fated Tarot Reading.</strong></em> If <em>The Devil</em> was pulled during the “Fated Tarot Reading” in chapter 9, the discarded cane is the <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.0dNAjhJtIgZ47fDY]{Cane of Phillip Druskenvald}</em><span class=\"s10\">*</span><em>.</em></p></div>"

The remains of her former archfey body are filled with power, but her true essence and consciousness inhabit the entirety of the Crooked Tree.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Ceiling.</strong></em> The ceiling is low, barely 6 feet tall at its highest point, and threaded with tangled roots.

The roots have Immunity to all damage.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Kehlenn’s Bones.</strong></em> The bones shed faint light with the colors of a campfire.

If the sacrifices are great enough, Adela will claim my power and dethrone Kehlenn, sever her ties to my land, and bind her within the Crooked Moon.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p13\"><em><strong>“Please… Let’s set this right…”</strong></em></p></blockquote><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_ADV_CROOKEDTREE_Kehlenn.webp\" width=\"100\" /><p class=\"p5\">To complete the ritual and trap the Crooked Queen within the moon, a character can touch the goat skull and offer a sacrifice. This can be anything of great personal value to the character: a cherished item, a piece (or person) of their past, or even a part of themselves (reducing an ability score by 2, giving up a class feature, etc.). Whatever is offered is lost forever.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Sacrifice.</strong></em> As a Magic action, a character can touch the goat skull, offer a sacrifice, and roll [[/r 1d20]]. On a 10 or higher, the sacrifice is accepted. However, Kehlenn in her Crooked Tree rages against her potential banishment. On a 9 or lower, Kehlenn receives a number of Ritual Points equal to the amount the roll failed by (10 minus the total rolled). Kehlenn can use these points to reduce future rolls before a character rolls the d20 for their sacrifice, potentially turning success into failure. On a failure, a character can try again on subsequent turns with a new sacrifice.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Last Act.</strong></em> A character whose sacrifice isn’t accepted can choose to give their all to assure the queen’s demise—the character can sacrifice their own life. A character who takes this option dies and can’t be restored to life. The sacrifice is accepted, and the Crooked Queen is powerless to stop it.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Resolution.</strong></em> If the characters fail in making their sacrifices 6 times, or if any of the characters ignore the pleading of Phillip’s spirit and don’t offer a sacrifice, the ritual completes in the Crooked Queen’s favor, and the Horned King reforms (see “Crooked Defeat” earlier in this chapter). If each character’s sacrifice is accepted before that, the ritual collapses, and Kehlenn is untethered from Druskenvald and bound forever within the Crooked Moon.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Underneath the Crooked Moon</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">When the final sacrifice is accepted, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>As the final sacrifice is accepted by the goat skull, its empty eye sockets fill with a glowing orange light that spreads along the cracks in the bone, up its horns, and to the wooden moon through the twine that holds it aloft. Then, a breeze whips through the clearing. Riding the wind is a single small ember, the very same one that floated away after the burning of the Wicker Man. The glowing ember, guided by the will of Adela Druskenvald, drifts down and lands at the base of the Crooked Tree.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p13\"><em><strong>In an instant, it bursts into flame. Shrieks of rage, pain, and hate fill the night sky for just a moment before silencing as the entire tree is fully engulfed from root to bough. You look up to the face of the Crooked Moon above, and where once had been a leering grin is now a scowl twisted with malice.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p13\"><em><strong>The radiating energy of the sacrificial ritual fades as the tree burns, and the eternal night of Druskenvald quiets. For a brief moment, the shimmering blue-green specters of Phillip and Adela appear before you, embracing sorrowfully, before fading into nothing.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">Those that still live find themselves watching the ancient trunk and branches collapse in flames, as safe as if they were sitting around a campfire sharing a story.</p><p class=\"p6\">The primeval bonds that tied Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen, to the land of Druskenvald have been severed. She is trapped within the Crooked Moon, fated to forever look down impotently on the people she so bitterly hates.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Level Up.</strong></em> The characters reach level 14, if they are still level 13, when they complete the ritual and defeat the Crooked Queen. If you plan on continuing the adventure to level 20 (see chapter 26), they remain at level 13 and instead increase one ability score of their choice by 2. This increase can't raise a score above 24.</p></div>"

The manipulation of sin that was driving the townsfolk to chaos and mass hysteria has ended, and the survivors of the recent horrors just want to rebuild their lives in peace.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">The people of Wickermoor Hollow, and indeed the peoples of Druskenvald, may never know how close they came to annihilation.

Depending on the number of characters who survive this final battle, it could be difficult to weave all of these climactic character moments together in a way that feels satisfying. It is recommended to select an order for the characters receiving their narrative Climax that allows for time to breathe in between each one so that every character gets their appropriate spotlight.</span></span></p><p class=\"p23\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">Some moments are a natural fit for happening immediately after the burning of the Crooked Tree, while others fit better later as the characters “catch their breath” physically, emotionally, and spiritually after their harrowing experience. These Climaxes should all be initiated while the characters are still within the Wytchwood, but not all of them must be at Kehlenn’s barrow, so you can initiate these impactful moments at various points throughout the trek out of the woods. For characters who wish to use teleportation magic to immediately leave the Wytchwood, you may determine that these spells fail despite the banishment of the Crooked Queen, caused by the surging energies called forth by the final sacrifice to burn the Crooked Tree.</span></p><p class=\"p23\"><span class=\"s6\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">Finally, while the immediate effects of the respective Climaxes and the resulting Catharses may be fitting to happen immediately following each Climax, you are encouraged to allow some time to pass for the characters to fully process each of the climactic moments of their narrative journeys. The Catharsis of each character’s Thread of Fate can be fully implemented during the conclusion of the campaign as presented in the Epilogue (see chapter 25).</span></span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div></div>"

Normally, curses are lasting or permanent negative conditions that require magic or significant effort to end. Chaotic Curses deviate from such curses in several ways:</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Fleeting.</strong> These curses are designed to last a brief amount of real-world time (15-30 minutes or less) and should fade before they become tedious.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Roleplay-Focused.</strong> They add whimsy, surprise, or mayhem to the game without heavily impacting mechanics or combat.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Unpredictable.</strong> These effects alter the characters’ beliefs, appearance, and actions in humorous or unexpected ways.</p><p class=\"p3\">Chaotic Curses are entirely optional and should be used with discretion. Groups that prefer less active roleplay or serious folk horror atmosphere should avoid these curses. For those that favor sillier games, even while confronting the many horrors described in this book, these curses add levity and entertainment.</p></div></div><h2>Using Chaotic Curses</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Pangolin.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" /><p class=\"p3\">To distribute Chaotic Curses, use one of the following methods:</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Tarot Deck.</strong> Shuffle a tarot deck and draw a card. Each card is associated with a curse (see the table below), and the card’s position—upright or reversed—determines which curse takes effect. The card can then be removed from the deck permanently or reshuffled into the deck each time.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Rolling Dice.</strong> Alternatively, you can roll a d100 and check the corresponding curse on the table below.</p><h3><strong>Starting and Ending Curses</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/BES_Nightweave%20Spider%20copy.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p3\">Chaotic Curses are best left up to the GM’s discretion, so they occur at unexpected times rather than during intense or pivotal moments. However, you can use mechanical triggers to determine when a curse begins and ends. Here are some ideas that might trigger Chaotic Curses:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p7\">Rolling a natural 1 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Whenever combat ends</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Finishing a long rest</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Touching a cursed object</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Entering a specific location</p></li></ul><p class=\"p3\">Ending curses can also be handled in a variety of ways:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p7\">Expending Heroic Inspiration</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\"><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse}</em> or similar magic</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Healing magic above a certain threshold</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Finishing a short rest</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">GM pity</p></li></ul><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:relative;z-index:3\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px\"><strong>Tarot Interpretations</strong></p><p class=\"p9\">The tarot deck is simply used for randomization.

This adventure, <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, is a folk horror story applied to 5E, a game of heroic fantasy. Interweaving these themes is no small challenge, but this chapter and the stories ahead are written to provide you with the tools you need to achieve a thrilling and haunting campaign.</p><p class=\"p4\">As the Game Master (GM), it is your role to play as the world of Druskenvald itself and everything else within it. You are the deep woods, the shadows between the trees, and the monsters that stalk the eternal night. You are the folk, both sinister and sincere, that inhabit the sleepy villages and remote homesteads on the fringes of civilization.</p><p class=\"p4\">You are also guiding your friends, who take the role of Player Characters (referred to as “characters” in this adventure). They are the protagonists of this horror story, and you are responsible for being their senses; they cannot fully experience the terror of Druskenvald without knowing what they see, hear, smell, and touch—and sometimes taste. To refresh yourself on how to run folk horror and instill dread and tension, refer to the Introduction of this book.</p><p class=\"p4\">While the previous chapter overviewed the story of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, this chapter highlights the relevant features and mechanical details of the campaign, as well as tips and tricks for reading the book. Most of the features and systems below are entirely optional, and the adventure is written so that none are required. It is up to you to determine what to implement to run a game that is best suited for your table.</p><h2>Adventure Features</h2><p class=\"p3\">Each chapter in the adventure includes background information, general guidance, and location features, as well as how encounters, NPCs, and monsters should be presented and where their treasure might be found.</p><p class=\"p4\">Pay close attention to the formatting and cross-references throughout each chapter. When a creature’s name is bolded and marked with a * symbol (for example, the <strong>@UUID[Actor.nyRSwRnMCTM1oEgG]{Hypnovulfen}</strong>*), the creature’s stat block can be found in Appendix A: Bestiary. When a magic item’s name is italicized and marked with a * symbol (for example, the <em>Scythe of the Harvest Terror</em>*), the magic item’s details can be found in Appendix B: Treasury. Backgrounds, spells, and other options from within this book are also marked in this way.</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Boxed text that appears like this is meant to be read or paraphrased aloud.</strong></em></p></blockquote><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:6px;bottom:6px;left:6px;right:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:relative;z-index:3\"><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><p><strong>GM Sidebar</strong></p><p class=\"p8\">Text that looks like this is for advice or other helpful information that will help you run the adventure.</p></aside></div><h3><strong>Lost in Isolation</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\"><em>The Crooked Moon</em> assumes that the only means of traveling in and out of Druskenvald is through the Shroud with the guidance of entities like The Vagrant—soul shepherds called “Strangers” (see chapter 1). Additionally, once the characters arrive in Wickermoor Hollow with Phillip and Adela Druskenvald, the ancient power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen, ensnares them and prevents them from leaving the province. Wickermoor Hollow has the following features if you wish to keep the characters trapped and alone:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>In the Mist.</strong> No magic, such as <em>Plane Shift</em> or <em>Teleport</em>, can transport a creature beyond the borders of Druskenvald without being shepherded by a Stranger.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Crooked Grasp. </strong>Physical and magical travel out of Wickermoor Hollow is made impossible by ancient wards. When a creature tries to exit, it gets lost and ends up being teleported to a forest within the valley.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Cut Off.</strong> Any attempts to communicate magically with creatures outside of Wickermoor Hollow automatically fail.</p><h3><strong>Fear of the Dark</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">In a horror campaign, requiring all characters to deal with the aspects of night that instill fear in humanity can increase the tension and dread. You can use the following optional rules to limit certain characters’ features to make the sleeping hours more horrifying. If you wish to implement them, be sure to discuss the details with your players ahead of the campaign to ensure it enhances the fun for your table.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>All Must Sleep.</strong> While in Druskenvald, characters who don’t need to sleep during long rests in other realms must sleep to stave off exhaustion, though they can still resist magic that might put them to sleep, if able.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Creeping Dark.</strong> Characters who benefit from darkvision find this trait suppressed, though magic that grants darkvision such as from a spell or magic item still functions. This does not affect monsters or NPCs.</p><h3><strong>Time in Druskenvald</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">As a realm of eternal night, Druskenvald’s unusual time cycle (see chapter 1) is an essential part of the setting’s atmosphere. While a sun never rises above the horizon, the amount of light and the color of the sky change throughout each night, from the purple of Twilight Hour, through the orange glow Dusk Hour, to the blues of Nightfall Hour and Evening Hour, and finally the pitch black of Midnight Hour and Witching Hour.</p><p class=\"p4\">Note the time when describing the land’s natural light and weather, and reflect it through the dialogue of NPCs who have an intuitive sense of Druskenvald’s unique night cycle. While it can be tricky to enforce this language throughout the game, and it’s fine to refer to real-world time periods for clarity, using cues like “We leave at the Twilight Hour” or “Let’s settle in before the Witching Hour” makes for a more immersive experience.</p><h4><strong>Time in Druskenvald</strong></h4><table class=\"foundry-header-red\" border=\"0\"><thead><tr><th>Period Name</th><th>Equivalent Time Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Twilight Hour</td><td>Morning (7 to 11 a.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Dusk Hour</td><td>Midday (11 a.m. to 3 p.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Nightfall Hour</td><td>Afternoon (3 to 7 p.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Evening Hour</td><td>Evening (7 to 11 p.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Midnight Hour</td><td>Late Night (11 p.m. to 3 a.m.)</td></tr><tr><td>Witching Hour</td><td>Early Morning (3 to 7 a.m.)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Overland Travel</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">Wickermoor Village serves as the hub of the adventure, and most chapters involve the characters traveling from what little safety is offered there to another remote location within Wickermoor Hollow. Though travel in the valley is rarely straightforward, you may pick up each chapter where it begins and convey the characters back to town after each chapter by briefly narrating the travel in between.</p><p class=\"p4\">If you choose to simulate overland travel between each location, the following options can help your players get a better sense of Wickermoor Hollow’s size:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p15\">Use the map of Wickermoor Hollow to estimate travel distances. The map of this province is deliberately not to scale, and the details on it are not precise, which allows for flexibility in this folktale adventure. However, an easy shorthand in determining travel distances is that most of the areas throughout the valley are a three-to-five night trek from Wickermoor Village, depending on how treacherous and overgrown the terrain is. Exceptions to this include Foxwillow and Maidenmist Cemetery, which are a one-to-two night walk on foot.</p></li><li><p class=\"p15\">No journey is a direct route, and there are few well-traveled roads in the valley. It is up to your discretion how many nights it takes to follow the valley’s winding paths to the characters’ destinations.</p></li><li><p class=\"p15\">Change the weather and vary terrain to create a feeling of distance. Successful Nature, Perception, and Survival checks can aid travel and avoid dangers.</p></li><li><p class=\"p15\">You can add combat encounters with creatures featured in Appendix A or other sources to reinforce the coming chapter’s themes and make the valley feel dangerous. These encounters should serve the narrative and not feel random.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p3\">Overland travel can give characters time to reflect, interact, and plan. Strategically allot moments for travel when the story has an opportunity to slow down; it can make the valley feel alive and hint at the horrors that await. But, do not dally when precious game time is limited—jump to the next step with a brief description.</p><h3><strong>Mortality</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">Death is never far in Druskenvald. When a character dies, their spirit lingers in Druskenvald until the Crooked Queen is defeated. At your discretion, if there is little chance for resurrection, you may offer players a chance to deny their character's death by accepting a Dark Bargain of your choice (see chapter 6), which restores the character to life with all of their hit points. This is a great narrative opportunity to add additional consequences aside from what is included in the features of the Dark Bargain.</p><p class=\"p4\"><em><strong>Deaths of the Druskenvalds.</strong></em> Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are two key NPCs whose fates play a pivotal role in the climax of the adventure. Their deaths are fated to occur in chapters 24 and 23, respectively. Any attempts by the characters to kill Phillip and Adela fail, and the ancient power of Kehlenn teleports them to safety so they can be sacrificed at the right moment.</p><h2>Character Advancement</h2><p class=\"p3\"><em>The Crooked Moon</em> takes characters from level 1 to level 14. The campaign is designed with specific story moments for character advancement instead of awarding XP. Nearly every chapter advances the characters’ level at its conclusion. Use the table below to guide level advancement throughout the adventure.</p><p class=\"p4\">If you and your players wish to continue the dreadful folktale past the primary storyline of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, refer to the rules and guidance in Chapter 26: Moonfall.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter8_Ghostlight_Express.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div></div></div>"

Simplified guidance for performing this reading is provided in the chapter, but below are rules to enhance the experience in a way that affects the adventure and foreshadows what’s to come.</p><h2>Fabled Rewards</h2><div style=\"max-width:750px;margin:0 auto;font-size:1.05em;text-align:justify;text-indent:2em\"><p class=\"p2\">Many Fabled Heirlooms—magic items that level up with the characters—are presented in this book and can be found throughout the adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>. However, provisioning the characters with a veritable treasure trove of powerful items could quickly trivialize the threats that await them.</p><p class=\"p4\">Therefore, the Fated Tarot Reading provides a method to determine which of the Fabled Heirlooms the characters can acquire. When Adela performs the reading aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, she uses only a portion of a full 78-card tarot deck. Instead, she shuffles the 22 most important cards, known as the Major Arcana, and pulls one for each character. Each card corresponds to a Fabled Heirloom or a powerful boon that can be found at specific points throughout the adventure (see “Major Arcana” below).</p><p class=\"p4\">When the reading is complete, make note of which cards were pulled. Then, as you run the adventure, keep an eye out for sections titled “Fated Tarot Reading,” each of which features a Major Arcana card, its corresponding item or boon, and the location it can be found or the circumstance needed to achieve it. Only implement the features of these sections that include the cards that were drawn during the reading. Ignore all other instances of these chapter sections.</p><p class=\"p4\">To determine these randomly, you can use your own tarot deck, shuffling the 22 Major Arcana cards and pulling them at the table. Alternatively, you can roll on the Fated Tarot table below. If you wish to equip the characters with items that are fitting for their abilities or story, you can simply choose a card for each character instead of drawing randomly. If you want to provide the characters with additional power throughout the adventure, you can have each character receive a two-card reading.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.PgDCRgyABMbAxork]{Fated Tarot Table}</strong></em></span></p><p></p></div><p></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/HK_inked.webp\" width=\"300\" class=\" centered\" /><h2><span class=\"s1\">Major Arcana</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Below are all 22 Major Arcana cards that can be pulled in the Fated Tarot Reading, along with Adela Druskenvald’s interpretation of the cards, who always pulls the cards in the upright position.

          "name": "Fateweaving",
          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap09 top-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">Fateweaving</p><p>Fateweaving provides an optional framework to intertwine the characters’ individual stories throughout the adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, allowing for a more personalized experience that does not require heavy alterations to the broader narrative. You can implement this system to provide each character with a call to action, rewards tied to narrative progression, and the opportunity to experience a full personal arc.</p><p class=\"p3\">These character arcs all end with the climax and conclusion of the main adventure of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, and the narrative results that the characters achieve are often immense and intended to come with the end of a protagonist’s story as a player character. Fateweaving is written with the intention that your campaign concludes in the Epilogue and does not proceed into the events of Moonfall (see chapter 26), though you can adjust to allow for play beyond the scope of the adventure.</p><h2><span class=\"s2\">How to Use Fateweaving</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">You can incorporate Fateweaving into your adventure by taking the following steps, each of which is expanded upon later in this section:</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Select a Goal.</strong> Have each player pick a Thread of Fate from the list of thirteen presented below, which provides a specific goal for their character. Each character should follow a different Thread so they can experience their own unique story.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Personalize.</strong> Work with each player to incorporate the Thread of Fate into their character’s backstory and motivation. They (or you) will need to make one major choice to customize the Thread to the specific character.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Review Touchpoints.</strong> Once the Threads of Fate are selected and personalized, review the six major Narrative Touchpoints for each Thread that you will weave into your adventure. These are the key story moments that provide each character with a complete arc.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Follow Symbols.</strong> Each Thread of Fate has a unique symbol associated with it. As you read through the adventure, keep an eye out for the symbols connected to the characters’ Threads, each instance of which marks a location or moment when and where a Narrative Touchpoint occurs.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Implement Touchpoints.</strong> As you run the adventure, incorporate each character’s Narrative Touchpoint at the appropriate place, and make it clear that the relevant character has the spotlight when this occurs.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Distribute Rewards.</strong> Each time a character completes a Narrative Touchpoint, reward them with its respective boon listed in the following section.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Finish the Story.</strong> Continue this process until the adventure concludes, where you can deliver the final emotional Catharsis of each character’s arc.</p><h2><span class=\"s2\">Narrative Touchpoints</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Fateweaving provides a full narrative arc for each character’s personal journey that unfolds in six major moments throughout the adventure called Narrative Touchpoints. These take each character from the Incitement of their quest all the way through the Catharsis at the end of their story. The location of each Narrative Touchpoint within the adventure differs depending on a character’s Thread of Fate.</p><p class=\"p3\">Each of the Narrative Touchpoints are written to be open ended and not prescriptive so that they are easily customizable for a wide variety of backstories. It is up to you how to tailor each one to the specific character. Each Touchpoint should be accessible without ability checks and should not be easily missed.</p><p class=\"p3\">Familiarizing yourself with the six types of Narrative Touchpoints and their associated rewards will help you interweave each progressive step along every character’s journey.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Incitement</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The first Narrative Touchpoint connects a character’s Thread of Fate with the story of <em>The Crooked Moon</em> and affirms that the goal of their personal quest lies ahead in Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This inciting moment can occur either aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> (chapter 10) or in the Crooked House (chapter 12).</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Reward.</strong> A character who encounters their Incitement receives inspiration.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Connection</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The second Narrative Touchpoint takes the form of meeting a villager from Wickermoor Village who bears a particular connection with a character’s Thread of Fate and offers clues, aid, and guidance. Make note of how this Connection NPC's partnership with the character might affect their allegiances and potential involvement in future plot developments, particularly during the events of Wicker’s Vigil (see chapter 23).</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This NPC can be found in Wickermoor Village (chapter 11) and should only be encountered after the character has completed their Incitement Touchpoint but before they follow a quest hook that leads to their Discovery Touchpoint.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Reward.</strong> In addition to gaining an ally whose attitude becomes friendly, a character who meets their Connection gains the effects of the <em>Bless</em> spell for 24 hours.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Discovery</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The third Narrative Touchpoint involves the character achieving the first key victory of their quest and learning a shocking truth or obtaining hidden knowledge about their Thread of Fate that points them toward the major Confrontation of their arc.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Chapter Placement.</strong> This moment of Discovery occurs while the characters explore one of the following locations during chapters 13–17: the Fields of the Crow, the Crimson Monastery, the Drowned Crossroads, Skitterdeep Mine, or Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Reward.</strong> A character who uncovers their Discovery gains a Twist of Fate that lasts until it is expended.

Each Thread provides a goal for a character to pursue, plot elements to incorporate into their backstory, player choices that personalize the experience, the call of adventure that sets the character on the path to Druskenvald, and six Narrative Touchpoints throughout the adventure that provide a full character arc and rewards for resolving each step.</p><p class=\"p3\">For ease of use, each Thread of Fate has thematic and narrative connections to one of the thirteen new backgrounds included in this book (see chapter 4). However, any character can select any Thread regardless of their background. Share these Thread options, their initial story elements, and any starting questions with your players, but keep the details of the Threads’ Narrative Touchpoints (presented in the following pages) a secret. You can also use these as inspiration to create your own Threads of Fate.</p></div>"

It then disappears.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Climax.</strong> After the death of the Horned King and the burning of the Crooked Tree, the spiritual beast appears, expanding to colossal proportions after consuming the essence of this king of monsters. It bows before the character, who has proven themselves to be the consummate hunter, offering them the opportunity to become the ultimate predator by transforming into what the spirit beast has become.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character accepts their spirit guide’s final offer, they and their spiritual beast become one and transform into an apex predator to stalk the wilds of Druskenvald and be the monster that even monsters fear. If they reject it, the spiritual beast calls for them to find new, even more fearsome prey in hunting grounds beyond Wickermoor Hollow.</p></div>"

They appear in this book’s adventure, and you can use them in your own encounters throughout the thirteen provinces of Druskenvald or anywhere else of your choosing.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">The creatures in this bestiary are organized into three broad categories: “Crooked Moon Monsters,\" which are the traditional foes faced throughout a dreadful folktale, “Legendary Monsters” for the monsters of legend who serve as climactic antagonists in the adventure, and “Familiars,” which can be recruited by player characters in addition to being encountered as any other monster might. Within each category, the monsters are organized alphabetically. The tables in the pages to come lists every creature in Appendix A, along with the creature’s type and CR.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Using a Stat Block</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">This appendix is a companion to the core rules and adopts a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar with the monster stat block format, read “Monster Statistics” in the <em>Basic Rules </em>before proceeding further. A stat block referenced in bold with a <span class=\"s2\">*</span> appears in this book.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Monster Secrets</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">Most of the monsters in <em>The Crooked Moon</em> have a secret weakness or other quirk that can influence interaction and battle with the creature, but the trick is knowing it before it’s needed. You can decide which nonplayer characters, writings, or other sources or methods might divulge a monster’s secret. A few examples of how the player characters could learn of it include:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p4\">Consulting with knowledgeable figures such as sages well-versed in peculiar creatures or hermits who have long lived in an area where a given creature lurks.</p></li><li><p class=\"p4\">Scouring libraries that hold lore.</p></li><li><p class=\"p4\">Talking with local folk who might have some factual information passed down in their superstitions and traditions.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p2\">Once they have a potential reliable source, a character who spends a number of hours equal to the monster’s CR (minimum of 1 hour) researching the secret must make an ability check using a skill proficiency determined by the monster’s creature type, as outlined in the Monster Lore table. The ability check used is usually Intelligence, but it could also be Charisma in the case of sourcing rumors and local folklore, at your discretion. The DC for the check is 10 plus the monster’s CR.</p><p class=\"p5\">On a success, the character learns the monster’s secret. On a failure, the sources don’t have reliable information, and the character can try again with a new source.</p><p class=\"p5\">If you decide that characters may have learned a monster’s secret during their own experiences, a character can make the ability check with a DC of 20 or the monster’s CR plus 10, whichever is higher. On a success, the character recalls the secret. On a failure, they can’t try this method with that monster again and must seek out a reliable source as above.</p><img style=\"border:none\"

The creatures aren’t content to wait for something to die and instead make their own carrion to gorge upon—they delight in snatching prey in their talons, carrying it into the air, and dropping it to its death. Boneflayers earn their name by using their sizeable, filth-riddled beaks to cleave flesh from bone and hoard the meat until it ages enough for them to enjoy.</p><p class=\"p6\">Cults sometimes use boneflayer killing grounds as a source of bones to burn in ritual bonfires, occasionally making pacts with the creatures to pay or trade for the creature’s castoffs.

Its draconic head resembles a decorated or armored horse’s head, and its sharp teeth fit together to appear like blunt, harmless decorations. The drakkenhob uses this benign guise to get close to its prey, which are typically within crowds near festivals or parades, before it summons its similarly garbed hunting hounds and strikes.

Their feathers are drab colors on the exterior, but their wings display a dazzling cascade of rainbow hues on the undersides when unfurled.</p><p class=\"p6\">These colors flow and shift, mesmerizing the dream eater’s prey and leaving them helpless.

This bond creates a deep, magical connection and isn’t entered into lightly by these familiars. They demand respectful treatment, but in return offer loyal companionship and service. If the familiar is mistreated or wronged, it can sever the bond and may become a thorn in the side of their former companion.</p><p class=\"p3\">Learning to form a familiar bond with one of these creatures isn’t necessarily common knowledge, and you can treat discovering how to perform the ritual as a secret, as discussed in the “Monster Secrets” section in the Appendix A introduction.</p><p class=\"p3\"><em><strong>Familiar Bond.</strong></em> When a creature performs a 10-minute ritual using materials worth at least 100 gp (noted in each familiar’s subtitle), the familiar can form a magical bond with that creature to serve as its familiar. The bond ends when the creature dies, or when the familiar decides to end it (no action required). While the bond lasts, the creature and the familiar gain the following benefits:</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Bonded Sympathy.</strong> The familiar can choose to exclude the bonded creature from any area of effect it creates, such as a damaging sphere or the goatstealer’s Stench trait. Additionally, if the familiar has another feature that creates a bond (such as the devil’s glove’s Symbiosis bonus action), that bond forms as part of the familiar bond.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Channel Magic.</strong> When the bonded creature casts a spell with a range of touch while within 100 feet of the familiar, the familiar can use its reaction to deliver the touch when the spell is cast.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Telepathic Connection.</strong> While the bonded creature and the familiar are within 100 feet of each other, they can communicate telepathically. Additionally, as a bonus action, the creature can see and hear through the familiar’s senses until the start of its next turn, gaining the benefit of any special senses the familiar has.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Revival.</strong> If the familiar dies while the bond exists, the bonded creature can restore the familiar to life with all its hit points by performing a 1-hour version of the Familiar Bond ritual (no further research required to learn this version).</p><h2 style=\"clear:both\"><span class=\"s2\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.R60glVqGFDyPQMIo]{Corn Dolly}</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/FAMILIAR_Corn_Dolly.webp\" width=\"200\" /><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\"><em>Grain Husk Companion (Curved blade plated in gold)</em></span></p><p class=\"p7\"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Any</p><p><strong>Treasure:</strong> None</p><p class=\"p2\">Crafted from dried husks and bound with twine, corn dollies’ delicate forms are stitched together with rustic care.

In a land that is mostly fabricated and constructed to maximize the fun of all who live there, the essence of joy, thrill, and friendship are woven into a threadborn's very nature. They cherish the bonds made between loved ones and always maintain a childlike wonder and whimsy, no matter one’s age.</p><p class=\"p2\">As living dolls, these folk are constructed with a variety of materials, including cloth, wood, metal, porcelain, stuffing, yarn, and anything else a toy might be made of. With the most varied body shapes of all Druskenvald’s species, each threadborn represents a unique representation of fun. They usually live for 100 years before falling apart and needing to be rebuilt.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Threadborn Traits</span></h2><blockquote><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Construct</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (about 4–7 feet tall) or Small (about 2–4 feet tall), chosen when you select this species</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p1\">As a Threadborn, you have these special traits.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Ball-Jointed.</strong></em> You can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide as if it were Difficult Terrain.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Innocent Mind.</strong></em> You have Resistance to Psychic damage.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Sewn Nature.</strong></em> You don’t require air, food, or drink.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Soothing Heart.</strong></em> You know the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGuidance00]{Guidance} </em>cantrip. Starting at character level 3, you always have the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbSanctuary0000]{Sanctuary}</em> spell prepared, and starting at character level 5, you always have the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplCalmEmotio]{Calm Emotions}</em> spell prepared. You can cast each spell once without a spell slot. When you cast <em>Calm Emotions </em>in this way, it can target creatures of any type. You regain the ability to cast them using this trait when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast either spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.</p><p class=\"p2\">Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this species).</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>You've Got a Friend.</strong></em> When a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself fails an ability check using a skill, you can take a Reaction to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGuidance00]{Guidance} </em>on the creature, ignoring the spell's normal range. The creature can add the spell's [[/roll 1d4]] to its ability check, potentially causing it to succeed, then the spell ends. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p></div>"

These ancient agreements bind the land, its magical energies, its creatures—and you. The effects bring boon and bane alike. It may be best for some sinister characters to offer their bargains plainly, letting the lurking curses reveal themselves only when the time is right. Beware your entry into these iniquitous accords.</em></p></div></div><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Entering_a_Dark_Bargain.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h1 class=\"section\">Shake on It</h1><p class=\"p3\">Any bargain offered by an utterly unknowable, unfathomable power such as those that position themselves within the realm of Druskenvald must be carefully considered by you, your character, and the GM. These gifts are not to be offered lightly and should not be accepted lightly; their mere presence should herald significant roleplaying opportunities now and in the future.</p><h2>Entering a Dark Bargain</h2><p class=\"p3\">In nearly all cases, the power that is proposing a Dark Bargain is uninterested in negotiating the duration or eventual cost of this gift. However, there may be extenuating circumstances. There could be roleplaying scenarios or simply the current events in the adventure’s narrative that could cause the power to briefly—briefly!—consider negotiating. The GM has the final say on whether a given bargainer has the inclination to haggle. Generally, characters need the Dark Bargain far more than the powers need to grant it.</p><p class=\"p6\">In any event, Dark Bargains reflect the entity imparting them, as well as the circumstances and any prices asked in exchange. You and the GM should tailor the cosmetic details of the bargain to the character’s situation.</p><p class=\"p6\">There are multiple ways a character might be tempted with power in Druskenvald.</p><h3><strong>Character Creation</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">With the GM’s permission, you can choose a Dark Bargain when you make your character. Work with the GM to determine the circumstances of your character entering into the bargain, who offered it, and what terms your character had to fulfill—or is still expected to fulfill—to make good on the deal.</p><h3><strong>During Play</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">Dark Bargains can also come about during play in a campaign. There might be times where inscrutable powers have their own designs and see an opportunity for a character to further those ends in exchange for gifts. Others might be willing to negotiate a bargain as an alternative price to death or worse.</p><p class=\"p6\">In these cases, the GM might alter terms of the bargains, such as increasing, lessening, or even waiving the prices of the bargains entirely—though perhaps only for a short time, or as long as some other condition is met.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Birds.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><h3><strong>Unique Bargains</strong></h3><p class=\"p3\">Each Dark Bargain is unique, and a character can enter into a given bargain only once. A character could be bound to multiple Dark Bargains at one time, but each one only once.</p><h2>Removing Dark Bargains</h2><p class=\"p3\">Dark Bargains are binding once sealed. There are tales and legends of those who have outwitted a bargainer or found a way to break a bargain’s hold on them, but the truth of such stories is left to the GM to decide.</p><h1 class=\"section\">Dark Bargain Descriptions</h1><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Bestial%20Embrace.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.m65qnJ7evLeIg8gq]{Bestial Awakening}</h2><p class=\"p3\">The feral world calls to your soul, howling for you to join it. You can give in to the call and transform into a beast, but the touch of silver bites you more deeply than the sharpest fang.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Beast Skin.</strong></em> You can cast the <em>Polymorph</em> spell using this benefit without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast it using slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spell when you cast it without a spell slot (choose the ability when you select this Dark Bargain).</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Searing Silver.</strong></em> Damage from silvered weapons ignores any resistance or immunity to damage you have. If you take damage from a silvered weapon or touch silver with your bare skin (or its equivalent), you can’t regain hit points until you finish a short or long rest.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Call%20of%20the%20Lonely.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.MeW04s429o2bpIys]{Call of the Lonely}</h2><p class=\"p3\">In the depths of your solitude, and when your hope withered on the branch, you were granted a companion you can call on. You never have to be alone again. This companion is friendly toward you but is deeply unsettling to your allies.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Never Alone.</strong></em> When no other creature can see you, you can use a bonus action to call your companion, which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. It takes the form of a person or a vague silhouette, and it uses the <strong>Doppelganger</strong> stat block. It is friendly toward you and acts as your ally, and it takes its turn on your initiative in combat. It disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, when you die, or when you use an action to politely dismiss it. When it disappears, it drops anything it was wearing or carrying.</p><p class=\"p6\">Once you use this bonus action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Precocious Friend.</strong></em> The companion sometimes appears with trinkets, Cursed Curios*, or other items. It might tell you where it got them, or it might not (GM’s choice). If it took the object from someone who misses it or wants it back, that could create difficulties for you.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Unsettling Presence.</strong></em> While your companion is summoned, both it and you exude a frightful air that unnerves your allies. While the companion is summoned, a creature that isn’t hostile toward you that starts its turn able to see you or the companion must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of its next turn.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Collector%20of%20Stories.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.NMeEone3i6sXyBIo]{Collector of Stories}</h2><p class=\"p3\">You have an insatiable desire to gather the tales of the world. Sometimes, you inadvertently take the story of meeting another person and keep it to yourself, forever.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Gathered Tales.</strong></em> You can cast the <em>Legend Lore </em>spell with this bargain without requiring spell components. Once you cast it using this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast it using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spell when you cast it without a spell slot (choose the ability when you select this Dark Bargain).</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Hoarded Stories.</strong></em> When you use this bargain to cast <em>Legend Lore</em>, a friendly NPC (the GM chooses) forgets ever meeting you. You can meet them again and attempt to rebuild a relationship, but you forever cause an unsettling discomfort in them. That NPC’s attitude toward you can’t ever improve beyond indifferent, and you have disadvantage on all Charisma checks against them.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Crooked%20Fortune.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.I4FfVvl5rcmsq2gR]{Crooked Fortune}</h2><p class=\"p3\">The crooked fate that governs Druskenvald has taken a liking to you. You can avoid calamity, but you must pay back your good fortune eventually.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Cheat Fate.</strong></em> When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. When you do so, if you would take half damage on a successful save, you take no damage instead. Once you use Cheat Fate, you can’t use it again until you pay the price (see below).</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Delayed Price.</strong></em> After you use Cheat Fate, your next three saving throws have disadvantage and can’t have advantage, and you gain 1 level of exhaustion when you succeed on one of the saves. Once you succeed or fail on the third saving throw, you regain the use of Cheat Fate. The powers that govern the warp and weft of fate don’t take kindly to cheating outside their terms—at the GM’s discretion, saving throws made intentionally or without true consequences simply to pay this price painlessly don’t count.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Cult%20of%20Personality.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.p1zZmfKtzQ8ZFaZT]{Cult of Personality}</h2><p class=\"p3\">You are a force of charm and allure with which to be reckoned. While others fall over themselves to stumble into your good graces, you might find that you end up needing them more than they need you.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Honeyed Words.</strong></em> As an action, you can speak sweet words to a creature within 60 feet of you. The creature is charmed by you for 24 hours, until you use this feature again, or until you or your allies deal any damage to the target or force it to make a saving throw. The charmed target is your ally and follows your commands as long as they don’t require the target to harm itself. If the target carries out a command it finds odious, it makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, ending the condition on itself on a success. Once the condition ends, the target is immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p><p class=\"p6\">If the target has immunity to being charmed, it instead has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of your next turn, and you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Solitary Weakness.</strong></em> If you start your turn with no allies that you can see or hear within 20 feet of you, you lose any temporary hit points you have from any source, and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of your next turn.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Hand%20of%20Death.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.jIljQZGysRvbBmTk]{Hand of Death}</h2><p class=\"p3\">Death has no claim on you. In exchange for staying its cold hand without that hand closing, you become a maw through which death feeds on the world around you.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Adamant Endurance.</strong></em> You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Cling to Life.</strong></em> When you have 0 hit points at the start of your turn, or when you die, you can instead choose to regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again. After using it, whenever you regain hit points through any means, you gain only half that amount. Once a Humanoid (other than you) dies within 30 feet of you, you regain the use of this feature, and you can regain hit points as normal.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Death Knell.</strong></em> Other creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on death saving throws, and you can’t restore hit points to a creature with 0 hit points by any means.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Might%20of%20Old.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.zrrPVQVznzj84ySG]{Might of the Old}</h2><p class=\"p3\">Ancient and primeval power dwells within the oldest forests of Druskenvald. These powers pour their strength into you but can overwhelm you with their unchanging nature.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Ancient Might.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22, and your Dexterity score decreases by 2.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Primeval Strength.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can call upon the might of the ancients to raise your Strength score to 25 for 1 minute, during which time you deal double damage to objects. Once you use this bonus action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Pyre’s Price.</strong></em> When you activate Primeval Strength, your skin takes on a bark-like texture, during which time you have vulnerability to fire damage. Your skin returns to normal when you finish a long rest.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Self-Serving%20Sacrifice.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.qvZyqHhPF6f8AIft]{Self-Serving Sacrifice}</h2><p class=\"p3\">You can snatch others from the jaws of death, but your own grip lingers too tightly. The feeling of saving others from suffering fills you with resolve, even as it drains the vigor from those you rescue.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Critical Savior.</strong></em> When a creature within 120 feet of you is subjected to a critical hit or is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to magically switch places with the target. Each of you teleports to the other’s space. Roll a number of d6s equal to half your level. You take force damage equal to the total rolled, you gain inspiration, and your exhaustion level is reduced by 1. The target regains hit points equal to the total rolled and gains 1 level of exhaustion. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Draining Presence.</strong></em> When you finish a short or long rest, each creature within 100 feet of you loses one Hit Die (before spending Hit Dice in the case of finishing a short rest).</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Final Sacrifice.</strong></em> You can cast the <em>True Resurrection</em> spell using this bargain requiring no material components. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spell when you cast it without a spell slot (choose the ability when you select this Dark Bargain).</p><p class=\"p6\">When you cast the spell this way, you die, and nothing can prevent it. Your soul is bound to torment the creature you returned to life, and you can’t be raised from the dead by any means. When the creature takes a long rest, it must roll a d20 halfway through the rest’s duration. On a 1, your soul takes the form of a <strong>Wraith</strong> within 100 feet of the creature and tries to kill it. The wraith vanishes after 8 hours, or when it dies. Once the wraith appears, it can’t appear again for 30 days.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Shrouded%20Spirit.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.kZ8RL5XFCIJThxhT]{Shrouded Spirit}</h2><p class=\"p3\">The pall of death drapes over you like the Shroud of Druskenvald. This shroud protects you from the depredations of the Undead, but it draws you ever nearer to their cold embrace.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Inured to Undeath.</strong></em> You have resistance to necrotic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects created by Undead.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Unholy Appetite.</strong></em> You must consume one pound of raw flesh (it needn’t be fresh) per day. If you don’t, at the day’s end, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Withering Soul.</strong></em> Features that detect your creature type, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the <em>Detect Evil and Good </em>spell, treat you as Undead if your creature type isn’t Undead already.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Skin%20of%20Coffin%20Nails.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.JZpz4rtIg8Zf5wUj]{Skin of Coffin Nails}</h2><p class=\"p3\">Your body becomes as coldly unrelenting as iron nails sealing away the dead. You can shrug off staggering punishment, but the waters of the world no longer embrace you, as if spiting your defiance.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Iron Grit.</strong></em> You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice when you select this Dark Bargain). You can change the damage type to one of the other options when you finish a short or long rest. When you suffer a critical hit from the chosen damage type, it becomes a normal hit instead.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Watery Doom.</strong></em> When you are immersed in water or splashed with at least 1 gallon of water (such as from a bucket or being rained on), your skin tightens and grows rusty until you finish a short or long rest. During that time, your speed and the time you can hold your breath are halved, and your resistance to the chosen damage type for Iron Grit becomes vulnerability instead. At the GM’s discretion, other liquids can also trigger this feature.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Stilled%20hungers.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.5BityO0OShQ5Ze7o]{Stilled Hungers}</h2><p class=\"p3\">Food, drink, and maladies of the flesh have lost their hold over you, but these are the very things that keep a soul vital while in the land of the living. Your mind grows ravenous absent those urges—your thoughts crack with gnawing fears, and your dreams wither into crooked nightmares.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Sated Cravings.</strong></em> Forgoing food and drink doesn’t give you levels of exhaustion. You have resistance to poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the poisoned condition.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Tenuous Psyche.</strong></em> You have vulnerability to psychic damage and disadvantage on saving throws to avoid or end the frightened condition. A <em>Calm Emotions</em> spell cast on you suppresses this feature for its duration.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Unquenchable%20Fury.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.TZOGg8vrVtZAmXas]{Unquenchable Fury}</h2><p class=\"p3\">Anger is a powerful tool. This bargain stokes it into a formidable inferno, but it threatens to consume everything in its path.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Furious Onslaught.</strong></em> As a bonus action, or when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can choose to enter a fury. While in this fury, you can make one additional melee attack when you take the Attack action on your turn, and you reduce all damage you take by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. The fury ends if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if you end your turn and there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. You also regain the use of this feature when you kill a Humanoid.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Red Haze.</strong></em> While you are in a fury, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of your turns. On a successful save, you can choose to end your fury or continue it. On a failed save, you no longer make the saving throw at the start of your turns, and you regard the creature nearest to you that you can see or hear as your enemy (if there are multiple, choose one at random). On each of your turns, you must move as close to the creature as possible and take the Attack action, targeting that creature with melee attacks. If you’re unable to get close enough to the creature to attack it, your turn ends after you’ve used up all your available movement. If the creature dies or can no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest creature that you can see or hear becomes your new target.</p><hr /><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Wings%20of%20Whispers.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.Wei9BNZGTHhNGa7p]{Wings of Whispers}</h2><p class=\"p3\">You have been gifted with secrets that you can call upon in the form of ravens and crows to bear you aloft, but at the risk of revealing your own secrets in turn.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Murderous Flight.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can magically gain a flying Speed equal to your walking speed (and you can hover) for 10 minutes. During this time, a mass of shadows takes the shape of a murder of crows and ravens (but they aren’t truly creatures). The birds fill the area within 20 feet of you and take flight and whirl around you when you fly. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you gain 1 level of exhaustion to use it again early.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Whispered Secrets.</strong></em> The birds that appear when you activate Murderous Flight remain and continue to follow you until you finish a short or long rest. While the birds are present, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and the birds whisper your secrets into the minds of other creatures, granting them advantage on Wisdom (Insight or Perception) checks made against you.</p></div>"

He raises crooked arms to a Crooked Tree at the edge of midnight and hears the whispers of the Old Ones.</em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><em>They speak of a beast that stalks the darkest woods and darkest hearts, a crown of horns upon its head.

The Crooked Moon is a tome intended to equip you with all the tools you’ll need to bring Folk Horror to 5E and turn your game into a terrifying tale told among friends.</span></p></div></div><h2><span class=\"s1\">Using This Book</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Within these pages, you’ll find a plethora of options, rules, mechanics, and inspiration to craft characters and campaigns rooted in Folk Horror. Whether you are taking up the mantle of the Game Master (GM) or facing the terrors that await you as a Player, this book offers the guidance to make your tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) experience an unforgettably dreadful folktale. <em>The Crooked Moon </em>consists of three parts:</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Part 1.</strong> Chapters 1–7 feature an overview of the setting of Druskenvald, including its thirteen major provinces, and they provide the player options needed to create thematic and compelling characters either hailing from or destined to this realm of eternal night.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Part 2.</strong> Chapters 8–26 contain a robust and thrilling Folk Horror adventure campaign in which a group of wayward souls becomes stranded in the isolated valley of Wickermoor Hollow and must contend with the malign machinations and minions of the Crooked Queen, taking the characters from level 1 to 14 (and optionally all the way to level 20).</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Part 3.</strong> The appendices provide additional options for GMs to enhance the horror in their games with folkloric monsters, eerie magic items, and a table of Chaotic Curses.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">What Is Folk Horror?</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_weird%20bird.webp\" width=\"100\" /><p class=\"p2\">Despite being so deeply rooted in tradition and old superstition, the term “Folk Horror” is a surprisingly new articulation to describe a nebulously defined genre with a wide variety of media under its umbrella. <em>The Crooked Moon</em> looks to the work of writer and filmmaker Adam Scovell to help define Folk Horror and guide its influence throughout the book.</p><p class=\"p4\">A work of Folk Horror might be one that utilizes folklore to instill a sense of uncanny dread (such as the 2015 film <em>The Witch</em>), presents the clash between the archaic and the modern (such as the 1973 film <em>The Wicker Man</em>), or creates its own folklore by weaving various elements of a culture’s collective consciousness (such as the 2014 series <em>Over the Garden Wall</em>). However, Scovell’s framework of the “Folk Horror Chain” unifies these archetypes and more into a broad but consistent definition.</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Folk Horror Chain</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">To determine what constitutes a Folk Horror story, Adam Scovell denotes four key narrative, thematic, or aesthetic aspects of a work that form a cause-and-effect series of “links” in a chain:</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Landscape.</strong> The first link is the prominence of the landscape or environment, often becoming a living, breathing character of its own. These stories most often take place in rural locations and commonly focus on nature or agriculture. Most importantly, these remote landscapes isolate the characters and communities within them.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Isolation.</strong> The people in these remote environments are cut off from the prevailing society and standard trappings of civilization. Whether a group of several characters or a small community, the folk of these stories find themselves separated from society physically, and most importantly, outside of its dominant ideologies and beliefs. The main action of many Folk Horror stories is initiated by outsiders, often representing modernity or urbanity, interloping into these communities.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Skewed Morality.</strong> In these stories, the isolated communities and groups develop skewed belief systems, often manifesting in an adherence to ancient superstitions, the practice of the occult, or a hostile rejection of the morals of society at large. This strange and warped morality inevitably leads to a horrific action and the final link in the chain.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>The Happening.</strong> Generally, at the climax of these stories, the skewed morality of the isolated groups living in remote landscapes manifests a supernatural or violent happening. This dreadful event might take the form of the summoning of an otherworldly entity, a ritual sacrifice, a demonic or ghostly possession, a bloody murder, or some other act of killing or occultism.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Chain in Practice</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">When defined in this way, Folk Horror is a broad but thematically consistent genre that can include works from any narrative medium, time period, or global culture. The chain encompasses archetypical Folk Horror stories such as the 2019 film <em>Midsommar</em>, as well as unexpected examples like the 1974 film <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre </em>and even genre-bending works like the 2007 film <em>Hot Fuzz</em>.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">While <em>The Crooked Moon</em> leans heavily upon the aesthetics, tropes, archetypes, and plot threads found in quintessential examples of Folk Horror, this book also draws inspiration from the wide umbrella of works encompassed by the Folk Horror Chain, as well as elements of other horror sub-genres such as Gothic Horror, Body Horror, Cosmic Horror, and more. You are encouraged to weave your own inspirations into your campaigns and characters to achieve a cooperative horror story best suited for your table.</span></p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/032_Crooked_Moon_DM_Screen.webp\" /><h2><span class=\"s1\">Folk Horror in Your Game</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Horror as a genre has a notorious reputation for being difficult to execute in a game of heroic fantasy. The goal of this book is to provide as many tools as possible for you to achieve the appropriate level of dread in your game, but there are many additional factors to be mindful of when setting off to weave a dreadful folktale with your friends.</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Aligning on Goals</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Rat.webp\" width=\"100\" /><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">One of the biggest sources of friction between people at a table is a misalignment of what everyone is hoping to achieve in the game. This is especially true when it comes to horror. Some players may want a deeply serious Folk Horror story where the tone and tension is maintained by all at the table. Others may be interested in a more goofy, spooky flavor of horror with plenty of jokes. Certain gamers may prefer to focus on engaging with mechanics and striving for tactically and strategically optimal play.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">These styles of play—and many others—are valid, but if there is a misunderstanding between players and clashing goals, this can lead to interpersonal conflict and soured sessions. Before you begin a campaign that draws from The Crooked Moon, your group should meet for a “Session Zero” to discuss each player’s goals for the game and strive to seek full alignment before the first session so that the game runs smoothly and is as fun as possible for all involved.</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Creating Compelling Characters</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The quality of a Folk Horror story is inextricably tied to the “folk” that feature in it. A story driven by compelling, multi-dimensional, and thematic characters can elevate a fun game of roleplaying into a deeply moving experience you and your friends will remember for the rest of your lives. The adventure campaign included in this book provides a large cast of memorable NPCs, but the most important characters of the story are the protagonists piloted by the players. Below is guidance to create and roleplay unforgettable Player Characters:</p><p class=\"p5\">Collaborate. The character creation process should be a collaborative experience between the players and the GM. Through working together, bouncing ideas back and forth, and iterating on initial concepts, the Player Characters that emerge from the process will be compelling and well-balanced, both thematically and mechanically, and the GM will be well equipped to incorporate character-specific elements into the adventure.</p><p class=\"p5\">Prioritize Theme. The key to an exceptional character is a foundation based on theme first and foremost. Instead of starting with the mechanics of the character sheet, consider what theme you want to exhibit in a Folk Horror story, both aesthetically and narratively. Don’t be afraid to leverage classic archetypes and tropes in fiction and borrow heavily from your favorite characters from various media. This will equip you with plenty of inspiration and ammunition to play a thematically rich and consistent character.</p><p class=\"p5\">Inhabit Your Character. Creating a compelling backstory for your character is useful, but far more important is knowing who they are. Remember that your character is a real person in an imaginary world and not just a collection of statistics, traits, and abilities. If you strive to understand who they are, you will be better equipped to roleplay a wholly realized and multi-faceted character and will know how they would react to any scenario. To help discover who your character is, answer the following questions:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p6\">What are your character’s defining personality traits?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">What ideals drive your character forward?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">What are your character’s flaws?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">What does your character fear and desire most?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">Which archetype best applies to your character?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">How has your character’s past shaped them?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">How would you describe your character without mentioning what they do, what they have, or what they look like?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\">Are there any aspects of your character that are superfluous to the answers to the above questions or are thematically unfitting for a Folk Horror adventure?</span></p></li></ul><h2><span class=\"s1\">Onward to Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">You are now prepared to venture through the Shroud aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> and face the terrors that await you in Druskenvald. Nothing in this book is meant to be prescriptive, and you are encouraged to use its contents in whatever way works best for you and your table. With <em>The Crooked Moon</em> as your guide, you are well-equipped to craft an unforgettable and haunting Folk Horror story with your friends.</p><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:6px;bottom:6px;left:6px;right:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:relative;z-index:3\"><h4><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Comfort and Safety</strong></span></span></h4><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">Many of the themes and topics core to Folk Horror can be deeply distressing for some. While the most disturbing elements of the genre have been greatly diminished, much of the content within The Crooked Moon deals with serious and potentially unsettling themes that should be considered with care and caution to ensure the comfort and safety of everyone at the table. To achieve this, be sure to approach the following topics during your group's Session Zero:</span></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Content Warnings.</strong> The Crooked Moon contains elements of graphic and gory violence, depictions of mental health issues, cultural and religious conflict, endangerment of children and animals, grotesque body horror, family trauma, allusions to suicide, and more. Ensure that all players are aware of what awaits them so you can gauge everyone's comfort levels.</span></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Establishing Boundaries.</strong> Solicit the themes and topics that each player does not wish to engage with in the game. Once established, these boundaries should always be honored and considered hard lines that are never crossed.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Safety Tools.</strong> Utilize safety tools that are understood by everyone at the table, empowering players to safely flag when they're uncomfortable without judgment and enabling the GM to change topic, pause the scene, fade to black, or otherwise steer the game away from the source of discomfort.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Regular Check-Ins.</strong> Make sure that all players check in regularly to gauge ongoing comfort levels and establish open and active communication to ensure that everyone feels heard.</span></p></div></div>"

A once-vibrant forest has fallen to a virulent blight that consumes trees, animals, and people alike—threatening to seed all life with rapidly spreading decay. Deep in the heart of the dying woodland, the Beast of Blight nurtures this rot, delivering death laced with the promise of rebirth. Those willing to endure the poisonous reaches of Hartsblight Forest must unearth and purge the source of the blight to put a stop to the spreading menace before it turns all to rot.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Hartsblight Forest was once a lush and verdant woodland at the edge of Wickermoor Hollow known as the Greenwood, home to a community of antlered, deerlike satyrs that cared for its flora and fauna. Now, it is a rotten place putrefied by Hartsblight, a fungal infection that brings decay to all living things.</p><p class=\"p7\">The first to surrender to the corruption of the blight was a young satyr named Farryn of the Greenwood, who followed the call of a dead primeval god to the origin of Hartsblight. Driven by the desperation of love, loss, and the hope for rebirth, she embraced the rot and forever changed into a monstrous embodiment of decay.</p><p class=\"p7\">Discarding the remaining shreds of who she once was, Farryn took the name of Gorthos, the Beast of Blight. This newly formed abomination spread rot through the forest, turning its plants, animals, and peoples to putrefaction. Now, Gorthos turns her attention to the lands beyond Hartsblight Forest, seeking to impart the blight upon all of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Infectious fungal spores drift from the tree line of Hartsblight Forest, rapidly spreading through Wickermoor Hollow. The only way to put an end to the advancing disease is to seek out and purge the source of the Hartsblight. Characters drawn to Hartsblight Forest by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have the following goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Follow the trail of fungal spores to Hartsblight Forest.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Find the source of the disease.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Gorthos, the Beast of Blight.</p></li></ul><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_ADV_HARTSBLIGHTFOREST_Gorthos.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the motives and history of Gorthos, the Beast of Blight, so that encounters between her and the characters are filled with tension. Understand the features of Hartsblight Forest and the effects of the blight to properly convey the oppressive nature of the diseased forest. Finally, a review of the climactic encounter, “Reign of Decay,” will ensure an intense and cathartic conclusion.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 8 characters.</p></div>"

        "The Beast of Blight": {
          "name": "The Beast of Blight",
          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap18\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Beast of Blight</p><p><span class=\"s7\">Gorthos was once a satyr devoted to the mystic rhythms of nature. As the Beast of Blight, she now spreads Hartsblight throughout Wickermoor Hollow. She believes that through death, decay, and the “Emerald Rebirth”—her distant dream where the world returns in its pure, green state—she can bring back her lost love, Gwenna. As the beast wallows in heartache in her den, decay creeps forth with the assistance of her zealous minions, every strained and sickly breath burdened by longing and the slow, relentless promise of entropy.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Farryn of the Greenwood</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Gorthos_and_Farryn.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Farryn was raised to follow the Old Ways. In the deep recesses of the Greenwood, her people—a circle of antlered satyr druids—revered the endless cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Knowing she would return to nature’s fold in time, Farryn was a devout student, tending to the old and new growth of the woods with boundless joy. She lived by the natural laws, her spirit bright and strong, and joined her kin in sacred songs and worship of the wild.</p><p class=\"p7\">The druids of the Greenwood believed that personal attachment was unnatural and would only lead tenders of the wild astray in their devotion to the endless cycle. Farryn shared this belief until she met a young human woman named Gwenna, who had traveled into the forest from Wickermoor Village. A worshiper of the Patient Lady, Gwenna held an innocent idealism that Farryn found infectious, believing that nature’s harmony could bring an end to the wicked witchcraft that hung over the neighboring Wytchwood.</p><p class=\"p7\">Although Farryn did not believe such a thing was possible, she offered Gwenna her help in exploring the Greenwood. The pair wove through the trees near the border of the Wytchwood, sharing stories, secrets, and a love that quickly blossomed. Farryn kept her new beloved hidden from her community, knowing that the druids would brand her as an oath breaker. But it mattered not; the young satyr had found a purpose more precious and beautiful than even the natural world.</p><p class=\"p7\">It was not long until Gwenna would pay for her naïve idealism. Less than a year after their first meeting, Farryn found her love on the forest floor, half eaten by a ravenous wolf monstrosity twisted by the malign power of the Crooked Queen. The druid drove off the beast, but it was too late. Gwenna had fed the creatures of the wood and would return to the earth, as decreed by the natural cycle. However, Farryn refused to accept Gwenna’s fate, overwhelmed with the agony of loss. In this moment of defiance and rejection of the natural cycle, she heard the call of Gorthos.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Gorthos, the Dead God</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">The voice of an ancient Fey god reached Farryn, calling her deep into the forgotten heart of the Greenwood with ragged, sickly whispers and the strained bleats of dying deer. She followed, carrying Gwenna’s body to a hidden cave overgrown with fungus. Within was the enormous corpse of an ancient stag. These putrid remains would not return to the earth, instead enduring decay without end.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">This colossal heap of rotting flesh, fur, and bone was all that remained of Gorthos—a dead Fey god of decay from the forgotten age of the Green Queen. He told Farryn of the lost eons, when Kehlenn was pure and untwisted. A time when her realm was green with renewal. Gorthos was captive in his den, just as the Crooked Queen was captive to her misguided desire for vengeance and unnatural, crooked corruption. But an Emerald Rebirth, he knew, could restore him and the queen as they were before. Gwenna would also be restored, and she and Farryn could spend an eternity together in a vibrant world of green.</p><p class=\"p7\">Farryn shared the dead god’s dream and understood what she must do. Over many weeks, she ate his rotting flesh, taking in his knowledge, his power, his purpose, and his name. As she feasted, she rotted, changed, and grew. Each bite of Gorthos’s decaying flesh was added to her own form until the stag was no more, and she had become a huge, putrid abomination.</p><p class=\"p7\">Farryn then carried Gwenna’s deeply decayed body to the Greenwood’s sacred wellspring that nourished all living things in the forest. She laid Gwenna in the waters, a final offering to the god she had consumed—the god she had become. As Gwenna’s body submerged, the pool spoiled, spewing forth an explosive bloom of spores that would seed all life in the wood with Hartsblight.</p><p class=\"p7\">As the rot spread, she retreated to her putrid den and became one with the blight, filled with bitter hope that the death and decay of all things, even the Crooked Queen herself, would restart the natural cycle in an Emerald Rebirth. Then and only then might she see Gwenna again.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Parley with the Beast</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Gorthos is bound to her den deep within Hartsblight Forest but can speak through creatures that have succumbed to the blight, her voice raspy and thin. She views the characters as potential new hosts of the Hartsblight that can leave the confines of the wood and spread the decay across Druskenvald. She shares her vision of the Emerald Rebirth with emotionless certainty, seeking the characters’ acceptance of the blight without threats or aggression. However, Gorthos is prepared to kill the characters and remake them in her image should they ultimately refuse.</p><p class=\"p7\">Throughout this chapter, there are multiple opportunities for the characters to parley with Gorthos through a dying creature—a rotting stag carcass (area F1), the slain Halden Wreath (area F4), and a blighted gloomwood (area F8). Additionally, Gorthos can project her image to any point in the forest and can approach the characters when they attempt to rest within Hartsblight Forest (see “The Shadowing Beast” later in this chapter).</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Druids of Rot</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The deerlike satyrs that once followed the Old Ways in the Greenwood now zealously worship Gorthos, serving as her chief agents in spreading her rot. These druids have been spared the slow and agonizing death and decay of the Hartsblight in exchange for the power to wield it and weave it through the woodland. They perform primeval rituals from eons past to quicken the spread of the sickness and deepen its effect, all united in the pursuit of the Emerald Rebirth.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">The Hartsblight</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Hartsblight is a rotting fungal disease that decays the body of any plant or creature it infects, spread by the will of Gorthos and her minions.

When the characters arrive, there is concern that Sister Rain (see chapter 11) has not yet shown up to lead the group in the pre-meal prayer.</p><p class=\"p7\">These concerns are justified when Sister Rain (Neutral good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmPriest00000000]{Priest}</strong>) finally appears toward the end of the gathering, her face strained with deep concern. She has just returned from a visit to a commune north of Moonsong Lake that had been established by fellow members of the Fold of the Patient Lady, announcing that their crops have begun to fail and their livestock have fallen ill.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s10\">Sister Rain attempted to assist the commune, but the affliction was beyond her ability to heal. Even worse, while she was treating an ill member of the commune, she experienced a sudden vivid hallucination of sprawling forests with brilliant emerald trees, its boughs filled with countless watching faces. By the time the vision faded, she was already a full night’s travel back to Wickermoor Village.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">She asks the characters to do what they can to help the commune, as she fears the threat is beyond any of the Patient Lady’s faithful.

Each creature within 60 feet of the keeper must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 17]] saving throw or gain 1 Hartsblight level and be stunned until the end of its next turn as its mind is overwhelmed with a hallucination.

Obsessed with tales of archfey, he ventured into Hartsblight Forest seeking the fabled Tall Man (see chapter 26), who had once danced through the Greenwood before it fell to blight. He met his end to a pair of rotting owlbears (see “Shrieking Death” earlier in this chapter) in an unwitting sacrifice to Gorthos.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Shrine to Gorthos.</strong></em> The tree has been marked by druids of the blight as a sacred site to Gorthos. It strengthens the Hartsblight that infects those suffering here and bends magic itself. Using magic to remove Hartsblight from its victims does the opposite: the target of the magic instead gains 1 Hartsblight level.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>The Corpse.</strong></em> A character who examines the corpse and succeeds on a [[/check NAT DC 15]] or [[/check MED DC 15]] check determines that the man was killed by large claws and beaks. The fungal growth that covers him seems far too advanced for how long the body has been dead. Shortly after a character investigates the corpse of Halden Wreath, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Suddenly, the fungus-covered corpse shudders as a crack rings out from the tree it is slumped against.

His arms dangle limply, and his moldy lower jaw hangs open, unmoving. Yet, you hear a familiar raspy feminine voice speak from the corpse. “Do you not see the beauty in the decay?”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Parley with the Beast.</strong></em> Gorthos speaks with the characters once more. She uses this opportunity to position herself as a force against the Crooked Queen in the hopes that the characters will understand their inevitable deaths and rebirth. She is uncaring toward the death of Halden and does not respond to threats.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What do you want?</strong> “The land is poisoned with vengeance and trapped in unending death. Only an Emerald Rebirth can put an end to this misery.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What does the ‘Emerald Rebirth’ mean? </strong>“It is the natural conclusion.

We shall all live and flourish in the green together, and we will know peace.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>The blight shows us visions—what are they?</strong> “The blight gives us green dreams with those it readies for rebirth. The green awaits us all, and the visions show us what has been, what is, and what’s to come.”</p><p class=\"p5\">When the will of Gorthos departs, the severed torso of Halden comes free from the tree, hitting the ground with a sickening splat.</p></div>"

She did not expect the characters to survive so deep in the forest, and now sees them as potential heralds of blight that can move beyond the confines of the forest to spread decay:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What if we refuse to allow this?</strong> “Such a choice does not exist.

Fix your gaze on the brilliant, many-colored lanterns and the ever-grinning Chuckles the Clown! Those cries in the night? Simply howls of delight, nothing more. The Fallen are defeated! The Fool’s Day Festival will be happy. It must be happy. The parade is coming, and you will be so, <em>soooo</em> happy.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>The Fool’s Day Festival consumes Wickermoor Village, led by Chuckles, Lord of Fools. This wicked clown has a perverse death wish and seeks to goad the characters into slaying him as his own ritual sacrifice. While he brings joy to the townsfolk, Chuckles delights in mocking the characters, belittling their previous exploits, and even attacking villagers they care about, so long as it brings them one step closer to killing him. The characters’ goals are:</p><ul><li><p>Play carnival games to earn tickets.</p></li><li><p>Rescue the forced revelers through tickets or combat or by severing their enchantments.</p></li><li><p>Free Phillip and Adela Druskenvald from their forced revelry.</p></li><li><p>Destroy Chuckles, the Lord of Fools.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, you should review Wickermoor Hollow’s townsfolk (see “Forced Revelers” below) to decide the most compelling NPCs to include in this chapter. Read through the festival events (see “Festival of Fools Locations” below) so you can smoothly run games for the characters. Finally, study the climactic battle, “Parade of Fools,” to fill the encounter with menace and hilarity.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 10th level characters.</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap21 middle-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Lord of Fools</p><p>Chuckles, Lord of Fools, is an evil spirit in clownish guise. He dances and cavorts as the malevolent jester of the Horned King, tormenting mortals for his master’s vile amusement. Chuckles’s true form is a grotesque balloon with a leering clown’s face, draped in multicolored ribbons, usually resting atop a maypole. This totem projects a puppet-like jester illusion that calls itself Chuckles, luring victims into a false sense of security.</p><h2>Tears of a Clown</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Chuckles.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>Once, long ago, a troupe of performers roamed the lands of Druskenvald. Each had their role: Bjorn the Horned Bear, Apia the Queen Bee, Chateau the Dancing Manor, Libro the Singing Tome, Cloche the Chiming Bell, and Cicogna the Stilted Stork. Leading them all was Chuckles the Great Fool.</p><p>Though Chuckles played the merry fool on stage, his heart was heavy, for his troupe, though beloved, was starving and impoverished. Clowning brought little coin. His tears caught the attention of the woman with a crooked smile, who whispered of a wonderful king who could erase his troubles if he would become his jester.</p><p>Desperate, Chuckles followed the Crooked Queen into the Wytchwood and communed with the Horned King, whose power grew each year. Chuckles, driven by despair, would do anything for his troupe.</p><p>“Anything?” asked the Horned King.</p><p>“Anything,” said Chuckles, foolishly.</p><p>“Forever?” asked the Horned King.</p><p>“Forever,” said Chuckles, sealing his doom.</p><p>Chuckles is now nothing more than a spirit dancing futilely at the right hand of the Horned King, yearning for death’s sweet release. If Chuckles frees his king, he too is set free. For ages, he has danced, waiting for the Fallen to be sacrificed. Now, he has arranged to be the final sacrifice for the Horned King, just as Adela Druskenvald will be for the Crooked Queen.</p><p>This masterstroke will prepare the Horned King’s spirit for incarnation through Phillip Druskenvald (see chapter 8), releasing Chuckles from his cursed servitude and letting him dance into the night one last time.</p><h2>Parley with THE FOOL</h2><p>The Lord of Fools views life as a cruel, endless joke, trapped in a wretched role as the Horned King’s jester. He craves not just the characters’ participation in his games but their hatred. Their wrath and other deadly sins are the true feast for the Horned King.</p><p>These are some responses to common questions the characters may ask of this wicked clown:</p><p><strong>Who Are You?</strong> “Sweet sweeties, I’m Chuckles the Great Fool! There isn’t a person alive who doesn’t love my japes ‘n jokes. So if you don’t… then you must already be dead!”</p><p><strong>How Do You Know Us?</strong> “Why wouldn’t we know who you are? You’re known far and wide as the heroes who are finally cleaning up Wickymoor Hollow!” (Chuckles is an agent of the Horned King and has been using <em>Scrying</em> to observe the characters.)</p><p><strong>Why Are You Happy to See Us?</strong> “I’m a kooky-crazy clown, sillies! And it’s festy-val time! Can’t I enjoy my own party?” (The characters are his only hope of escaping his torturous existence as the Horned King’s jester!)</p><p><strong>What is this Festival?</strong> “Fool’s Day is a way to escape the sad-sad-suffering of this sad-sad-world. Don’t you want people to be happy? Besides, this year’s festy-val is speci-all.” (Fool’s Day is an age-old tradition, but this one is special.)</p><p><strong>Special, Huh?</strong> “Because of you, my hip-hip-heroes! You’re the guests of honor! The cream of the crop! The slayers of the fabulous Fallen! We’ve never had killers like you in our midst!” (This is the unvarnished truth. Even if it’s omitting the bit about the ritual.)</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_FOOLS_Seeking%20out%20the%20Revelers_Finished-LARGE%20VERSION.webp\" alt=\"\" /></div>"

In their place, stalls, stages, and booths have been set up for a festival. When the festival ends, they are once again in their original locations.</p><p><em><strong>Finger Food Flood.</strong></em> All buildings are filled to their ceilings with scotch eggs and hand pies, blocking and preventing entry.</p><p><em><strong>Hard to Navigate.</strong></em> Roads and walkways leading away from the festival are treated as difficult terrain (see area C4).

The stalls are gone. Only the maypole remains, its leering clown face perched above.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Chuckles sits atop the grotesque balloon, but it’s not his squeaky voice you hear. Instead, the maypole booms in a deep, growling baritone: “And now, our grand finale. We trust you’ve come to hate us, since we tailored our pranks and pratfalls just for you! Isn’t that right, everyone?” The crowd cheers.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>“Yes! Three cheers for the heroes whose murders have primed the Horned King’s grand entrance! All that’s left is to kill you… or me. Either way, what an entrance.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>At least three revelers dance around the maypole. When this fight begins, check how many of the captured villagers (see “Forced Revelers” earlier in this chapter) were not saved. They are present here and are magically compelled to dance around the maypole with their masks removed, screaming for help. These minions, whether compelled captives or not, use the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.FqcgFfeQkIDWCLak]{Herald of Fools}</strong>* stat block, except they have 30 hit points and lack the Multiattack action.</p><p>Any townsfolk here as forced revelers only break away from the maypole and attack if the characters harm them first. Otherwise, they continue dancing until Chuckles is defeated.</p><h2>Festival Influence</h2><p>The frantic energy of the revelry peaks as the battle is joined and takes on a life of its own. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the revelry causes one of the following effects; it can’t choose the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><p><strong>Join the Dance.</strong> If there are fewer than three heralds of fools in the battle, one herald of fools (using the adjustments noted above) dances out of the crowd and joins the fight. It acts on the same initiative count as the other heralds, or if there are none, on initiative count 20.</p><p><strong>Ribbon Bind.</strong> Ribbons, streamers, or pennants animate and bind up to two creatures in the town square. Each target must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 15]] saving throw or have a speed of 0. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect ends early if the revelry uses this option again.</p><p><strong>Snack Pelting.</strong> Carnival foods fling from the crowd and pelt a creature in the square. The creature has a −2 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws to maintain concentration until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/21-2_Ring_of_Fools.webp\" alt=\"\" /></div>"

Though slain one by one, the Vermintoll Coven has returned, reborn with the malignant power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen. Despite their hatred for one another, the three vile hags have been fused together as one horrific abomination. They now twist the potent dreams of the clairvoyant Adela Druskenvald to fulfill her foretold fate. The house cannot be cleansed and must be destroyed along with the coven to bring the terrors to an end.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">With the destruction of the Fallen and the sacrifice of the Lord of Fools, the next step of the prophesized ritual to turn the Horned King to flesh and free the Crooked Queen from her prison is the sacrifice of Adela Druskenvald. However, her inevitable burning in the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise can only occur once her body, mind, and soul have been prepared.</p><p class=\"p7\">These preparations were the wicked purpose of the Vermintoll Coven before they were slaughtered. However, their malefic spirits lingered, and Kehlenn returned them to abominable life to utilize their twisted magic one last time. Now, they have pulled Adela Druskenvald’s prophetic dreams into the Crooked House, weaving them with Kehlenn’s primeval power deep in the earth below to turn the entire home into a waking nightmare that has shattered reality itself.</p><p class=\"p7\">After watching the characters throughout their trials and tribulations in Wickermoor Hollow, the Crooked Man waits for them inside his old home in hopes of adding more sacrifices to the pyre. He knows he will be given a new body just like his Horned King. The night has come for him to incarnate as the Wicker Man, and he only need delay the would-be heroes a little longer.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">The Crooked House has reawakened with the rebirth of the Vermintoll Coven in their new amalgamative form. The Crooked Man has trapped the Druskenvalds—once again—and the Jenkins within the house. Characters who enter the nightmare have these goals:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Approach Druskenvald Manor and ensure the safety of Dani Jenkin.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Enter the Crooked House, confront the Crooked Man, and witness it shatter into the Crooked Nightmare.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Venture through the horrific dreamscapes, rescuing Walter Jenkin, Gilly Jenkin, and Phillip Druskenvald along the way.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Confront the hags of the Vermintoll Coven in the attic of the Crooked House and destroy the Coven Abomination.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, refresh yourself on the major NPCs, all of which the characters have previously encountered: the Druskenvalds, the Jenkin family, the Vermintoll Coven, and the Crooked Man. Read through the locations and dreamscapes of the Crooked Nightmare to better improvise each encounter.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 11 characters.</p></div>"

She explains that Frederick, her doll, is a toy version of a one-eyed beast that looks like a mix between a turkey and dinosaur.</p><p class=\"p7\">She becomes increasingly nervous if the characters approach, telling them that Frederick is very hungry and wants to devour their flesh. She whispers that Frederick will devour her flesh if she lets go of him. She is scared and doesn’t know what to do. Use map 22.2 for combat in this area.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Little Adela.</strong></em> The mole on the girl’s right cheek seems familiar. A character who succeeds on a [[/check INV DC 15]] check deduces this must be Adela Druskenvald as a child.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Frederick.</strong></em> When a character moves within 5 feet of Adela’s stuffed creature, it instantly transforms into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.fuJHMByh1BJraTQi]{Gobblegeist}</strong><span class=\"s11\">*</span> and attacks the characters. When the gobblegeist is reduced to 0 hit points, it reverts to a stuffed toy.</p><p class=\"p7\">After Frederick is defeated, little Adela apologizes for her imaginary friend and blames the “Bad Bug Lady.” At this mention, the cackling voice of Stonoga Blackstinger fills the clearing.

The target must succeed on a [[/save DEX DC 17]] saving throw or take [[/damage 2d10 fire]]{11 (2d10)} Fire damage. If Gilly is targeted, the number of rounds she can survive decreases by 1. These bursts continue until all characters have left the area or died.</p><p class=\"p7\">When all three chains are removed, Gilly falls free from the spit. If she is alive, she is terrified and in pain. She reacts as if hearing a voice that the characters can’t. She calls out to her daughter Dani, who pulls her out of the dream in a swirl of blue mist.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Roast Gobblegeist.</strong></em> The roasting beast on the spit is the monstrous form of the creature that little Adela had called Frederick.

They’re calling us home!” Use map 22.3 for combat in this area.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Teenage Adela.</strong></em> The voice clearly belongs to Adela Druskenvald (Neutral, human noncombatant <span class=\"s7\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong></span>), though a decade older than her form in the forest. When she arrives at the pulsing meteorite, she stares at it with awe and beckons the characters to join her so they can all travel beyond the stars together.

A Charmed creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it takes damage, or at the start of its turns while it can’t see the meteorite, ending the effect on a success.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Characters who speak Deep Speech can puzzle out that the whispers are inviting them on a trip through the stars to realms beyond comprehension, but such a voyage requires leaving their bodies behind. Only their minds can make the trip.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Space Invaders.</strong></em> The first time a character moves within 5 feet of the meteorite, it cracks and an <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.grit0JinU8cmNnSN]{Invader Out of Space}</strong><span class=\"s11\">*</span> rises from within, attacking the characters until it’s destroyed. Any Disrupting Touch attacks that hit creatures Charmed by Whispers From Beyond are critical hits. Creatures killed from damage in this way are turned to dust except for their brain or equivalent organ responsible for thought.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Fallen Star.</strong></em> On Initiative count 20 (losing Initiative ties), the cracked meteorite pulses with its strange, alien colors. Creatures within 60 feet of the fallen star that can see the colors must succeed on a [[/save INT DC 15]] saving throw or roll on the Fallen Star table to determine the alien experience and its effect.

At this mention, the shrill screech of Golub Graygullet fills the air, and Adela rockets upward into the night sky, shrieking as she disappears into a twinkling star.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Crooked Door.</strong></em> Once Adela disappears, a crooked door rises from the crack in the fallen star. The characters must climb up the 7-foot-tall meteorite to reach the door, which leads to area N5.

She gloats that Adela never learned how to control the powerful mind that she didn’t deserve, and it has led to her doom. The hag disappears if she takes any damage. Even if the characters don’t attack Golub, roll Initiative!</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Decanter.</strong></em> The glass decanter has Immunity to all damage and can’t be moved. Its stopper can’t be removed by any means from outside, but it can easily be pressed up from within if Walter chooses to escape. However, the mental torture that he is suffering makes him unaware of this solution and unable to do anything but impotently bang on the glass in agonized desperation.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Wisp.</strong></em> Even if the characters previously killed the malicious ketgrinn during the events of the Crooked House (see chapter 12), this nightmare version of Wisp has stolen Walter’s voice once more. Now colossal, Wisp grins and speaks with not just the voice of Walter, but also Gilly, Dani, Mayor Somerton, and other townsfolk as you see fit. He spews vicious words to keep the man paralyzed in self-loathing.</p><p class=\"p7\">Wisp looks into the bookshelf with only his head and paws visible, attacking the characters as he wraps Walter in despair. He uses the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSphinxOfLore00]{Sphinx of Lore} </strong>stat block with the following changes: his alignment is Chaotic Evil, his size is Gargantuan, his creature type is Fey, and his Claw attacks deal Psychic damage. Wisp vanishes with a yowl if reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Saving Walter.</strong></em> The liquor level continually rises in the great decanter imprisoning Walter. He is terrified and clutches his head in agony. On Initiative count 0 (losing Initiative ties) on the 10th round, Walter drowns in the liquor.</p><p class=\"p7\">Only Walter can save himself, but he can’t do it alone. He can be snapped out of his nightmare-induced powerlessness by appealing to the most defining aspect of his personality: his sense of loyalty. This can be accomplished through encouragement or by him seeing those he cares about in grave danger. He starts with loyalty 0, and he gains loyalty when any of the following occur:</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Rally (Gain 1 Loyalty).</strong> An attack made against Wisp scores a Critical Hit.</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Resolve (Gain 1 Loyalty).</strong> An attack against a character scores a Critical Hit, or a character fails a saving throw Wisp forced.</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Victory (Gain 3 Loyalty).</strong> Wisp is reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Encourage (Gain 1 Loyalty).</strong> As an Influence action, a character succeeds on a DC 20 ability check using one of these approaches, or any other that you deem appropriate:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">[[/check DEC DC 20]]{Charisma (Deception)} to distract Wisp from unleashing more mental torture.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">[[/check PER DC 20]]{Charisma (Persuasion)} or [[/check INT DC 20]]{Charisma (Intimidation)} to inspire him to block out the verbal abuse or to pull himself together.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">[[/check HIS DC 20]]{Intelligence (History)} or [[/check NAT DC 20]]{ Intelligence(Nature)} to use logic to help Walter realize that the nightmare is full of lies.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">When his loyalty reaches 6, Walter snaps himself out of his tortured inaction. He pushes the glass stopper out of the decanter and climbs out, horrifically shaken and scarred but alive. He reacts as if hearing a voice only he can hear and calls out to his daughter Dani, who pulls him from the nightmare in a burst of blue mist.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Crooked Door.</strong></em> After Walter Jenkin escapes or dies, a crooked door appears in an image of Wisp’s enormous grin of sharp teeth.

Though Kehlenn’s influence has been severed from the land, her imprisonment within the Crooked Moon above did not put an end to her primeval power. The defeated archfey seeks her final revenge: the total destruction of the realm she once ruled. Her leering gaze settles on Wickermoor Hollow for the last time, awakening eight ancient beings of immense power to bring the moon crashing down upon Druskenvald, destroying everyone and everything within.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s5\">With Kehlenn’s defeat at the Crooked Tree, a fragile peace has settled over Wickermoor Hollow, but it is a peace born of fear and uncertainty. Even in the face of victory, the people of the valley have been forever changed by the horrors that have occurred over the past weeks and months. While many inhabitants of the valley may not know the events that occurred in the Wytchwood and how close the Horned King came to annihilating them, they all soon learn of the new doom descending from above.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">The moon’s grin has curled into a sneer as it wakes eight eons-old powers still tethered to the land. With the promise of a transformation of the domain into their own image, these mythic beings call the moon down from the night sky to eventually crash into Wickermoor Hollow. The resulting cataclysm would destroy the whole of Druskenvald and remake it as Kehlenn and her champions see fit. The characters must act quickly, or all they have fought to save will be lost with the moon’s apocalyptic embrace.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Endgame</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">This optional chapter offers guidance for leading level 13 characters to the pinnacle of 20th level, providing the inspiration to craft challenging and harrowing encounters that will test their might and resolve. This chapter is aimed at tables that favor epic tiers of play and want to experience grandiose stakes of high fantasy.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s5\">If you wish to continue the campaign after the main events of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>, this chapter presents a flexible framework that challenges players while maintaining the unsettling dread central to folk horror. If you plan on following this path, the characters should not reach level 14 after defeating the Horned King. Instead, each character increases one ability score of their choice by 2. This increase can’t raise a score above 24.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">Characters who seek to prevent Kehlenn’s final vengeance have the following goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Seek out each of the eight awakened powers of Wickermoor Hollow.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy them and sever their tether to the Crooked Moon.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Banish Kehlenn to the Crooked Moon for all time.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Many of the specifics of how the characters embark on this final adventure will be up to you to decide.

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap26\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Moon is Falling</p><p>One terrible night, the Crooked Moon lets out a horrific shriek and speaks with Kehlenn’s voice, delivering a message that echoes across Wickermoor Hollow: the moon shall fall, and doom will come in thirteen nights. Slowly but surely, the moon begins to grow larger in the sky as it descends toward the valley.</p><p class=\"p6\">The inhabitants of Wickermoor Hollow react in a variety of ways—some turn to panic, others to prayer, and surprisingly, many resign themselves to the end. However, most are too preoccupied with the destructive effects of the eight evils that have risen and the horrors they’ve unleashed upon the land. This development will stress or empower the relationships that the characters have nurtured during their time in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Impending Doom</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The characters must now hunt down these emerging evils, racing against time as each victory delays the moon’s fall—but not its inevitable approach. Further, every moment wasted allows the once-dormant threats to grow in power and cause mass destruction ahead of the impending apocalypse.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Countdown to Extinction</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">As soon as the Crooked Moon begins falling, it will crash into Wickermoor Hollow in exactly thirteen nights. If this occurs, the resulting collision and explosion of primordial energy annihilates the entirety of Druskenvald, including the characters if they are still within the realm when the moon makes impact. This ends the campaign.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Achieving Victory.</strong></em> The only way to prevent Druskenvald’s downfall is to kill all eight of the ancient evils bound to Wickermoor Hollow and reject Kehlenn’s final bargain. This returns the Crooked Moon to its rightful place in the sky and ensures that the Crooked Queen is powerless forever.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Tracking Time.</strong></em> As each of the thirteen nights progresses, keep track of how many nights are left before the inevitable collision. Clearly describe to the players that the moon is growing larger in the sky and its face is growing more menacing. Also, consider how the people of the valley act in the face of a seemingly inevitable death.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Delaying the Inevitable.</strong></em> Each time one of the ancient evils is slain, the descent of the moon stops for 24 hours. This means that if the characters continually kill the powerful enemies before them, they have a full twenty nights to stop the doom.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Turn Back Time.</strong></em> If you wish to give the characters additional time or believe they have earned help, the Vagrant arrives right before the collision and aids them. He plays a powerful song on his fiddle that turns back time 72 hours, buying the characters three additional nights. Due to the timeless nature of the ancient evils, any of them killed before or during this reverted time remain dead.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>The Old Fears</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Eight fearsome beings bound to the land of Wickermoor Hollow stir and rise to power, having felt the gaze of the Crooked Moon upon them.

Due to corruption at the highest levels of the town’s leadership, this headsman was falsely accused of murder, dragged through an unjust trial, and beheaded before the whole town. While its townsfolk exclaimed justice, the blood that spilled on the soil bound the centaur’s spirit to the fields. With the power of the Crooked Moon, the Galloping Headsman thunders through the farmland, seeking justice against his killers’ descendants, whipping them up in a frenzy of paranoia that spelled his doom so many years ago.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Hysteria in Foxwillow</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The distrust sown by the secrets revealed during the Harvest Terror’s attack has boiled into all-out conflict, plunging the farming community into mass hysteria. A farmer from the town seeks out the characters and tells them that neighbor has turned against neighbor, and folks are being condemned to death by beheading. The executioner is rumored to be a spirit of fiery wrath that rides to meet each of the condemned, lops off their heads, and adds them to its collection.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Fields of Vengeance</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The fertile farmland around Foxwillow—so easily corrupted by the demonic influence of Raum—craves vengeance and has come to life under the ghastly influence of the Galloping Headsman.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Stone Pressing.</strong></em> The earth itself opens up, attempting to swallow the accused and crush them with the stones within. For every mile traveled, characters must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 17]] saving throw or fall into a sinkhole and have the &amp;reference[restrained apply=false] condition. While Restrained in this way, a character takes [[/damage 1d8 bludgeoning]]{4 (1d8)} Bludgeoning damage at the start of each of their turns.

While Grappled in this way, the character gains 1 &amp;reference[exhaustion apply=false] level at the end of each of their turns. A character who can't be Charmed succeeds automatically. The crops have AC 5; HP 10; Vulnerability to Fire damage; Immunity to Bludgeoning and Psychic damage.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Mob Injustice</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">When the characters arrive at the Foxwillow Farmland, they find its people are Hostile to them, accusing them of witchcraft, murder, sabotage, and of causing the incoming apocalypse. Some cunning townsfolk even attempt to act as friends to earn their trust before turning them over to frenzied mobs.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Vengeful Wrath.</strong></em> The wrathful emotion of the Galloping Headsman spreads like a virulent plague. Whenever a character comes within 20 feet of a Foxwillow villager, the character must succeed on a [[/save CHA DC 17]] saving throw or lose the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. On a success, the character is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Wandering Mob.</strong></em> Roving gangs of vigilantes hunt the characters in the hopes of capturing, imprisoning, trying, and executing them.

She was a malevolent maiden who sought apocalypse, and her fiendish dabbling made her the prime candidate for Kehlenn’s first sacrifice.

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap01\"><h1 class=\"section\">The Land Between<br />Life and Death</h1><p>Druskenvald <em>(DRUSK‑in‑vahld)</em> is a realm that exists outside the lands of the mortal and material. Enveloped in a seemingly endless expanse of eldritch gloom, it exists in a paradoxical state of limbo between the warring furies of life and death. Beyond the misty borders of this domain may lie countless worlds and afterlives, but Druskenvald stands apart—a self-contained demiplane where the living, dead, and everything in between can coexist.</p><p class=\"p2\">Within these confines is a landmass hewn into the shape of a crescent moon and a dark and roiling sea that stretches from its eastern coastline until it disappears into the haze. Looming mountain peaks to the north and south flank the lands between, forming an enormous continent-sized valley that nonsensically spans numerous environments in a relatively short distance and never experiences the turn of a season. The laws of nature and logic have no dominion over a place that is just as much nightmare and folktale as it is a land to explore.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The mystifying nature of Druskenvald is made most apparent by the thirteen major provinces that comprise it. As if pulled from a child’s storybook featuring a broad collection of varying tales, each of these territories has a wholly distinct biome, topography, and climate. From forest to moor, desert to tundra, swamp to farmland, they all exist side by side like a collection of bizarre patches stitched together upon a grandmother’s quilt. Despite the uniqueness of each Druskenvaldian patch, travel between provinces is not especially difficult, and borders can be crossed with a simple step.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_TimeTable_Cuckoo%20clock.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h2><span class=\"s2\">Night of the Crooked Moon</span></h2><p class=\"p1\">In Druskenvald, the sun never rises. Instead, the land is bathed in an orange glow from the horizon for a few brief hours at the height of dusk, only to be swallowed by the encroaching darkness that dominates the rest of the night.</p><p class=\"p2\">The Crooked Moon, an eternal crescent with the visage of a leering hag, hangs eternally overhead. Its light waxes and wanes with the cycle of each night as it moves through the sky with no discernible pattern, casting long, creeping shadows. At times, it looms large in the sky, its baleful eye glowering over the land with malicious intent. At other times, it shrinks to a small sliver nearly lost in the night sky, leaving the land blanketed in total darkness.</p><p class=\"p2\">The people of Druskenvald have adapted to their peculiar 24-hour “day” cycle from the Twilight Hour through the Witching Hour, dividing their time according to the shifting light in their own ways. Some rise as soon as the golden glow of the hidden sun shows itself above the horizon and settle in before the most treacherous hours of night. Others only wake during true darkness. While they may not agree on how to honor Druskenvald’s time, all peoples and provinces have aligned on the same naming conventions for the phases of each passing night.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Before Druskenvald became the harrowing realm it is today, it was a place of vibrant life and rebirth, ruled by Kehlenn <em>(KEH‑linn)</em>, the Green Queen. This afterlife demiplane was an enormous forest, teeming with “green magic” that facilitated the natural cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Mortal souls would journey here to be reincarnated as plants, animals, and other natural beings, contributing to the eternal cycle.</p><p class=\"p3\">Kehlenn was a Fey queen, neither benevolent nor malevolent, but a guardian of this natural order. She believed in the sanctity of the cycle, where each death brought forth new life, and the essence of the departed merged with the vibrant flora and fauna of the realm. Her dominion was one of serene balance, where the natural world thrived in an endless loop of renewal, untouched by the corrupting influences of sentient ambition and desire.</p><p class=\"p3\">Kehlenn’s vision of peace reigned until Phillip Druskenvald arrived. Where he came from and how he discovered this realm of rebirth is forgotten to all including Phillip himself, but his appearance initiated a cataclysmic conflict that left Kehlenn a hollow shell of her former self. The once lush forest became the fog-shrouded landscape of Druskenvald. Kehlenn, now the Crooked Queen, retreated to the deepest and darkest wood within Wickermoor Hollow, a minor province and the only one not under the dominion of Phillip and his Crescent Court.</p><p class=\"p3\">In this weakened state, she lingers nearly dormant as she waits to reclaim her domain. Her bitterness festers, and she whispers the words of the Old Ways to those who will listen. Many of the monsters and creatures not shaped by the nature of their provinces have been made bent and crooked by the hateful spite of the Crooked Queen.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Phillip and Adela Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Since coming to power, Phillip Druskenvald has attempted to shape the realm he named after himself into a reflection of his own ideals. A master of unchained ambitions, he envisions a realm where civilization crushes the wild pulse of nature, where order reigns supreme over the primal chaos of the afterlife. In his mind, he has crafted a sanctuary—a place where souls are reborn into lives filled with the pleasures and comforts they once knew, no longer bound by the harsh cycles of nature.</p><p class=\"p3\">In Phillip’s eyes, he is a benevolent ruler who has given the inhabitants of Druskenvald a second chance at life, which he believes to be the ultimate desire of every mortal. However, as the years have gone on, he has become out of touch with the people for whom he is responsible. Often aloof and completely unaware of the realities of living in Druskenvald, he presumes that the inhabitants of Druskenvald are having as good and easy a time as he is.</p><p class=\"p3\">At Phillip’s side stands his beloved wife Adela <em>(uh‑DELL‑uh)</em>, the most precious soul in existence to him. Adela was once a mortal woman living in the material world, but one born with immense powers of divination and prophecy. Her unbound curiosity, enthusiasm, and drive, along with an obsession with the spiritual world, drew her to seek out the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>. It is there she met Phillip, and the two fell deeply in love and were promptly married. She now assists her husband and is invaluable in the governance of Druskenvald.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Weasel%2001.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Crescent Court</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">The Druskenvalds do not rule the domain alone. There are thirteen major provinces, each with a lord or lady who governs and embodies the essence of their territory. Some of these nobles are members of the origin species of their province, while others, though different in form, still represent the province’s spirit. These diverse leaders form the Crescent Court, a council that governs all of Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p3\">The nobles of the Crescent Court enjoy a significant degree of autonomy in the governance of their provinces with little direct oversight from Phillip. As long as each province maintains order and does not disrupt the affairs of neighboring provinces or the Druskenvalds themselves, the lords and ladies are free to rule as they see fit.</p><p class=\"p3\">Several times a year, the Crescent Court gathers at Chateau Clair de Lune <em>(sha‑TOH KLAIR‑duh‑LOON)</em>, the Druskenvalds' sprawling manor. The home was built by Phillip to Adela’s exacting design, and it serves as an ideal place of residence and headquarters for the domain’s leadership. When court is called, there is pageantry and celebration, but important matters are discussed and crucial decisions are made regarding the governance of Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p3\">Oftentimes, the primary focus of the meetings is on the malefic machinations of the Coven of the Midnight Moon. This coven of thirteen witches is led by a powerful crone known as Mother Midnight. She and her daughters work in the shadows, terrorizing the thirteen major provinces of Druskenvald to some incomprehensible end.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Shroud</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">No matter the power of the beings that dwell in Druskenvald, virtually none can pierce the wall of fog that encircles it. The phantom gloom, known among the inhabitants of Druskenvald as the Shroud, appears as a dense gray mist that wails in a chorus of agonized voices. The Shroud is, in reality, the condensed essence of the primordial element of death itself given form. It lingers just beyond the fringes of the mortal realms and serves as the veil that separates the lands of the living and the dead.</p><p class=\"p3\">All souls not offered salvation by the hallowed or delivered damnation by the hells must pass through the Shroud on their way to the afterlife to which they are destined. They must first be led through the mist by the Strangers—timeless beings with the power to safely guide the dead to the other side. While these entities use many methods and take many forms, such as shepherds, ferrymen, reapers, or angels of death, all are bound to their solemn duty for eternity. Without the protective shield of a Stranger, the phantom mist annihilates wayward souls and devours their anima, the quintessential soul-stuff that provides all beings spiritual identity and sentience.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Vagrant and the Ghostlight Express</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">The Vagrant <em>(VAY‑grint)</em> is the enigmatic Stranger who ferries souls to Druskenvald, possessing the unique ability to come and go from the domain as he pleases. All others must be guided by him aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, a spectral locomotive powered by the Shroud itself. The old black ghost train traverses the boundaries between life and death, unbound to any track as it courses through the mists. This mysterious mechanical ferry is the only means of passage in and out of Druskenvald for all, living or dead.</p><p class=\"p3\">None know the Vagrant’s origin, how he came to cooperate with Phillip, or his ultimate aims. Whether or not it is his true form, the visage he favors is that of an amiable frogman dressed in ragged clothing. The sole conductor of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, he is known by all passengers for his charming demeanor and love of stories and fiddle tunes.</p><p class=\"p3\">In the mortal realms, the Vagrant’s mirthful fiddle and haunting whistles herald the arrival of the ghost train, which emerges seemingly out of nowhere, rolling in on a bank of dense fog. It is said that only the dead may see this arrival, but there are a few fortunate, or perhaps unfortunate, living souls who have discovered how to gain passage while still alive.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The People of Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Souls that arrive in Druskenvald are reborn into a wide variety of species, including those which inhabit the world of the living. However, the realm’s predominant populace is comprised of thirteen distinct species, each having originated from one of the thirteen shrouded provinces.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">The origins of these species are as varied as the land itself, some rising from the landscape, others being crafted by the provincial lords, and still more arriving from magical phenomena, emerging into Druskenvald as fully formed adults, infants, or any age in between. In just as many instances, the rebirth is initiated by two parents seeking a child through biological, magical, or technological means.</p><p class=\"p3\">No matter the species, most inhabitants of Druskenvald emerge anew, their memories of a past life erased, allowing them to live their next life with a clean slate. A few cling to fragments of their former selves, their memories either shrouded in mist or vivid and unyielding. Even rarer are those with a fully clear picture of their past life, even remembering their moment of death. While many of these beings remain in their province of origin, others choose to roam across Druskenvald and settle in other communities.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Besides the thirteen species native to Druskenvald, humans are the most populous species found in the realm compared to other folk such as dwarves, elves, or halflings. This is due to the deep connection that Phillip and Adela Druskenvald have to the domain they rule. Despite having become deathless, immortal beings long ago, their once-human hearts have left a clear imprint upon the land.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Death in Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">There is no guarantee of the fate that befalls those who die again while in the confines of this realm of rebirth. For many, the cycle starts once more, and the soul of the recently deceased is reborn as one of the species of Druskenvald. Sometimes, they return as the same species they had been in life, but just as often, they awaken as an entirely different one.</p><p class=\"p3\">Some experience a “Final Death,” where the soul simply fades into oblivion and ceases to exist. For those who were particularly wicked in their second chance at life, the Shroud claims it. The soul’s anima is devoured, and the spirit is transformed into a shrieking abomination doomed to wander the eldritch fog forever.</p><p class=\"p3\">Rarely, the souls of the dead are reincarnated by the original nature of Kehlenn’s domain and are turned into plants or animals by whatever lingering remnants of green magic still pervade the realm. These souls, marked by the Crooked Queen herself, are warped into the crooked monsters that lurk in the old places and stalk along the fringes of civilization.</p></div>"

When wayward souls cross the boundary from their world to wander among the oak, ash, and thorn, they belong to the trees. Dry your eyes. The Elderwood weeps for them now.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Elder Gallows -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p4\">Ardengloom <em>(AR‑din‑gloom)</em> is a warning whispered by candlelight, a wood so ancient that all know its name. In a time beyond memory, the primordial forest enveloped the entirety of Druskenvald. Though now only a fraction of its former glory, its towering, gnarled trees are the last barrier between civilization and the unknown. For as long as there have been voices, songs have been sung of the terrors that lurk in the umbral heart of the wood.</p><p class=\"p5\">The province of Ardengloom is a land of dark forests, twisting shadows, and echoes of the long-dead feyfolk who once dwelled there. Though dangerous to outsiders, deep within the twisting roots and choking shadows lies a shrouded society. Living in remote settlements throughout the great wood, the gnarlborn are a people grown from the forest itself, resembling their treant ancestors with bark-like skin and haunting, glowing faces. These folk, along with the other species of the dark forest, stand as sentinels against those who wish to exploit their primordial home.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Ancient Elderwoods</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">The Elderwoods are the oldest and largest of the trees within Ardengloom and Druskenvald as a whole. Within each of their broad trunks is a face of knotted wood and cracked bark. Should harm come to the wood in which they are rooted, they weep viscous, amber sap in response to that shared pain. It is believed that within each Elderwood is the soul of a long-dead Fey—the last remnants of a once-mighty oaken empire.</p><p class=\"p5\">The venerable language of the Elderwoods is so ancient that many folk of Ardengloom have forgotten how to speak it. Now, these primordial beings communicate the will of the woods through the subtle shifting of leaves or swaying of branches, while those attuned to the Old Ways may even hear their voices on the wind.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Mists of Tirna Féth</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">On nights when the moonlight pierces through the dense canopy, a soft, blue mist forms on the breeze and billows into the surrounding forests. The Mists of Tirna Féth <em>(TEER‑nuh FETH)</em>, as they are known in legend, blanket the wood in an eerie dew, thought to be the lost souls of the feyfolk that once thrived in the glades and glens of Ardengloom.</p><p class=\"p5\">Most who find themselves caught in the mist are trapped—forced to wander the gloom forever. The lost no longer have an understanding of time or place, and nearly all meet their end. The lucky few who emerge from the mists tell tales of being helped or hindered by confounding fey spirits or following the ghostly luminance of a will-o’-wisp.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/card/card%20tarot/01_INT_DRS_Ardengloom_Elder%20Gallows%20woodcarving.webp\" width=\"200\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Elder Gallows</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">Gnarled treants are not an uncommon sight in Ardengloom, and Elder Gallows is by far the oldest and largest of all who walk the woods. The lord of Ardengloom is so old that only the most timeworn of trees remember his true name, and none, not even the Elderwoods, dare speak it.</p><p class=\"p5\">True to his name, nooses hang interspersed among his knotted branches as a constant reminder of the fate that will befall those who encroach upon and dare to defile his primordial realm. Having borne witness to so much of the forest’s destruction, he has become bitter toward outsiders and even his fellow lords of the Crescent Court. However, his contempt is controlled by his unmatched patience, for he knows that he and the forest will outlast them all.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Silhouette</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">It is said that even the darkness fears the witch of Ardengloom, and those venturing into the tree line of the province who do not heed this warning never return. Appearing as a looming shadow with glowing embers for eyes, Sister Silhouette slinks between the trees of the deepest parts of the forest, twisting the shadows cast by her cursed lantern into a wicked extension of her form, enveloping and snuffing out the life essence of travelers lost in the wood. By the time her victims see the pinprick of light through the yawning darkness, it is too late.</p><p class=\"p5\">Sister Silhouette’s shadows are a malevolent, corrupting force capable of blighting even the mightiest Elderwood trees. This sickness corrupts the primordial fey spirits that dwell within the trees, causing black sap to run like tears down rotten bark. Every night, Sister Silhouette spreads the malady deeper into the wood and collects the vile sap to fuel her lantern so that it may eventually cast her shadow across all of Ardengloom.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Gloaming Gulch</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">Deep within the shrouded heart of Ardengloom lies Gloaming Gulch, a flourishing city built into the very trees themselves. Spanning from the tangled roots to the towering canopy overhead, the capital is the center of society for the gnarlborn and the other species that call the forest home. Great rings of standing stones are found on the forest floor, weathered by time and enveloped by moss and lichen. It is here that the Old Ones, a group of revered treants, hold the great Gnarlmoot. This assembly, led by Elder Gallows, gathers to discuss solutions to the problems plaguing the province.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Ardengloom_Petula%20Moon%20Shadows%20Gourd.webp\" width=\"200\" /><p class=\"p5\">Deeply isolated from the rest of the province, Gloaming Gulch is the closest thing Ardengloom has to a city. The concept of currency is wholly foreign to those who live here. Goods are bartered at grand treetop markets, and the entire way of life for the gnarlborn is predicated on a system of honor and respect. However, those who violate the laws and customs of the gulch find themselves facing merciless justice, and the bones of countless trespassers are forever lost among the roots of the Elderwoods.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Maze of the Dreamers</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">Legends are told of a mysterious, overgrown maze built into the forest from stone, earth, branch, and bush. Marked by an archway that shimmers with emerald light, the countless miles of labyrinthian, enchanted woodland murmurs with the faint song of beasts, birds, and the old gods of the forest.</p><p class=\"p5\">Alluring song beckons unwary travelers into the Maze of the Dreamers. The lost are doomed to wander endlessly or be consumed by grasping brambles, choking ivy, or the gnashing jaws of the impossibly ancient creatures within. However, it is said that those who brave the labyrinth and best its challenges will arrive at the Green Dream, the dwindled ethereal realm of the few surviving fey folk from the lost ages of Druskenvald.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Ardengloom</span></h2><p class=\"p4\">Each journey into the tangled heart of Ardengloom tempts adventurers to confront the shadows that corrupt the ancient land.</p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s3\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.3j2rk2xKKPrQQ5Jl]{Ardengloom Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

Each one is a thread that connects past, present, and future. When woven together in their multitudes, the tapestry of fate is illuminated to those with clear eyes and open minds. No matter the lateness of the hour, if you look to the heavens and truly see, you will never be lost in the darkness.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Headmistress Narcissa Voss -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">Astramar <em>(ASS‑truh‑mar)</em> is a place of light in a realm shrouded in the darkness of eternal night. While the sun never rises, the glittering stars that shine down upon the towering mountains and rolling hills of the province cast it in luminant shades of blue, made even brighter by the magical ley lines that streak across its landscape. This azure brilliance illuminates not only the land and sky of Astramar but also the inquisitive and aspiring minds of the people who live there.</p><p class=\"p4\">The harpy-like azureborn are most prominent in Astramar, descending from the night sky as they are reborn. However, the province draws all those who wish to study the arcane arts from across Druskenvald—and even beyond the Shroud. While magical energies of all varieties radiate through the province, the cosmic guidance of the stars and other celestial bodies that fill the cerulean skies are especially leveraged by clairvoyants, soothsayers, and other such practitioners of divination magic.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Winds of Aither</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In eons past, the domain now known as Astramar was the site of an impossibly powerful ritual that called down storms of arcane energy from the stars themselves. This suffused the entire province with aither<em> (AY-thur)</em>—condensed arcane energy that spellcasters can draw upon to empower their magic. This volatile essence whips through the sky and crackles across the land, forming interconnected strands of power that are constantly shifting like complex wind patterns.</p><p class=\"p4\">The people of Astramar rely on aither for their magical way of life, looking to the skies and the landscape to trace the ley line patterns and following the stars to divine how they will change each night. They collect the arcane substance in azure crystals embedded in the ground or held aloft in the heavens atop great towers. These crystal foci send the winds of aither across the province, fueling the enchantments, conjurations, and countless other spells that provide a wondrous life to all its inhabitants, even those born without an affinity for magic.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Stygian Depths</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In stark contrast to the illuminated landscapes of Astramar, far below its mountainous surface is a sprawling network of caverns called the Stygian Depths, where far less wondrous and beautiful things lurk. Within these subterranean chambers, death itself thrives—the true cost of harnessing volatile aither.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">The aither-touched souls of Astramar’s mages are all at risk of being ripped from their bodies with one wrong incantation or misappropriation of a spell. When such a miscast occurs, the spirit is pulled into the underworld and joins the numerous souls that form the River Atropos, which snakes through the entirety of the Stygian Depths. The spectral waters of this river can be utilized for even stranger and more profane rituals, but meddling with the damned is extremely dangerous and can drain one’s youth, magic, and vitality in mere moments.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Headmistress Narcissa Voss</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">As well as ruling the whole of Astramar, Narcissa Voss <em>(nar‑SISS‑uh VAHSS)</em> serves as the headmistress of the illustrious magical academy Gandorhal. As an azureborn, her features are owl-like, with white feathers that almost appear as spectacles that frame wizened yet determined blue eyes. Voss is known among the other nobles of the Crescent Court for being especially stern, proud, and cold, but she exhibits surprising warmth and patience with all of her students and prioritizes their tutelage above most of her other duties.</p><p class=\"p4\">When she is not overseeing the academy or ruling the province from her tower in Lunarium, teleporting between both locations with a single incantation, she looks to the stars as a master of divination, seeking to foresee threats to her people. While she can see many possible futures, fate can always be twisted and changed, and she often joins her most powerful mages in weaving monumental spells that protect the peoples of Astramar.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Astramar_Headmistress%20Narcissa%20Voss%20marble%20facade%20fresco.webp\" width=\"400\" class=\" centered\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Effigy</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The deadly and stunning Sister Effigy dwells in a ruined city-sized stone palace deep within the darkest cavern of the Stygian Depths. Nearly statuesque in her appearance, with a head covered in writhing, venomous snakes, she is consumed by vanity and bitter jealousy for all those she perceives as more beautiful or powerful than her. Effigy draws the waters of the River Atropos and spins them like threads into malign and mutating spells that transform beast and person alike into horrific monsters.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Viewing herself as the loving mother of her creations, she waits and plots for the opportune moment when hordes of her monstrous children will spill up from the underworld and rampage across Astramar, tearing their great and beautiful cities down so that none shall be as impressive as her crumbling ruin of a lair. Until then, she magically molds new stone blocks, pillars, and statues for her ever-growing palace to feed her unquenchable thirst for grandeur.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Lunarium</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s6\">Lunarium <em>(loo‑NAR‑ee‑uhm)</em> is Astramar’s grand capital, filled with ornate spires and towers that reach high into the night sky, as if trying to reach the very stars from which the azureborn are created. Despite the diverse population of practitioners of the arcane, the city was constructed with flight-capable beings in mind, including floating domes, landing platforms, and structure entrances that lead out into the clouds. While easily navigable by the azureborn, those without flight must explore the city on floating arcane discs easily controlled by even the least magical of visitors.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">The capital, fueled by great arcane crystals thrumming with aither, contains numerous homes, schools, and cultural centers that shine like the stars the province reveres. One of the most prominent and famous landmarks of the city is the Dome of Cygnus, an enormous observatory said to have been built by Lunarium’s founder. Numerous enchanted telescopes protrude from the structure, allowing stargazers from across Druskenvald to seek answers from the cosmos above.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Astramar_Sister%20Effigy%20Buste.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Gandorhal College of the Arcane Arts</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Located on Lake Rommeda <em>(ROM‑meh‑duh)</em> in the misty moors of Astramar, Gandorhal <em>(GAN‑der‑hall)</em> is Druskenvald’s most prestigious magical academy. Students from across all thirteen provinces are drawn to this influential college to hone their arcane skills and knowledge by following a general curriculum that covers all types of magic.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, the institution provides the opportunity for students to specialize in one particular school, dividing each year’s class into eight houses to foster the growth of talent in each pupil’s selected focus. The labyrinthine halls of Gandorhal are filled with mysteries and dangers that some consider unacceptable for students so young, but the professors believe that the necessity to defend oneself with magic is the best path to mastery.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Astramar</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In Astramar, adventurers delve into arcane mastery and celestial mysteries that intertwine with magical academia, the sinister secrets of the Stygian Depths, and the volatile forces of the arcane landscape.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.cjxpS2y5xFRTw5TV]{Astramar Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

But claiming power does not grant it, and what these claimants hold is the mere illusion of it. True power is held by those who understand that all peoples, from the rulers to the ruled, care not for any of these ideals and are driven solely by the instinct to survive and reproduce.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Doctor Molder Underfoot -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">The plague-ridden province of Bubonia <em>(boo‑BOH‑nee‑ah)</em> is bleak and shrouded in clouds of miasma and toxic haze. Amidst the instability of rampant disease and strife, rival guilds work and scheme tirelessly to achieve their individual aims, hoping to become the next predominant faction that wields the power and wealth to control all others. Most of the plagueborn and other species of Bubonia lead humble and often short lives, filled with constant fear. However, the guilds provide an opportunity for a life of larger purpose, excitement, and riches.</p><p class=\"p4\">Mutant creatures, twisted by the province itself, wander on all manner of appendages and seek to destroy those still spared from their terrible fate. But perhaps even more dangerous are the plots of the province’s people, where loyalty is fleeting and assassination, backstabbing, and other heinous acts of treachery are common.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Pestilent Haze</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">A sickly, yellowish-green haze hangs in the air of Bubonia, filled with plague, poison, and mutagenic power. It is from these roiling, stinking plumes that newly rebirthed plagueborn emerge, but while the rat-like people are more resistant to the toxic atmosphere than other species of the province, none are immune to the pestilent haze. It works slowly and insidiously, infecting the body, mind, and soul of those who breathe it. Some exhibit terrible physical symptoms and perish, while others are turned to wickedness and commit acts of great evil, but the victims who suffer the worst fate are the ravening, plagued mutants.</p><p class=\"p4\">None understand the purpose of the haze or whether it has a will of its own, but every attempt to banish it from Bubonia has failed, and all that’s left to be done is to manage it and hope to survive. The best defense against the haze that the province’s people possess are huge, ancient windmills that dot the hills, built long before recorded history. The mills’ seemingly decrepit blades are sturdy enough to spin quickly, blowing miles of plague clouds away. However, certain schemers have discovered ways to use the windmills to harness the haze to their own unscrupulous ends.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Five Great Guilds</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">While Bubonia is represented in the Crescent Court, the true power resides among the many guilds that operate throughout the province. However, five great guilds dominate all others, spending equal time working together and sabotaging each other.</p><p class=\"p7\"><strong>The Doomsday Guild.</strong> This league of scientists, alchemists, engineers, and artificers sits at the top of the other four guilds as the ruling faction of Bubonia, simply due to being the only one that can ensure annihilation of the province should they be deposed. Known for their chaotic and destructive weapons of war and doomsday devices, they seek new glory for Bubonia through strange scientific advancement.</p><p class=\"p7\"><strong>The Cheesemonger Guild.</strong> This union of cheese merchants, butchers, bakers, and other tradespeople specializing in foodstuffs is the wealthiest guild, hawking often rotten wares to starving customers at exorbitant rates. Understanding that people are often motivated by their stomachs, they trade nourishment for power, tightening their grip with each transaction as saviors and exploiters.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Bellringer Guild.</strong> Often hidden away in crumbling abbeys across Bubonia, this order of monks, priests, and prophets worships the pestilent haze as a deity called the Great Plagued One. As the keepers of the primary faith of the province, they command legions of zealous adherents, spreading the holy word while administering salves and ointments that cure and spread the plague, all in the name of their pestilent god.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Ratcatcher Guild.</strong> This sordid syndicate of assassins, spies, and saboteurs prefers to skitter through the sewers and run-down alleys of Bubonia’s towns and cities. Known for being willing to kill any mark or infiltrate any space if the price is right, they slip through the shadows with envenomed blades to advance the aims of the powerful aristocrats who hire them.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><strong>The Boltflinger Guild.</strong> This order of monster and mutant slayers is filled with highly skilled hunters and trackers that brave the wilds and the haze to seek and destroy the threats to Bubonia. Given their mission to protect, they may initially seem like the noblest of the guilds; however, they believe no means are too extreme in wiping out the abominations that lurch through the miasma.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Bubonia_Doctor%20Underfoot%20scroll%20pencil%20art.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Doctor Molder Underfoot</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">In a province filled with schemers, its leader must be the one who schemes the best, and that is how Doctor Molder Underfoot maintains control. A plagueborn who has greatly extended her own life through the discovery of alchemical secrets, she serves as master of the Doomsday Guild as well as sitting at the Crescent Court.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Her arsenal of doomsday devices helps keep the other guilds in line, but it is her complete understanding of the minds of those around her that allows her to pull the right strings to always get what she wants. Despite how ruthless and calculating she can be, her ultimate aim is to develop a reliable immunity to the plague and a reversal of the haze’s mutations so that Bubonia can experience a new age of prosperity and safety.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Homunculus</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">As a province with such widespread death, Bubonia serves as the perfect laboratory for the unhinged genius known as Sister Homunculus <em>(huh‑MUNG‑kyuh‑luhs)</em>. Her advancements in strange science infused with occult magic, as well as her artificer skills in arcane machinery, eclipse even the most prestigious members of the Doomsday Guild. Regularly robbing the mass graves of those killed by the plague or the mutants forged by it, she fuses body parts together into horrific flesh-crafted abominations that serve her unquestioningly and assist her in performing increasingly vile experiments on living subjects.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Bubonia_Vellcinda%20Moon%20coin.webp\" width=\"250\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Castle Underbelly</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The capital city of Bubonia is built into the ruins of a colossal castle that had long been abandoned before recorded history. A strange sight to newcomers, this sprawling city is one of the largest population centers in Druskenvald and features ramshackle wooden additions grafted to ancient stone structures.</p><p class=\"p4\">The city is home to thousands of people of all levels of prosperity, separated by the different layers of the castle, with the rich and powerful residing at the tops of great towers connected by heavily guarded walkways, and the most downtrodden attempting to survive far below in a massive sewer system. It also contains the headquarters of all five of the great guilds, each prospering from the surprising amount of trade, commerce, and travel throughout the capital.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Bubonia</span></h2><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">Adventurers in this plague-ridden land face a myriad of challenges—from thwarting guild machinations to surviving the abnormal mutations that roam the blighted landscape.</span></p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.Zk8i8xFFGtaLn4hp]{Bubonia Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

Truth is, fortune comes or goes with a single choice: heads or tails. But here, at least that choice is yours to make. Welcome to Chernabos! And whiskey’s half-price for the next thirty minutes.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Ol’ Mister Scratch -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Fiery wind howls above Chernabos <em>(CHURR‑nuh‑bohs)</em> and casts a strange reddish glow across its scorched wastelands and deserts dotted with ashen, skeletal remains. It is a land of extremes: blistering heat, relentless drought, and violent eruptions and earthquakes, all laced with the promise of wealth beyond one’s wildest dreams. Beneath fiendish volcanic peaks that belch forth ash and the ashborn</span> <span class=\"s3\">that thrive in the province, rich veins of gold and—even more valuable—hell iron ore draw treasure hunters, opportunists, and the truly desperate from far and wide to seek their destiny here.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">There is no law in Chernabos, save for what its people get away with or enforce, whether it be through their might, guile, or luck. If all of this wasn’t enough, every inch of the province is tethered to the otherworldly realms of the devils, so sin itself suffuses the land, air, animals, and people of this harsh land with one clear ruling vice: greed. No matter how the dice fall, Chernabos is one hell of a place to make one’s fortune.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Hell Iron</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Hell iron is a fiendish metal, pitch black and streaked with red, perfectly suited for the construction of devilish machinery that can outperform entire factories owned by the largest captains of industry. When enormous deposits of hell iron were discovered deep within the volcanic landscapes of Chernabos, there was an overnight population explosion that dwarfed the various gold rushes the province had experienced for years beforehand. Enterprising folk from all over flocked to Chernabos to join the ashborn and other species of the province, and everyone profited.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Treacherous hell iron mines dot the hills, mountains, ridges, and volcanoes of the province, with the largest concentration bored throughout the hellfire-spewing Sulfur Mountain. The constant threat of cave-ins, hellfire eruptions, and the unearthing of malevolent Fiends deters many from stepping into a mine. Yet still they flock, for the fiendish metal is more valuable than gold, and coins and bars made from it are used as currency across Chernabos.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Chernabos_Ol-Mister-Scratch-playing-card.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Devil Rail</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Built and operated by the Midas Railroad Company, the <em>Devil Rail</em> is an enormous train constructed from hell iron, plated in gold, and fueled by hellfire. Intended to eventually serve as a direct competitor to the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, it currently provides passage across the treacherous landscape of Chernabos on rails of fire and brimstone for a hefty fee of gold or hell iron, emerging from beneath the earth to collect its passengers from wherever they desire at a predetermined time.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">This relatively new service allows for once-impossible travel throughout the province in comfort and style, but like everything in Chernabos, it is fraught with risk. Those who board without a ticket, miss the train at the exact time of departure, or request an emergency spiriting from a life-threatening situation forfeit their soul, which is fed into the firebox to fuel the devilish locomotive.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Ol’ Mister Scratch</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">A hulking devil with red skin, golden eyes, a black mustache, and curved horns, Ol’ Mister Scratch maintains a cool and charming disposition despite his imposing stature, which contrasts drastically with the ashborn who comprise a majority of the people he rules over. However, this devil takes the decrees of the Crescent Court as mere suggestions and strives to keep his province lawless, where destiny is determined with free will and the flip of a coin.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">Conducting his scant lordly duties from the Deadwood Theater, which also serves as a saloon, hotel, and casino, he deals with the other powerful entrepreneurs of the province through temptation and manipulation. In truth, every soul that succumbs to sin in Chernabos becomes his, so he wheels and deals to ensure that business stays booming and greed remains king.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Malignance</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Gaunt and shrouded in a billowing black robe, the nearly skeletal Sister Malignance lingers atop Pale Mountain, which stands at the southernmost border of Chernabos. As the eldest of Mother Midnight’s daughters, the occult power of Malignance is immense, and she has used her mastery of necromancy to command death itself.</p><p class=\"p4\">Every night, she rides her white Undead steed along the towering wall of shrieking fog at Druskenvald’s border and pulls forth twisted, tormented souls that she dominates to her will. Whether bid by her mother or motivated by her own aims, Sister Malignance works tirelessly to weaken the Shroud’s barrier so that, like a breaking dam, a tide of death will spill forth and crash upon Chernabos and beyond.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Brimstone</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Brimstone, the capital of Chernabos, is a boiling cauldron of desire and desperation. Soot and smoke from chimneys mix with the sulfuric air, and its ashy streets are lined with saloons, gambling halls, theaters, and brothels a mere stone’s throw from places of commerce, trade, and industry. The city offers the tempting and truthless promise of sin without consequence, which draws folk from across Druskenvald who hope to change their fortune in a heartbeat without realizing that heartbeat may be their last.</p><p class=\"p4\">Countless games of chance are played throughout the city, with gamblers wagering gold, hell iron, or their own souls to win jackpots beyond imagination. Strong spirits of all varieties flow freely, but most prefer Brimstone’s signature liquor, Fiddler Johnny, which is made with poisonous cactus juice and rattlesnake venom. When damnation is on the line, disputes often turn heated and are settled with duels to the death.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Hotel Durango</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s6\">Despite what some folks say, Hotel Durango <em>(der‑AYNG‑goh)</em> isn’t a myth but it sure is hard to find. When someone’s luck runs out in Chernabos and they lose everything, they often wander off into the desert in delirious damnation. It’s to these lost souls that Hotel Durango appears. An impossibly large and remote hotel in the middle of the desert, it acts as a shimmering oasis for the desperate. The lights are inviting, and the door is always open, encouraging those who see it to stop for the night and forget their troubles.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Chernabos_%20Sister%20Malignance%20decorated%20gloves.webp\" width=\"400\" /><p class=\"p4\">Within the mirage-like hotel is everything one’s heart might desire: water for the thirsty, food for the starving, vices for the craving, companionship for the lonely, or some chips for the gambler who wants one last game. Once a soul checks into Hotel Durango, they leave the world they knew behind, find everything they’ll ever need, and can never leave. However, certain tales whisper of ways to find the hotel and free the souls within.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Chernabos</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In the untamed land of Chernabos, adventurers face a world where lawlessness and hellfire collide. From soul bargains in dusty saloons to fiendish menaces, each encounter promises both danger and opportunity.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.sAtWLk2XFV9tLG9Q]{Chernabos Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

Why should we? The wheels of time, progress, and industry don’t. We may be trapped between them, crushed beneath them, or cut down by them, but we will never be left behind. If we slow or stop for even just a moment, the beast will catch us.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Charlotte Heady, The Iron Maiden -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Edwardia <em>(ed‑WAR‑dee‑uh) </em>is a province of gray. Its sky, water, landscape, settlements, and even its people exist in a grayscale that colors every aspect of their society. The heart of Edwardia is ever pulled between two contrasting extremes, and the balance that its people maintain has allowed them to achieve a level of technological progress far beyond the wildest dreams of most of Druskenvald’s inhabitants, with sprawling cities, industrious machinery, and fantastic vehicles all powered by electricity captured from the province’s frequent storms. But progress has its cost, and for all the prosperity and comfort the province enjoys, there is just as much hardship and strife.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">The society that has resulted is one obsessed with dualities—life and death, good and evil, law and anarchy, wealth and poverty, peace and conflict, progress and regression, city and country. These opposing furies have manifested into a curse that marks every inhabitant of Edwardia and hangs over the province like the dense fog from which the wolfen curseborn emerge. Managing this affliction by maintaining balance is core to life in this province of gloomy hills, moors, and flatlands, with its people divided between a towering metropolis and the quaint countryside.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Grey</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Edwardia is intricately intertwined with the Grey, which is a term that references three parts of a whole. First, it is the name of the dense, gray fog that rolls across the province and shrouds its people in gloom for half of every night.</p><p class=\"p4\">Second, it is the name of the lifelong curse that marks every native of Edwardia, which some believe to be the result of living in the strange, oppressive fog. This malediction has no ongoing negative effects, but an afflicted individual who lives a life of any extreme meets an untimely end with total certainty.</p><p class=\"p4\">Third, this death is delivered by an entity called the Grey. It appears to the doomed in the fog as a huge, gray canid beast with two heads—a she-wolf’s on the left and a mastiff’s on the right—and allows its prey one last choice. Those who accept their fate are nuzzled gently by the mastiff, dying peacefully and painlessly within moments. Those who flee, fight, beg, or otherwise attempt to escape their fate are chased down and violently torn to pieces by the she-wolf.</p><p class=\"p4\">None know if this being is a spirit, a fiend, an angel, or a god, but the two-headed beast is revered and honored across Edwardia, serving as an eternal reminder to its people to strive for balance between all things. Some say that this malediction is a blessing, as it has driven the province to thrive despite the sacrifices required to balance the scales.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sparktech</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Edwardia is filled with industrious folk, including many inventors who have a keen eye toward progress. However, no advancement has had nearly as much of an impact as Sparktech, the invention by which Charlotte Heady transformed the province overnight. This revolutionary technology utilizes magnetized, bulb-shaped rods wrapped in coiled springs to capture electricity from the air and harness its energy to power a wide variety of machines and devices that are now the cornerstones of Edwardia’s civilization.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">While Sparktech is critical and widely used in Edwardia’s industry, transportation, energy, and commercial sectors, it is limited by its great expense to maintain, difficulty to repair, and high rate of fatal accidents. Additionally, attempts to spread the technology outside of Edwardia have failed catastrophically. Because endeavors to improve upon its design have brought the doom of the Grey upon many inventors, engineers, and scientists, the technology seems destined to remain at its current level indefinitely.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Edwadia_%20Charlotte%20Heady%2C%20the%20Iron%20Maiden%20Art%20Nouveau.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Charlotte Heady, the Iron Maiden</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Charlotte Heady <em>(SHAR‑lit HEE‑dee)</em> was once a curseborn who considered herself the ultimate renaissance woman, finding immense passion and success in every pursuit she tried, from invention to music to dueling to alchemy. But in the process of inventing Sparktech, a catastrophic accident annihilated her body and transmuted her soul into raw electricity. Through quick thinking, she was able to bind her soul inside a suit of iron armor before her crackling new form could dissipate. This was the moment she realized that balance could be achieved by embracing both extremes of duality in equal measure instead of walking a middle ground of mediocrity.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Now called the Iron Maiden, Heady leads Edwardia with this philosophy in mind, battling the Grey and the average with every action she takes. She acts as a ruthless inspector one night, before leading a fiery riot to the sound of raucous electric music the next. She strives to increase the province’s quality of life through rampant industrial growth while accepting the sickness and suffering caused by the subsequent pollution. The Iron Maiden takes no joy in the sacrifices that must be made in the name of progress, but she places the blame on the curse that she believes forced her hand.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Serenade</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Heartbreak defines and consumes Sister Serenade, the consummate tortured musician of the Coven of the Midnight Moon. Although she always possessed a complete disregard for mortal life, when she lost the love of her life many years ago, she was forever changed into a brooding, hateful witch who loathes joy in others. Donning a dramatic white mask and black cape, she weaves witchcraft through her bombastic music and magically manipulates the emotions of her victims toward malign ends.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">As if riding the sound waves of her songs, Serenade teleports herself and her massive, enchanted pipe organ across Edwardia and throughout its capital. She gives heart-rending performances that rip out people’s passion, joy, and free will, turning them into heartless, living automatons as gray as the fog of the province. She seeks to rob every last inhabitant of Edwardia of their color and vivacity to amass an army of emotionless, gray drones that follow her song and spread her suffering to all of Druskenvald.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Baskerton</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The fogbound, electric metropolis of Baskerton <em>(BASK‑urr‑tin) </em>is the largest city in Druskenvald, with numerous high-rise buildings that pierce the gloom with bright lights and crackling tendrils of harnessed lightning. A huge, diverse population of industrious folk live here across all social classes, always seeking to improve their lives with hard work. Its cobbled streets are filled with wondrous Sparktech vehicles that zoom past all manner of shops, factories, and other businesses. Statues, murals, and other imagery of the two-headed Grey are displayed prominently throughout the city, lest its people forget their unbreakable curse. Visitors to this capital can find myriad points of interest and intrigue.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Rex and Romula.</strong> The great twin clocktowers that stand at either end of Baskerton set the city’s rhythm, with every inhabitant waking, sleeping, and going about their night timed by the booming chimes that echo like howling in the night. They also serve as the primary docking stations for the airships that the wealthy use to travel to other provinces.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Progress Quarter.</strong> This district of workshops, laboratories, and universities draws inventors from across Druskenvald and beyond to perfect their inventions, showcase them to the public, and receive critiques from the most brilliant minds in the city.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Sumptown.</strong> Underneath the city are near-endless stretches of brick-lined sewers, slums, and service tunnels that have come under the control of rival gangs, forming a sinister haven for serial killers that pick off people who won’t be missed.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>The Cogs.</strong> The industrial heart of the city is polluted by miles of tightly packed factories, warehouses, and energy plants that operate through all hours of the night via revolving shifts that employ a huge portion of the city’s population.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>The Iron Opera House.</strong> This renowned theater, adorned with metal spikes, is owned by Charlotte Heady, providing a venue for avant-garde dramatic and musical performances featuring elaborate set design and experimental stage effects created by Sparktech machinery.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Edwardia</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In Edwardia, adventures span the sprawling urban surface and below, often involving solving macabre murders, unraveling conspiracies, or delving into the complex criminal underground.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.cxOMEKsZVQk93yHm]{Edwardia Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

We all were born knowing how it goes, each one of us has a part in the harmony, and everyone will be singing it ‘til the very end. Lend me your voice, little one, and we’ll help this seed grow.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Methuselah -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">The harvest is a way of life in Enoch <em>(EE‑nock)</em>, a rustic countryside province that sprawls across miles of rolling farmland, its fields of plenty forming a patchwork pattern across the landscape. Serving as the primary breadbasket for all of Druskenvald, it is known to produce crops of every variety that are tended to by the hardworking people of the province and sold to one and all at vibrant, bustling markets and even shipped to other provinces.</p><p class=\"p4\">Crystal clear rivers weave through the fertile hills and humble woodlands that comprise most of the region, delivering enchanted water to crops that allow them to grow unnaturally large. The harvestborn, crafted with care by the lord of Enoch, join in celebration with the other folk of the province to show thanks for the bountiful and relatively peaceful life afforded to them. However, nowhere in Druskenvald is free from the dangers that lurk on the fringes of society.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Moonlit Harvest</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Despite having been driven from most of Druskenvald, primeval “Green Magic” hums throughout Enoch like a familiar tune and infuses the soil, water, and air of the province with unbound growth and fertility. The knowledge of how to harness this vital power has been passed from generation to generation through story and song, providing farmers the ability to complete a full agricultural cycle every month. This is a true miracle of nature, especially in a land of eternal night.</p><p class=\"p4\">After the seeds are sown and planted at the beginning of the month, the verdant magic surges within them, and vibrant stalks, vines, and stems burst to life at an immeasurable pace. If patient, one can actually watch the plants of Enoch grow to enormous size. By the end of the month, the fruits are sweet, the vegetables are succulent, and the grains are hearty. Then, the Moonlit Harvest is held, and all the folk of the province, young and old, head into the fields and orchards to reap the month’s bounty under a brilliant moon before ending the night with a celebratory festival.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Crop Trotters</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Crop trotters are giant turkeys with substantial speed, strength, and endurance that serve as the primary beasts of burden in Enoch. The province’s people have a great respect and appreciation for these birds, which are critical in pulling wagons, plowing fields, serving as mounts, and even guarding farms from predators and bandits. For many families, they are cherished as precious pets that sleep inside the home when the work is done.</p><p class=\"p4\">The breeding and rearing of crop trotters is an esteemed and invaluable profession, and many farmers donate a portion of their heartiest harvest to newly hatched poults to ensure the next generation is healthier than the last. Each year, a great race across Enoch called the Turkey Trot is held, and folk from across the province compete to win the title of Top Trotter with their trusted, feathered steed.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Enoch_Methuselah%20cat%20statue.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Methuselah</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The oldest living being in Enoch is also its leader—a black-furred cat-man with eyes as gold as the province’s grain fields at harvest time. No one knows where Methuselah <em>(muh‑THOO‑suh‑luh)</em> came from, how old he is, or how he began crafting and giving life to newly rebirthed harvestborn, but what folks do know is that if there’s something to learn about Enoch, the lord of the province can teach it. He bears the immense wisdom befitting his many years but has a sprightly energy that betrays a youthful soul.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">When he is not presiding over his lordly duties, he works the fields alongside his people, shares his knowledge of the agricultural cycle with aspiring farmers, tells tall tales with just a hint of truth, and warbles songs of the harvest to all who will listen—it’s said that even the crops sway to his tune. Favoring the rustic clothing of a farmer, he prefers a simple and peaceful life but occasionally hosts a lively gathering of Enoch’s musicians called the Cornhusk Jamboree and even leads the band while strumming his favorite guitar.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Nightmare</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Not even the seemingly idyllic Enoch is spared from its fair share of terror. The name “Sister Nightmare” is whispered behind closed doors and used as a threat and warning to children who disobey their parents, but the headless witch is very real. Galloping madly through the fields atop her coal-black steed with eyes, hooves, and mane of fire, this pyromaniac sets all ablaze with her flaming whip and pumpkin head that serves as a mockery of the harvestborn she terrorizes.</p><p class=\"p4\">With every ritualistic burning, the great plumes of smoke and ash surge with magical energy that induces supernaturally intense fear through waking nightmares. As the smoke spreads, so do the shrieks of horror, with many victims even dying from fright on the spot. Sadistically relishing the dread she inspires, Sister Nightmare will not stop until the skies of Enoch are filled with ash and screams.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Pumpkin Hill</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Atop the highest hillock in Enoch is the capital city of Pumpkin Hill, which overlooks miles of patchworked fields below. Packed dirt streets snake through homes, gardens, shops, gathering halls, and other rustic wooden structures before converging in a lively town square. Here, weekly markets and monthly festivals draw people from across the province to trade and celebrate the harvest. Corn husking and pumpkin throwing contests are common sights, and folk dances are stepped through with joyful abandon.</p><p class=\"p4\">Standing at the center of the city and rising from the highest point on the hill is Harvesthome Hall, where representatives from every community in Enoch gather to discuss and decide provincial matters, always advised by Methuselah. Just down the road is the famous Candlewick Tavern, which serves pumpkin ale renowned across Druskenvald. One of the yearly events that draws numerous visitors from other provinces is the Emerald Hunt, in which participants seek powerful gemstones said to contain fragments of the powerful green magic of Enoch.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Enoch_Alistra%20Moon%20Embroidery.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Bramblethorn Brothers’ Barnstead</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The Bramblethorn Brothers—Barnaby, Bertram, and Bartholomew—run the largest and most advanced farm in Enoch, an operation that threatens to take over its smaller neighbors’ steads. Favoring technological advancement over tradition, the brothers split up in their youth and studied in Edwardia, Bubonia, and Astramar, respectively, returning home with knowledge of strange science, engineering, and alchemy to turn the Barnstead into a “modern marvel of agriculture.”</p><p class=\"p4\">Their achievements included altering seeds to complete a full cycle in a single week, constructing tireless harvest constructs to endlessly work the fields, and modifying crop trotters to be even larger, more powerful, and vicious. Their headquarters now also serves as a laboratory, factory, and fortress, with bizarre new “improvements” made monthly. Although they produce extraordinary yields, side effects and mishaps are constant, and if unchecked, the Bramblethorn Brothers’ Barnstead could overtake the whole province.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Enoch</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In Enoch, adventurers often find themselves protecting the abundant fields from strange forces, unraveling eerie folklore that has come to life, and uncovering long-buried mysteries hidden in the heart of the province.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.L1IetAIaqIYJ7tS0]{Enoch Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

It’s the memories that remain at the end of it all. This night, too, is fleeting. So let us live it fully and love it deeply, my sweet, so that we make memories worthy of you and I that endure until the last star takes its final breath. Will you join me for this dance?”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Catrina the Sweet -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">In Kalero <em>(kuh‑LAIR‑oh)</em>, life and death are celebrated with equal exuberance. This province is dominated by deep canyons formed by roaring rivers that snake through the land, their tall earthen walls carved out to construct settlements, roads, and innumerable individual tombs from which newly rebirthed relicborn emerge. These skeletal folk and the other people of the province adorn themselves in vibrant colors and marigold garlands as they paint beautifully intricate murals honoring those who came before.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">The dry wind here carries golden sand and the scent of burning incense as it whips through the bustling markets and colorful remembrance celebrations that take place at all hours of the night. But the gold of Kalero is not just from the desert sands, and swashbuckling adventurers are called from far and wide to seek vast treasure troves hidden throughout the province, whether within the ruins of a mesa-top city or lost in a shipwreck in a forgotten cove. In this place where history and legend are honored with great esteem, excitement and adventure await for all daring enough to seek it.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>River of Remembrance</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The River of Remembrance winds through the deep canyons that comprise most of the province, as wide and turbulent as a nautical strait. This prominent waterway forged Kalero, not just by shaping the landscape to its running course, but also by intertwining the region with the essence of memory. The great river’s waters contain the lingering memories of souls lost to the Shroud and are all that remain of who they once were. Those who peer into the rushing waters can see full spectral scenes playing beneath the surface in the fragmented moments of extinguished lives.</p><p class=\"p4\">This river is also the primary method of travel through Kalero and to the provinces beyond. Numerous ships of all shape, size, and construction navigate the waterways on all manner of voyages from trading to treasure hunting. However, the waters are often treacherous with sudden rapids and whirlpools, hungry river beasts, and the vicious pirates that lurk in the hidden coves throughout the bottom of the canyons.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Thousand Bones</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Rising up from the rocks, rivers, and sands of Kalero are the Thousand Bones—countless towering pillar-like rock formations that reach high into the sky above. Finding the footholds to scale the bones is a near-impossible task, made far more deadly by the violent gales that batter each zenith and the viciously ravenous vultures of colossal size that nest among the jutting spires.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, an endless number of explorers, fortune hunters, and thrill seekers make the attempt, for legend states that atop the Thousand Bones are the glittering ruins of cities made of gold, rubies, and long-lost magical technology. Adventurers believe that the secret to successfully reaching the top of the bones lies in the lost memories of the first inhabitants of Kalero, waiting in a forgotten tomb built into a remote canyon wall.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Catrina the Sweet</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Catrina the Sweet <em>(kuh‑TREE‑nuh)</em> leads the province like she leads the dance during Kalero’s unending celebrations—with unbound vivaciousness and a lust for life that can only be truly appreciated by the dead. As a relicborn, her skeletal features are adorned with a rainbow of intricate patterns and draped in swirling silks, jangling jewelry, sweet perfumes, and a veritable mane of curly locks that seem to have a mind of their own.</p><p class=\"p4\">While her unbound enthusiasm, joy, and passion for dancing and pageantry lead some adversaries to dismiss her as a legitimate threat, such folly always leads to defeat or death. Hand-in-hand with Catrina’s gregarious delight is a playful cunning and measured ferocity that she leverages to fiercely protect the past, present, and future of her province. Embracing the beauty of death has made Catrina one of the most respected and even feared leaders among the nobility of the Crescent Court.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Playtime</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">As the youngest, smallest, and most frail of Mother Midnight’s daughters, Sister Playtime is consumed by envy—of her sisters’ power and station, of the joyous community shared among Kalero’s people, and of the toys, friends, and parties she never had. Appearing like an uncanny doll with a porcelain face, Playtime has mastered the magic of memory and has the mind to turn her victims into her own living playthings.</p><p class=\"p4\">Not caring to earn true companions, she wipes and manipulates the minds and memories of the province’s people so they will offer her the adoration she desperately craves. She makes them play games with her that often end in disaster and death. Every night, her jealousy builds, and she will not be satisfied until all of Kalero is her personal playground.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Memento</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Built into the sheer stone walls of Kalero’s canyons and overlooking the winding River of Remembrance is Memento <em>(muh‑MEN‑toh)</em>. Every corner of this many-tiered capital city is etched with personal memories, and the streets are lined with altars of remembrance and reverence for the dead. Public art, decoration, and monuments of every imaginable hue make Memento a prism of a city that casts its colorful vivaciousness across the great walkways, staircases, and tunnels that connect the hive-like network of districts.</p><p class=\"p4\">Memento never sleeps, and at all hours of the night, there are lively bands playing, celebratory dances, and bustling shops offering flowers, sweets, and other goods. Visitors come from far and wide to experience the city’s famous Screaming Skulls—magical fireworks that scream through the sky in brilliant colors before exploding into complex patterns and images to the delight of all below.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Kalero_Caterina%20the%20Sweet%20Papercut.webp\" width=\"400\" class=\" centered\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Port Melee</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Nestled within a protected cove along the River of Remembrance is Port Melee <em>(MAY‑lay)</em>, the largest port in southern Druskenvald and the center of commerce in Kalero. Goods from every province are bought and sold in the crowded public markets of this flourishing town, and even rare items from beyond the Shroud can be procured in private negotiations. And for those who know where to find it, the infamous Dorado Auction House offers strange artifacts, exotic creatures, dangerous weaponry, and other curiosities found only on the black market.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Kalero_Ilinca%20Moon%20mural.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p4\">With so many riches concentrated in one location, Port Melee earns its name from the constant conflict with pirates, bandit gangs, and other cutthroats that conduct raids on the town in hopes of pilfering even a fraction of its wealth. However, the town is heavily defended with magical cannons that turn Screaming Skulls into projectile weapons, and a culture of martial prowess is fostered among the locals so they can sufficiently defend their homes. In fact, Druskenvald’s premier school of swordsmanship, the Mastered Hand, is one of the port’s oldest institutions, turning young aspirants into agile and deadly Wave Dashers, an elite league of duelists.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Kalero</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Amid Kalero’s vibrant celebrations and remembrance ceremonies, swashbuckling excitement and exploration await.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.MsZg3huASv3T3WpE]{Kalero Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

We built it.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- God King Xanatep -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">The far southeastern reaches of Druskenvald are covered in desolate, jagged mountain ranges and crumbled ruins devoid of life. However, deep beneath the earth in massive, sprawling caverns is Nerukhet <em>(NAIR‑oo‑KET)</em>, a grand province lit by glittering gemstone geodes that shine kaleidoscopic light across monumental cities and webbed tunnels from which the spider-like silkborn emerge. These people and the other species of the province strive for greatness in all aspects of life, with many hoping to establish their place in history as the chosen of their gods.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, the threads holding Nerukhet together are thin, with conflict and unrest always lurking beneath the surface of society—and far worse things squirming in the darkest depths.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Tears of the Gods</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The massive, sparkling gemstones found throughout Nerukhet are known as Tears of the Gods, which feature prominently in the long and storied history of the province. Legend says they were gifted by the gods of the land, who wept when the province’s First Kingdom upon the surface fell to a great cataclysm, calling the survivors to a new promised land to rebuild their civilization with these magical gems that hum with divine vitality.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Granting long life, sharp mind, strong body, and sturdy constitution, the tears are greatly coveted, but they are collected en masse by the wealthiest and most noble families of the province, passed on from generation to generation through great inheritances. Varying greatly in size, color, and power, they are used as currency and worn as signs of status and influence.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Bejeweled</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The people of Nerukhet live in harmony with enormous, divine insects and arachnids known as the Bejeweled, whose carapaces are encrusted with jewels. Believed to be the heralds of the gods, these creatures share a special psychic bond with the province’s inhabitants, with the long-lived creatures often loyally serving the same family for generations. Their hides, eyes, and mandibles glow with the same glimmering light that illuminates the province, and they assist with all manner of tasks required by their masters, from boring new tunnels to joining armies in war.</p><p class=\"p4\">The most numerous of the Bejeweled are spiders the size of large hounds, which can be found in every household, no matter their wealth and station. These spiders assist with everyday tasks and spin the silk that clothes and adorns the province. Huge locusts provide air travel across the vast subterranean province, and enormous scarabs are monumental in the construction of the homes, temples, and palaces of its cities. The rarest, most powerful, and most highly sought-after Bejeweled are dragon-sized scorpions that are used as symbols of divinity by the prominent houses that command them.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>God King Xanatep</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Said to be the only silkborn that has ascended to divinity and achieved immortality, God King Xanatep <em>(ZAN‑uh‑tep)</em> is the supreme ruler of Nerukhet. He begrudgingly pledges fealty to Phillip Druskenvald under the condition that he can rule his people as he sees fit. As the master of Vekloriash the Amethyst Dread—the largest and deadliest bejeweled scorpion to ever exist and the only to possess great dragonfly wings—he has remained unopposed since before the doom of the First Kingdom. While his pride is unmatched, his true aim is to increase the greatness of Nerukhet above all else.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s6\">Ruling from the top of the colossal monument-flanked ziggurat in Arakir, the Skittering City, Xanatep allows the various factions, houses, and families to squabble and settle disputes on their own, even as it comes to war. However, if such a conflict ever threatens the security or prosperity of the province, he descends upon the battle atop Vekloriash and brings an end to the fighting, often resulting in the total annihilation of both sides. Through the Tears of the Gods, he can see across all of Nerukhet, so few escape his watchful and merciless gaze.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Nerukhet_Faerlina%20Moon%20Silk%20Shawl.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Hourglass</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">While personal achievement and measured mastery of oneself are paramount in Nerukhet, extreme opulence and over-indulgence are a constant concern, especially among the wealthy and the noble. It is through parties and politicking that Sister Hourglass thrives and weaves an ever-growing web of deceit and treachery that threatens to topple the civilization of the province. While she is tall, curvaceous, and hypnotically beautiful with sleek arachnid features, the danger of her oft-leveraged seduction pales in comparison to her deadly cunning.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Spinning spells that manipulate the mind of her victims, she pulls the strings of the ruling classes and guides Nerukhet to its eventual self-destruction. Aiding her are swarms of spiders that feed her whispers and secrets she uses to tighten her grip around the province. On the rare occasion that her numerous disguises are uncovered, her eldritch webs and venomous fangs leave no witnesses.</p><p></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Arakir, the Skittering City</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The massive, many-tiered capital of Nerukhet is perhaps the premier wonder of Druskenvald, and those who have not seen it cannot imagine its sheer size and grandeur. Filled with glittering temples to the many gods of the province, imposing tombs of the most legendary historical figures, and magnificent palaces of the most prosperous houses, Arakir <em>(AHR‑uh‑KEER)</em>, the Skittering City stands as a monument to its people, who have achieved so much in the unlikeliest of places.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Illuminated by radiant geodes, the capital buzzes with countless bejeweled alongside the bustling lives of the silkborn and other people who live there. Beautiful gardens flourish with colorful vegetation that should not be able to thrive underground. The immense Lapis Library contains numerous ancient texts, both historical and poetic, that stretch back millennia. And the most infamous location in the city is the Tunnel of Claws, where wild and vicious bejeweled scorpions unclaimed by masters lurk and hunt.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Nerukhet_Xanatep%20gemstone%20statue.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Crawling Doom</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In the deepest and darkest pit of Nerukhet lies a ruined place of death and horror. In eons past, the people of the First Kingdom, who once thrived upon the surface, grew hedonistic, envious, and overzealous for grandeur. The province rotted from within, along with the hearts and souls of its people. They began worshiping a strange and terrible entity that promised wealth, greatness, and immortality in exchange for offerings of depravity. The people abided, society degraded, and the thing fed and grew until one awful night when the nameless horror brought doom to the kingdom.</p><p class=\"p4\">While the surface was left a wasteland, the remnants of the First Kingdom collapsed into a pit, where a fleshy, squirming aberration resides within the cursed depths of the province. This unthinkable horror shatters the minds of all who see it, and the mightiest priests and magicians of Nerukhet have sealed it away with intricate spells and blessings. However, every year that goes by, this protective barrier cracks, and the thing in the darkness waits.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Nerukhet</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In the gleaming depths of Nerukhet’s gem-lit caverns, peril and intrigue await.

Olmarsh <em>(OAL‑marsh)</em> stretches along miles of rocky shoreline and flooded salt marshes, and it encompasses numerous islands that dot the waters off the coast. A shadow hangs over the province and slithers up from below, gripping its people in a paranoia of the unknown.</p><p class=\"p4\">Life here is simple and buoyed by the bounty of fish that the sea provides, allowing the people of the province to live beyond a meager existence limited by the scarce resources of the land. But there is a constant threat from the watery depths. Even the semi-aquatic deepborn fled to the surface in fear of the abyss from which they emerged. Worse still is the ever-present feeling of being watched by something from the night sky overhead. Above the waves, the cold, salty air is thick, almost viscous, and a strange fishy stink lingers in every corner of the province.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Light of the Drowned</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Pervading the dark waters of Olmarsh is an unceasing threat of eldritch, gibbering storms that whip up out of nowhere, swallow ships whole, and turn any survivors to incoherent babbling. The only defense against these storms and other cosmic intrusions are the numerous lighthouses that dot the coastline and isles of the province, each shining with an eerie, ghostly light. Crews that have the skill to navigate between these beacons and stay in the radius of their enchanted light are shielded from such strange phenomena.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">However, such a protective boon comes at great cost, for the lamps are fueled by the souls of those lost at sea. Each lonely lighthouse is manned and operated by a single keeper who also serves as a warden of the souls, keeping the flame lit while being battered by the incessant wails of the drowned. Such a position is considered a great honor and noble sacrifice, for every tender of the light is doomed to have their own mind shattered whilst providing safe passage for the minds of others.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Hungering Ones</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The most calamitous threat to ships and coastal settlements are the various colossal sea monsters that dwell in the abyssal depths of Druskenvald’s black ocean. They take myriad forms, including great shelled krakens, ghostly white megalodons, fiendish whale-like leviathans, and titanic adversarial crabs. Feared, yet also worshiped as deities, these Hungering Ones are offered food, treasure, and sacrifice to sate their appetite in the faint hope that a vessel or town is spared from their legendary wrath.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, for those daring, or perhaps foolish enough, a fortune can be made by slaying one of these behemoths and harvesting its corpse for a valuable psychedelic substance called Tide Ash, which can be found within the heart of each beast no matter its form. Even more desirable is a mythical shell that, when blown like a horn, binds the will of a Hungering One.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Olmarsh_Nezara%20Moon%20figurehead.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Captain Ephraim Wake</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">Captain Ephraim Wake <em>(EFF‑rum WAIK)</em> was a renowned deepborn sailor and one of the first lighthouse keepers to ever man the light of the drowned. He lasted longer than any keeper has before or since, but he eventually succumbed to the delusions of the enchantment in the lamp. Hearing a siren’s call out on the sea, he swam to meet it and was devoured by a Hungering One. None know what brought him back, but the next night, he returned to shore as a spirit who bore the secrets of the deep and the sight beyond the stars.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">As the lord of Olmarsh, Captain Wake appears as a burly green ghost with a great beard of tentacles and seaweed. He is typically clad in his eternally weathered captain’s outfit and is mostly lucid, though he is occasionally overcome with ravings of superstitions, curses, and dangers on the horizon—all of which are filled with truth and heeded by his people. This eldritch, perhaps cosmic, knowledge has allowed the people of the province to weather the numerous dangers both natural and supernatural, and his leadership continues to be invaluable in their survival.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Fathom</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Sister Fathom’s sorrow mirrors the sadness of Druskenvald’s people. When they cry, she sheds briny, inky tears that spill into the sea. With slimy skin, kelp-like hair, and scaled fins, she is a creature of the ocean and is bound to it as a prisoner of her own misery. When she surfaces and yearns for land, her tears spill forth in a great surge that crushes her back to the deep.</p><p class=\"p4\">Her eerie witchcraft conjures impossibly acidic ooze that can eat away a galleon in mere moments. A fleshy bulb that hangs from her forehead casts an enchanting light that can hypnotize and draw unwary sailors into her clutches. She seeks to steal the Light of the Drowned into her lure so that she may command all the sea monsters of Olmarsh to flood the land in a tidal wave of her tears, making the land-dwellers suffer as she does. Her misery forever craves company.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Ibbsmouth</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Ibbsmouth <em>(IBZ‑mith)</em> is the fog-bound coastal capital of Olmarsh and the biggest port city in Druskenvald. Crooked, drab streets wind their way through gray, weather-worn buildings that are populated with folk who seem just a little off. Despite the gloomy appearance, sailors, traders, fishermen, and hunters come from all other provinces to make port before seeking the supernatural bounty of the strange tides off the coast.</p><p class=\"p4\">Amidst the salty markets and docks covered in the blood of lesser sea monsters, eldritch and occult relics, often collected from the countless sunken ruins found in the marshes of the province, are traded behind closed doors and away from prying eyes. Unsettling, rundown chapels can be found honoring the various Hungering Ones that are often surprisingly full of worshipers, driven by equal parts adoration and dread. The most infamous location in the city is the Seven Sisters tavern, known for its seafood stew and the raucous clientele of salty dogs, cutthroats, and bad eggs.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Olmarsh_Captain-Wake-Flag.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Darktide Manor</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Far south of Ibbsmouth, along a stretch of particularly treacherous, windswept cliffs, is a cursed site known as Seabird’s Fall, where a legendary mariner once brought down an albatross—a foolish act that invited doom upon himself, his crew, and his entire family line. Here stands Darktide Manor, a towering, gloomy mansion that defies architectural logic. A combination of protective spells, lingering curses, marsh dangers, and sudden gales makes it perilous to reach, but those who knock on its heavy oaken door have found the headquarters of the Nautilus Order.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Bearing the symbol of the spiral shell, this secret society fosters the study of the strange, occult, and forbidden, seeking both magical and scientific pursuits. It also serves as a museum filled with curiosities from across Druskenvald and beyond, as well as a small university where only the most committed can succeed and survive. Initiation into the Nautilus Order involves venturing to a nearby black reef on a night that it rises above the surface of the sea and sacrificing something or someone precious to prove that your old life is over.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Olmarsh</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Amid Olmarsh’s fog-drenched shores and haunting waters, hidden terrors and twisted mysteries await.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.Ky0E1xvGw3hux1Yk]{Olmarsh Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

Blessed is the one, who in the name of piousness, temperance, diligence, and unity, sacrifices all they have and all they are to follow in the footsteps of the divine. This is the only path to the silver heavens and the blinding light of its joyous rapture!”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Archbishop Danton Alexandre Renault -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">In Pholsense <em>(FOAL‑senss)</em>, every life is measured, above all else, by its adherence to divine law. In the quiet provincial towns that dot the rolling hills, fertile farmland, and humble woodlands, life is quite peaceful, but there is always a lurking fear of making a wrong move and straying from the Silver Path. For within the province’s great cities, built from the same stone that the gargoyle-like stoneborn are carved out of, the zealous militants of this faith seek wayward and wicked souls to judge and purge swiftly and without mercy.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Whether the people of the province walk through crowded streets or sprawling fields, they strive to keep their footfalls along the path of righteousness so they might be rewarded ascension to the blinding light of the one true god. In Pholsense society, it is paramount to put the Silver Path above neighbor, family, and self, vigilantly watching for and reporting any transgression or heresy to the inquisitors responsible for dispensing the silver justice. Magic achieved through any means other than faith is deeply distrusted, and casting the wrong spell at the wrong time can ensure a fiery fate.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Silver Path</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The Silver Path is not merely a religion or divine philosophy; it is the god itself. Lacking the typical trappings of personification that mortals often attribute to their gods, this deity exists as an imperceivable divine will that upholds the five holy tenets: piousness, temperance, diligence, unity, and sacrifice. There is zero tolerance for sin or apathy that affronts these virtues. Pholsense has suffered far worse from the witchcraft of the Coven of the Midnight Moon than any other province, which has only emboldened their righteous fury.</p><p class=\"p4\">Most of Pholsense, including many of the stoneborn and other species of the province, serve as devout members of the faith, celebrating with regular ceremonies in a variety of houses of worship, from small chapels to grand cathedrals. All throughout the region, the near-constant ringing of great bells can be heard; the faithful claim this is the voice of the Silver Path and attempt to discern meaning from it. However, members of the hierarchical clergy insist only they can truly decipher the voice of their god, so they act as intermediaries with increasing authority all the way to the head of the church, Archbishop Renault.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Silver Hammer</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The Silver Hammer is a knightly order of inquisitors and crusaders dedicated to purity above all else, traveling across the province and unfalteringly seeking out evil as the Silver Path defines it. While many chapters of the knights genuinely want to protect the innocent of Pholsense from the machinations of Mother Midnight, the methods of some chapters are extreme and often cruel, justified as a necessity to rid the province of witchcraft and wickedness. Fair trials are rare when a suspicion takes root, especially when the malignant effects of curses are discovered.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">Practitioners of arcane and primal magic are deeply distrusted by the Silver Hammer and are sometimes dealt with indiscriminately, alongside actual servants of the mother of witches. However, magic-users who report and register their powers with the order and take a vow to use them in the service of good are generally tolerated or even tasked to fight alongside the knights to unleash their spells upon the wicked, fighting fire with fire.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Pholsense__Mother%20Midnight%20stained%20glass.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Archbishop Danton Alexandre Renault</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The ruler of Pholsense holds his lordly duty and loyalty to the Crescent Court firmly secondary to his embodiment and obedience to the Silver Path. Appearing as a tall, thin, silver-skinned human with shimmering angelic eyes, Archbishop Danton Alexandre Renault <em>(DAN‑tawn a‑lek‑SAN‑dur reh‑NOH)</em> leads the province under the same tenets with which he leads the church. He strives for perfection in all things, particularly in the carving of the stoneborn, whom he views, along with the other species of Pholsense, as his flock. He expects similar perfection from his people but regularly offers forgiveness for those who confess to sin and accept harsh penance.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, sin lurks at the heart of the archbishop, and each passing year, he becomes more fond of indulgence in food, drink, flesh, and coin, as well as the ramping sadistic glee with which he conducts interrogations, complete with torture. While his inner demons gnaw away at him, Archbishop Renault keeps this truth hidden in his corrupted heart as he delivers blistering sermons from his seat of power in Cyril’s Cathedral of the Silver Rapture.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Mother Midnight</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Where the hallowed ground of the Silver Path blazes brightest, the Coven of the Midnight Moon is at its strongest due to the oppressive presence of its matron, Mother Midnight, who looms over the province like a gloaming goddess of witchcraft and wickedness—a deliberate and direct mockery of Pholsense’s rigid god.<br />None know where the witch mother came from, but it is whispered that she has been in the domain as long as Phillip Druskenvald has ruled it. And it is the sin that lurks in the hearts of mortals with which she seeks, draws forth, twists, and consumes. While she does bear genuine love for her twelve daughters, she fosters competition and pits them against each other to ensure they are ruthless in the execution of their own machinations.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">She is a master of the general magic arts, with particular talent for shapeshifting, corruption of mind, body, and soul, potion brewing, and familiar conjuring and manipulation. She spends her time in Pholsense turning its people to sin and causing them to veer off the Silver Path. She slowly siphons occult energy from their corrupted hearts, which she will use to usher in a single night of sin that turns the province into a hellscape of wickedness and the staging ground for her conquest of Druskenvald.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Cyril</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">The shining, silver heart of Pholsense is its capital city, Cyril <em>(SEER‑ull)</em>. One of Druskenvald’s great metropolises, its grandeur and achievements in architecture and stonemasonry make the other settlements of the province, even its other cities, look like ramshackle frontier camps. Despite widespread poverty, famine, and disease throughout the province, the city is a monument of polished stone and glittering silver, filled with towering statues and complex, multi-tiered fountains. At the city center is the enormous Cathedral of the Silver Rapture, which rings dozens of colossal silver bells that chime through the city and at all hours of the night.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">It is also home to the headquarters of the Silver Hammer and its inquisitorium’s gaol, where the most wicked heretics are imprisoned and tortured, whether innocent or not. Near the city outskirts is the Cyril Orphanage, the biggest in Druskenvald. It houses thousands of children that have lost their parents to inquisition, witchcraft, or the dangers of living in the overcrowded and unsanitary districts of the city. Sprawling beneath the city are miles of catacombs so famous that visitors from across the other provinces travel to explore them—though not all return.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Pholsense</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">From grim trials to curses that fester like wounds, Pholsense calls forth those who dare challenge its fervent laws and break the chains of zealotry.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.rQYho8CDvDkwpqDj]{Pholsense Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

The reason is simple! The world is miserable, and this will never change. You know this. Blinski knows this. The people know this most of all. But if Blinski can show them wonder, make them smile, and help them forget misery for just one night, they might believe that change is possible. Such a thing is truly special, my friend. Blinski built this place to see the looks on the people’s faces when they believe.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Blinski II -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">Fun is not just a way of life in Picco <em>(PEE‑koh)</em>; it’s the law of the land. It is a place of high energy and constant motion, where all manner of play thrives outside the world of make-believe, and the wildest imaginations are made manifest by the great and powerful toymaker Blinski II, who wants nothing more than to grant every unfulfilled childhood wish. From within his walking mechanical workshop, he is always creating new toys, attractions, and other inventions of thrill, as well as the doll-like threadborn, which he crafts with the most love of all.</p><p class=\"p4\">To the ever-present tune of a discordant calliope, the people of the province go about their lives in frantic frivolity, surrounded by a fabricated landscape of cloth, decorations, and props as if pulled straight from a school’s stage play. While the endless fun is exciting and joyous, it is often dangerous, with the thrills occasionally turning deadly and the lack of rest leaving the uninitiated exhausted and even terrified.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Fun Tickets</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In Picco, it's not gold that buys goods and services. Instead, Fun Tickets are the province's currency, which take the form of shiny carnival tickets in vibrant colors that represent different uses, from purchasing food to securing passage in one of the huge hot air balloons that soar across the province. These tickets drive Funtopia’s economy—which by all reasonable accounts should simply not function—and they can be obtained in a variety of ways, including purchasing with coin, earning through work, winning as a game prize, or rewarded for succeeding in an incredible challenge.</p><p class=\"p4\">Rare and uniquely designed tickets procured through particularly death-defying feats have specialized magical power. Avid collectors travel from across Druskenvald in the hopes of finding these rare and prestigious prizes. There are rumors of exclusive attractions and artifacts that require one of these precious tickets to gain access.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Jolly Jangles</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">While Blinski’s vision of a happy Picco may seem like a lighthearted hope for the inhabitants, it is, in fact, a mandate that is held with immense gravity. To this end, the toymaker created Jolly Jangles, an enormous flying cymbal monkey that serves as the guardian of Picco. It was built with the ability to sense the overall mood of the province and sniff out negative emotions that might threaten to bring others down.</p><p class=\"p4\">Jolly Jangles flies throughout the province, visiting those experiencing prolonged sadness, anger, or other such unpleasantries. He first attempts to cheer them up with titanic pratfalls and folly, but he will eventually resort to absconding with the individual in question if the mood does not improve. These “downers” are brought to Blinski’s workshop for “tinkering” until unbound fun is restored.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Picco_Blinski%20II%20toystore%20hangout%20board.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Blinski II</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The gregarious Blinski II <em>(BLIN‑skee)</em>, known for booming laughter and infectious cheer, is the creator of Picco and most of its inhabitants, whom he builds and repairs with deep affection and care. A master toymaker, he is an automaton himself, with stout, rounded proportions that presumably resemble whomever “Blinski the First” was, although none remember any master of toys but this second incarnation. Finding the bureaucratic duties of lordship painfully dull, he prefers to travel the province in his mechanical walking workshop, have fun with his subjects, and offer free repairs to the broken.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">In a realm of eternal night filled with terror and misery, Blinski believes it his duty—as well as the duty of his people—to bring only joy, laughter, and light to the darkness. This childlike innocence and enthusiasm, despite being one of the oldest lords of Druskenvald, has made him a target of manipulation among his fellow nobles. This occasionally leads to questionable and even disastrous deeds, all committed with genuinely pure intentions but without full understanding of the consequences.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Antic</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The most unhinged and unpredictable of Mother Midnight’s daughters, Sister Antic is a frenzied witch of sadistic joy and delusion who strives for nothing but pure chaos. Antic has an immensely colorful personality, but her entire form, as well as all her spells and possessions, exists only in grayscale, as if she was made from paper and ink. Her proportions are unnatural, rounded, and elongated, and she wears an eternal grin.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Sister Antic can effortlessly manipulate reality around her, stretching and reshaping her body and her surroundings and conjuring anything from her imagination out of thin air in an instant. In the hands of a witch with a deliberate will, this seemingly impossible magic could make her one of the most powerful beings in existence, but the chaotic Antic never uses it to its full potential, instead favoring its application for comedic or dramatic effect. Her most intentional use of witchcraft is magical explosives, and she hopes that blowing up enough buildings and people will eventually lead to a Druskenvald of pure anarchy.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Funtopia</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">While the entire province of Picco is one big circus, the capital of Funtopia<em> (fun‑TOH‑pee‑uh) </em>is the heart of the festivities. Equal parts carnival, amusement park, and city, it is a wonder of magical engineering that allows for a society of living toys to thrive. A night’s work here usually consists of playing games for hours to earn Fun Tickets.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Funtopia’s food is rarely nutritious but supremely delicious, drawing adventurous eaters from across Druskenvald to sample the endless creative options, especially the legendary Jolly Jangles Waffles. The transportation system consists of elaborately constructed rides that carry commuters across town at extreme speeds, filling the air with screams of thrill and delight as they are delivered to any of the city’s themed districts.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Crazy Clown Hell.</strong> Kept uncomfortably hot and adorned with the imagery of devils, jesters, and hellfire, this is the center of thrill in the city, where all the most extreme, death-defying rides and attractions can be found. It also contains the headquarters of the Honk Legion, the premier union for Picco’s numerous fools, led by the beloved clown Chookels-Chookels.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Dinoworld.</strong> Amidst towering facsimiles of jungle trees, intricately constructed mechanical dinosaurs fill crowds with awe and delight in a district that encourages exploration and heroic adventure. Also serving as the university district, it features schools that teach only fun subjects.</p><p class=\"p4\"><em><strong>Strahdanya’s Castlemania.</strong></em> Shrouded in endless darkness, this spooky district focuses on delivering fun-filled frights with haunted houses, dark rides, and other scary attractions. It also serves as the drama hub of the city; every night, the castle-sized Cravencroft Theater shows a performance of the critically acclaimed stage play <em>Curse of Strahdanya.</em></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Friendlyville.</strong> The center of wholesome fun aimed at children and adults who are young at heart, this soft district is filled with cozy, pillow-like cottages and contains a large population of living, snuggly stuffed animals that provide relentless love and encouragement to all who visit. Overseen by Mayor Cream Cheese, a plump, stuffed llama, it also provides homes and support for the lost, broken, and misfit toys of the province.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Captain Bone’s Lagoon.</strong> This district-sized, pirate-themed water park features year-round aquatic attractions, such as wave pools, lazy rivers, and the infamous, never-ending Captain Bone’s Wild Slide. It also serves as Funtopia’s port, allowing ships from across Druskenvald to come and go with cargo and passengers that help keep the city thriving.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>Neonopolis.</strong> Lit by bright, vibrantly colored lights and painted with starry scenes of the cosmos, this is Funtopia’s music district, with concert venues and dance halls on every corner that feature all manner of musical performances. However, much of Neonopolis is under construction, with flashing signs bearing the promise that the city’s greatest attraction is yet to come.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Picco</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Step right up to Picco’s peculiar carnival of wonders, where adventurers will enjoy thrills, chills, and kills.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.KNv8wj0o98px6c6D]{Picco Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

However, each of the three warring factions would scoff at being the first to suggest peace. Thus, the fighting rages on across the snow-bound landscape, where the bones of long-dead dragons rest and countless graves spawn the ghoulish graveborn.</p><p class=\"p4\">The hollow remnant of a once-great kingdom that united humanity and dragonkind, Syndramas <em>(sin‑DRAH‑mus)</em> is now a place of immense necrotic power. Any living thing that dies within its borders rises again as an Undead creature, joining the endless armies of graveborn and other species of the province. These tireless warriors spill forth from metal fortresses and vast grave cities, clashing with masterfully forged weapons and armor to earn glory for themselves and their legions in the eyes of their Wyrm Queen, Sapphira.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Sepulchral Legions</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Syndramas is eternally warred over by three militant legions, each with its own culture, territory, capital, and military hierarchy, as well as specialized tactics, weaponry, and occult arts. Though each is led by a grand general, all three factions pledge fealty to Wyrm Queen Sapphira, who allows and even encourages conflict, so long as it does not spill beyond the borders of the province. The victory condition of each legion is the total annihilation of the other two so they may earn the sole favor of their draconic monarch and prepare for the eventual conquest of the rest of Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p4\"><em><strong>The Rimeshade Legion</strong></em>. Clad in heavy plates of drakkonite and armed with icy, runic blades, this legion relies upon the superiority of its war chest. Hoarding more resources than the other two legions combined, its armies are equipped with exceptional weapons and armor engraved with eldritch runes of frost and shadow, and they march to battle alongside immense war machines. Huge floating fortresses powered by ancient magic drift through the sky, allowing the Rimeshade Legion to bring the might of its armory to every front.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\"><em><strong>The Bloodboil Legion</strong></em>. Every warrior of this faction has total devotion to the legion and their comrades, and this tight-knit fellowship allows this army to fight in perfect synchronicity. Each soldier fiercely pursues mastery of combat, aided by blood magic rituals that provide supernatural strength, precision, and battle instinct.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><em><strong>The Marrowfeast Legion.</strong></em> Sheer numbers and viciousness allow this faction to compete in the war for Syndramas. Emerging from great hives made from dragon bone, hordes of innumerable warriors crash upon their foes like a wave, with each fallen soldier replaced by two more. The legion employs few complex tactics, though it frequently unleashes the vile necrotic magic of the province itself to wither and putrefy its enemies.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Drakkonite</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In the great conflict that destroyed the ruined kingdom that once thrived in Syndramas, countless mighty dragons perished, and their broken bodies have been covered by the frozen wastes. As mass death fell upon the great creatures by the thousands, their draconic essence was leeched into the province itself, forever changing the land and creating a new metal ore that would be called drakkonite <em>(DRACK‑oh‑nite)</em>.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Vast deposits of this dark and unnaturally cold metal can be found throughout Syndramas. Known for its immense sharpness, strength, and lightness, it is widely used across the province in the construction of weapons, armor, and structures. Because it is so highly sought after, even by warriors outside Syndramas, many of the deadliest battles have been fought over drakkonite mines.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/01_INT_DRS_Syndramas_Sapphira%20relief%20fresco%20PNG.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Wyrm Queen Sapphira</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The wintry dragon that would become the leader of Syndramas was the last being to die in the brutal civil war that destroyed a once-thriving kingdom. Having witnessed such wanton destruction driven by the squabbling of petty lords, including the extinction of her kind, her final moments were consumed by unbound rage and hate. This set off a necrotic chain reaction that turned the province into a land of undeath and resurrected Sapphira <em>(suh‑FEER‑uh)</em> as an immensely powerful necromancer. Now, she appears as a great skeletal dragon with desiccated gray flesh and patches of blue and white scales.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s6\">Sparing her dragon kin from such an existence, Sapphira raised the former humans of the kingdom, twisting them into the ghoulish graveborn and becoming their Wyrm Queen. She now rules them and the other species of her frigid domain with pride and ruthlessness, manipulating the three warring factions into constant conflict with promises of glory—in part due to a bitter vengeance but also out of necessity. The hungering necrotic wrath of the province has grown beyond the Wyrm Queen, and she knows that it can never abide peace. Should one legion ever claim victory, it would turn its sight southward to consume Druskenvald.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Howl</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Sporting a tall, broad, and muscular build, Sister Howl is the most physically imposing of Mother Midnight’s daughters. With razor-sharp teeth, long claws, patches of fur, and other bestial features, Howl prefers the thrill of close combat, unleashing primal instinct and raw fury enhanced by a self-empowering witchcraft that most of her sisters consider barbaric.</p><p class=\"p4\">Although she is disinterested in the broader machinations of the Coven of the Midnight Moon, Sister Howl plays along, taking any excuse to fight and kill. She leads an ever-growing horde of vicious beastmen that thunders across the frozen tundra, conducting raids and guerrilla warfare against all three Sepulchral Legions. They continually spread a curse of bestial bloodlust that twists even the most loyal soldiers into slavering pack members. She one day hopes to turn the Wyrm Queen herself into a mindless beast of mass destruction that would empower Howl to live by her own rules and even break away from her family.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sepultura</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Sepultura <em>(seh‑pull‑TUR‑uh)</em> is an enormous, fortified necropolis that stands at the center of Syndramas. Built from gravestone and drakkonite, this mighty capital serves as a neutral territory where all three legions have agreed to a truce while within the city’s walls and for ten miles beyond its limits. Violating this non-aggression pact is considered such an egregious and dishonorable taboo that even the most treacherous and power-hungry people of the province find such a thing unthinkable. The rare schemer or brute who engages in any act of war within the city is personally dealt with by Wyrm Queen Sapphira herself within her mighty drakkonite citadel at the heart of the necropolis.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Sepultura is carved up into quarters—the Frost Quarter, the Blood Quarter, and the Bone Quarter for the Rimeshade, Bloodboil, and Marrowfeast Legions, respectively, and the Wyrm Quarter, which acts as neutral ground for meeting and mingling amongst members of opposing factions and for conducting military business with Sapphira’s personal army, the Queensguard. While visitors from other provinces are rare, much coin can be made in offering goods and services of comfort to soldiers who experience so few of life’s pleasures.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Dragons’ End</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The most sacred site in Syndramas is a vast dragon graveyard in a hidden valley in the northernmost mountain range of the province. At Dragon’s End, miles of snowy landscape are covered in the massive skeletal remains of thousands of wyrms, drakes, and other dragonkin. The valley was the site of the bloodiest battle of the civil war that rendered the winter dragons extinct, and Sapphira occasionally makes a pilgrimage here to reflect in solitude—the only time she allows herself to feel any grief.</p><p class=\"p4\">Legend states that many powerful artifacts of war were lost in the battle and still wait, scattered among the bones. But would-be grave robbers must face numerous dangers, including the unforgiving elements, huge scavenging beasts that still feed on the dragons’ marrow, and lingering curses that helped bring an end to a civilization.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Syndramas</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Amid the frozen wastes of Syndramas, conflict is ceaseless as Undead legions vie for dominion, each bound by bitter rivalries and ominous secrets etched in bone.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.ncMKx1Anxj6xRXLA]{Syndramas Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

Do you hear that? Night. The spirit of life. It is calling you. Have no fear, child. It is the singing frog. It is your grandfather. It is the rain. It is the old mangrove tree. It is your mother.

Will you answer?”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Tazri Swampcaller -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Despite existing in an otherworldly domain of death, the vast, tropical swamps of Zulrogg <em>(ZULL‑rawg)</em> teem with life. Underneath a dense canopy of twisting, vine-choked trees, each stage of the cycle of life, death, and rebirth thrives in harmony with the others, as do the plants, animals, and peoples of the province. Primal and ancestral spirits drift back and forth through the veil, offering their wisdom and guidance to those who seek it.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">Although this treacherous swamp is rife with dangers of all varieties, it also provides everything needed for survival to the people of the province, including the bogborn</span>,<span class=\"s3\"> who emerge from the mire after rebirth. Forming unbreakable bonds with the bog’s beasts, both natural and supernatural, they enjoy rich and fulfilling lives that are intertwined with the wilds and led by the wisdom of the spirit priests revered by this society.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Spirit Beasts</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s6\">The province is watched over by great wild spirits that are worshipped by the people of the province. Each one takes the form of a different creature of Zulrogg’s swamps, jungles, and shorelines and is said to possess the wisdom of all the ancestors who favored that particular spirit. While some spirits are more benevolent than others, all have a place in the guidance of Zulrogg’s inhabitants, from the most humble fisherman to the wisest spirit priest.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Zulrogg’s society is based upon the reverence of and communion with these Spirit Beasts, and making regular offerings to different spirits for different things is a fact of life. However, this deep connection to mortals makes the spirits vulnerable, and malevolent ritualists seek to capture them and siphon their essence for their own ends. Some even seek to kill a Spirit Beast and claim its power for themselves.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Everblooms</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Zulrogg is overgrown with countless varieties of flowers, herbs, fruits, and other flora that all have a use as reagents in the rites, rituals, and medical practices of the province. A concoction, salve, or tincture to solve any problem can likely be procured in at least one of its stilted settlements. However, the supremely rare Everbloom is held in the highest esteem for its immense magical properties.</p><p class=\"p4\">Appearing as beautiful, delicate flowers with petals of pink, purple, orange, and gold, Everblooms radiate with the primal essence of rebirth, new life, and youth. They can only be found in remote locations at certain times under specific circumstances, and seeking them out requires the guidance of a Spirit Beast. If carefully harvested and stored without any damage to the petals, the most skilled spirit priest can utilize the flowers to create mixtures that perform miracles of healing, bring back the dead, and even grant immortal youth. This power is not taken lightly by the people of Zulrogg, and these concoctions are only given to those who have proven themselves in the eyes of the province’s spirits.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Zulrogg_Nazri%20Swampcaller%20mantle.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Tazri Swampcaller</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Although the bogborn spirit priest called Tazri Swampcaller <em>(TAZ‑ree)</em> is a member of the Crescent Court, she eschews any political authority and leads Zulrogg by example and spiritual guidance. Personally chosen by the great Hydra Spirit to be its speaker, she receives many heads' worth of wisdom and is widely considered to be one of the most insightful beings in Druskenvald. Despite her station, she spends much of her nights teaching the youth how to better commune with the spirits and discover which Spirit Beast they should choose to favor—a profound rite of passage for every member of Zulrogg society.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s6\">Tazri has lived for many centuries, extending her life with Everbloom concoctions until she can find a suitable replacement to become the next speaker of the Hydra Spirit. However, when one looks upon her, it is difficult to determine her age, appearing youthful one moment and truly ancient the next. This is made more mystifying by her eccentric passion for collecting. She knows that the swamp never gives without purpose, so she takes any trinket or debris she finds and adds it to the stitched sack that holds her collection. It is said that these odds and ends become the most powerful reagents in her rituals.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Gizzard</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In the twisted boughs of the deepest and most overgrown mire of Zulrogg is the thorn-tangled roost of Sister Gizzard. This fleshy, wrinkled witch with feathered, avian features resembles a bloated vulture and fittingly has a voracious appetite to consume raw, rotting flesh, especially that of sapient mortal species. She loves nothing in the world but her “children,” the countless grotesque carrion birds that she commands in huge flocks through the skies of Druskenvald. They serve as eyes and ears for the Coven of the Midnight Moon and can devour the flesh off of a victim’s bones in seconds.</p><p class=\"p4\">Her witchcraft specializes in rot, decay, and disease, and it perfectly prepares any creature for consumption—including supernatural beings, spirits, or gods. It’s this ability that makes Gizzard feared by all her sisters and even her mother, since she fully absorbs and claims the power of whatever entity she eats. In Zulrogg, her hungry eyes are set on the mightiest Spirit Beasts, and she hopes to eventually make a meal out of each of them to take the full primal power of the province for herself.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Gurash’Atal</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">While many settlements are nestled throughout the swamps, jungles, and waterways of the province, the largest of the stilted cities is Gurash’Atal <em>(gur‑OSH uh‑TALL)</em>. Built atop the murky water and throughout the mossy trees, the wooden streets and structures are connected by an elaborate network of walkways and rope bridges that are intimidating to visitors but easily navigated by locals. Long-necked reptilian swamp beasts ferry travelers to different parts of the city, and great saber-toothed felines serve as mounts that can easily climb up and down the city’s various levels and leap between treetop platforms.</p><p class=\"p4\">Throughout Gurash’Atal, shrines are dedicated to the numerous Spirit Beasts, where offerings can be made to earn their favor and even receive mystical blessings. Swampstalker Lodge draws visitors from across Druskenvald to see the greatest trophies of Zulrogg’s long line of legendary hunters and learn tracking, hunting, and trapping from the masters. The bustling trading post run by the enigmatic Trader Senj has everything one needs for an expedition into the wilds.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Zulrogg_Sister%20Gizzard%20Batik.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sunken Temple of Rakan’Zahl</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Built millennia ago by a lost civilization, the ancient stone temple of Rakan’Zahl <em>(ruh‑KAHN ZAHL)</em> slowly sank into the swamp until it was completely swallowed by its stagnant waters. However, the chambers within have not flooded, and those who find the temple’s hidden entrance can discover a labyrinthian network of hallways, ritual rooms, and grottos overtaken by the flora and fauna of the bog.</p><p class=\"p4\">This place of ancient mystical power has also drawn the attention of a cult that worships the malevolent Bloodbat Spirit. They practice their malign rites in the damp stone chambers and seek to use the temple’s secret knowledge to help their patron become a god that rules all Spirit Beasts. They work toward a monumental ritual that would drain the blood and life essence of every person in the province to initiate and fuel this ascension to godhood.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Zulrogg</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Venture into the depths of Zulrogg’s overgrown swamps, where spirits call and ancient dangers await those brave enough to test the swamp’s primal powers.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.uAo2gq4fS1FDgFIl]{Zulrogg Quest Hooks}</strong></p></div>"

With not a single right angle in its bizarre construction, the abandoned manor is an uncanny monument to the Crooked Queen. Her minions infest the place, and the wicked weasel hag, Vessla Browntooth, is its primary corruptor. She twists the souls of the living and dead trapped within the crooked walls. Only with the death of this hag can the horrors of the Crooked House be put to an end.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>The Crooked House stands as a haunted manifestation of Kehlenn’s ancient power, twisted and alive with malevolent energy. It warps all who dwell within, unravelling and corrupting their very souls in preparation for sacrifice.</p><p>Victims’ shattered souls and suffering feed the house, which reconfigures itself after each cycle of torment, shaping anew for the next doomed inhabitants. With each renewal, the gruesome process repeats itself—an eternal vessel for the Crooked Queen’s insatiable hunger for sacrifice.</p><p>Steeped in the blood of its past, the Crooked House, now called Druskenvald Manor, readies its horrors for the unlucky pair that now call this place home. The Crooked Queen’s influence lingers, her vile energy feeding the house, and the tormented spirits within turn their gaze toward new prey.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>The Crooked House bends and contorts into its true twisted, ruined, and haunted form with the helpless Druskenvalds trapped inside. The Crooked Man, Vessla Browntooth, and the repulsive creatures within await new souls ripe for sacrifice. Characters drawn to the house by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p>Enter the Crooked House in search of Phillip and Adela Druskenvald after first meeting the Crooked Man.</p></li><li><p>Conduct a séance to commune with the spirit of Joseph Patrini, who can point the characters to the hag in the attic.</p></li><li><p>Investigate the house and face the spirits within to collect all six mementos from the ghosts of the slain Lockwood Household.</p></li><li><p>Find the secret door to the attic and use the mementos to gain access to the Cauldron Room (area H17).</p></li><li><p>Destroy the weasel hag Vessla Browntooth.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the history of the Crooked House and the tragedy that befell the Lockwoods to help improvise the spectral encounters, including the séance with Joseph Patrini.

Eustace Lockwood believed he was bringing his family to a peaceful valley, free from the city’s toils, where nature would cradle them.</p><p>Their new manor, perched ominously atop a hill, loomed over a quaint village. Rebuilt by local hands upon the bones of its predecessor, it was grand yet unsettling. The builders didn’t question the hidden attic that appeared in the altered architectural plans—an attic soon claimed by Vessla Browntooth, her evil familiar, Filthy Jasper, and her swarm of twisted weasels.</p><p>The house was built atop the ruins of an ancient locus of Kehlenn’s primeval power, making it the ideal dwelling to corrupt and trap souls, all of which would feed the power of the Crooked Queen. And such an elaborate and crooked construction provided the hag with ample opportunity to torment the numerous inhabitants over the years.</p><p>For a short time, the Lockwoods flourished. Eustace, his wife Petunia, children Sally and Arthur, and Petunia’s elderly mother Keziah enjoyed the manor’s deceptive warmth. Their servants, the Patrinis, shared in their bliss, as did their son Francis, Sally’s best friend of the same age.</p><p>But the joy was fleeting. Illness and nightmares crept in—the work of Vessla’s vile enchantments. No medicine, not even the most skilled healers of Wickermoor Village, could combat the mounting corruption. Eustace, plagued by nightmarish visions, succumbed to madness, slaughtering his family and the Patrinis. The body of Francis was never found.</p><p>Families came and went, all drawn to the village’s quiet charm. Yet, the tale always ended in tragedy. Eventually, the cursed manor was seemingly abandoned, falling to the village when no one dared return. Yet, no matter whether the manor was occupied or not, the circular window at the highest point of the house always shone with an eerie glow during the Witching Hour.</p><p>Mayor Wendel Somerton, blind to the horrors, gifted the estate to the Druskenvalds, a move suggested by Randall Graham, the town’s scheming barber and doctor. Graham, knowing the house’s sinister nature and eager to see the Druskenvalds consumed, sought to unleash the house's malice on the new residents.</p></div>"

After the bloodbath, Eustace hanged himself, urged on by Vessla Browntooth. She crammed his broken corpse into a narrow crawlspace beneath the house, snapping nearly every bone to make him fit.</p><p>From that cursed night onward, his soul was bound to the Crooked Queen’s will, his spirit as distorted as his crumpled remains. Eustace now stalks the manor as a crooked specter in a tattered suit, twisted beyond recognition. Even when not with the house, his bond to it and the queen remains unbroken. With each soul claimed by the house, the queen's power deepens in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>The Crooked Man’s aim is to free the Crooked Queen from her prison and restore her reign over Druskenvald. As her loyal minion, he roams Wickermoor Hollow like a shadow, aiding the schemes of the Vermintoll Coven and the cult of the Old Ways, drawing ever closer to unleashing the queen's malice.</p><h2>The Lockwood Household</h2><p>After Eustace Lockwood’s bloody rampage, the spirits of his murdered household became trapped in the Crooked House, where they remain to this day. While the house has claimed many souls over the years, the ghosts of the Lockwood Household’s six victims manifest more strongly than the others.</p><h3><strong>Petunia Lockwood</strong></h3><p>The dour but dutiful wife of Eustace Lockwood, Petunia, had been looking forward to moving to a more agrarian community. Her true love was in tending all manner of plants, especially her beloved bergamot trees. She viewed the Lockwood Estate as her chance to finally enjoy her husband’s wealth—which was the only reason she married him.</p><h3><strong>Sally Lockwood</strong></h3><p>Sally was Eustace and Petunia’s first child, but she never received much attention from her parents. Suffering from regular nightmares, Sally developed phobias and paranoias at a young age. The only time she felt safe was when she was surrounded by her dolls and other toys.</p><p>On the night of the murders, Sally managed to escape the Crooked House before succumbing to her wounds on the path down the hill. Her spirit eventually reincarnated into the dog now called Shuck (see “Shuck” below).</p><h3><strong>Arthur Lockwood</strong></h3><p>Arthur was born in Cyril but spent most of his short life in Wickermoor Village. He was a sickly baby, but no doctors that the Lockwoods hired could discover an underlying illness. His regular wailing led to him being left in the nursery for most hours of the night.</p><h3><strong>Keziah Endicott</strong></h3><p>Keziah, Petunia’s elderly mother, was widowed at a young age, and she moved in with the Lockwoods. Coming from a wealthy and eccentric family, she developed many hobbies over her long life—landscape painting, taxidermy, and raising albino peafowl. Her active social life intrigued many strange folk from the town with a strong reverence for the Old Ways.</p><h3><strong>Joseph Patrini</strong></h3><p>Joseph came from a long line of butlers and took the profession very seriously, so he unquestioningly followed his employers to Wickermoor Village. He brought his wife, son, and love of music. While the Lockwoods abandoned Pholsense’s faith of the Silver Path (see chapter 1), Joseph never wavered and believed the divine would protect him in his strange new home.</p><h3><strong>Gail Patrini</strong></h3><p>Gail found less joy in being a housekeeper than her husband, but she relished being a mother. She never trusted her employers and found Keziah’s strange hobbies especially unsettling. Her intuition allowed her to save her son on the night of her death, sacrificing herself so that Francis survived.</p><h3><strong>Francis Patrini</strong></h3><p>Francis, a clever and funny child, was the precocious son of Joseph and Gail Patrini. He was best friends with Sally Lockwood and would unsuccessfully try to get the girl to go on small adventures with him despite her inherent fears.</p><p>He was saved from the murderous Eustace Lockwood by his mother but was deeply traumatized by the experience. He became unable to speak coherently, and the memories of his former life became fragmented, eventually becoming known to all in Wickermoor Village as Old Rusty (see chapter 11).</p><h2>The Jenkin Family</h2><p>The Jenkin family serves as caretakers for the Druskenvalds during their stay, having long tended the homes of Wickermoor’s elite. Three years ago, Mayor Somerton assigned them to the old Lockwood Estate, an honor laced with dread. Like the villagers, they had heard the whispered tales of the cursed house. Nevertheless, they moved in, preparing for the Druskenvalds.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin-right:10px;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Walter_Jenkin.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><h3><strong>Walter Jenkin</strong></h3><p>A handsome and affable sort, Walter Jenkin (lawful neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</strong>), lost his voice within weeks of arriving. No healer could explain the sudden silence. Now, he communicates through writing and sign language, which his family also knows and can translate. Entering the manor makes him nervous, sensing its malice, though he never speaks of his fears.</p><p>Known for his loyalty and dutifulness, Walter has an almost reverent respect for Mayor Wendel Somerton and his other former employers. And in this new position, he has already become devoted to the Druskenvalds, despite having only just met them.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin-left:10px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Gilly_Jenkin.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><h3><strong>Gilly Jenkin</strong></h3><p>Gilly Jenkin (lawful neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</strong>) has known Walter since they were children, and they have loved each other just as long. She is not as devoted to the Druskenvalds as her husband; her concerns lie more with their daughter. She was pregnant with Dani when they first became employed by Mayor Somerton over a decade ago, and she is overly protective of the girl. Gilly feels the presence of the strange forces in Wickermoor Village, and she fears her daughter Dani has some sort of strong connection to these powers.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin-right:10px;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Dani_Jenkin.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><h3><strong>Dani Jenkin</strong></h3><p>Dani (neutral, human noncombatant <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</strong>) was born to Walter and Gilly within a couple of weeks of their move to the mayoral manor to serve Mayor Somerton’s family. Now ten years old, she senses the ghosts and disturbing forces around her, knowing things a child shouldn’t. Though she cannot yet control her abilities, her bond with the powers of the Old Ways grows.</p><h3><strong>Shuck</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin-left:10px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKHOUS_Shuck%20and%20Wisp_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" /><p>A red-furred dog that never leaves Dani’s side, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.6a5bpuH4pUCYDwVf]{Shuck}</strong> (neutral good <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.yawTeS8u2FCfzzZH]{Wolf}</strong>) was a stray before the Jenkins took him in. Unbeknownst to the family, Shuck is the reincarnated soul of Sally Lockwood, a victim of the Crooked House who escaped just before her death. Shuck guards Dani fiercely. If any of the characters are evil, or if they use supernatural abilities that are in any way associated with the Crooked Queen, Shuck growls at them if they get anywhere near Dani.</p><h3><strong>Wisp</strong></h3><p>The estate’s gray cat has earned Walter’s affection but terrifies Dani. The cat is no ordinary feline; it is a shapeshifted <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.GQOjAbBUZg4KIHnf]{Ketgrinn}</strong>*, a Fey in service to Vessla Browntooth. Wisp stole Walter’s voice and torments Dani by speaking to her when they are alone. Shuck loathes Wisp, sensing his true nature, and stays close to protect Dani from the lurking evil. If the ketgrinn’s true form is exposed and slain, Walter’s ability to speak is restored.</p></div>"

Randall Graham, the barber-surgeon, approaches the characters and tells them he has seen the creatures stealing pulled teeth from his shop and scurrying up the hill to the Crooked House.

Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>An old man with wild red-gray hair and filthy clothes scrambles toward you.

They laugh. Every step leads to his return. Its return. Her return. Disintegration. Annihilation.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The characters can try to calm Old Rusty, but even if he’s made calm, he has nothing coherent to offer the characters. Rusty, whose true identity is Francis Patrini, was just a child when the Crooked House took his family away 70 years ago, and the traumatic experience left him forever changed.</p><h3><strong>Learning More</strong></h3><p>If the characters attempt to learn more about the Crooked House and its history, either now or at some other point when they're in Wickermoor Village, they don't get far. Most of the superstitious locals are so terrified of bringing evil upon themselves that they will not even speak of it out loud.</p><p>Even the Newcomers, who pride themselves on reason, dismiss talk of cursed houses as mere fairy tales, unwilling to believe in the supernatural so close to home.</p><p>They claim that while some of the families there have had bad luck, those same families may merely have been treating the place as a temporary vacation home before moving away. They genuinely believe—or hope—that the Crooked House is just a house, no matter how spooky its name and reputation are.</p><p>The most sinister members of the Followers of the Old Ways (see chapters 8 and 11) know the true history and encourage the notion that the house is perfectly safe.

Three people emerge from the nearest barn and wave in your direction.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>These people are the Jenkin family: Walter, Gilly, and Dani. At Dani’s side is a red-furred dog called Shuck.</p><h3><strong>The Conversation with the Jenkins</strong></h3><p>The Jenkin family approaches the characters to greet them, knowing that the Druskenvalds invited the characters to dinner. Use the details below to guide the conversation. Remember that Walter Jenkin can’t speak, but he uses hand signs to communicate with his wife and daughter, who can translate. When his family is not with him, he communicates by writing in a small, worn notebook he keeps in his pocket.</p><ul><li><p>The Jenkins are on their way to town to buy some necessities and a book for Dani—a rare outing, as they grow food on the estate.</p></li><li><p>The family has met the Druskenvalds, who just moved in last evening, but Phillip and Adela haven’t been seen yet tonight.</p></li><li><p>They were surprised at the arrival of the Druskenvalds—they weren’t sure if Phillip and Adela would ever visit—but are pleased to finally meet them.</p></li><li><p>The Jenkins have a positive outlook on the people of Wickermoor Village, especially Mayor Somerton.</p></li></ul><p>When the conversation ends, the Jenkins wish the characters a pleasant visit with the Druskenvalds, and they pass through the gate and head down the hill toward Wickermoor Village.</p><p>Immediately after they part, the gray cat Wisp strolls placidly out of the bushes, stares for a second at each of the characters individually, lets out a long and sneering “Mrrrreoww...,” and then walks away.</p></div>"

Clad in a tattered suit and a bent-top hat that covers his eyes, he smiles with an impossibly large grin filled with crooked, yellow teeth.</p><h3><strong>A Crooked Chat</strong></h3><p>If the characters strike up a conversation with the Crooked Man, be careful not to give away too much about the plot of the adventure too soon.

You will return from whence you came in blood and fire.”</p></li><li><p>“Go on in and enjoy the refreshments I’ve prepared for you. Phillip and Adela will be with you shortly.”</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Farewell for Now…</strong></h3><p>If the characters attempt to attack the Crooked Man in any way, he invokes the power of the Crooked House and simply disappears. Otherwise, after the Crooked Man has said everything he has to say, he doffs his hat toward the characters, gives a mocking bow, and vanishes. As if on command, a cacophonous boom of thunder shakes the house, and a violent storm rolls in.

All that’s left to be done is disintegration. All that remains is annihilation.”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>- Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen -</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The Wytchwood bows to the Crooked Queen. At its heart stands a Crooked Tree, a barren oak that thirsts for revenge. The deposed queen need only wait a little longer. Her patience wears thin, and her old wounds still fester. It is in this dark wood that desperate bargains and sacrifices will be made, and only fate can tell the true cost.</p><p>Now, Phillip Druskenvald, once the most powerful being in all the land, moves toward his sealed fate and certain doom. The final reckoning of Druskenvald is at hand, and the land itself holds its breath.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>The end is coming to Druskenvald. With the sacrifices of the Fallen and the Lord of Fools, the Horned King is primed for his hellish birth, his influence now spreading beyond the tree line of the Wytchwood. At the gnarled forest’s heart, the Crooked Queen calls Phillip Druskenvald to her barrow so she may exact her vengeance and bring about the annihilation she has craved for millennia.</p><p>The blazing ritual and massacre atop Rowan’s Rise have caused great turmoil within Wickermoor Village. With so many lost, townsfolk are looking for salvation. This is especially true of Phillip Druskenvald, who lost the love of his life to the burning Wicker Man and is now desperate to return her to life. He does not yet know that Adela’s soul is bound to Kehlenn as the final sacrifice needed for her escape from her tomb and prison.</p><p>In his grief, Phillip has sequestered himself away in the Green Queen Inn. Now out of options, he desperately hopes to use the primeval magic of the Old Ways to bring his beloved back to him. This is doomed to fail, and the lord of the land will be utterly powerless. In his lowest moment, Phillip will finally hear Kehlenn’s call and will answer.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>The time for the final confrontation with Kehlenn has come. Her vengeful designs have all worked toward this moment to ensnare Phillip within the Crooked Tree and transform him into the Horned King. Unless the characters stop the ritual, her consort will ascend to godhood, the Crooked Queen will be free, and all of Druskenvald will be annihilated and experience a horrid, crooked rebirth. Characters who enter the Wytchwood following the Quest Hooks later in the chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p>Search the forest for Phillip Druskenvald.</p></li><li><p>Defeat the Horned King, and prevent the Crooked Queen from returning.</p></li><li><p>Perform a sacrificial ritual to sever Kehlenn’s bonds with Druskenvald forever.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, consider the wants, goals, and connections of the characters to present them with the most alluring offers from the Horned King. Reviewing the final battle, “Born King,” will help create a climactic and terrifying final encounter. Finally, refreshing yourself on the details of the setting and history of Druskenvald, as well as the key NPCs of the adventure, particularly Kehlenn and Phillip Druskenvald (see chapters 1 and 8), will ensure a satisfying and cathartic finale for <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 13th level characters.</p></div>"

How he found her and where he received the power to depose her, she never learned, but it was not long before she was reduced to a pile of bones in a barrow and a weakened fey spirit bound to a single tree.</p><p>As Phillip remade the domain in his image, Kehlenn remained. As Phillip forgot the violent conflict that usurped her, Kehlenn remembered. And with each passing year, her slow recovery from the crushing defeat brought greater awareness of the hubris of the man who named her domain after himself.</p><p>She powerlessly witnessed the vile desecration of her once-green world with the introduction of sapient life using her stolen power. The resulting hatred consumed her entire being, and over the millennia, she was twisted into the Crooked Queen, a moniker she now bears with spiteful pride.</p><p>The moment she has waited eons for has finally arrived. The sacrifices required to bring an end to Phillip Druskenvald and reclaim the power he stole from her have come to fruition, one after the other, just as she had planned for so long. All that remains is for Phillip to kneel, and she will remake him just like he remade her precious domain.</p><h3><strong>All Will Be Crooked</strong></h3><p>Kehlenn’s freedom is nothing short of apocalyptic. She seeks not only to reclaim Druskenvald but to reshape it in her twisted image. Her eons of solitude and imprisonment have spoiled her once-green nature and transformed her into vengeance incarnate.</p><p>While she once sought to restore the natural cycle of life, death, and rebirth, she now only seeks the total annihilation of Druskenvald. Her ultimate goal is the corruption and disintegration of every sapient being, returning them to nature as she now defines it. She plans to rebirth them into crooked mockeries of what they once were—to live a terrifying, painful, and short life before perishing and being reborn to experience their horrible existence over and over again for eternity.</p><p>Now that the final stages of the Crooked Queen’s plan are in motion, there is no need for subterfuge, and Kehlenn has no interest in hiding her intentions. She will be honest with the characters, offering up her tale to persuade them to see her side of the story and turn them against Phillip in his final agonizing moments as a parting knife in the back.</p><h2>The Horned King</h2><p>The Horned King is Kehlenn’s cruel and powerful creation, made from sin itself. Through temptation and desire, he seeks to corrupt souls and bring about her vengeance. He is a monstrous shade of Phillip Druskenvald himself, woven from fragments of his very soul. This terrible entity intends to replace the lord of the land and sit at the right hand of his Crooked Queen.</p><p>The Horned King remains bound within the Wytchwood, his incorporeal form unable to cross its borders. Yet with the sacrifice of the Lord of Fools, his influence has begun to creep into the lands beyond. He bides his time, stalking the forest and whispering temptations throughout Wickermoor Hollow, slowly ensnaring its inhabitants.</p><p>The Horned King is subtle in his methods. His greatest pleasure lies in softly seducing the most disciplined and pious souls—those who believe themselves above vice—into giving in to their hidden desires. His whispers are a constant pressure, a slow unraveling of restraint. The more they resist, the deeper his influence burrows, until even the most virtuous souls find themselves standing before their own corruptive acts.</p><p>At the command of his Crooked Queen, the Horned King seeks to achieve physical form through the possession and metamorphosis of Phillip Druskenvald. After consuming Phillip’s soul and becoming corporeal, he plans to leave Wickermoor Hollow and siphon the energies of all of Druskenvald. If not stopped, he will use this immense power to finally free his queen from her prison to remake the domain in her crooked image.</p><h2>Phillip Druskenvald</h2><p>Phillip Druskenvald is a broken man at his lowest point. He is consumed by guilt, desperation, and the agonizing pain of loss following the death of Adela. Despite having fallen for Kehlenn’s trap and acting as the architect of his own downfall, he is still filled with the misguided belief that he can somehow control or undo what he has set in motion.</p><p>This mindset is what has led him to seek the power of the Old Ways. His forward-thinking obsession with progress and the future has brought him nothing but destruction, so his last hope lies with the primeval powers that existed before he brought civilization to the domain. However, his attempts to harness this power to resurrect Adela in the Green Queen Inn have failed, shattering him further.</p><p>This humbled husk of a man is whom Kehlenn calls out to once the ritual fails, her whispers laced with the promises to return Adela’s soul and her life. With no further options before him, Phillip set off into the Wytchwood to seek the Crooked Queen in the desperate hope he can finally make things right. Like a sacrificial lamb, he is oblivious to his imminent slaughter and the ritualistic power his death will provide.</p></div>"

However, knowing that Phillip vanished after discovering Adela’s charred remains within the Wicker Man—hearing from villagers that he has locked himself away within the Green Queen Inn—may prompt them to seek him out.</p><h2>The Last Hope</h2><p>Wickermoor Village has been thrown into chaos in the aftermath of the massacre on the moors. The revelation that many townsfolk were behind the dreadful events has left the village divided and in disarray. Unrest simmers and power structures unravel. Some cling to old superstitions, while others look for new leadership, each with their own interpretation of what has happened and what must be done to make things right.</p><p>If Mayor Somerton survived the events on Rowan’s Rise and did not fall in league with the nefarious cultists of the Old Ways, the panicked townsfolk blame him for everything that has happened and swiftly turn on him, imprisoning or even killing him. If Constable Doris Squire still lives, she is powerless to bring order to the chaos, disheartened by the evident betrayal of Deputy Howie Butterman.</p><p>The characters may find themselves drawn into this turmoil, as various people vie for their favor or assistance. But nothing is more pressing than discovering the fate of Phillip Druskenvald. Some want him captured and punished for bringing suffering and death to Wickermoor Hollow. Others want him rescued, viewing him as the only possible authority figure that can prevent Wickermoor Village from falling to anarchy. Both sides implore the characters to investigate.</p><p>After a brief inquiry, some townsfolk claim to have seen Phillip Druskenvald stumbling into the Green Queen Inn—his face pale and his eyes haunted.</p><h2>Chaos Reigns</h2><p>If the characters choose to delay or ignore the rising threat of the Crooked Queen, time becomes their greatest enemy. The longer they wait, the stronger the Horned King’s influence grows. One by one, villagers begin to fall to their vices. Pure bedlam and pandemonium are but a few short nights away as even the most disciplined, chastened, and restrained people give in to their basest desires.</p><p>The townsfolk that the characters confront discover the evil impulses that had once lain dormant in the corrupted villagers’ hearts. They also learn that the common thread among them was that all of them heard the seductive whispers of a three-eyed beast that stalks the dark woods. Those who confess and admit their transgressions, deeply shamed, plead with the characters to discover what is happening and put an end to it.</p></div>"

The endeavor failed and opened the door to Phillip’s mind, welcoming Kehlenn in.

There have been few visitors that have dared to walk among the primeval trees since the forgotten times when the forest was young. Only a small collection of trophies buried beneath the Crooked Tree serve as evidence of those doomed souls’ existence. For the unwary, the Wytchwood is a place of endless misdirection and a tomb for all those who become lost within.</p><h2>Features of the Wytchwood</h2><p>There are no clear paths in this untouched wilderness—only beasts tread here. Unless otherwise stated, the Wytchwood has the following features:</p><p><strong>Canopy.</strong> The forest’s canopy is 60 feet above the ground.</p><p><strong>Fitful Rest.</strong> Creatures that finish a long rest take [[/damage 3d6 psychic]]{10 (3d6)} psychic damage after regaining hit points for the rest. They also find their belongings moved about and arranged on the ground in strange patterns, with no evidence of how or when it happened.</p><p><strong>Lighting.</strong> The light of the Crooked Moon passes through the sparse tree cover and sends shadows dancing about the forest floor. The entire forest is lightly obscured.</p><p><strong>A Quiet Place.</strong> Dense needles on low-hanging branches dampen sounds that fail to echo through the wood. Sounds can’t be heard beyond 120 feet from their source, even if shouted or magically produced (such as with the <em>Knock</em> spell).</p><h2>Entering the Wytchwood Early</h2><p>If the characters want to explore the Wytchwood before the events of this chapter, Kehlenn wraps the wood in an impenetrable glamour. Until Phillip Druskenvald heeds the Crooked Queen’s call in the wake of the Wicker Man’s burning, the Wytchwood has the following features:</p><p><strong>Twisting Paths.</strong> No matter how long a visitor explores or what methods they employ to find or mark their way, travelers in the wood find themselves trekking back toward the edge of the forest where they entered.</p><p><strong>Hunted.</strong> Travelers in the Wytchwood are at the mercy of Kehlenn’s creatures. Every night that characters explore the wood during the Witching Hour, roll [[/r 1d12]]. On a roll of 2 or higher, a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.zCFEcKc4a46mHGjB]{Hypnovulfen}</strong>* attacks the characters before the hour is up.</p><h2>Into The Dark Woods</h2><p>The Wytchwood is a two-night trek from Wickermoor Village across the moors to the north. In his grief-stricken journey, Phillip has left an unmasked trail, not caring who might follow. The characters venture into the forest with one goal: to find the Crooked Tree, where Phillip has gone to confront the Crooked Queen.</p><p>When the characters enter the Wytchwood, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The moment you step into the wood, darkness and quiet surround you. The pine and fir trees before you bend subtly at odd angles in an endless expanse that feels truly ancient.</strong></em></p></blockquote><h2>Tracking Phillip</h2><p>The characters can follow the messy trail left by Phillip with relative ease. Upon first entering the Wytchwood and after each encounter until the characters arrive at the Crooked Tree, a character can make a [[/check SUR DC 13]] check to find muddy footprints, crushed pine needles, and snapped branches, which lead to the next encounter after an hour of travel. A character has advantage on this check after an encounter if any of the characters successfully found Phillip’s Clue (see “Wytchwood Encounters” later in this chapter). Characters will always experience the encounters in order, and they always are at least one hour of travel through the wood apart.</p><p>If the check fails, the characters lose the trail and wander for one hour until they are attacked by monstrous denizens of the forest. Roll on the Hungry Woods table to determine what creatures attack.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.PS4TYAewIXVGPtck]{Hungry Woods}</strong></em></p><p>After the characters defeat the attacking creatures, they may repeat the check to continue tracking Phillip. On a success, they proceed to the next encounter after an hour of travel. On a failure, they wander for another hour and are attacked by the monsters of the Wytchwood once more.</p><h2>On Cloven Hoof</h2><p>The Horned King stalks the Wytchwood, an incorporeal spirit unable to take physical form until his unholy union with Phillip Druskenvald. His arrival is signaled by the snapping of branches under an enormous bulk, the rumbling of earth from heavy footfalls, and the hot, putrid breath of a huge panting beast.</p><p>His form is that of a massive black goat with three ruby-red eyes. While stalking the characters, he never fully reveals himself, always keeping just beyond sight. The characters might catch glimpses of a bloody eye, some shaggy black hair, or a jagged gray horn between the trees.</p><h3><strong>Within Temptation</strong></h3><p>While the characters are traveling between encounters (see “Wytchwood Encounters” later in this chapter), the Horned King will make his presence known and call out in a low, rumbling, and seductive voice. His goal is to pry into the characters’ hearts to determine what they truly desire, erode confidence in their mission, plant seeds of doubt in their allies, and elicit curiosity for what he can truly offer them. To properly persuade the characters, have the Horned King visit them two or more times before Encounter 4.</p><p>A character can gauge the intentions behind the Horned King’s words with a successful [[/check INS DC 18]] check. They sense that, while his words are carefully measured, he is earnest about learning their true desires and offering them what they want, but for a clearly ulterior purpose.</p><p>The Horned King never answers the characters’ questions outright and continues to steer the conversation to the things they crave most, especially vices. Those who demand gifts or bargains are denied until he makes his final offer (see “Live Deliciously” later in this chapter).</p><p><em><strong>Impotent Wrath.</strong></em> Any attempts to engage the Horned King in combat are futile, but he won’t vanish simply because of an attempted ranged attack or spell. Any character who attempts to initiate combat with the Horned King before the final confrontation (see “Born King” later in this chapter) must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 18]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[frightened apply=false] for one minute. While frightened in this way, the character must drop whatever they’re holding, use their action to Dash, and use their movement to run away from the Horned King after being filled with the dread of what lurks in the hearts of mortals.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:1em 0\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter24_On_Cloven_Hoof.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h3><strong>Conferring with the Horned King</strong></h3><p>The Horned King thrives on sin and desire, with the power to turn mortals toward corruption (see “The Horned King” earlier in this chapter). He initiates conversations with questions that play into the characters’ wants, fears, and struggles in hopes to tempt them. Some example responses include:</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/MAP_35_Crooked%20Tree%20Flowchart.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><ul><li><p>“Why do you carry such a heavy burden alone? There are easier paths.”</p></li><li><p>“Do you wish to suffer forever? The pain can end with a spoken word.”</p></li><li><p>“Do you truly believe you have all the answers? There are many secrets yet to discover.”</p></li><li><p>“Why do you rush toward your fate? There is peace in letting time pass you by.”</p></li><li><p>“Why do you struggle against the inevitable? Lay down your weary head and rest.”</p></li><li><p>“Would you like to live deliciously? Life need not be filled with tragedy and loss.”</p></li></ul><p>If asked questions by the characters, his answers are cryptic and always drive toward temptation. Use the following to guide responses if the characters speak with the Horned King:</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong> I am he who stalks the deepest woods and darkest hearts. I am in the heart of every mortal. I am the very thing you desire most. I am the Horned King, consort of she who watches from the Crooked Tree.</p><p><strong>What do you want from us?</strong> I ask for nothing besides friendship and loyalty. And in exchange, I offer you the means to live deliciously. You come to my woods burdened, and I offer to alleviate that which weighs down your soul.</p><p><strong>Why should we trust you?</strong> Trust? You need not trust me to see the truth in my words. You need only walk the path I tender.</p><p><strong>What do you know of the Crooked Queen?</strong> She is the first, and she shall be the last. There is nothing but the forest. There is nothing but my queen.</p><p><strong>What of Phillip?</strong> He is an honored guest in these woods and has been given safe passage.</p><p><strong>What happens if we refuse you?</strong> It is your choice, but not one to be made lightly. Refuse, and nothing will protect you from what is to come. Accept, and you may find comfort and succor.</p><h2 style=\"clear:both\">Wytchwood Encounters</h2><p>The Wytchwood is not just a physical space but also a manifestation of the Crooked Queen’s will.

This can be anything of great personal value to the character: a cherished item, a piece (or person) of their past, or even a part of themselves (reducing an ability score by 2, giving up a class feature, etc.). Whatever is offered is lost forever.</p><p><em><strong>Sacrifice.</strong></em> As an action, a character can touch the goat skull, offer a sacrifice, and roll [[/r 1d20]]. On a 10 or higher, the sacrifice is accepted. However, Kehlenn in her Crooked Tree rages against her potential banishment. On a 9 or lower, Kehlenn receives a number of Ritual Points equal to the amount the roll failed by (10 minus the total rolled). Kehlenn can use these points to reduce future rolls before a character rolls the d20 for their sacrifice, potentially turning success into failure. On a failure, a character can try again on subsequent turns with a new sacrifice.</p><p><em><strong>Last Act.</strong></em> A character whose sacrifice isn’t accepted can choose to give their all to assure the queen’s demise—the character can sacrifice their own life. A character who takes this option dies and can’t be restored to life. The sacrifice is accepted, and the Crooked Queen is powerless to stop it.</p><p><em><strong>Resolution.</strong></em> If the characters fail in making their sacrifices 6 times, or if any of the characters ignore the pleading of Phillip’s spirit and don’t offer a sacrifice, the ritual completes in the Crooked Queen’s favor, and the Horned King reforms (see “Crooked Defeat” earlier in this chapter). If each character’s sacrifice is accepted before that, the ritual collapses, and Kehlenn is untethered from Druskenvald and bound forever within the Crooked Moon.</p><h2>Underneath the Crooked Moon</h2><p>When the final sacrifice is accepted, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>As the final sacrifice is accepted by the goat skull, its empty eye sockets fill with a glowing orange light that spreads along the cracks in the bone, up its horns, and to the wooden moon through the twine that holds it aloft.

It is recommended to select an order for the characters receiving their narrative Climax that allows for time to breathe in between each one so that every character gets their appropriate spotlight.</p><p>Some moments are a natural fit for happening immediately after the burning of the Crooked Tree, while others fit better later as the characters “catch their breath” physically, emotionally, and spiritually after their harrowing experience. These Climaxes should all be initiated while the characters are still within the Wytchwood, but not all of them must be at Kehlenn’s barrow, so you can initiate these impactful moments at various points throughout the trek out of the woods. For characters who wish to use teleportation magic to immediately leave the Wytchwood, you may determine that these spells fail despite the banishment of the Crooked Queen, caused by the surging energies called forth by the final sacrifice to burn the Crooked Tree.</p><p>Finally, while the immediate effects of the respective Climaxes and the resulting Catharses may be fitting to happen immediately following each Climax, you are encouraged to allow some time to pass for the characters to fully process each of the climactic moments of their narrative journeys. The Catharsis of each character’s Thread of Fate can be fully implemented during the conclusion of the campaign as presented in the Epilogue (see chapter 25).</p></aside></div>"

This trip through the mists of death leaves them stranded in the mysterious valley of Wickermoor Hollow, where isolated peoples are terrorized by restless dead, wicked hags, ravenous monsters, and many other creatures of the night that never ends.</p><p class=\"p3\">From the very beginning, the characters’ fates are intertwined with that of Phillip Druskenvald, the lord of the land that he shaped and named after himself, as well as his clairvoyant wife, Adela. Despite their power, these well-meaning but naïve nobles are doomed to perish in the story’s climax from the machinations of a twisted fey goddess known as the Crooked Queen.</p><p class=\"p3\">This primeval entity named Kehlenn is served by countless minions, including a secret cult of human worshippers, a coven of verminous crones, and a malevolent spirit called the Crooked Man—all of whom do her bidding throughout the valley to free her from her ancient prison deep within the dark wood.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/large-Holly_Bunyip.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p3\">The means of this eventual return lies with a fledgling god born from sin itself. Known only as the Horned King, this fiendish black goat seeks to incarnate and be made flesh so he may free his Crooked Queen and sit at her right hand, annihilating the people of Druskenvald and disintegrating the land ahead of the domain’s twisted rebirth.</p><p class=\"p3\">The whispers and promises of this lord of sin are alluring and have brought about the fall of six formerly heroic wayward souls who now terrorize all corners of Wickermoor Hollow. Known to the followers of the Crooked Queen as the Fallen, these six villains serve as sacrifices to be made and the seals to be broken to unleash the full power of the Horned King.</p><p class=\"p3\">It is this complex web of evil with which the characters must contend if they hope to survive their time in the valley and save the lives of Druskenvald’s inhabitants. While victory is possible, the cost will be tremendous, and many souls cannot be saved no matter what the would-be heroes do.</p><p class=\"p3\">And yet, while there is only a ghost of a chance that salvation can be achieved, it is a hope all the same.

His dapper appearance and affable personality belie the immense power he holds. While he appears to be a tall, thin man with perfectly slicked back hair and a pencil-thin mustache as black as night, the truth is that he is a timeless lord of death with his origins lost deep within the Shroud itself . . . even to him.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Despite ruling in Druskenvald for many years, he was not always the realm’s master. Formerly, it had belonged to the fey goddess Kehlenn, who utilized the reincarnation magics of the domain to rebirth souls as flora and fauna in a natural world where life was brutal and short.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">Phillip is another kind of deathless being who arrived from beyond the mist eons ago. He usurped the realm of rebirth, claiming its reincarnating powers for his own. He then reshaped the land into his own design, even renaming it after himself. In this new afterlife, Phillip provided souls the opportunity to be reborn as sapient mortal beings to enjoy a second chance at a “normal” life.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">After the slow passage of millennia, Phillip forgot about his battle with Kehlenn or that there was ever a world before the one he forged himself. He now oversees the domain with his Crescent Court, composed of the thirteen lords and ladies of Druskenvald (see chapter 1). However, he finds governance tedious and prefers to enjoy the good life he brought to the afterlife, with all the messy and sinful comforts and indulgences that come with it.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">While he maintains a general grasp of the current affairs of the thirteen major provinces of Druskenvald, Phillip is mostly ignorant of the happenings in Wickermoor Hollow, heightened by the crooked power of Kehlenn that shrouds it from his view. Even worse, while in the valley, Phillip has none of the supernatural powers that make him the most formidable being in the land.</p><p class=\"p3\">He does not know, and will only learn too late, that in Wickermoor Hollow, Kehlenn has seized his power and weaves it toward her own aims in the creation of a newborn god of sin: the Horned King. While within the confines of the valley, Phillip is very nearly just a mortal man, which will lead to his inevitable destruction.</p><p class=\"p3\">Phillip’s newfound impotence frustrates him, but he still decides to remain in the valley after being stranded there with the characters. His curiosity is stronger than his sense of preservation, and he cannot fathom a scenario where he could be in any real danger. He sees the presence of the characters as an opportunity to get to the bottom of what’s happening in Wickermoor Hollow while also helping the citizens he’s neglected for so long.</p><h2><span class=\"s2\">Adela Druskenvald</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Adela_Druskenvald.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p2\">Adela Druskenvald is the loving partner-in-crime of her husband Phillip. She rules Druskenvald alongside him, and while she similarly has a distaste for politics and bureaucracy, she often serves as a voice of reason and a reminder of the responsibility to help the people across the thirteen provinces.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">While Phillip is an otherworldly entity from regions unknown, Adela was born a mortal woman and lived in the material world for the first three decades of her life. As a child, her paranormal experiences and prophetic visions led to her discovery of immense powers of divination and a strong connection to the spiritual world.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">As a young woman, Adela’s curiosity and dauntlessness brought her face-to-face with Phillip aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, and the two fell in love at first sight. They were quickly married, and as a Druskenvald, Adela became immortal, enjoying her endless youth by seeking every new and exciting experience she could find.</p><p class=\"p3\">While Adela has an exceptional gift of second sight, she doubts her own abilities, which often leads to her misinterpreting her visions. Despite this anxiety and her cheerful, almost ditzy demeanor, there is reason to believe that she is far more crafty, calculating, and deliberate than she lets on.</p><p class=\"p3\">Even with her gift of prophecy, she is powerless to stop her fate as a sacrificial lamb in the ritual to free the Crooked Queen. Throughout the adventure, her visions become increasingly grave but also more difficult to interpret.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen</span></h2><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Kehlenn_Finished.webp\" /><p class=\"p2\">Kehlenn is a primordial fey goddess who first created the plane of existence now known as Druskenvald. Before Phillip Druskenvald invaded her realm and made it his own, she was the Green Queen, who tended an afterlife of reincarnation into a realm of pure nature. Mortal souls would be reborn as plants and animals, and while the verdant world she ruled was natural, each life after rebirth was brutal and short.</p><p class=\"p3\">When Phillip Druskenvald arrived in her green realm and supplanted her, he was unaware that a being of such power could never be completely destroyed, especially within the confines of the dimension she created. In her defeat, Kehlenn managed to slink into the darkest wood she could find and crawl beneath the roots of a single tree. Her physical form withered in the barrow, and her essence compressed into the trunk, bough, and branch of the tree that grew from it.</p><p class=\"p3\">From this solitary spot, she slumbered in a near-deathlike stasis for eons, slowly reabsorbing the power of the land that surrounded her—a valley that would eventually come to be called Wickermoor Hollow. But what never slept was the hate she felt for Phillip Druskenvald and the mortal beings he brought with him to her once green domain. The bitterness and desire for vengeance twisted Kehlenn and the tree where she dwelled until all the Green withered and she took up the new title of the Crooked Queen.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Kehlenn has slowly been regaining strength century after century, eventually calling to minions that gathered around her like moths to a flame. The worship they paid her and the twisted rituals they conducted in her honor made her even stronger until all Wickermoor Hollow was her domain, despite still being entombed and imprisoned in the forest that had come to be called the Wytchwood.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">With her servants enacting her heinous machinations, she readies herself for freedom and the revenge she so desperately seeks against Phillip and the people he rules over. Now she plots toward the disintegration of all sapient beings into nature and the annihilation and crooked rebirth of the world she had been robbed of.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Horned King</span></h2><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Horned%20King_Finished.webp\" /><p class=\"p2\">Deep within the Wytchwood stalks a terrible beast that is the manifestation of sin itself. A fledging god of mortal desire that seeks to achieve incarnation to usher in the annihilation and crooked rebirth of Druskenvald, the Horned King is the fiendish servant of the Crooked Queen and her ultimate weapon in claiming vengeance against the man who usurped her.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Despite Kehlenn’s overall defeat, her eventual reawakening and growing power in Wickermoor Hollow has allowed her to achieve her greatest victory since she was cast down. Just as Phillip stole her domain in the forgotten past, she has claimed his inherent power within the confines of the valley, rending the usually-mighty lord of the land as little more than a mortal human.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">What she found in the powerful and even eldritch energies spawned from the heart of Phillip Druskenvald was sin. The darkness and desire that lurk within humanity and nearly all sentient mortal beings are what the new lord of the land brought to her once-beautiful, green kingdom. And with it was the desperate, fear-driven desire to not just survive, but to thrive and live deliciously in comfort and abundance.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Kehlenn held onto this newfound fragment of Phillip’s soul, siphoning it to slowly regain her strength and weave a fledgling god of sin, desire, and wickedness into existence to serve as her consort and right hand. Taking the form of an enormous black goat with three blood-red eyes, the Horned King exists as an incorporeal fiendish spirit bound to the haunted Wytchwood where the Crooked Queen remains entombed and imprisoned (see chapter 24).</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">However, his sinful power spreads through Wickermoor Hollow, offering the mortals of his queen’s realm the chance to live the life they’ve always wanted at the cost of pledging and sacrificing their very soul. With each new covetous and terrified mortal who falls to sin and signs their name in the book of the Horned King, Kehlenn’s plan comes closer to fruition. And soon, with the inevitable downfall of Phillip Druskenvald, the beast that stalks the deepest woods and darkest hearts will be made flesh and ascend as an instrument of the Crooked Queen’s vengeance.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Crooked Man</span></h2><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Crooked%20Man_Finished.webp\" /><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s4\">The essence of this ancient spirit has existed since the forgotten ages, a lingering remnant of the Crooked Queen's twisted power of rebirth. Despite this primeval origin, the Crooked Man has taken a myriad of forms over the millennia, always corrupting and killing a mortal host before being reborn with a new visage every century or so, favoring a brutalized human shape for as long as the species has dwelled in Wickermoor Hollow.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\">His current incarnation is the twisted shade of a man named Eustace Lockwood, who slaughtered his entire household in one bloody night after a slow descent into paranoia and malevolence through a malign witchcraft that plagued his dreams. His neck, torso, limbs, fingers, teeth, and even his top hat are bent at unnatural angles, truly living up to his name. While he can move about the whole valley, he primarily resides in the manor home built atop a remnant of Kehlenn’s power, aptly dubbed the Crooked House (see chapter 12).</span></p><p class=\"p3\">Serving as the mouthpiece and instrument of the Crooked Queen while she remains trapped within the Wytchwood, he has orchestrated many of the horrors that have befallen the residents of Wickermoor Hollow. He also serves as a guiding force of the malevolent Cult of the Crooked Queen that has infiltrated the Followers of the Old Ways within the valley, constantly working in secret to bring about Kehlenn's return.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Vermintoll Coven</span></h2><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Vermintol%20Coven_Finished.webp\" /><p class=\"p2\">The only minions of Kehlenn on par with the Crooked Man are the three vile hags that form the Vermintoll Coven. All three of the ancient crones are fey beings from the time before Phillip, now just as twisted and hateful as the queen they’ve served for eons. Each member of the coven obsessively favors a verminous creature and has taken on the physical traits of the foul animals they command.</p><p class=\"p3\">The ultimate purpose of the coven is to toll the death knell of the living beings fated for sacrifice and prepare their mind, body, and soul for the sacrificial rituals conducted in honor of the Crooked Queen. While these three sisters are united in their malign purpose, they truly despise each other, all seeking a place at Kehlenn’s left hand.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s4\">The youngest sister is Vessla Browntooth, the weasel hag, who corrupts the soul through wicked witchcraft and twisted dreams from the attic of the Crooked House (see chapter 12). The middle sister is Stonoga Blackstinger, the centipede hag, who corrupts the body through disease, venom, and loathsome fleshcrafting from the depths of Skitterdeep Mine (see chapter 16). The eldest sister is Golub Graygullet, the pigeon hag, who corrupts the mind through manipulation of information as the disguised postmaster of Wickermoor Village from her Roving Rookery (see chapter 20).</span></p><p class=\"p3\">This coven is a constant threat plaguing the people of Wickermoor Hollow and subtly assisting the Cult of the Crooked Queen from the shadows. And despite being unwittingly fated to die themselves, they are destined to serve Kehlenn even after their deaths at the hands of the characters, shattering reality and unleashing the ultimate nightmare upon the valley.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Fallen</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">The greatest victory of the Horned King after his birth from the sinful soul of Phillip Druskenvald was the fall of six powerful and wayward souls that found themselves in Druskenvald from the material world. Each of these beings had once been heroic in their own way, but all had deep flaws and demons both within and without.</p><p class=\"p3\">While these former heroes never once directly heard the seductive voice of the goat in the woods, the sin that dwelled in each of their hearts was plied by the Horned King until they brought about their own downfall one by one. With each turn to despair, hopelessness, and eventually wickedness, the Fallen, as they came to be known by the servants of the Crooked Queen, turned into the monsters they once fought against.</p><p class=\"p3\">The increasing evil perpetuated by the Fallen has added to the Horned King’s power as he seeks to spread sin from his prison within the Wytchwood. Now, each of the Fallen must die so that their wicked essence may be consumed and used as the catalyst for the black goat’s inevitable incarnation.</p><p class=\"p3\">However, none of the Fallen actively serve the forces of the Crooked Queen and purely seek to achieve their own aims. They have no alliances with each other or even the lord of sin, who is ultimately responsible for each of their falls. These villains intimidate and slaughter the people of Wickermoor Hollow on their own volition, each offering a unique threat and challenge for the characters to confront.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_FULLPAGE_6%20Fallen.webp\" /><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Raum, the Harvest Terror</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The friendly and helpful scarecrow tunesmith named Ol’ Jericho Sticks was once a beloved member of the agrarian community of Foxwillow, but his construction contained a ravenous demon of secrets within. Eventually, the whispers corrupted him into a fiendish crow-like fiend that terrorizes the people he used to cherish. Feasting on his victims’ flesh, souls, and secrets, Raum strikes from a demonic dimension of infinite cornstalks and replaces the bodies of his prey with grotesque pumpkin-headed effigies (see chapter 13).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Father Renathyr, the Crimson Abbot</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">Sir Marius Renathyr was once a gallant knight who served a god of morning and protected the innocent. However, he was tricked by a succubus duchess of hell into sacrificing everything he once stood for, transforming him into a bloodthirsty vampire. Now, Father Renathyr leads a rigid faith from the Crimson Monastery sworn to destroy wickedness at every turn, commanding legions of zealous followers to kidnap innocents so they may burn at the stake or be drained of blood to feed his undying hunger (see chapter 14).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">Once a pirate of fearsome renown, Captain Briggsy “The Kutlass” Kratch practiced hexing magic granted to him by a powerful death spirit he had bargained with. Driven by the desire for more wealth and power, he tricked and imprisoned his patron, harnessing the magic of jinxcraft for himself to become a master of misfortune. He now lurks in the swamps of the Drowned Crossroads, offering the truly desperate their hearts’ desire in a bargain that always ends in misery. After each deal turns bad, Mister Crossroads rips the spirits from his associates’ bodies and binds their shambling corpses to his will (see chapter 15).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Matron Lethica, the Weeping Widow</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">Lethica Nightborne was once a high priestess of a night goddess and committed to healing the sick and injured with blessings of the divine. However, following the painful loss of her husband, she turned to vile science fueled by the alien biology of a cosmic horror which she called forth into Druskenvald. Now, Matron Lethica oversees the gloomy sanatorium called Memory’s Rest, wiping the minds of her patients with an eldritch serum and performing grotesque experiments on their bodies (see chapter 17).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Gorthos, the Beast of Blight</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">A young antlered satyr named Farryn once devoted her life to tending a lush forest called the Greenwood until she became heartbroken following the death of her only love. In an attempt to bring this lover back, she followed the call of a dead god and transformed into a vile rotting husk of an abomination and blighted the entire woodland with her newfound power. Now, Gorthos lurks within Hartsblight Forest, spreading rot and decay with the help of a circle of twisted druids who revere and serve her (see chapter 18).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Yorgrim, the Chained Reaper</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The orc gravedigger known as Yorgrim is the last to fall. Once a shaman who inadvertently led to the death of his entire clan, he spent a lifetime performing a penance before dying himself. However, he found no rest in death and his spirit became bound to Maidenmist Cemetery, where he tends to the spirits of the dead and serves as a jailer of the ravening souls from the Shroud within. Now, he is doomed to become a harbinger of death called the Chained Reaper following the incessant corruption of the gibbering spirits he guards (see chapter<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>19).</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKMOON_Crooked%20Moon.webp\" /><h2><span class=\"s1\">A Prophecy of Sacrifice</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">In order to achieve the incarnation of the Horned King, the ascension of the Crooked Queen, and the disintegration of Druskenvald, a complex sacrificial ritual is under way the moment that the characters step onto the Ghostlight Express. The prophecy that has been whispered by the cult of the Old Ways and the servants of the Crooked Queen demands the slaughter of all six of the Fallen, a sacrificial fool called Chuckles, and both Phillip and Adela Druskenvald. And only Kehlenn herself knows that even the Vermintoll Coven and the Crooked Man must be destroyed for the ritual of her glorious rebirth to achieve its full power.</p><p class=\"p3\">Throughout the adventure, the characters will inadvertently advance the will of the Crooked Queen through their good deeds. Although they are viewed as pawns by Kehlenn, it’s through their actions that she might ultimately be defeated and sealed away within the Crooked Moon in the climax of the story.</p><p class=\"p3\">This means that all the NPCs mentioned above are doomed. If the characters survive to the end of the adventure, Phillip and Adela, the Fallen, the Vermintoll Coven, and even many innocent residents of Wickermoor Hollow will all be dead. The events that take place will save the lives of Druskenvald as a whole, but it will come at great cost, perhaps even requiring the sacrifice of the characters themselves (see chapter 24).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Redemption and Salvation?</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">In Folk Horror, there is scarce redemption for the wicked, and the protagonists rarely survive unless they pay a terrible cost. <em>The Crooked Moon</em> adventure is written with this in mind. The villains are meant to be destroyed, and the Druskenvalds are doomed to perish, as is required by the ritual to unleash the Crooked Queen.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">However, your players may sympathize with some of the villains and wish to spare them or find it unconscionable that major NPCs cannot be saved from a terrible fate. While the campaign is designed and written so that all of the Fallen, the Vermintoll Coven, and the Druskenvalds are dead by the end of the story, you may decide to allow the possibility to spare them.</p><p class=\"p3\">The simplest way to achieve this is to remove the prophecy and rituals that require the sacrifice of the major figures in the campaign. Kehlenn can simply draw more power as wicked deeds spread through Wickermoor Hollow, eventually allowing for her attempted ascension in the climax of the story.</p><p class=\"p3\">Alternatively, you can interpret the requirement for sacrifice in ways that do not lead to death. For instance:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p5\">The Fallen must have the Horned King’s sin driven from their souls, causing the death of their wicked identity. For example, sparing and redeeming Lethica Nightborne still “kills” her Fallen identity of the Weeping Widow.</p></li><li><p class=\"p5\">The Vermintoll Coven must be driven from their lairs so that they lose their source of power without being slain.</p></li><li><p class=\"p5\">Phillip and Adela Druskenvald must lose their hope and their pride, with the act of falling so low being enough for Kehlenn to achieve her goals.</p></li><li><p class=\"p5\">Any surviving and redeemed villains leave Wickermoor Hollow forever and don’t aid the characters in their quest.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p2\">It is up to you how you approach the adventure and account for the changes and potential “butterfly effects” that result from choosing to spare these figures.</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap08\"><p class=\"h1 section\">Wikermoor Hollow</p><p>The entirety of <em>The Crooked Moon</em> adventure takes place within the valley known as Wickermoor Hollow. This minor province of Druskenvald is isolated from the rule and watchful eye of the Crescent Court and especially Phillip Druskenvald, thanks to the rising power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Locations and Landscapes</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">In Folk Horror, the landscapes where the stories take place are just as important as the vile antagonists and doomed protagonists that drive the action forward. The wide variety of rural locations and natural settings throughout this adventure are intended to increase the feeling of isolation among the characters.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">Review the details of each location within Wickermoor Hollow so you can incorporate them into the adventure and leverage evocative descriptions to best achieve an atmospheric tone perfect for Folk Horror.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Wickermoor Village</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">At the heart of Wickermoor Hollow lies the town that shares its name. The oldest and largest settlement in the valley, it is still a relatively small and isolated village that does not get many visitors. Its people have built a community that lives in harmony with each other and with nature to survive the incredible dangers and lurking horrors that dominate the valley.</p><p class=\"p3\">However, beneath the surface operates a sinister cult that serves the Crooked Queen and seeks to bring about her return, even in the face of their own annihilation. Even the friendliest, smiling face can belie a wicked worshipper of Kehlenn who intends to sacrifice their neighbor when the time is right.</p><p class=\"p3\">Wickermoor Village sits on the banks of the Silverbell River that cuts through the valley from the Drowned Crossroads to Moonsong Lake. Nestled within the gloomy moors that rise near the center of the hollow, it serves as the hub of trade and commerce between the primarily human residents that call this place home (see chapter 11).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Foxwillow Farmland</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">To the east of Wickermoor Village stretches miles of fertile farmland that has been turned into fields that grow all manner of crop. Many small farming settlements dot the landscape, but at the center of the farmers who work the soil is the community of Foxwillow. These nearly picturesque fields and hills serve as the breadbasket for the rest of Wickermoor Hollow (see chapter 13).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Howlers</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The western border of the valley is walled in by a towering mountain range with snow-capped peaks. The Howlers, named for the wind that rips through the towering summits, stand as the impassable barrier to much of the rest of Druskenvald. The town of Dawn’s Gate sits in the foothills, surviving on the hunting and mining that the mountains provide (see chapter 14).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Drowned Crossroads</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">At the lowest point of the valley is the teeming swamp called the Drowned Crossroads. This treacherous bayou is known for its miles of still, black water, choking overgrowth, and lurking predators that threaten to swallow even the most experienced swampfolk. Its largest town, Murkwater Bend, is a lawless haven for anyone hoping to escape the societal rule of the other settlements across the valley (see chapter 15).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Moonsong Lake</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The Silverbell River empties into the vast Moonsong Lake at the western edge of the valley, which is prone to bouts of rain that can last for weeks. At the center of the lake rests the Isle of Mourn, which once served as a place of healing despite the near-constant gloomy weather. However, its seemingly placid waters are teeming with wriggling parasites (see chapter 17).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Hartsblight Forest</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">The wood in the northwest corner of the valley has been overrun by a terrible blight that afflicts all plants, animals, and people that enter Hartsblight Forest. Thousands of varieties of fungus thrive in the alien-looking woodland as the dominant life form, and even the air between the trees is choked with virulent spores (see chapter 18).</span></p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Maidenmist Cemetery</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The sprawling hills south of Wickermoor Village roll all the way to the southern border of the valley, covered in tombstones and crypts. Serving as the final resting place of the dead of Wickermoor Hollow, the vast Maidenmist Cemetery is a region of its own, and it’s even said that the iron gates inch further outward every passing night (see chapter 19).</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Wytchwood</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s6\">The oldest and wildest part of Wickermoor Hollow is the forbidden forest called the Wytchwood. All those who venture past its shrouded tree line never return, and the eerie howls, roars, snarls, and bellows of the strange creatures within can be heard from miles away. People across the valley feel drawn to the wood, called by the beast that stalks between its primeval trees (see chapter 24).</span></p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Ideologies and Power Groups</span></h2><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">While various beliefs are spread throughout Wickermoor Hollow, four primary ideologies have taken hold among most of the common folk of the valley. These factions are most prevalent among the residents of Wickermoor Village but can be found in other settlements as well. While some of these groups might have more members that are good or evil, membership in any of the ideologies doesn’t guarantee how any of its adherents will act.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">Additionally, these groups are not factions in the traditional sense with official membership and processes for joining. Instead, people might be associated with a group based on their beliefs or actions but are not necessarily zealots or advocates for any particular worldview.</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Followers of the Old Ways</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Followers%20of%20the%20Old%20Ways-%20good%20and%20back%20combined.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p2\">The Followers of the Old Ways kneel to the natural and supernatural world that surrounds them. This faith is the standard belief system of the people of Wickermoor Village, and its members believe that adhering to the Old Ways has allowed for their settlement to have survived for centuries and grow to a level of relative prosperity in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Highly superstitious, those who revere the Old Ways bow to and seek to appease the protective and destructive sides of nature and its spirit world counterpart. The personification of the Old Ways is a primordial fey entity called the Green Queen who embodies both nature and magic. However, most worshipers do not know that the true identity of their goddess is Kehlenn, who has turned crooked after millennia of hateful imprisonment.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">The Followers of the Old Ways believe that survival in a world such as Druskenvald is a privilege and a miracle—and never guaranteed. They accept with open arms nature’s blessings as well as the utter destruction and death it can cause.</p><p class=\"p3\">To them, individual life is a tiny insignificance in the scope of the community; they are happy and willing to sacrifice themselves or others if it means honoring and appeasing the Old Ways and guaranteeing a greater existence and prosperity for the collective whole in the years to come. Most practitioners of the Old Ways perform numerous rituals in their nightly lives and always strive to listen to the elders and the wisest among them.</p><p class=\"p3\">The majority are not evil or actively attempting to serve the Crooked Queen. Only the most devout and enlightened have formed a secretive cult of the Old Ways that practices malign and forbidden magic to serve Kehlenn, the Crooked Man, and the Vermintoll Coven.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">This sect manipulates the unaware and more benevolent adherents of the Green Queen to bring about the ascension of the Crooked Queen and the eventual disintegration of all sapient life. These cultists know that they too will die but are seeking a glorious rebirth in the new crooked order of things. As soon as Phillip and Adela Druskenvald arrive in Wickermoor Hollow, they begin to advance their plans toward this end.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">On the surface, the benevolent symbol utilized by the general members of the Followers of the Old Ways is a feminine face made from green leaves. However, the more malign cultists who seek to unleash the Crooked Queen recognize each other by wearing or displaying the symbol of an antlered hare. This might be a tattoo, a piece of jewelry, or an actual hare foot kept somewhere on them for “good luck.”</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Fold of the Patient Lady</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Fold%20of%20the%20Patient%20Lady.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p2\">The members of the Fold of the Patient Lady believe in harmony between sapient life and the forces of nature. They reject that nature is brutal, destructive, and uncaring and instead believe that it provides everything that sapient life needs to thrive without need for archaic and barbaric sacrifice and appeasement.</p><p class=\"p3\">This newer reinterpretation of the Old Ways is a more palatable and perhaps naïve view of nature that has been quite appealing to the folk of the valley, and it has gained in popularity outside of Wickermoor Village. There are adherents in many of the larger communities, but most of the practitioners live in remote communes in the wilds.</p><p class=\"p3\">The faithful of this sect are genuinely grateful to survive in such a dour and dangerous world and believe that the goddess known as the Patient Lady is to thank, giving her the credit for the ability to survive and grow food in a realm with no daytime and no seasonal cycle. They also eschew any dabbling in the spirit world or supernatural realms, considering such a thing a foolish and dangerous invitation for malevolent forces to corrupt the wilds.</p><p class=\"p3\">Its adherents still perform rituals and rites in honor of the Patient Lady, but they keep them incredibly simple and tied to the natural world around them. This can even take the form of basic meditation outdoors, a walk through the woods and fields with fellow faithful, or the utterance of a song or prayer at harvest time.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The members of the Fold of the Patient Lady wear symbols that represent the beauty and bounty of nature. Flowers such as daisies and primroses and fruit such as apples and pumpkins are frequent symbols of these folk.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Brightsingers</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Brightsingers.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p2\">Only a small handful of people in Wickermoor Hollow are among the faithful that call themselves the Brightsingers. This new monotheistic sect believes in one true divine power that brings light to the land of darkness. They hold that their omnipresent and omniscient god, the Brightsinger, is the only path to goodness and prosperity, holding that the realms of nature and spirit in Druskenvald are inherently wicked and corrupted.</p><p class=\"p3\">They attempt to spread their belief through pilgrimage and missionary work, advocating for their beliefs through relentless kindness and benevolence, never scolding or criticizing members of other faiths. However, there is a supreme pride among them because they believe they themselves to be as godly as their deity. The Brightsinger is all, so each member of the faithful is a Brightsinger themselves.</p><p class=\"p3\">They see his presence in the songbirds that still sing brightly in the land of eternal night. They alone preach unconditional love and light in the hollow, but it is often a self-righteous and self-aggrandizing love that holds little sway over the population who have seen too much suffering to believe in a love on that scale.</p><p class=\"p3\">The Brightsingers wear brightly colored clothes and jewelry, particularly fashioned from valuable materials and displaying fine craftsmanship. This attire often depicts images of suns, torches, lanterns, or brilliantly colored songbirds.</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Newcomers</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Newcomers.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p2\">The group known as the Newcomers embraces reason, modernity, progress, and civilization. Often having traveled to Wickermoor Hollow from other provinces of Druskenvald or even from cities in the material world, they reject the beliefs and practices of the superstitious ideologies prominent in the valley.</p><p class=\"p3\">Instead, they focus on what can be achieved and explained through knowledge, science, and technology. Phillip Druskenvald shares similar tenets with the Newcomers and easily makes friends with members of this scarce group throughout Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p3\">These folks are not an organized group, and they share no symbols or rites. They are identified as Newcomers by the other folk in the area rather than self-identifying as a cohesive group.The entirety of <em>The Crooked Moon</em> adventure takes place within the valley known as Wickermoor Hollow. This minor province of Druskenvald is isolated from the rule and watchful eye of the Crescent Court and especially Phillip Druskenvald, thanks to the rising power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Locations and Landscapes</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">In Folk Horror, the landscapes where the stories take place are just as important as the vile antagonists and doomed protagonists that drive the action forward.

There are adherents in many of the larger communities, but most of the practitioners live in remote communes in the wilds.</p><p class=\"p3\">The faithful of this sect are genuinely grateful to survive in such a dour and dangerous world and believe that the goddess known as the Patient Lady is to thank, giving her the credit for the ability to survive and grow food in a realm with no daytime and no seasonal cycle. They also eschew any dabbling in the spirit world or supernatural realms, considering such a thing a foolish and dangerous invitation for malevolent forces to corrupt the wilds.</p><p class=\"p3\">Its adherents still perform rituals and rites in honor of the Patient Lady, but they keep them incredibly simple and tied to the natural world around them. This can even take the form of basic meditation outdoors, a walk through the woods and fields with fellow faithful, or the utterance of a song or prayer at harvest time.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The members of the Fold of the Patient Lady wear symbols that represent the beauty and bounty of nature. Flowers such as daisies and primroses and fruit such as apples and pumpkins are frequent symbols of these folk.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Brightsingers</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Brightsingers.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p2\">Only a small handful of people in Wickermoor Hollow are among the faithful that call themselves the Brightsingers. This new monotheistic sect believes in one true divine power that brings light to the land of darkness. They hold that their omnipresent and omniscient god, the Brightsinger, is the only path to goodness and prosperity, holding that the realms of nature and spirit in Druskenvald are inherently wicked and corrupted.</p><p class=\"p3\">They attempt to spread their belief through pilgrimage and missionary work, advocating for their beliefs through relentless kindness and benevolence, never scolding or criticizing members of other faiths. However, there is a supreme pride among them because they believe they themselves to be as godly as their deity. The Brightsinger is all, so each member of the faithful is a Brightsinger themselves.</p><p class=\"p3\">They see his presence in the songbirds that still sing brightly in the land of eternal night. They alone preach unconditional love and light in the hollow, but it is often a self-righteous and self-aggrandizing love that holds little sway over the population who have seen too much suffering to believe in a love on that scale.</p><p class=\"p3\">The Brightsingers wear brightly colored clothes and jewelry, particularly fashioned from valuable materials and displaying fine craftsmanship. This attire often depicts images of suns, torches, lanterns, or brilliantly colored songbirds.</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Newcomers</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Newcomers.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p2\">The group known as the Newcomers embraces reason, modernity, progress, and civilization. Often having traveled to Wickermoor Hollow from other provinces of Druskenvald or even from cities in the material world, they reject the beliefs and practices of the superstitious ideologies prominent in the valley.</p><p class=\"p3\">Instead, they focus on what can be achieved and explained through knowledge, science, and technology. Phillip Druskenvald shares similar tenets with the Newcomers and easily makes friends with members of this scarce group throughout Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p3\">These folks are not an organized group, and they share no symbols or rites. They are identified as Newcomers by the other folk in the area rather than self-identifying as a cohesive group.</p></div>"

Their breath slows, drawn to a halt, until all that remains of the sacrificed is ash. Atop the highest hill in the gloomy moorland stands a titan made of wicker, casting its crooked shadow over a throng of devotees that sing praises to the Crooked Queen.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A prophecy (see chapter 8) has been whispered among the Followers of the Old Ways since Kehlenn first stirred within her prison in the Crooked Tree. Following the deaths of the Fallen, the bloody revelries brought forth by the Lord of Fools, and the preparations for sacrifice conducted by the Vermintoll Coven, the final piece of the prophecy is put into place with the capture of Adela Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p7\">Adela’s sacrifice is all that remains to free the Crooked Queen and unleash her twisted, vengeful power upon Phillip Druskenvald and the domain he dared to steal. No fewer than thirteen souls must be consumed by flames within an enormous wicker effigy shaped into the form of the humanity that Kehlenn loathes so much. Among those doomed to burn is the beloved bride of her eons-old foe.</p><p class=\"p7\">With the ritual set in motion and the ancient prophecy poised to come to fruition, the Followers of the Old Ways have erected a Wicker Man atop the highest hill in the moors north of Wickermoor Village. This sacred site, known as Rowan’s Rise, is where the Crooked Man makes his final play, drawing forth his ancient power.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Leaving the collapsed remains of the Crooked House behind, the characters follow the massive swarm of spirits—their ethereal cries now mingled with gleeful screams of dying victims—out into the moors toward Rowan’s Rise. Characters have these goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Journey across the moors, saving innocent townsfolk from the monsters of the Crooked Queen.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Disrupt the ritualistic magic at the standing stones atop Rowan’s Rise.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy the animated Wicker Man and annihilate the Crooked Man.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, review the NPCs of Wickermoor Village (see chapter 11) and decide who will be cultists and who will be captives based on the characters’ connections for the most dramatic climax. Read through the encounters across the moors so you can better improvise the innocents’ reactions to the horrors around them. Finally, familiarize yourself with the climactic battle, “Shadow of the Wicker Man,” so that you can deliver a satisfying ending to the Crooked Man’s story arc.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 12 characters.</p></div>"

This sacred place draws the freed souls to it before they fly off in all directions and fade in an attempt to find rest. Now is the time to save the still-living souls.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">The Legend of Rowan</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Many years ago, a young woman named Rowan became enchanted by the moon that forever gazes upon Druskenvald, its gentle light a soft invitation from the heavens. She followed its beckoning glow from her bedroom in Wickermoor Village and disappeared into the moors. When she did not return home, a search party scoured the highlands all night before finding the last trace anyone would ever find of her. Her precious silver locket lay abandoned at the center of a ring of ancient standing stones, the portrait of her beloved sister within replaced by the image of an antlered hare.</p><p class=\"p7\">The story told for generations was that Rowan soared into the night sky, flying higher and higher until she could sit upon the Crooked Moon, watching over the people of Wickermoor Hollow forever more. From then on, that great crowned hill was known as Rowan’s Rise.</p><p class=\"p7\">Beneath the tale lies the truth… that Rowan became the first human sacrifice to Kehlenn when she first reawakened her power. And so, it is at this sacred site that the Followers of the Old Ways perform the final rites to release the Crooked Queen so that she can reclaim her usurped domain.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Sacrifices</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Each encounter in this section places innocent villagers in peril. Every villager that dies loses their soul to the ongoing sacrificial ritual and feeds the Wicker Man atop the hill. This is made obvious to the characters when, after each death of an innocent, a mote of blue-green light rises from the corpse and is whisked toward the Wicker Man. Keep track of how many villagers perish in the encounters, up to a maximum number noted in each encounter. The total determines how much stronger the Wicker Man becomes in the final confrontation.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Should the characters fare poorly while moving across the moors or falter in protecting the innocents, they may find themselves overwhelmed. If they retreat, dozens of townsfolk will be sacrificed, and the Wicker Man will achieve its full power, turning its wrath toward Wickermoor Village and the valley beyond until all has turned to ash.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">What’s at Stake</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Before parting ways with the Jenkin family at the ruins of the Crooked House, Dani tells the characters that she senses that both Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are on the moors. Adela is trapped in a prison of wicker surrounded by terrified innocents and animals. She can sense Phillip desperately searching the moors but does not know where he is.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Crooked Chaos</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">When the characters arrive at the moors, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The moors outside of Wickermoor Village are treacherous even in the best of times.

The ground is strewn with bodies, cut down by gleeful hands, their blood mingling with the mud.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p11\"><em><strong>On a distant hill, a towering bonfire roars, its light dancing wildly in the storm. Above, the clouds churn, forming a grinning face with hollow eyes. The voice of the Crooked Man bellows from the sky, dripping with twisted merriment.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p11\"><em><strong>“Welcome, dear friends, to the exaltation!” the disembodied voice lilts. “The hollow rejoices, and all have come to witness my blazing incarnation. Like lambs to the slaughter, each little sacrifice adds to the pyre of our beloved queen’s power. Do you think you can save them all? Remember, there are no heroes here.”</strong></em></p><p class=\"p11\"><em><strong>The face of the Crooked Man is replaced by roiling storm clouds, leaving the scattered people to scream in even greater terror.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">The Crooked Man has incited mass panic and calls forth the minions of the Crooked Queen to descend upon the numerous potential sacrifices.</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters attempt to get clarity regarding the situation by asking one of the people in their vicinity, choose an NPC who they’ve dealt with in the past and whom they trust.

Some of them brought captives of their own.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The captives and the kidnappers appeared to have gone deep into the moor, and now there is a raging fire atop Rowan’s Rise.</p></li></ul></div>"

A stone can be deactivated with a successful <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDispelMagi]{Dispel Magic}</em> (DC 15), or by taking a Utilize action and succeeding on an ability check using one of the following methods (or another at your discretion):</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">[[/check ATH DC 15]] or [[/check SLT DC 15]] to forcefully or precisely expose a weakened area on the stone.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">[[/check NAT DC 15]] or [[/check REL DC 15]] to alter a rune and prevent it from drawing on the Crooked Queen’s power.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">[[/check INV DC 15]] or [[/check PRC DC 15]] to find and break a natural flaw in the stone.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">[[/check ARC DC 15]] to undo the magic flow at the point of weakness.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Each time a character damages one of the stones or fails an ability check made with the Utilize action to disable a stone, the character is targeted by a burst of flame as described in “Sacrifices” below.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Sacrifices.</strong></em> The captives are chained to the stones, but the chains are melded into the rock and have no lock or latch to open.

However, they can be used to set the tone for any Folk Horror adventure you wish to run. Below is suggested guidance for how to use all three albums to maximize the atmosphere of your dreadful folktales.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s2\">The Crooked Moon Soundtrack</span></h2><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first album acts as a soundtrack for this book’s adventure campaign. In most cases, these songs aren’t literally occurring in the “canon” of the world (non-diegetic music) and can be utilized for conveying the tone of each character or encounter. Alternatively, if you wish to run a more musical campaign, you can find creative ways to incorporate each song into the context of the adventure (diegetic music). The list below overviews the characters and scenarios that have inspired each song.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Crooked Moon.</strong> A cultist of the Old Ways tells of the folklore and superstitions of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>When It’s Time.</strong> The Vagrant welcomes wayward souls aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> for their final journey.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Impossible.</strong> Phillip and Adela Druskenvald share a tender moment and celebrate what they’ve built.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>The Echoes.</strong> The spirit of Joseph Patrini laments the grisly fate of the inhabitants of the Crooked House.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Coal Eyed Birds.</strong> Ol’ Jericho Sticks is manipulated by his inner demon Virgil to join together as Raum.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Under Your Shadow.</strong> Father Renathyr leads worship of the devil goddess Viraxys, still wounded by lost love.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>By the Lagoon.</strong> Mister Crossroads makes a deal with a sinner and takes them to the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Lullaby of the Sea.</strong> Matron Lethica sings a lullaby to Hugo, still consumed by the grief of her lost love.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Dead Trees.</strong> Gorthos dwells on who she once was, whom she once loved, and what she has become.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Cold Iron.</strong> Yorgrim tends to his penitent duties as the twisted souls of the Shroud corrupt him.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>No Fun to Die.</strong> Chuckles wakes up to lead a parade of revelry and usher in rebirth in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Sing Ye Vermin.</strong> The Vermintoll Coven meets to brew a magic concoction and commune with their vermin.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Light of My Life.</strong> Adela reflects on her life and love before meeting a fiery fate in the Wicker Man.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Born King.</strong> Kehlenn takes her revenge against Phillip and transforms him into the Horned King.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Nightwind.</strong> The Vagrant returns at the end of the journey to take the survivors to their next destination.</p><h2><span class=\"s2\">Atmospheric &amp; Combat Music</span></h2><p class=\"p1\">The second and third albums feature looping instrumental tracks that evoke the themes of this book’s adventure, whether to set the tone while exploring a location or increase the tension and excitement during combat encounters. The table below suggests which chapters or scenarios to play these songs during, but they can be a thematic fit in any Folk Horror campaign.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Atmospheric Tracks per chapter</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Forgetting Glow.</strong> The Ghostlight Express</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Life Delicious.</strong> Wickermoor Village</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Silent Hours.</strong> The Crooked House</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Sunken Sky.</strong> Fields of the Crow</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Drained of Fear.</strong> The Crimson Monastery</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>A Place to Unwind.</strong> The Drowned Crossroads</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Wriggle Forth.</strong> Skitterdeep Mine / The Roving Rookery / The Crooked Nightmare</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Cradled in Dark.</strong> Memory’s Rest</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Rotted Rings.</strong> Hartsblight Forest</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Endless Twilights.</strong> Maidenmist Cemetery</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Round and Around.</strong> Fool’s Day</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Songs We’ve Borrowed.</strong> Wicker’s Vigil</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Half Forgotten.</strong> The Crooked Tree</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Creaking Bones.</strong> Outdoor Locations</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Blurring Faces.</strong> Indoor Locations</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Combat Tracks per chapter</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Riding too Long.</strong> The Ghostlight Express</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Thrashing Light.</strong> Wickermoor Village</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>These Splitting Walls.</strong> The Crooked House</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Talons.</strong> Fields of the Crow</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Hearts Agape.</strong> The Crimson Monastery</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Alligator’s Smile.</strong> The Drowned Crossroads</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Steaming Death.</strong> Skitterdeep Mine / The Roving Rookery / The Crooked Nightmare</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Shudders in a Teardrop.</strong> Memory’s Rest</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Her Rotting Throne.</strong> Hartsblight Forest</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Breaking.</strong> Maidenmist Cemetery</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Dizzy Dancing.</strong> Fool’s Day</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Fire Rising.</strong> Wicker’s Vigil</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Beneath Immortal Hooves.</strong> The Crooked Tree</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Shrieks of Endless Night.</strong> Outdoor Locations</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>So Solemn and Grim.</strong> Indoor Locations</p><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:relative;z-index:3\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;text-align:center\"><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">Find all these tracks and more at <a href=\"https://avantris.com/music\">avantris.com/music</a></span></span></p></div><p></p></div>"

Instances of accidents, disease, and financial ruin have increased dramatically, with no end to the bad luck in sight.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Even worse, the hex has brought the Drowned Crossroads to unnatural life, with the swamp itself rising up to drag unsuspecting travelers into its murky depths. In the Midnight Hour, haunting brass music can be heard throughout the mire, and the distant lights of a ghastly riverboat drift through the gloom, always just out of reach.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Murkwater Bend is jinxed, and its people are being swindled into bad deals that cost them their very souls.

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap15\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Grinning Sinner</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Mr_Crossroads_and_Briggsy.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Captain Briggsy “The Kutlass” Kratch gave up a life of piracy when he lost his crew to the violent waves of Druskenvald’s ravenous ocean. The crocodile-folk himself was only able to survive through the fate-bending power of his patron, an ancient death spirit known as Snake Eye Jack. Leaving the sea behind, he found himself bouncing between bounty hunts and other dangerous jobs armed with his patron’s jinxcraft and the sigil-etched cutlass that once gave him his piratical moniker.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s10\">In time, he made a home in the swamp, known as the Drowned Crossroads, feeling at ease around the scoundrels that lurked within. The rogues of the swamp did not care for the crocodile man, and the common folk of the bayou feared his strange magic and garishly hexed sword. They even coined ugly legends about him that claimed he devoured children and stole souls.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Work dried up, attempted cons and thievery failed, and Briggsy found himself penniless, purposeless, and reviled. This potent cocktail of isolation, resentment, and bad luck made him deeply resent his patron, believing that Snake Eye Jack had turned his back on Briggsy despite the years of service. Through the bitterness, the cunning croc-folk came up with a plan.</p><p class=\"p7\">One night at the Midnight Hour, Briggsy rowed into the bayou and tossed his hexed cutlass overboard at the exact point where the two ancient roads had once crossed centuries ago. This offering summoned Snake Eye Jack, a many-armed man of shadow and bone with serpents’ eyes glowing a neon green and pink. Briggsy challenged his patron to a game of dice, making an offer the death spirit could not refuse.</p><p class=\"p7\">The pair diced all night, and through Briggsy’s guile and treachery, he beat Snake Eye Jack and bound him in a hexed coffin. Claiming the full power of his former patron for himself, the croc-folk became a master of misfortune and jinxcraft, conjuring forth a magical blunderbuss with his new abilities. However, the cost was great. His body rotted as if he had been dead for weeks, and his left arm withered to bone.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s10\">Briggsy didn't mind. He moved into an abandoned shack on stilts at the heart of the swamp and decided to become what the people of Murkwater Bend believed him to be: the bogeyman of the Drowned Crossroads.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Heart’s Desire</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">From then on, Briggsy called himself Mister Crossroads, but many of the folk who called upon him for favors and charms dubbed him the Grinning Sinner after his crocodile smile and tricksy magic. People of the swamp come to Mister Crossroads for simple jinxes and curses, but the croc-folk’s favorite “associates” are the truly desperate.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">He makes deals with these unfortunate souls, whether they're someone trying to escape a hell of their own making or in search of their wildest dreams. Shortly after sealing the pact through a signed contract or a simple handshake, the luck of the new victim would turn around, and they would get exactly what Mister Crossroads promised.</p><p class=\"p7\">But the Grinning Sinner is clever, and there are always loopholes in every deal. After weeks, months, or even years, the luck runs out, and the joy and fortune granted by the jinxcraft turns to ash. Eventually, each and every one of them experiences a terrible misfortune that costs them their life and grants their soul to Mister Crossroads, which he uses to fuel the soul-binding magic that keeps Snake Eye Jack bound within his hexed coffin. As added insult, their lifeless corpse rises as an Undead thrall to join his crew of the damned.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Captain of the Damned</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">When Mister Crossroads isn't making deals in his swamp shack, he captains the opulent <em>Dead Man’s Hand </em>riverboat, which thrums with his jinxcraft power. Acquired from a foolish gambler—Elias—the riverboat moves about the Drowned Crossroads, mooring at random locations each night, only able to be found by those who have made a deal with Mister Crossroads.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\">Keeping the riverboat fueled and Snake Eye Jack bound requires a constant supply of damned souls. His most recent and precious catch is Adela Druskenvald herself, who made a foolish bargain with Mister Crossroads in desperation to avoid her most terrifying visions and prophecies of calamity. The Grinning Sinner’s current target and most vexing foe is Vander Boone, the self-proclaimed “Bayou King” of the Drowned Crossroads (described in “NPCs of the Drowned Crossroads” below).</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Between Elias’s riverboat, Adela’s powerful soul, and Vander’s large following, Mister Crossroads hopes to stack his crew with hundreds of new corpses and stock up on enough soul-stuff to keep Snake Eye Jack imprisoned forever.</p><p class=\"p7\">These grand schemes are motivated by fear and doubt. He knows that, should his former patron ever break free, his own doom would come swiftly, and the soul he traded to Snake Eye Jack many years ago would be tormented for all time.</p></div>"

Within Wickermoor Hollow, Crossroaders are often labeled as scoundrels, thieves, or gamblers—and many are—but most swamp-folk are regular fisherfolk, traders, hunters, trappers, and artisans who’ve learned the secret ways of surviving in the wetlands. Some important swamp-dwelling characters in this adventure are featured below.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Elias Greaves</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Elias_Greaves.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Elias (eh-LYE-us) Greaves was a gambler from the world of the living who dreamt of wealth and influence far beyond his station. Seemingly blessed by Lady Luck herself, he won big at every gambling hall he visited, eventually growing bored and craving a new challenge. He found a way to board the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> and travel to Druskenvald, where he met Phillip and Adela.</p><p class=\"p7\">Despite his powerful new friends, his luck ran out in the lands of death, and his fortune was quickly spent. Soon, he was stuck playing low stakes games aboard the<em> Laughlin Lullaby</em>, a riverboat that traveled up and down the Silverbell River in Wickermoor Hollow. In desperation, he made a deal with Mister Crossroads to turn his luck around.</p><p class=\"p7\">After shaking the croc-folk’s hand, his luck instantly turned around, and he even won ownership of the riverboat in a poker bet. He renamed it <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> in reference to the skeletal left hand of his new patron. The gambler enjoyed years of prosperity, but as always, the Grinning Sinner exploited the man’s greed and the fine print in the deal, and it all came crashing down.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s10\">When Mister Crossroads came to collect, he claimed Elias’s soul, his walking corpse, and the fine riverboat, which the trickster turned into his base of operations. He then threw the gambler’s spirit into a soulfire boiler to power the hexes that kept Snake Eye Jack imprisoned in the jinxed coffin. Elias was special. As a living soul who traveled aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, his spirit would burn bright and long, keeping the Grinning Sinner’s game going for years.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Elias’s shambling corpse mindlessly serves aboard the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>, but it was recently reawakened when his old friend Adela Druskenvald made a deal with Mister Crossroads. A fragment of his soul stirred in his withered hand, which ripped free from the animated corpse and crawled through the swamp in search of help against the Grinning Sinner.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Vander Boone, the Bayou King</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Vander_Boone.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Folk often come to Murkwater Bend to trade or scheme, but prize fights draw in the largest crowds. Vander Boone (Chaotic Neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmBanditCaptain0]{Bandit Captain}</strong>) was one such prize fighter, a brigand-turned-boxer renowned throughout the swamps. He was popular and successful, but he longed for more. He wanted real power, real control, and real respect.</p><p class=\"p7\">One night, just short of a year ago, Vander met Mister Crossroads and asked for the power to rule the Drowned Crossroads. All would pay tribute to him and seek his approval. But when the Grinning Sinner extended his hand, Vander pulled back, shook his head, and told Mister Crossroads he would do it himself. The flabbergasted croc-folk swore that Boone would regret his decision as he walked away.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\">Vander has declared himself the Bayou King and named himself the protector of the Drowned Crossroads. He has amassed a small legion of small-time thugs, decked them out in stylish purple-and-black uniforms with his prize money, and created a protection racket in Murkwater Bend. Unlike most bandit captains, however, Vander has proved to be a surprisingly canny leader. He understands the motivations of the countless rogues within the town and strives to keep them in balance.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">He was surprised when everyone readily paid his taxes, leaving him with the job of managing the town while maintaining its lawlessness as much as possible. Recently, however, the Grinning Sinner has sent his Undead crew across the swamp to hunt down the Bayou King. Vander’s crew clashes with Mr. Crossroads’ minions nearly every night, and though the Bayou King has been steadily losing ground and has retreated to his fort in Murkwater Bend, his noble defense of the village has made him more beloved than ever.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Lyla Webb</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Lyla_Webb.webp\" width=\"220\" /><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">A native of the Drowned Crossroads born to a family of fisherfolk, Lyla (LYE-luh) Webb (Chaotic Good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmPriest00000000]{Priest}</strong>) had dreams that were much bigger than a life of catching catfish. She set off from home at a young age and eventually discovered a community in the swamp that worshiped Snake Eye Jack and held him as a beneficent spirit who made sure that luck was always on their side. She learned their ways and became a skilled jinxcraft practitioner, using her magical abilities to help the people of the bayou as well as aid her work as a trader.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Now an adult, she has become a shrewd and resourceful businesswoman who has numerous contacts throughout the Drowned Crossroads and a knack for fencing stolen goods that the rogues of the swamp bring her. Her skill in business, helpful magic, and wisdom beyond her years have made her widely respected by all the folk of the swamp, and the Bayou King has appointed her as his chief advisor and emissary.</p></div>"

Dressed in a black fur coat, wide brimmed hat, and long woolen gloves, she is clearly trying to seem incognito despite just how out of place her outfit is. She speaks in a pleading whisper, asking the characters to have a private meeting.</p><p class=\"p7\">When Adela is alone with the characters, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Adela looks around to make sure there is no one else watching or listening before slowly removing the long woolen glove off her left hand and pulling up the sleeve of her fur coat.

The skin has turned to a corpse flesh gray all the way to the elbow.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p11\"><em><strong>“I made a big mistake…”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Adela then makes her confession. Following the events in Foxwillow, she had offered to join the pilgrims of the Patient Lady to help the townsfolk start rebuilding their lives after the destruction of Raum. However, this was a lie so she could secretly go to the Drowned Crossroads after a terrifying vision and prophecy. She’s just returned from her trip after making a deal with Mister Crossroads.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">The prophecy stated, “You and your king shall leave this place on ashen winds when the Crooked Moon snarls with rage and not a night before,” which shook her to the core. In desperation, she secretly sought out the magician in the swamp after hearing tales from her new confidant Gaston Doray.</p><p class=\"p7\">Mister Crossroads promised that Phillip’s power would return when it was time to leave the valley, and all it cost was her wedding ring. In desperation, she accepted. After leaving the Drowned Crossroads, she had forgotten the path she took to get there, and her entire left arm began withering away. This affliction can only be reversed if her wedding ring is recovered and returned to her finger or if Mr. Crossroads is killed, though Adela doesn't know this.</p><p class=\"p7\">She pleads with the characters to head to the swamp and find a cure for her arm, offering them 150 gp each in return. She also asks them to keep the arrangement secret and to not tell Phillip, promising an extra 50 gp each for their discretion.</p><p class=\"p7\">After the characters are finished talking to Adela, she leaves to return to the Druskenvald Estate, telling them that she must keep up appearances so Phillip doesn’t worry. The characters are then free to gather supplies and travel to the Drowned Crossroads.</p></div>"

If they honestly reply that Adela is paying them [[/award 150gp]] apiece ([[/award 200gp]] if sworn to secrecy), he scowls at the price but accedes to pay them that upon delivering proof of the Grinning Sinner’s demise.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\">If they lie about the price, they must succeed on a [[/check DEC DC 15]] check to convince him. Naming a price of [[/award 300gp]] apiece or higher imposes disadvantage on this check. On a success, he agrees to pay whatever price they name, up to a maximum of [[/award 300gp]].</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Defeat.</strong></em> If the Bayou King or Lyla wins, Vander smiles and shakes his head. He admits the characters may not have the luck of a master gambler but believes that they may have enough moxie to muscle through. After all, they owe him now to kill the Grinning Sinner.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Time to Rest.</strong></em> After the game, Vander lets the characters rest in the fort, offering a small room to share with enough bedding for all of them. Before retiring for the evening, he invites the characters to eat and drink with him, providing an opportunity for the characters to learn more about the Bayou King, the Drowned Crossroads, and the Grinning Sinner. The downtime of the dice game and remaining evening are enough for the characters to take a Long Rest.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Screams in the Night</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">After the characters bid goodnight and retire, they’re jolted awake by piercing screams echoing through the fort. The Grinning Sinner’s Undead thralls have infiltrated Murkwater Bend, scaling the fort walls. When the characters reach the throne room, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Outside, shrieks split the night air as the throne room descends into chaos. The Bayou King’s scoundrels scramble for weapons, casting fearful glances toward the door. Suddenly, it flies open, and a blood-streaked sentry stumbles in, gasping, “They’re here… Over the wall…” before collapsing in a heap.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p11\"><em><strong>Vander Boone turns to you, his voice a fierce growl: “Get outta’ here! Take the north road and head to the Sinner’s shack. Keep running ‘til you hear his cursed strings playin’ in the swamp. Board his riverboat, cut that grinnin’ croc down, and end this nightmare!”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">The Bayou King will hear no protest. If the characters enter the village’s streets and fight, even against his wishes, you can draw your own map of the streets and challenge them with four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmGhast000000000]{Ghasts}</strong> led by a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Rx2bHyP6K3q4taKX]{Ferryman}</strong><span class=\"s13\">*</span>. Another similar group arrives on initiative count 20 of the fifth and tenth rounds of combat. Staying to fight is foolish, and Lyla Webb joins the fray to spur them on to defeat Mister Crossroads and free Snake Eye Jack.</p><p class=\"p7\">Otherwise, the characters flee as the town dissolves into a frenzied melee. Waves of the living dead stagger through the streets, their hollow eyes seeking only to kill. Amid the chaos, the characters slip past the carnage unscathed and take the north road, where wooden walkways give way to a soggy, mud-choked path leading into the stinking mire.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_DROWN_Screams%20in%20the%20Night_Finished.webp\" /></div>"

The players in this game are Vander, Lyla, and the characters.</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">Each player has a set of five 6-sided dice, and each round they roll them in secret and look at their own dice (rolling in cups is recommended).</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">1s are considered wild and can be used as any number. For instance, a player with two 4s and two 1s would actually have four 4s.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">The first player (starting with Vander in round one) makes a bid on how many dice of a certain face were rolled by all players in total. For example, Vander starts by safely bidding “two 2s”.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">After each bid, the next player to the left can challenge the bid, and all players reveal their dice. If the challenged player overbid, they lose a die for the rest of the game. For example, if there was only a single 2 showing between all players (unlikely, but possible), Vander would permanently lose a die in all future rounds. If the challenged player did not overbid (if there were two or more 2s for example), the challenging player permanently loses a die for the rest of the game instead. Once the challenge is resolved, players reroll their dice, and the player who lost a die makes the first bid in the new round.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">If the next player to the left doesn’t wish to challenge, they must raise either the number of dice (“three 2s”), the face (“two 3s”), or both (“four 4s”). There is no limit to how high either number can be raised in the next bid, other than the natural cap of 6 for the face portion of the bid.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">This process of bidding and challenging continues around clockwise with play always passing to the next player on the left.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">When a player loses all five of their dice, they are eliminated from the game.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">The winner of the game is the last person with any dice remaining.</span></p></li></ul><p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">You will know both Vander and Lyla’s dice. That’s okay—they know how to communicate under the table to gain an advantage.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><em><strong>Special Rules.</strong></em> Characters with certain skill proficiencies can manipulate the game to their advantage, letting the characters be better gamblers than their players. Show the players the following rules.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">If you have proficiency in the listed skill or tool, you can use that special trait on your turn. You can use any combination of these traits up to a total of three times during the game:</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Hard Read (Insight).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, one opponent of your choice must reveal their dice to you, and only you.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Deft Hands (Sleight of Hand).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, you can change one of your dice to any number.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Sly Reveal (Stealth).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, show your dice to one opponent. They can choose to show you theirs.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Poker Face (Deception).</strong> When an opponent challenges a bid you made this turn, you can succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check against DC 15 or the other player’s Wisdom score, whichever is higher, to make them balk and withdraw their challenge.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Daring Dicer (Gaming Set: Dice).</strong> Immediately after rolling your dice, you may change any number of your dice to the face of your choice.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Fated Luck (Any).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, you can reroll all of your remaining dice.</span></p><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><h3><span class=\"s2\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Variant: Quick Liar’s Dice</strong></span></span></h3><p>If you’d prefer an alternative to playing a game of Liar’s Dice within your game session, you can leave the game to ability checks using tools.</p><p>Using the guidance in the gaming set tool, you can call for [[/check WIS DC 20]] checks using proficiency with dice to determine the winner of the game. Any gambler who fails to meet or exceed 20 loses, and if multiple gamblers succeed on the check, the gambler with the highest total wins.</p><p>To add a bit more nuance, you can allow Charisma (Deception) checks using the dice instead, with advantage if the player has proficiency with both dice and the Deception skill.</p></aside></td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

Folk call it the Marshwinder Road, and it’s the only way to traverse a far distance through the Drowned Crossroads without a boat.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">After traveling through the treacherous muck of the swamp for six hours, only spying the occasional hut, boathouse, or fishing shack, the characters finally hear the musical call of Mister Crossroads.</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><span class=\"s7\"><em><strong>The winding, soggy road leads deeper into the swamp. The dense canopy swallows the moonlight, and the eyes and sounds of wild creatures follow you, yet you’re certain none of the shambling dead pursued you. After a few hours of trudging along the muddy, overgrown path, you suddenly hear the low mournful wails of a stringed instrument sailing across the black water to your left.</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p11\"><em><strong>As you turn, you see the source of the melancholic tune: a dilapidated one-room shack on stilts stands above the waterline, a ladder hanging down from its porch. Its windows are filled with the warmth of an inviting fire, and pairs of light-filled bottles float atop the swamp’s surface to act as glowing buoys that form a path along the water to the shack.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s10\">The water here is 4 feet deep and can be waded through, although the thick mud below makes each foot of movement cost 4 feet. If the characters stay between the glowing jars that act as navigational beacons, they arrive at the Grinning Sinner’s</span> <span class=\"s10\">shack without issue.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">If any character leaves the designated pathway lit by the jars, whether through the water or on top of it, the swamp comes to life with the glow of jinxcraft and a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.iXXg49tXUKWxehi9]{Bayou Beast}</strong><span class=\"s13\">*</span> attacks.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Between the Deals</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">At the top of the ladder is a modest porch overlooking the black pool below. A rickety rocking chair creaks with a gentle sway, and a large steel guitar rests on its seat, shifting back and forth with each rock. The windows glow with a warm orange light, yet through the glass, you see only shadows. The door is unlocked. When the characters open the door, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The door groans open, and the inviting orange light proves to be a cruel illusion. Inside, the shack is cluttered with strange trinkets and knick-knacks, and bottles glow with an eerie neon green and magenta light that emanates from the sigils that adorn them. Against the back, a narrow wooden staircase spirals upward, vanishing into the unseen shadows above.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">The vast collection of Mister Crossroads consists of Cursed Curios<span class=\"s8\">*</span> and Paranormal Potions<span class=\"s8\">*</span>. In addition, carved idols and woven dolls resembling creatures can conjure Familiars<span class=\"s8\">*</span>. There is a weathered paper price tag for every item in the shack, each reading “3 cp.”</p><p class=\"p7\">When the characters touch one of the items, call out to <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.xcfItWQMdjf5MK2k]{The Grinning Sinner}</strong><span class=\"s13\">*</span>, or turn to leave the shack, Mister Crossroads himself walks heavily down the stairs.</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Heavy footfalls descend the stairs in the back of the shack.

A feathered top hat sits atop his head. He flashes a toothy grin. “I’m Mister Crossroads,” he drawls. “Have you come to partake in my wares? Or perhaps you’d care to make a deal. Let’s have a civil conversation, shall we? I am a gentleman after all.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_DROWN_Familiars_Finished.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Parley with the Sinner</strong></em>. In this conversation, the Grinning Sinner is trying to charm and befriend the characters so they don’t disrupt his plans with Adela. Use the guidance below to steer the conversation with Mister Crossroads:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">He tries to appear charming and disarming, brushing off threats and insults as a joke.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">If asked about his undead-looking state, he waves it off as a simple skin condition. It is true he is not Undead—he simply has his own withering curse.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">He invites the characters to the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> as guests, promising an endless night of food, drinks, and gambling. He even offers a few free games on the house.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The Sinner’s shack is a place to make quick deals and sell magical trinkets. He has all Dark Bargains<span class=\"s8\">*</span> on offer, costing a handshake.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">If asked about Adela, he swears he made a fair deal, and she just failed to read the fine print.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Mention of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> increases Mister Crossroads’ interest. A successful [[/check INS DC 18]] check makes it clear it’s a suspicious curiosity.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Mister Crossroads is insistent about the characters taking a deal or trinket in order to get them aboard his riverboat and curse them to stay forever.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Take One.</strong></em> Each character can only choose one item or deal (Dark Bargain, Potion, Curio, or Familiar). Attempts to purchase or shake down for more are refused, and anything stolen after the first trinket turns to swamp water as soon as it leaves the shack.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\"><em><strong>Making a Deal.</strong></em> If every character accepts a deal or purchases a trinket, he bids them adieu and tells them he’ll see them aboard the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>, which is just down the road. He adds that they’ll be his honored guests while in the casino (see “Dead Man’s Hand” later in the chapter) before disappearing into a burst of magenta fire.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Refusing the Sinner.</strong></em> If the Grinning Sinner’s hospitality is outright refused, or if the characters attack him, he shakes his head regretfully before grinning, making his escape, and calling forth his minions (see below).</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Swamp Stalkers</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">If the characters reject Mister Crossroads or attack him, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><span class=\"s10\"><em><strong>The croc-folk pulls out a pocket watch with his skeletal hand and examines it. “My, my. Look at the time! It’s a shame we couldn’t make a deal, but I must retire to the Dead Man’s Hand. It’s just down the road!”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p11\"><em><strong>With a snap of his bony fingers, brilliant magenta flame whips up around him, and he’s gone in an instant. A moment later, the door of the shack explodes in a hail of splinters as a hulking beast made of interwoven swamp plants and hexed charms lurches into the building. A loud buzzing fills the room as it enters.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\"></p><p class=\"p5\">This monster is a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.iXXg49tXUKWxehi9]{Bayou Beast}</strong><span class=\"s13\">*</span> and is joined by six grotesquely large and jinxed mosquitoes (use the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmStirge00000000]{Stirge}</strong> stat block). When defeated, the monsters dissolve into muck.</p><p class=\"p7\">All of the trinkets remain in the shack, but if a character tries to leave with more than one, all but the first trinket that character took turn to swamp water. Any character who didn’t take a Dark Bargain or buy a trinket can steal one now. If they do, 3 cp (or a larger denomination coin or gem if that’s all they’re carrying) vanishes from the character’s possessions or from those of the person closest to them if they’re not carrying any money, and the character will be able to gain passage aboard the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">By the Lagoon</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Once each character has earned passage on the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>, nothing stands in their way from finding it and getting aboard. Mister Crossroads was telling the truth—surprisingly—and the riverboat is currently moored in the bayou just a few miles north along the Marshwinder Road. When the characters make the trek, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>With each step, the muddy path becomes more treacherous and choked with foliage, but you finally hear your destination before you see it. Distant jazzy brass music fills the night air, almost in a greeting as you come to the edge of a mangrove-shrouded lake.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p11\"><em><strong>Moored at the center of this bayou is an enormous riverboat, glowing with vibrant neon colors and shimmering with the haunted visage of a ghost ship. Its sigil-etched paddle wheel is motionless, but the tall twin funnels belch magenta flame sporadically.</strong></em></p></blockquote><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_15_DROWN_Bayou%20Beast.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Any character who hasn’t earned passage aboard the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> doesn’t hear the music and only sees a wrecked and ruined riverboat split into two pieces, faded letters reading “LAUGH” on the portion of the hull still emerging from the black water. A character must return to the shack and retrieve a trinket to board the boat.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">A friendly <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Rx2bHyP6K3q4taKX]{Ferryman}</strong><span class=\"s13\">*</span> approaches in a coffin boat perfectly sized to fit all the characters. It is dressed as a chauffeur and has copper pieces in its eye sockets and one in the center of his forehead. It greets them on behalf of Mister Crossroads and offers them passage to the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Fated Tarot Reading.</strong></em> If <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> was pulled during the “Fated Tarot Reading” in chapter 9, the <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.E9n5vyzSl49xQCXC]{Cutlass of Briggsy Kratch}</em><span class=\"s8\">*</span> can be found glowing just below the surface of the bayou.</p></div>"

Interior areas have bright light from chandeliers and mirrored walls. All of these lights glow with vibrant neon colors and are fueled by burning soulfire that the Grinning Sinner has collected; a character who succeeds on a [[/check ARC DC 15]] or [[/check REL DC 15]] check realizes this.</p><p class=\"p14\"><strong>Music.</strong> Bright and upbeat jazz music plays throughout the entire riverboat, magically projecting from the band that plays in the Gambling Hall (see area B3). It is surprisingly catchy, no matter one’s musical tastes. Creatures who can hear the music have disadvantage on saving throws to maintain concentration.</p><p class=\"p14\"><strong>Jinxcraft Sigils. </strong>Every location has glowing jinxcraft sigils etched into the walls, floors, and ceilings that keep Snake Eye Jack imprisoned and use his spectral essence to fuel the operations of the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>. This fills the riverboat with his power over luck, both good and bad. Attack rolls score Critical Hits on a roll of 19 or 20, and they automatically miss on a roll of 1 or 2. This is cumulative with features such as a champion fighter’s Improved Critical (who would score Critical Hits on a roll of 18, 19, or 20).</p><p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s7\"><strong>Gamblers.</strong> Dozens of people from across Wickermoor Hollow and the rest of Druskenvald sit at casino tables, playing cards or dice or betting on enchanted horse figurines made to race, or they mingle at the ship’s well-stocked bar. They are all cursed—enthralled by the seductive power of the casino. They are Friendly and happily lead characters around and share their favorite games, but they know little about the ship or its campaign and direct them to ask the Undead casino staff (who they seem to think are still living people). Gamblers become Hostile to anyone who interferes in their games.</span></p><p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s10\"><strong>C</strong></span><strong>urse of the High Roller.</strong> When a character who isn’t yet cursed by the casino finishes a game of chance here, they must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 8]] saving throw or be cursed and have the &amp;reference[charmed apply=false] condition (by the Grinning Sinner). While Charmed in this way, they are enthralled and want nothing more but to gamble, drink, flirt with patrons, and otherwise keep enjoying the area of the casino they’re currently in. They can repeat this saving throw after 10 minutes, ending the effect on a success. A character who fails two of these repeat saves in a row becomes fully captivated, makes no more saving throws, and has Disadvantage on all D20 Tests made to harm the casino patrons or otherwise disrupt the convivial atmosphere of the riverboat while cursed. The curse is then permanent until broken by a <em>Remove Curse </em>spell or similar magic, or if the Grinning Sinner damages the character, forces them to make a saving throw, or dies.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/15-2_Dead_Mans_Hand.webp\" /></div>"

Undead laborers shuffle about, mending broken pipes, hauling crates, and carrying out the grim tasks required to keep this sinister casino running. Trapped within the boiler lies the tormented soul of Elias Greaves. Freeing him releases Elias from the Grinning Sinner’s grip, granting the characters a powerful advantage and cutting off the soul-fueled hexes that bind Snake Eye Jack, signaling Mister Crossroads’ inevitable downfall.</p><p class=\"p7\">However, the disruption immediately alerts the Sinner to the characters’ presence (see “Don’t Grieve for Greaves” below).</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Soulfire Boiler.</strong></em> This coffin-shaped, sigil-etched boiler is tended by a mighty spirit called the Soulfire Engineer (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWraith00000000]{Wraith}</strong>). She serves the Grinning Sinner by incanting jinxcraft hexes that eternally regenerate Elias’s soul to keep the magenta soulfire burning. She demands the characters leave if they enter the boiler room and attacks if they remain or retaliate. When initiative is rolled, the boiler belches forth 5 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSpecter0000000]{Specters}</strong> and a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.rAQGFdLEjXhY6W0Y]{Soulfire Stoker}</strong><span class=\"s13\">*</span>, and they join the fight.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Blasting Furnace.</strong></em> When combat breaks out here, the flames in the boiler blaze and belch out through the furnace doors and gaps in the plating. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), creatures in the room must make a [[/save DEX DC 13]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 2d6 fire]]{7 (2d6)} Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The Soulfire Engineer, stoker, and specters are immune to this effect.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Don’t Grieve for Greaves.</strong></em> When the last of the spirits is defeated, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The fiery spirit wails in fury and flares out, extinguishing the boiler’s magenta flames along with it.

When a character opens the boiler, the <em>Withered Hand</em><span class=\"s8\">*</span> tries to scurry up their body, jump into the boiler, and touch the mote. If it does so, it then runs back to Elias’s body, taking the soul with it. Once the soul and the body are reunited, neon light returns to Greaves’ eyes, and he can speak once more. If a character is attuned to the hand, this does not break the attunement.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\">He runs to meet the characters while they are still in the belly of the ship and wearily thanks the characters for freeing his soul.

He knows his own soul was able to power the boiler because he traveled aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> in life.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">With his soul running out of anima to drain for the boiler, his usefulness has been running out. Mister Crossroads plans to swap Adela’s soul into the boiler once she succumbs to the withering curse. Such a powerful soul would fuel the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> and Snake Eye Jack’s prison for all time.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Elias’s Gift.</strong></em> Elias’s soul is tattered and weary, and he wishes to depart so he can finally rest. As a parting gift, he casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{Death Ward}</em> on two characters. He apologizes that he can’t break the curse on his <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.aMP7nYdF7PHVFKFo]{Withered Hand}</em><span class=\"s8\">*</span> but entrusts it to the accursed character and hopes they can avoid his fate.</p><p class=\"p7\">He also hands over Adela Druskenvald’s wedding ring, which his hand had pickpocketed from Mister Crossroads and hid in Elias’s pocket for safekeeping before making its journey to the characters. He hopes that returning it will heal Adela. After a final farewell, the light in his eyes goes out, and his body collapses, finally at rest.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Alerting Mister Crossroads.</strong></em> The Grinning Sinner senses when his ship’s boiler goes cold.

Though Kehlenn’s influence has been severed from the land, her imprisonment within the Crooked Moon above did not put an end to her primeval power. The defeated archfey seeks her final revenge: the total destruction of the realm she once ruled. Her leering gaze settles on Wickermoor Hollow for the last time, awakening eight ancient beings of immense power to bring the moon crashing down upon Druskenvald, destroying everyone and everything within.</p><p>With Kehlenn’s defeat at the Crooked Tree, a fragile peace has settled over Wickermoor Hollow, but it is a peace born of fear and uncertainty. Even in the face of victory, the people of the valley have been forever changed by the horrors that have occurred over the past weeks and months. While many inhabitants of the valley may not know the events that occurred in the Wytchwood and how close the Horned King came to annihilating them, they all soon learn of the new doom descending from above.</p><p>The moon’s grin has curled into a sneer as it wakes eight eons-old powers still tethered to the land.

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap26 middle-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Moon is Falling</p><p>One terrible night, the Crooked Moon lets out a horrific shriek and speaks with Kehlenn’s voice, delivering a message that echoes across Wickermoor Hollow: the moon shall fall, and doom will come in thirteen nights. Slowly but surely, the moon begins to grow larger in the sky as it descends toward the valley.</p><p>The inhabitants of Wickermoor Hollow react in a variety of ways—some turn to panic, others to prayer, and surprisingly, many resign themselves to the end. However, most are too preoccupied with the destructive effects of the eight evils that have risen and the horrors they’ve unleashed upon the land. This development will stress or empower the relationships that the characters have nurtured during their time in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><h2>Impending Doom</h2><p>The characters must now hunt down these emerging evils, racing against time as each victory delays the moon’s fall—but not its inevitable approach. Further, every moment wasted allows the once-dormant threats to grow in power and cause mass destruction ahead of the impending apocalypse.</p><h3><strong>Countdown to Extinction</strong></h3><p>As soon as the Crooked Moon begins falling, it will crash into Wickermoor Hollow in exactly thirteen nights. If this occurs, the resulting collision and explosion of primordial energy annihilates the entirety of Druskenvald, including the characters if they are still within the realm when the moon makes impact. This ends the campaign.</p><p>Achieving Victory. The only way to prevent Druskenvald’s downfall is to kill all eight of the ancient evils bound to Wickermoor Hollow and reject Kehlenn’s final bargain. This returns the Crooked Moon to its rightful place in the sky and ensures that the Crooked Queen is powerless forever.</p><p>Tracking Time. As each of the thirteen nights progresses, keep track of how many nights are left before the inevitable collision. Clearly describe to the players that the moon is growing larger in the sky and its face is growing more menacing. Also, consider how the people of the valley act in the face of a seemingly inevitable death.</p><p>Delaying the Inevitable. Each time one of the ancient evils is slain, the descent of the moon stops for 24 hours. This means that if the characters continually kill the powerful enemies before them, they have a full twenty nights to stop the doom.</p><p>Turn Back Time. If you wish to give the characters additional time or believe they have earned help, the Vagrant arrives right before the collision and aids them. He plays a powerful song on his fiddle that turns back time 72 hours, buying the characters three additional nights. Due to the timeless nature of the ancient evils, any of them killed before or during this reverted time remain dead.</p><h3><strong>The Old Fears</strong></h3><p>Eight fearsome beings bound to the land of Wickermoor Hollow stir and rise to power, having felt the gaze of the Crooked Moon upon them.

Due to corruption at the highest levels of the town’s leadership, this headsman was falsely accused of murder, dragged through an unjust trial, and beheaded before the whole town. While its townsfolk exclaimed justice, the blood that spilled on the soil bound the centaur’s spirit to the fields. With the power of the Crooked Moon, the Galloping Headsman thunders through the farmland, seeking justice against his killers’ descendants, whipping them up in a frenzy of paranoia that spelled his doom so many years ago.</p><h2>Hysteria in Foxwillow</h2><p>The distrust sown by the secrets revealed during the Harvest Terror’s attack has boiled into all-out conflict, plunging the farming community into mass hysteria. A farmer from the town seeks out the characters and tells them that neighbor has turned against neighbor, and folks are being condemned to death by beheading. The executioner is rumored to be a spirit of fiery wrath that rides to meet each of the condemned, lops off their heads, and adds them to its collection.</p><h3><strong>Fields of Vengeance</strong></h3><p>The fertile farmland around Foxwillow—so easily corrupted by the demonic influence of Raum—craves vengeance and has come to life under the ghastly influence of the Galloping Headsman.</p><p><em><strong>Stone Pressing.</strong></em> The earth itself opens up, attempting to swallow the accused and crush them with the stones within. For every mile traveled, characters must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 17]] saving throw or fall into a sinkhole and be &amp;reference[restrained apply=false]. While restrained in this way, a character takes [[/damage 1d8 bludgeoning]]{4 (1d8)} bludgeoning damage at the start of each of their turns. A restrained character repeats the save at the end of each of their turns, freeing themself on a success.</p><p><em><strong>Choking Crops.</strong></em> The crops attempt to choke the life out of the wicked. The first time a character enters any field that bears crops, its roots, stalks, or vines attempt to strangle the character. They must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 17]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[grappled apply=false] for 1 minute (escape DC 15). While grappled in this way, the character gains 1 level of &amp;reference[exhaustion apply=false] at the end of each of their turns. A character that can't be charmed succeeds automatically. The crops have AC 5; 10 hit points; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning and psychic damage.</p><h3><strong>Mob Injustice</strong></h3><p>When the characters arrive at the Foxwillow Farmland, they find its people are hostile to them, accusing them of witchcraft, murder, sabotage, and of causing the incoming apocalypse. Some cunning townsfolk even attempt to act as friends to earn their trust before turning them over to frenzied mobs.</p><p><em><strong>Vengeful Wrath.</strong></em> The wrathful emotion of the Galloping Headsman spreads like a virulent plague. Whenever a character comes within 20 feet of a Foxwillow villager, the character must succeed on a [[/save CHA DC 17]] saving throw or lose the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. On a success, the character is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p><p><em><strong>Wandering Mob.</strong></em> Roving gangs of vigilantes hunt the characters in the hopes of capturing, imprisoning, trying, and executing them. Every 1 hour that the characters spend within 1 mile of the town center of Foxwillow, they must succeed on a group DC 17 Dexterity (Stealth) check or be detected and attacked by 20 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thugs}.</strong></p><h3><strong>All Hallows’ Evil</strong></h3><p>The emergence of the Galloping Headsman has twisted the Foxwillow farmland’s flora, fauna, and people, and it has awakened monstrous creatures with a burning vengeance:</p><p><em><strong>Vengeful Spirits.</strong></em> The Headsman has riled up the spirits of the dead that faced wrongful deaths and seek retribution.

They revere this being as an angel of judgment, punishing their town for the wickedness of their neighbors. The characters must learn where they can find this spirit to put an end to the mass hysteria.</p><p><em><strong>Tarnished History.</strong></em> The characters can investigate Foxwillow to learn about the village’s dark past. If the characters succeed on a group [[/check HIS DC 17]] or [[/check INV DC 17]] check, they learn the headsman’s story and that he was beheaded before the covered bridge to the east of town toward the edge of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p><em><strong>Bloody Trail.</strong></em> The characters can tail a mob as it dispenses its “justice” or even infiltrate its ranks with a successful group [[/check STE DC 17]] or [[/check DEC DC 17]] check to witness the attempted execution of a falsely accused villager.</p><h3><strong>The Headless Horseman</strong></h3><p>Characters who arrive at the covered bridge can lure out the vengeful spirit with the offering of the execution of a Foxwillow local or by inciting its warped sense of justice. <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.jsMSxEGRbXiyBrvJ]{The Galloping Headsman}</strong>* rides out from the darkness of the bridge’s cover and charges the characters, seeking to behead them all and slake its never-ending thirst for vengeance.</p><p><em><strong>Reckoning’s End.</strong></em> With the Galloping Headsman’s destruction, the town is freed from his oppressive judgment.

It once wandered the remote peaks of the Howlers, the mountain chain that makes up the western border of Wickermoor Hollow, following the rune stones of its creator after the creature lost all contact. As the centuries passed, its long, heavy strides became more of a struggle, and it grew weary from its aimlessness. And so, it slumbered until the Crooked Moon instilled the beast with primal fury, the very essence of its creation.

Otherwise, it is content to suffuse the land with its power of the end of things. The only way to face, battle, and kill the beast is to confront the spirit of Rowan atop the volcanic mound and draw her ire. Only then will she lose her sense and draw the beast forward to attempt to destroy the characters. However, it requires particular information to provoke the spirit enough to initiate the final battle.</p><p><em><strong>Final Folklore.</strong></em> The last hope of Wickermoor Hollow may be the local legends kept alive by those who adhere to the Old Ways. By seeking these stories from those knowledgeable of the valley’s lore and succeeding on a group [[/check PER DC 20]] or [[/check ITM DC 20]] check, the characters can learn the truth of Rowan. She was a malevolent maiden who sought apocalypse, and her fiendish dabbling made her the prime candidate for Kehlenn’s first sacrifice. By appealing to the innocent maiden she once was, the characters who condemn her for her wickedness and how much she had fallen will turn the spirit to rage.</p><p><em><strong>Family Ties.</strong></em> The only person Rowan cared for was her sister, whose descendant still lives in Wickermoor Village. By scouring any records for Rowan or her family and succeeding on a group [[/check ARC DC 20]] or [[/check HIS DC 20]] check, the characters discover which townsfolk is her sister’s descendant and use this knowledge against her. By appealing to the love of her family she once had, the specter's conflicted feelings will boil into a vengeful wrath.</p><h3><strong>The Number of the Beast</strong></h3><p>When the characters ascend the ruins of Rowan’s Rise and face the shimmering maiden at the center of the bursting brimstone, her wrath is as fiery as the doom she has brought to the valley. With a cry to the moon above and the hellfire below, she heralds the apocalypse. <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Xx2E0pzymhXavH3H]{The Brimstone Behemoth}</strong>* erupts from the sulfuric lava with an earth-shattering bellow and seeks to annihilate the characters and Druskenvald along with them.</p><p><em><strong>To the Farrows and Fields.</strong></em> When the Brimstone Behemoth is destroyed, it explodes in a catastrophic burst of stinking lava that pours down upon Wickermoor Hollow. The lava instantly cools and hardens, forming countless scars upon the landscape. In time, they will provide nutrient-rich soil for a new age of fertility and regrowth.</p><p>Rowan’s spirit calms, and she has a final moment of clarity, apologizing to the characters for everything she brought to pass before fading forever. With no champions remaining, the Crooked Moon gazes upon the characters themselves.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Improvement.</strong></em> When the characters destroy the Brimstone Behemoth, they increase one of their ability scores by 4 or two of their ability scores by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Fabled Heirloom.</strong></em> The <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.YSwHE4AdiHvITluu]{Hide of the Brimstone Behemoth}</em>* remains in the hardening lava after the colossus explodes.</p></div>"

Her last chance for revenge is to convince the characters to accept the power of remaking Druskenvald, which would obliterate all those within and allow them to create a new realm.

The missing time could be a short interval—mere days or weeks gone from your memory—or you might have only vague hints at best of who you are and where you are from. Flashes of déjà vu are common, taunting you with recollection, but they almost always slip away, as ungraspable as the mists of Druskenvald. An injury, some traumatic experience, or the magical workings of a spell or curse could be the culprit behind your amnesia.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Feat:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.hWzzM9A425JVH7lL]{Memory Starved}</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> <em>Choose two</em> (see below)</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Tool Proficiency:</strong> <em>Choose one</em> (see below)</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Equipment:</strong> <em>Choose A or B:</em> (A) book (personal notes), ink, ink pen, traveler’s clothes, 11 gp; or (B) 50 gp</p><h3>Scattered Memories</h3><p class=\"p2\">You don’t choose skill proficiencies or a tool proficiency when you select this background, and you don’t choose any languages other than Common during character creation—these are parts of your past that you are missing. Instead, you can pick one of those proficiencies or languages during play at any time. The knowledge might return in a spontaneous flash, even as you make a roll that relies on the proficiency, or slowly emerge as you struggle to solve a problem. Once you choose one of these features, you can’t choose another one until you gain a level.</p><p class=\"p5\">The GM might rule that you can choose a new recalled feature early if something reminds you of your past, such as finding a piece of evidence from your missing memories or experiencing an event similar to one you have forgotten. Of particular value is an event relating to one of the story threads or trinkets presented below.</p><h3>Building an Amnesiac</h3><p class=\"p2\">Any character can face misfortune or a choice that steals their memory. Consider how your character came to lose their memory. Was it lost through injury or illness, or did something more sinister steal it with a toxin or curse? You might decide to leave this choice up to the GM, letting you as a player discover the cause alongside your character.</p><p class=\"p5\"><em><strong>Suggested Story Threads.</strong></em> This background presents a paradox when considering threads to weave through a campaign, since the character may not remember them. Work with the GM to create some leading events or people that can serve as constants to trace a path through the void of the character’s past, especially if the GM can insert existing nonplayer characters into the thread to strengthen these connections.

In the rules to do so below, “you” refers to the character crafting the potion.</p><p class=\"p3\"><em><strong>Cost.</strong></em> Adding the Heightened Potency property to a potion you’re creating or to an existing potion requires extra materials, as shown in the Heightened Brewing table, beyond the cost for a normal potion of its rarity.</p><p class=\"p3\"><em><strong>Time and Ability Check.</strong></em> Creating a potion with the Heightened Potency property takes the normal time for its rarity. Adding the Heightened Potency property to an existing potion takes 1 hour of work using alchemist’s supplies or an herbalism kit. After the work time, make an Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check with a DC determined by the potion’s rarity on the Heightened Brewing table. On a success, you create the potion without issue. On a failure, you roll 1d6 on the Potion Quirks table, then decide whether to create a potion that has the indicated quirk or discard all materials.</p><h4><em><strong>Heightened Brewing</strong></em></h4><p class=\"p10\"> </p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th>Base Potion Rarity</th><th>DC</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common</td><td>10</td><td>10 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon</td><td>15</td><td>50 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Rare</td><td>20</td><td>500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Very Rare</td><td>25</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary</td><td>30</td><td>25,000 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=\"p5\"><em><strong>Potion Quirks</strong></em></p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><thead><tr><th>D6</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Cracked Bottles.</strong> Spend twice the normal heightened brewing cost.

From the depths of what was once Glitterdeep Mine, rich with veins of gold, silver, and iron, the contamination spreads. Seventy years ago, a suspicious cave-in occurred, and the few rescuers who returned spoke of terrors before they condemned the mine, leaving it abandoned.</p><p>Now called Skitterdeep Mine after its many-legged inhabitants, it is mentioned only in hushed tones, with wary glances over shoulders in fear of the crawling minions and the hag rumored to have brought ruin upon its darkened tunnels.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>A trio of ancient hags known as the Vermintoll Coven has long wrought their wicked magic upon the fields, forests, and villages of Wickermoor Hollow. Seventy years ago, the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger corrupted Skitterdeep Mine—a once thriving source of precious ores.</p><p>Using illusion, hearty food, and strong drink, she wormed her way into the miners’ trust. Then, she poisoned and twisted them all into grotesque abominations and collapsed the tunnels, trapping the wretched souls within. A cadre of knights attempted a rescue, but they too fell to Stonoga’s influence as she warped their flesh to create new minions.</p><p>Over the years, fear and superstition shrouded the Skitterdeep Mine. Travelers still vanish near its entrance, taken as material for her pestilent experiments. The infestation has now spread beyond the mine, skittering throughout the walls, beneath the earth, and within the bodies of Wickermoor Village.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Wickermoor Hollow is infested with countless centipedes that devour foodstuffs, spread disease, and even burrow into the bodies of the townsfolk. The source of the infestation is the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger, who seeks a new supply of human flesh for her twisted experiments deep within her abandoned mine. With each passing night, the vermin that have taken over town claim more victims and devour more food stores, threatening widespread death and famine. Characters drawn to the mine by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p>Discover and trace the source of the tunneling vermin to Skitterdeep Mine, and face the horrors within.</p></li><li><p>Destroy Stonoga Blackstinger and end the Skitter Plague.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger, the key NPC. Review the Quest Hooks to provide a compelling reason for the characters to venture to the abandoned mine. Finally, read through the locations of Skitterdeep Mine so you are ready to improvise encounters as the characters explore.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 7th level characters.</p></div>"

Her unnaturally tall and lanky body has morphed over the years to more closely resemble the centipedes she favors, losing her nose and most of her toes and stretching her neck out by several feet.</p><p>Just as it was her sister Vessla’s role in the coven to twist souls in preparation for sacrifice to the Crooked Queen, Stonoga is tasked with corrupting bodies. She cares not for the matters of mind and spirit, as all life to her is simply meat to be molded beneath her jagged fingers. But despite this, she has a jovial disposition, taking glee in savoring the suffering of her victims.</p><p>Unlike her sisters, she prefers to hide away in the deepest, darkest holes in the earth where she can be embraced by the squirming swarms of her beloved centipedes. It is in these places that never see the light of the moon where she conducts her alchemy, witchcraft, and fleshcrafting.</p><p>Stonoga has been waiting for the night that her younger sister Vessla is slain, a moment foreseen and deemed a necessary sacrifice by her older sister Golub. The two older hags conspired to allow the weasel hag to be butchered in the Crooked House, but Stonoga has no idea that she herself was deceived. Golub Graygullet believed the middle sister needed to die too, as whispered by the Crooked Queen with the promise of being elevated within the inevitable crooked court of Kehlenn.

The familiar of Stonoga Blackstinger, he shares his mistress’s glee in the horrid reshaping of flesh into new forms. He can command the squirming hordes of centipedes that crawl throughout Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>Rather than being a collector of body parts like his weasel counterpart Filthy Jasper, Oswald prefers to create grotesque homes out of his master's victims. He burrows deep into Humanoid carcasses and rearranges the rotting innards to his liking, often lurking within for weeks at a time. Sometimes, he even digs into a healthy person to corrupt and prime their body for flesh shaping while they still live.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto 1em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter16_Plague.webp\" alt=\"\" /></div></div>"

The sick only have a few nights to live before succumbing to the affliction. A solution must be found before it’s too late.</p><h2>Infestation</h2><p>The village is infested with thousands of centipedes sent by Stonoga Blackstinger. These vermin consume food stores, burrow into the flesh of the living, and spread a magical contagion that afflicts those bitten by the creatures (see “Skitter Plague” below).</p><p>After the characters finish a long rest in Wickermoor Village, four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.wTFFZ0NBnE3NKN4e]{Skitterswarms}</strong>* emerge from the walls and floor of wherever they are staying and attack. Creatures hit by the swarms’ attacks must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw or be afflicted with Skitter Plague. Dozens of small mundane centipedes crawl throughout the floorboards as well.</p><p>When the characters step out into the streets of Wickermoor Village after dispatching the skitterswarms, many people are gathered here having fled their homes from centipede infestations. When asked about what’s going on, the plight is consistent across the townsfolk’s stories:</p><ul><li><p>They awoke with dozens of centipedes crawling in their beds, many having been bitten.</p></li><li><p>Their stored food is infested with centipedes, and much of it has been eaten.</p></li><li><p>Some larger, more grotesque, and especially vicious centipedes have dug into certain people’s skin.</p></li><li><p>People quickly started falling ill, coming down with fever, breaking out into mauve-colored pustules, and vomiting black bile.</p></li></ul><p>Over the next few hours, ten more villagers succumb to the unknown malady, all with similar stories. If nothing is done, the Skitter Plague will become an epidemic.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Skitter Plague</strong></h3><p><em><strong>Magical Disease</strong></em></p><p>Skitter Plague was created by the hag Stonoga Blackstinger, and it spreads through the bites of her grotesque centipedes, ignoring disease immunity. A creature bitten by any centipede under Stonoga’s control must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 12]] saving throw or suffer the following effects [[/r 1d4]] hours after infection:</p><p><strong>Fever. </strong>The creature gains level of &amp;reference[exhaustion apply=false] that can’t be removed until the contagion ends on the creature.</p><p><strong>Crawling Blisters.</strong> Blisters that feel like crawling centipedes form on the creature’s skin. When the creature finishes a long rest, it takes [[/damage 1d4 necrotic]]{2 (1d4)} necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction can’t be removed until the contagion ends on the creature. A Humanoid that dies from this contagion explodes into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.wTFFZ0NBnE3NKN4e]{Skitterswarm}</strong>* at the next Midnight Hour, the corpse’s flesh and bones turning into a malleable putty-like substance that can be split apart and carried by centipedes back to Skitterdeep Mine.</p><hr /><p><em><strong>Fighting the Plague.</strong></em> A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}</em> spell suppresses the effect of the contagion for 24 hours. Nightly at the Twilight Hour, an infected creature makes a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the plague ends for it.</p><h2><strong>Trail of Corruption</strong></h2><p>The characters can investigate the town to find where the centipedes are coming from by succeeding on a group [[/check INV DC 15]] or [[/check SUR DC 15]] check, discovering a sprawling network of tiny tunnels in the earth that seem to be coming from the northwest of Wickermoor Village.</p><p>After deducing the direction from which the centipedes are burrowing into town, the characters are approached by Mrs. Oakum (see chapter 11), who works for Siv Harga at the butcher shop. She tells the characters that the centipede infestation perfectly matched stories that her father used to tell her about the old abandoned mine in the wooded hills northwest of Wickermoor Village. Use the details below to guide the conversation with her:</p><ul><li><p>Her family used to live in a small community of hill-folk that worked in mining, logging, and trapping.</p></li><li><p>Decades ago, the old Glitterdeep Mine had a terrible cave-in that trapped dozens of miners within.</p></li><li><p>Thousands of huge, monstrous centipedes were seen skittering in the hills and into the mine.</p></li><li><p>A large rescue party was organized, but those who went into the mine never returned.</p></li><li><p>The rumor among the community was that it was a hag that caused the tragedy.</p></li><li><p>Swearing vengeance, a posse of riders was rallied to kill the hag and her minions, but they were never heard from again.</p></li><li><p>Fear of vile magic and the loss of work in the mine caused the community to dwindle.</p></li><li><p>Folks who know the old story have called the abandoned mine Skitterdeep for years.</p></li></ul><p>Mrs. Oakum offers to guide the characters through the hills but says she won’t get too close to the mine, fearing the hag that lurks in the depths. If the characters accept her help, the journey to the mine is the ideal opportunity to have her true identity as a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.7tRhrxuknTpHpYcA]{Werewolf}</strong> be revealed through an inadvertent transformation, whether it be through danger that the characters experience or hunger triggered by a forest creature.</p><p>If the characters don’t take it upon themselves to investigate the mine, Morgan the apothecary (see chapter 11) requests their assistance. They stress that if nothing is done, the sickness will overwhelm the town, and there will not be enough healers to tend to the ill—made worse by the indifference of the de facto surgeon Randall Graham, who believes the situation will resolve itself without taking drastic action. If necessary, Morgan offers the characters a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of Healing}</em> (greater) each to find the cause of the sickness and eliminate it.</p><p>Characters who monitor the health of afflicted villagers over the course of the night, or Morgan the apothecary if the characters don’t think to, realize that the illness is likely fatal over the course of several nights.</p><h2>Sisterly “Love”</h2><p>If the characters are not in Wickermoor Village when you wish to initiate the events of this chapter, a carrier pigeon finds them wherever they are, delivering a letter from postmaster Theodora Mayville. She informs them of the town’s infestation and her own suspicion that the centipedes were coming from Skitterdeep Mine.</p><p>She claims that she sent out a rider, who normally delivers large parcels, to investigate the mine, but he never returned. Theodora implores the characters to head to the mine themselves and put an end to the infestation, offering [[/award 50gp]] to each character once the plague is halted.</p><p>This is a ruse by Golub Graygullet (see chapter 8) to lure the characters into finding and killing her sister Stonoga as a sacrifice in honor of the Crooked Queen. If the characters follow this quest hook, they are confronted by a lone <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.80MeeiJWRBHrLuCR]{Fleshdobbin}</strong>* when they are three miles out from the mine—the flesh-crafted parcel rider that Theodora had sent to his doom.</p></div>"

He raises crooked arms to a Crooked Tree at the edge of midnight and hears the whispers of the Old Ones.</em></p><p class=\"p2\"><em>They speak of a beast that stalks the darkest woods and darkest hearts, a crown of horns upon its head. If you lose your way and feel a warm breath that chills you to the bone, run.</em></p><p class=\"p2\"><em>Follow the songs of harvest time, and before long, you’ll find revelry in the dancing shadows of blazing wicker.

Whether you are taking up the mantle of the Game Master (GM) or facing the terrors that await you as a Player, this book offers the guidance to make your tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) experience an unforgettably dreadful folktale. <em>The Crooked Moon </em>consists of three parts:</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Part 1.</strong> Chapters 1–7 feature an overview of the setting of Druskenvald, including its thirteen major provinces, and they provide the player options needed to create thematic and compelling characters either hailing from or destined to this realm of eternal night.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Part 2.</strong> Chapters 8–26 contain a robust and thrilling Folk Horror adventure campaign in which a group of wayward souls becomes stranded in the isolated valley of Wickermoor Hollow and must contend with the malign machinations and minions of the Crooked Queen, taking the characters from level 1 to 14 (and optionally all the way to level 20).</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Part 3.</strong> The appendices provide additional options for GMs to enhance the horror in their games with folkloric monsters, eerie magic items, and a table of Chaotic Curses.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">What Is Folk Horror?</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_weird%20bird.webp\" width=\"100\" /><p class=\"p2\">Despite being so deeply rooted in tradition and old superstition, the term “Folk Horror” is a surprisingly new articulation to describe a nebulously defined genre with a wide variety of media under its umbrella. <em>The Crooked Moon</em> looks to the work of writer and filmmaker Adam Scovell to help define Folk Horror and guide its influence throughout the book.</p><p class=\"p4\">A work of Folk Horror might be one that utilizes folklore to instill a sense of uncanny dread (such as the 2015 film <em>The Witch</em>), presents the clash between the archaic and the modern (such as the 1973 film <em>The Wicker Man</em>), or creates its own folklore by weaving various elements of a culture’s collective consciousness (such as the 2024 series <em>Over the Garden Wall</em>). However, Scovell’s framework of the “Folk Horror Chain” unifies these archetypes and more into a broad but consistent definition.</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Folk Horror Chain</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">To determine what constitutes a Folk Horror story, Adam Scovell denotes four key narrative, thematic, or aesthetic aspects of a work that form a cause-and-effect series of “links” in a chain:</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Landscape.</strong> The first link is the prominence of the landscape or environment, often becoming a living, breathing character of its own. These stories most often take place in rural locations and commonly focus on nature or agriculture. Most importantly, these remote landscapes isolate the characters and communities within them.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Isolation.</strong> The people in these remote environments are cut off from the prevailing society and standard trappings of civilization. Whether a group of several characters or a small community, the folk of these stories find themselves separated from society physically, and most importantly, outside of its dominant ideologies and beliefs. The main action of many Folk Horror stories is initiated by outsiders, often representing modernity or urbanity, interloping into these communities.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Skewed Morality.</strong> In these stories, the isolated communities and groups develop skewed belief systems, often manifesting in an adherence to ancient superstitions, the practice of the occult, or a hostile rejection of the morals of society at large. This strange and warped morality inevitably leads to a horrific action and the final link in the chain.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>The Happening.</strong> Generally, at the climax of these stories, the skewed morality of the isolated groups living in remote landscapes manifests a supernatural or violent happening. This dreadful event might take the form of the summoning of an otherworldly entity, a ritual sacrifice, a demonic or ghostly possession, a bloody murder, or some other act of killing or occultism.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>The Chain in Practice</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">When defined in this way, Folk Horror is a broad but thematically consistent genre that can include works from any narrative medium, time period, or global culture. The chain encompasses archetypical Folk Horror stories such as the 2019 film <em>Midsommar</em>, as well as unexpected examples like the 1974 film <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre </em>and even genre-bending works like the 2007 film <em>Hot Fuzz</em>.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">While <em>The Crooked Moon</em> leans heavily upon the aesthetics, tropes, archetypes, and plot threads found in quintessential examples of Folk Horror, this book also draws inspiration from the wide umbrella of works encompassed by the Folk Horror Chain, as well as elements of other horror sub-genres such as Gothic Horror, Body Horror, Cosmic Horror, and more. You are encouraged to weave your own inspirations into your campaigns and characters to achieve a cooperative horror story best suited for your table.</span></p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/032_Crooked_Moon_DM_Screen.webp\" /><h2><span class=\"s1\">Folk Horror in Your Game</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Horror as a genre has a notorious reputation for being difficult to execute in a game of heroic fantasy. The goal of this book is to provide as many tools as possible for you to achieve the appropriate level of dread in your game, but there are many additional factors to be mindful of when setting off to weave a dreadful folktale with your friends.</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Aligning on Goals</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Rat.webp\" width=\"100\" /><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s3\">One of the biggest sources of friction between people at a table is a misalignment of what everyone is hoping to achieve in the game. This is especially true when it comes to horror. Some players may want a deeply serious Folk Horror story where the tone and tension is maintained by all at the table. Others may be interested in a more goofy, spooky flavor of horror with plenty of jokes. Certain gamers may prefer to focus on engaging with mechanics and striving for tactically and strategically optimal play.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">These styles of play—and many others—are valid, but if there is a misunderstanding between players and clashing goals, this can lead to interpersonal conflict and soured sessions. Before you begin a campaign that draws from The Crooked Moon, your group should meet for a “Session Zero” to discuss each player’s goals for the game and strive to seek full alignment before the first session so that the game runs smoothly and is as fun as possible for all involved.</p><h3><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Creating Compelling Characters</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">The quality of a Folk Horror story is inextricably tied to the “folk” that feature in it. A story driven by compelling, multi-dimensional, and thematic characters can elevate a fun game of roleplaying into a deeply moving experience you and your friends will remember for the rest of your lives. The adventure campaign included in this book provides a large cast of memorable NPCs, but the most important characters of the story are the protagonists piloted by the players. Below is guidance to create and roleplay unforgettable Player Characters:</p><p class=\"p5\">Collaborate. The character creation process should be a collaborative experience between the players and the GM. Through working together, bouncing ideas back and forth, and iterating on initial concepts, the Player Characters that emerge from the process will be compelling and well-balanced, both thematically and mechanically, and the GM will be well equipped to incorporate character-specific elements into the adventure.</p><p class=\"p5\">Prioritize Theme. The key to an exceptional character is a foundation based on theme first and foremost. Instead of starting with the mechanics of the character sheet, consider what theme you want to exhibit in a Folk Horror story, both aesthetically and narratively. Don’t be afraid to leverage classic archetypes and tropes in fiction and borrow heavily from your favorite characters from various media. This will equip you with plenty of inspiration and ammunition to play a thematically rich and consistent character.</p><p class=\"p5\">Inhabit Your Character. Creating a compelling backstory for your character is useful, but far more important is knowing who they are. Remember that your character is a real person in an imaginary world and not just a collection of statistics, traits, and abilities. If you strive to understand who they are, you will be better equipped to roleplay a wholly realized and multi-faceted character and will know how they would react to any scenario. To help discover who your character is, answer the following questions:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p6\">What are your character’s defining personality traits?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">What ideals drive your character forward?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">What are your character’s flaws?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">What does your character fear and desire most?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">Which archetype best applies to your character?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">How has your character’s past shaped them?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\">How would you describe your character without mentioning what they do, what they have, or what they look like?</p></li><li><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\">Are there any aspects of your character that are superfluous to the answers to the above questions or are thematically unfitting for a Folk Horror adventure?</span></p></li></ul><h2><span class=\"s1\">Onward to Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">You are now prepared to venture through the Shroud aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> and face the terrors that await you in Druskenvald. Nothing in this book is meant to be prescriptive, and you are encouraged to use its contents in whatever way works best for you and your table. With <em>The Crooked Moon</em> as your guide, you are well-equipped to craft an unforgettable and haunting Folk Horror story with your friends.</p><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:6px;bottom:6px;left:6px;right:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:relative;z-index:3\"><h4><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Comfort and Safety</strong></span></span></h4><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">Many of the themes and topics core to Folk Horror can be deeply distressing for some. While the most disturbing elements of the genre have been greatly diminished, much of the content within The Crooked Moon deals with serious and potentially unsettling themes that should be considered with care and caution to ensure the comfort and safety of everyone at the table. To achieve this, be sure to approach the following topics during your group's Session Zero:</span></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Content Warnings.</strong> The Crooked Moon contains elements of graphic and gory violence, depictions of mental health issues, cultural and religious conflict, endangerment of children and animals, grotesque body horror, family trauma, allusions to suicide, and more. Ensure that all players are aware of what awaits them so you can gauge everyone's comfort levels.</span></span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Establishing Boundaries.</strong> Solicit the themes and topics that each player does not wish to engage with in the game. Once established, these boundaries should always be honored and considered hard lines that are never crossed.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Safety Tools.</strong> Utilize safety tools that are understood by everyone at the table, empowering players to safely flag when they're uncomfortable without judgment and enabling the GM to change topic, pause the scene, fade to black, or otherwise steer the game away from the source of discomfort.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Regular Check-Ins.</strong> Make sure that all players check in regularly to gauge ongoing comfort levels and establish open and active communication to ensure that everyone feels heard.</span></p></div></div>"

Though slain one by one, the Vermintoll Coven has returned, reborn with the malignant power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen. Despite their hatred for one another, the three vile hags have been fused together as one horrific abomination. They now twist the potent dreams of the clairvoyant Adela Druskenvald to fulfill her foretold fate. The house cannot be cleansed and must be destroyed along with the coven to bring the terrors to an end.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>With the destruction of the Fallen and the sacrifice of the Lord of Fools, the next step of the prophesized ritual to turn the Horned King to flesh and free the Crooked Queen from her prison is the sacrifice of Adela Druskenvald. However, her inevitable burning in the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise can only occur once her body, mind, and soul have been prepared.</p><p>These preparations were the wicked purpose of the Vermintoll Coven before they were slaughtered. However, their malefic spirits lingered, and Kehlenn returned them to abominable life to utilize their twisted magic one last time. Now, they have pulled Adela Druskenvald’s prophetic dreams into the Crooked House, weaving them with Kehlenn’s primeval power deep in the earth below to turn the entire home into a waking nightmare that has shattered reality itself.</p><p>After watching the characters throughout their trials and tribulations in Wickermoor Hollow, the Crooked Man waits for them inside his old home in hopes of adding more sacrifices to the pyre. He knows he will be given a new body just like his Horned King. The night has come for him to incarnate as the Wicker Man, and he only need delay the would-be heroes a little longer.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>The Crooked House has reawakened with the rebirth of the Vermintoll Coven in their new amalgamative form. The Crooked Man has trapped the Druskenvalds—once again—and the Jenkins within the house. Characters who enter the nightmare have these goals:</p><ul><li><p>Approach Druskenvald Manor and ensure the safety of Dani Jenkin.</p></li><li><p>Enter the Crooked House, confront the Crooked Man, and witness it shatter into the Crooked Nightmare.</p></li><li><p>Venture through the horrific dreamscapes, rescuing Walter Jenkin, Gilly Jenkin, and Phillip Druskenvald along the way.</p></li><li><p>Confront the hags of the Vermintoll Coven in the attic of the Crooked House and destroy the Coven Abomination.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, refresh yourself on the major NPCs, all of which the characters have previously encountered: the Druskenvalds, the Jenkin family, the Vermintoll Coven, and the Crooked Man. Read through the locations and dreamscapes of the Crooked Nightmare to better improvise each encounter.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 11th level characters.</p></div>"

A successful [[/check INS DC 15]] check makes it clear that she is enchanted by the fallen star.

A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it takes damage, or at the start of its turns while it can’t see the meteorite, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>Characters who speak Deep Speech can puzzle out that the whispers are inviting them on a trip through the stars to realms beyond comprehension, but such a voyage requires leaving their bodies behind.

He is terrified and clutches his head in agony. On initiative count 0 (losing initiative ties) on the 10th round, Walter drowns in the liquor.</p><p>Only Walter can save himself, but he can’t do it alone. He can be snapped out of his nightmare-induced powerlessness by appealing to the most defining aspect of his personality: his sense of loyalty. This can be accomplished through encouragement or by him seeing those he cares about in grave danger. He starts with loyalty 0, and he gains loyalty when any of the following occur:</p><p><strong>Rally (Gain 1 Loyalty).</strong> An attack made against Wisp scores a Critical hit.</p><p><strong>Resolve (Gain 1 Loyalty).</strong> An attack against a character scores a critical hit, or a character fails a saving throw Wisp forced.</p><p><strong>Victory (Gain 3 Loyalty).</strong> Wisp is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p><strong>Encourage (Gain 1 Loyalty).</strong> As an action, a character succeeds on a DC 20 ability check using one of these approaches, or any other that you deem appropriate:</p><ul><li><p>[[/check DEC DC 20]]{Charisma (Deception)} to distract Wisp from unleashing more mental torture.</p></li><li><p>[[/check PER DC 20]]{Charisma (Persuasion)} or [[/check INT DC 20]]{Charisma (Intimidation)} to inspire him to block out the verbal abuse or to pull himself together.</p></li><li><p>[[/check HIS DC 20]]{Intelligence (History)} or [[/check NAT DC 20]]{ Intelligence(Nature)} to use logic to help Walter realize that the nightmare is full of lies.</p></li></ul><p>When his loyalty reaches 6, Walter snaps himself out of his tortured inaction.

Prosperity and riches of all varieties come easy to the free folk who call the lawless swamp town on stilts home. But the misfortune that follows comes just as easily, the sinister cost of the deals made with Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner—a crocodilian gambler and magician.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>The treacherous swamp known as the Drowned Crossroads sits at the lowest point of Wickermoor Hollow. The people of the stilt-town of Murkwater Bend favor freedom and vice, enjoying the natural separation from the strict laws and social customs that govern the valley’s other regions.</p><p>Years ago, a sudden strike of prosperity came to Murkwater Bend, with gold flowing freely and luck seemingly being on the side of the swamp-folk. People came from all over Wickermoor Hollow in hopes of finding their own fortune in the bayou.</p><p>But luck doesn’t hold out forever, and the good times were not meant to last. In recent years, the people of Murkwater Bend have been struck with terrible misfortunes, and some whisper of the whole swamp being jinxed. Instances of accidents, disease, and financial ruin have increased dramatically, with no end to the bad luck in sight.</p><p>Even worse, the hex has brought the Drowned Crossroads to unnatural life, with the swamp itself rising up to drag unsuspecting travelers into its murky depths. In the Midnight Hour, haunting brass music can be heard throughout the mire, and the distant lights of a ghastly riverboat drift through the gloom, always just out of reach.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Murkwater Bend is jinxed, and its people are being swindled into bad deals that cost them their very souls. Characters drawn to the town by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p>Find a cure for Adela Druskenvald, whose hand is afflicted with a withering hex.</p></li><li><p>Discover the source of the town’s misfortune by treating with Vander Boone.</p></li><li><p>Brave the Drowned Crossroads to find Mister Crossroads, then make a bargain with him or purchase his wares to earn passage aboard the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> riverboat.</p></li><li><p>Disrupt the soul-powered boiler in the riverboat’s Boiler Room.</p></li><li><p>Destroy Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Mister Crossroads, the key NPC, to weave his sly malevolence throughout. Study the rules to Liar’s Dice (see “Test of Luck” later in the chapter) to efficiently oversee tense games of chance. Carefully read through the list of Dark Bargains*, Cursed Curios*, Paranormal Potions*, and Familiars* to make the meeting with Mister Crossroads in his Sinner’s shack as enticing as possible. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “Bayou Boogie,” ensures a thrilling final encounter filled with twists and turns.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 6th level characters.</p></div>"

The crocodile-folk himself was only able to survive through the fate-bending power of his patron, an ancient death spirit known as Snake Eye Jack. Leaving the sea behind, he found himself bouncing between bounty hunts and other dangerous jobs armed with his patron’s jinxcraft and the sigil-etched cutlass that once gave him his piratical moniker.</p><p>In time, he made a home in the swamp, known as the Drowned Crossroads, feeling at ease around the scoundrels that lurked within. The rogues of the swamp did not care for the crocodile man, and the common folk of the bayou feared his strange magic and garishly hexed sword. They even coined ugly legends about him that claimed he devoured children and stole souls.</p><p>Work dried up, attempted cons and thievery failed, and Briggsy found himself penniless, purposeless, and reviled. This potent cocktail of isolation, resentment, and bad luck made him deeply resent his patron, believing that Snake Eye Jack had turned his back on Briggsy despite the years of service. Through the bitterness, the cunning croc-folk came up with a plan.</p><p>One night at the Midnight Hour, Briggsy rowed into the bayou and tossed his hexed cutlass overboard at the exact point where the two ancient roads had once crossed centuries ago. This offering summoned Snake Eye Jack, a many-armed man of shadow and bone with serpents’ eyes glowing a neon green and pink. Briggsy challenged his patron to a game of dice, making an offer the death spirit could not refuse.</p><p>The pair diced all night, and through Briggsy’s guile and treachery, he beat Snake Eye Jack and bound him in a hexed coffin. Claiming the full power of his former patron for himself, the croc-folk became a master of misfortune and jinxcraft, conjuring forth a magical blunderbuss with his new abilities. However, the cost was great. His body rotted as if he had been dead for weeks, and his left arm withered to bone.</p><p>Briggsy didn't mind. He moved into an abandoned shack on stilts at the heart of the swamp and decided to become what the people of Murkwater Bend believed him to be: the bogeyman of the Drowned Crossroads.</p><h2>Heart’s Desire</h2><p>From then on, Briggsy called himself Mister Crossroads, but many of the folk who called upon him for favors and charms dubbed him the Grinning Sinner after his crocodile smile and tricksy magic. People of the swamp come to Mister Crossroads for simple jinxes and curses, but the croc-folk’s favorite “associates” are the truly desperate.</p><p>He makes deals with these unfortunate souls, whether they're someone trying to escape a hell of their own making or in search of their wildest dreams. Shortly after sealing the pact through a signed contract or a simple handshake, the luck of the new victim would turn around, and they would get exactly what Mister Crossroads promised.</p><p>But the Grinning Sinner is clever, and there are always loopholes in every deal. After weeks, months, or even years, the luck runs out, and the joy and fortune granted by the jinxcraft turns to ash. Eventually, each and every one of them experiences a terrible misfortune that costs them their life and grants their soul to Mister Crossroads, which he uses to fuel the soul-binding magic that keeps Snake Eye Jack bound within his hexed coffin. As added insult, their lifeless corpse rises as an Undead thrall to join his crew of the damned.</p><h2>Captain of the Damned</h2><p>When Mister Crossroads isn't making deals in his swamp shack, he captains the opulent <em>Dead Man’s Hand </em>riverboat, which thrums with his jinxcraft power. Acquired from a foolish gambler—Elias—the riverboat moves about the Drowned Crossroads, mooring at random locations each night, only able to be found by those who have made a deal with Mister Crossroads.</p><p>Keeping the riverboat fueled and Snake Eye Jack bound requires a constant supply of damned souls. His most recent and precious catch is Adela Druskenvald herself, who made a foolish bargain with Mister Crossroads in desperation to avoid her most terrifying visions and prophecies of calamity. The Grinning Sinner’s current target and most vexing foe is Vander Boone, the self-proclaimed “Bayou King” of the Drowned Crossroads (described in “NPCs of the Drowned Crossroads” below).</p><p>Between Elias’s riverboat, Adela’s powerful soul, and Vander’s large following, Mister Crossroads hopes to stack his crew with hundreds of new corpses and stock up on enough soul-stuff to keep Snake Eye Jack imprisoned forever.</p><p>These grand schemes are motivated by fear and doubt. He knows that, should his former patron ever break free, his own doom would come swiftly, and the soul he traded to Snake Eye Jack many years ago would be tormented for all time.</p></div>"

He found a way to board the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> and travel to Druskenvald, where he met Phillip and Adela.</p><p>Despite his powerful new friends, his luck ran out in the lands of death, and his fortune was quickly spent. Soon, he was stuck playing low stakes games aboard the<em> Laughlin Lullaby</em>, a riverboat that traveled up and down the Silverbell River in Wickermoor Hollow. In desperation, he made a deal with Mister Crossroads to turn his luck around.</p><p>After shaking the croc-folk’s hand, his luck instantly turned around, and he even won ownership of the riverboat in a poker bet. He renamed it <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> in reference to the skeletal left hand of his new patron. The gambler enjoyed years of prosperity, but as always, the Grinning Sinner exploited the man’s greed and the fine print in the deal, and it all came crashing down.</p><p>When Mister Crossroads came to collect, he claimed Elias’s soul, his walking corpse, and the fine riverboat, which the trickster turned into his base of operations. He then threw the gambler’s spirit into a soulfire boiler to power the hexes that kept Snake Eye Jack imprisoned in the jinxed coffin. Elias was special.

All would pay tribute to him and seek his approval. But when the Grinning Sinner extended his hand, Vander pulled back, shook his head, and told Mister Crossroads he would do it himself. The flabbergasted croc-folk swore that Boone would regret his decision as he walked away.</p><p>Vander has declared himself the Bayou King and named himself the protector of the Drowned Crossroads. He has amassed a small legion of small-time thugs, decked them out in stylish purple-and-black uniforms with his prize money, and created a protection racket in Murkwater Bend.

Dressed in a black fur coat, wide brimmed hat, and long woolen gloves, she is clearly trying to seem incognito despite just how out of place her outfit is. She speaks in a pleading whisper, asking the characters to have a private meeting.</p><p>When Adela is alone with the characters, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Adela looks around to make sure there is no one else watching or listening before slowly removing the long woolen glove off her left hand and pulling up the sleeve of her fur coat. The arm underneath is incredibly withered, nearly skeletal, and her fingers are gnarled inward. The skin has turned to a corpse flesh gray all the way to the elbow.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>“I made a big mistake…”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Adela then makes her confession. Following the events in Foxwillow, she had offered to join the pilgrims of the Patient Lady to help the townsfolk start rebuilding their lives after the destruction of Raum. However, this was a lie so she could secretly go to the Drowned Crossroads after a terrifying vision and prophecy. She’s just returned from her trip after making a deal with Mister Crossroads.</p><p>The prophecy stated, “You and your king shall leave this place on ashen winds when the Crooked Moon snarls with rage and not a night before,” which shook her to the core. In desperation, she secretly sought out the magician in the swamp after hearing tales from her new confidant Gaston Doray.</p><p>Mister Crossroads promised that Phillip’s power would return when it was time to leave the valley, and all it cost was her wedding ring. In desperation, she accepted. After leaving the Drowned Crossroads, she had forgotten the path she took to get there, and her entire left arm began withering away. This affliction can only be reversed if her wedding ring is recovered and returned to her finger or if Mr. Crossroads is killed, though Adela doesn't know this.</p><p>She pleads with the characters to head to the swamp and find a cure for her arm, offering them [[/award 150gp]] each in return. She also asks them to keep the arrangement secret and to not tell Phillip, promising an extra 50 gp each for their discretion.</p><p>After the characters are finished talking to Adela, she leaves to return to the Druskenvald Estate, telling them that she must keep up appearances so Phillip doesn’t worry. The characters are then free to gather supplies and travel to the Drowned Crossroads.</p></div>"

The characters won’t get to Murkwater Bend without a fight. Along the way, the characters face three encounters with opportunities for a long rest between each. For these encounters, use map 15.1.</p><p><em><strong>First Night.</strong></em> When the characters are ready to camp, an animated, withered hand approaches the characters, sensing their connection to Phillip and Adela. The hand once belonged to Elias Greaves and bears a fragment of his soul.</p><p>Any character who touches the <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.mE1Nm9ZCokBe2nGe]{Withered Hand}</em>* automatically becomes attuned to it. If the character is already attuned to three magic items, they must choose one of those to which their attunement ends. If the characters ignore the hand, it tracks them for two nights, reappearing each time they take a long rest. If it fails to make contact before the characters arrive at Murkwater Bend, it returns to the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> to rejoin Elias’s body.</p><p>An hour after the hand first appears, a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.39jY1cMlEslsjtuW]{Bayou Beast}</strong>* shambles out of the mire and attacks the characters, drawn by the jinxcraft of the cursed appendage. A character who examines the remains of the beast and succeeds on a [[/check ARC DC 13]] check determines that the creature was a manifestation of the swamp, crafted by powerful jinxcraft magic and animated with a hexed wooden mask.</p><p><em><strong>Second Night.</strong></em> While crossing a particularly deep stretch of swamp water, the characters are ambushed by two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.3YwmvDupMwycWNCO]{Giant Crocodiles}</strong> and four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8aCTKP5qaBPFOqxM]{Crocodiles}</strong>.

Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Suddenly, the thick bayou foliage parts, revealing a town built on stilts that rise up from the murky water and thick, dark mud of the swamp.

New buildings cluster around the fort, with piles of freshly cut planks strewn across the muddy ground.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Two sharp whistles echo through the air, and the gate creaks open. A young woman in a purple coat festooned with jewelry and charms hails you. “You’ll want to be inside, strangers,” she says matter-of-factly.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The person calling to them is Lyla Webb. Although she has considered deposing Vander should he prove to be a cruel and foolish leader, her primary goal is the destruction of the Grinning Sinner. She can tell that the characters could be useful allies in the fight against Mister Crossroads and tries to guide them into an audience with the Bayou King.</p><h3><strong>What Lyla Knows</strong></h3><p>Lyla is an excellent judge of character. She knows that the Bayou King is dangerous, but the Grinning Sinner’s magic is worse. She especially loathes that he has imprisoned her patron and twists his power to the croc-folk’s own sinister aims.</p><p>Lyla knows everything that the Bayou King does (see “What the Bayou King Knows” later in this chapter) but doesn’t see it as her duty to explain. If pressed for information, you can use the information below to guide Lyla’s conversation with the characters:</p><ul><li><p>Locals now shelter within the walls of Vander’s fort to avoid the rampant spread of shambling dead.</p></li><li><p>Lyla scoffs at Vander’s self-avowed title, “Bayou King.” She once knew him as a destitute pit fighter.</p></li><li><p>She only describes her connection with Snake Eye Jack to someone with similar magic or aligned goals.</p></li></ul><h2>Seat of the Bayou King</h2><p>The characters are led through the large fort, past plenty of the Bayou King’s gang but also common folk seeking shelter from the Undead attacks. This is where Vander Boone oversees his “duties” in Murkwater Bend, primarily in waging the fight against Mister Crossroads.</p><h3><strong>Meeting the Bayou King</strong></h3><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>This throne room is a cramped, dingy hall filled with mismatched but surprisingly plush furniture from across Druskenvald.

They’re armed, and they look like they’ve fought their way through the Sinner’s goons.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>This man is Vander Boone, the Bayou King (chaotic neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY]{Bandit Captain}</strong>).</p><p>The fort currently holds around 30 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners}</strong> from around Murkwater Bend and 10 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN]{Bandits}</strong> (scoundrels and thieves of the swamplands) who have paid the king tribute in exchange for refuge from the Undead here. Finally, six of the Bayou King’s personal enforcers (chaotic neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thugs}</strong>) keep the peace.</p><h3><strong>What the Bayou King Knows</strong></h3><p>Vander sees the characters as potential allies who might be able to help him with the current problems facing the town. Use the details below to guide the conversation with the Bayou King:</p><ul><li><p>Murkwater Bend used to prosper until misfortune befell the town.</p></li><li><p>Mister Crossroads and his Undead minions assail stragglers in the swamp and cause “freak accidents” outside of the fort.</p></li><li><p>That wily and rotten croc-folk can only be destroyed while he is aboard his accursed riverboat.</p></li><li><p>To board the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>, you must make a deal with the Grinning Sinner or purchase one of his trinkets.</p></li><li><p>The Sinner’s shack can be found if you take the north road out of Murkwater Bend—just listen for the music.</p></li><li><p>Vander feels responsible for the people of the Drowned Crossroads, so he won’t risk getting cursed by making a deal.</p></li><li><p>Be friendly to the deceitful deal-maker until you learn his secrets.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Test of Luck</strong></h3><p>After conversing with the characters, the Bayou King looks them up and down and challenges them to a game of Liar’s Dice to test their worth.</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>“Any of your gang gamblin’ men?” the Bayou King says with a smirk. “I want you to prove me somethin’.

He lives in a nasty ship chock fulla his rottin’ goons, and every last one of ‘em’s packin’ blades. I don’t think there’s any way of killin’ this croc without taking a big risk.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>\"So why don’t you prove you got a gambler’s stomach? Play me. Liar’s Dice. Win, I double whatever it is you got paid to come all the way out to the Murk. Lose, you owe it to your king to kill that jinxed crocodile.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><h3><strong>Victory or Defeat</strong></h3><p>Resolve the game’s outcome quickly to move things along or draw it out with cross talk at the table to increase the tension (see \"Liar's Dice Rules\" below).</p><p><em><strong>Victory.</strong></em> If one of the characters wins the game, the Bayou King smiles proudly and asks the characters how much they’re being paid. If they honestly reply that Adela is paying them [[/award 150gp]] apiece ([[/award 200gp]] if sworn to secrecy), he scowls at the price but accedes to pay them that upon delivering proof of the Grinning Sinner’s demise.</p><p>If they lie about the price, they must succeed on a [[/check DEC DC 15]] check to convince him. Naming a price of [[/award 300gp]] apiece or higher imposes disadvantage on this check. On a success, he agrees to pay whatever price they name, up to a maximum of [[/award 300gp]].</p><p><em><strong>Defeat.</strong></em> If the Bayou King or Lyla wins, Vander smiles and shakes his head. He admits the characters may not have the luck of a master gambler but believes that they may have enough moxie to muscle through. After all, they owe him now to kill the Grinning Sinner.</p><p><em><strong>Time to Rest.</strong></em> After the game, Vander lets the characters rest in the fort, offering a small room to share with enough bedding for all of them. Before retiring for the evening, he invites the characters to eat and drink with him, providing an opportunity for the characters to learn more about the Bayou King, the Drowned Crossroads, and the Grinning Sinner. The downtime of the dice game and remaining evening are enough for the characters to take a long rest.</p><h2>Screams in the Night</h2><p>After the characters bid goodnight and retire, they’re jolted awake by piercing screams echoing through the fort. The Grinning Sinner’s Undead thralls have infiltrated Murkwater Bend, scaling the fort walls. When the characters reach the throne room, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Outside, shrieks split the night air as the throne room descends into chaos. The Bayou King’s scoundrels scramble for weapons, casting fearful glances toward the door. Suddenly, it flies open, and a blood-streaked sentry stumbles in, gasping, “They’re here… Over the wall…” before collapsing in a heap.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Vander Boone turns to you, his voice a fierce growl: “Get outta’ here! Take the north road and head to the Sinner’s shack. Keep running ‘til you hear his cursed strings playin’ in the swamp. Board his riverboat, cut that grinnin’ croc down, and end this nightmare!”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The Bayou King will hear no protest. If the characters enter the village’s streets and fight, even against his wishes, you can draw your own map of the streets and challenge them with four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.IyIybE5t2adMEVUM]{Ghasts}</strong> led by a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Wou9MoWctZhNBzi0]{Ferryman}</strong>*. Another similar group arrives on initiative count 20 of the fifth and tenth rounds of combat. Staying to fight is foolish, and Lyla Webb joins the fray to spur them on to defeat Mister Crossroads and free Snake Eye Jack.</p><p>Otherwise, the characters flee as the town dissolves into a frenzied melee. Waves of the living dead stagger through the streets, their hollow eyes seeking only to kill. Amid the chaos, the characters slip past the carnage unscathed and take the north road, where wooden walkways give way to a soggy, mud-choked path leading into the stinking mire.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_DROWN_Screams%20in%20the%20Night_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/design/border-section-top-horned.webp\" height=\"55\" style=\"margin:10px auto;border:none\" /><h1><strong>Liar's Dice Rules</strong></h1><div style=\"max-width:750px;margin:0 auto;font-size:1.05em;text-align:justify;text-indent:2em\"><p>The rules of Liar’s Dice are simple, and Lyla is content to explain them to the characters if they’re unfamiliar. The players in this game are Vander, Lyla, and the characters.</p><ul><li><p>Each player has a set of five 6-sided dice, and each round they roll them in secret and look at their own dice (rolling in cups is recommended).</p></li><li><p>1s are considered wild and can be used as any number. For instance, a player with two 4s and two 1s would actually have four 4s.</p></li><li><p>The first player (starting with Vander in round one) makes a bid on how many dice of a certain face were rolled by all players in total. For example, Vander starts by safely bidding “two 2s”.</p></li><li><p>After each bid, the next player to the left can challenge the bid, and all players reveal their dice. If the challenged player overbid, they lose a die for the rest of the game. For example, if there was only a single 2 showing between all players (unlikely, but possible), Vander would permanently lose a die in all future rounds. If the challenged player did not overbid (if there were two or more 2s for example), the challenging player permanently loses a die for the rest of the game instead. Once the challenge is resolved, players reroll their dice, and the player who lost a die makes the first bid in the new round.</p></li><li><p>If the next player to the left doesn’t wish to challenge, they must raise either the number of dice (“three 2s”), the face (“two 3s”), or both (“four 4s”). There is no limit to how high either number can be raised in the next bid, other than the natural cap of 6 for the face portion of the bid.</p></li><li><p>This process of bidding and challenging continues around clockwise with play always passing to the next player on the left.</p></li><li><p>When a player loses all five of their dice, they are eliminated from the game.</p></li><li><p>The winner of the game is the last person with any dice remaining.</p></li></ul><p>You will know both Vander and Lyla’s dice. That’s okay—they know how to communicate under the table to gain an advantage.</p><p><em><strong>Special Rules.</strong></em> Characters with certain skill proficiencies can manipulate the game to their advantage, letting the characters be better gamblers than their players. Show the players the following rules.</p><p>If you have proficiency in the listed skill or tool, you can use that special trait on your turn. You can use any combination of these traits up to a total of three times during the game:</p><p><strong>Hard Read (Insight).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, one opponent of your choice must reveal their dice to you, and only you.</p><p><strong>Deft Hands (Sleight of Hand).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, you can change one of your dice to any number.</p><p><strong>Sly Reveal (Stealth).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, show your dice to one opponent. They can choose to show you theirs.</p><p><strong>Poker Face (Deception).</strong> When an opponent challenges a bid you made this turn, you can succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check against DC 15 or the other player’s Wisdom score, whichever is higher, to make them balk and withdraw their challenge.</p><p><strong>Daring Dicer (Gaming Set: Dice).</strong> Immediately after rolling your dice, you may change any number of your dice to the face of your choice.</p><p><strong>Fated Luck (Any).</strong> Before you bid or challenge, you can reroll all of your remaining dice.</p></div><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><h3>Variant: Quick Liar’s Dice</h3><p>If you’d prefer an alternative to playing a game of Liar’s Dice within your game session, you can leave the game to ability checks using tools.</p><p>Using the guidance in the gaming set tool, you can call for [[/check WIS DC 20]] checks using proficiency with dice to determine the winner of the game. Any gambler who fails to meet or exceed 20 loses, and if multiple gamblers succeed on the check, the gambler with the highest total wins.</p><p>To add a bit more nuance, you can allow Charisma (Deception) checks using the dice instead, with advantage if the player has proficiency with both dice and the Deception skill.</p></aside></div>"

Here, the hexing power of Snake Eye Jack reaches its peak, with the Grinning’s Sinner’s former patron still bound within.</p><p>As the characters explore, they may encounter the ship’s original owner, the now-Undead Elias Greaves, and uncover the tale of the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em> and the Grinning Sinner’s plan for Adela Druskenvald. Upon entering the Captain’s Quarters (area B8), the ship warps into a grand, garish arena—the stage set for a final showdown with Mister Crossroads.</p><h2>Dead Man’s Hand Features</h2><p>Areas within the riverboat casino have the following features unless its description says otherwise:</p><p><strong>Lighting.</strong> Exterior areas have dim light shed by paper lanterns and glowing jinxcraft sigils etched all over the exterior of the riverboat. Interior areas have bright light from chandeliers and mirrored walls. All of these lights glow with vibrant neon colors and are fueled by burning soulfire that the Grinning Sinner has collected; a character who succeeds on a [[/check ARC DC 15]] or [[/check REL DC 15]] check realizes this.</p><p><strong>Music.</strong> Bright and upbeat jazz music plays throughout the entire riverboat, magically projecting from the band that plays in the Gambling Hall (see area B3). It is surprisingly catchy, no matter one’s musical tastes. Creatures who can hear the music have disadvantage on saving throws to maintain concentration.</p><p><strong>Jinxcraft Sigils. </strong>Every location has glowing jinxcraft sigils etched into the walls, floors, and ceilings that keep Snake Eye Jack imprisoned and use his spectral essence to fuel the operations of the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>. This fills the riverboat with his power over luck, both good and bad. Attack rolls score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20, and they automatically miss on a roll of 1 or 2. This is cumulative with features such as a champion fighter’s Improved Critical (who would score critical hits on a roll of 18, 19, or 20).</p><p><strong>Gamblers.</strong> Dozens of people from across Wickermoor Hollow and the rest of Druskenvald sit at casino tables, playing cards or dice or betting on enchanted horse figurines made to race, or they mingle at the ship’s well-stocked bar. They are all cursed—enthralled by the seductive power of the casino. They are friendly and happily lead characters around and share their favorite games, but they know little about the ship or its campaign and direct them to ask the Undead casino staff (who they seem to think are still living people). Gamblers become hostile to anyone who interferes in their games.</p><p><strong>Curse of the High Roller.</strong> When a character who isn’t yet cursed by the casino finishes a game of chance here, they must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 8]] saving throw or be cursed and &amp;reference[charmed apply=false] by the Grinning Sinner. While charmed in this way, they are enthralled and want nothing more but to gamble, drink, flirt with patrons, and otherwise keep enjoying the area of the casino they’re currently in. They can repeat this saving throw after 10 minutes, ending the effect on a success. A character who fails two of these repeat saves in a row becomes fully captivated, makes no more saving throws, and has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws made to harm casino patrons or otherwise disrupt the convivial atmosphere of the riverboat while cursed. The curse is then permanent until broken by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse} </em>spell or similar magic, or if the Grinning Sinner damages the character, forces them to make a saving throw, or dies.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/15-2_Dead_Mans_Hand.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>Dead Man's Hand Locations</h2><p>The following areas are found on map 15.2.</p></div>"

Trapped within the boiler lies the tormented soul of Elias Greaves.

Yorgrim, the necropolis’s caretaker, stands alone against a rising tide of undeath, slowly corrupted by the incessant whispers of the malicious, ravening spirits he has sworn to entomb and imprison. Unless aided by the characters, the jailer will break, and a wave of shrieking spirits will crash upon Wickermoor Hollow and devour every living soul within.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Maidenmist Cemetery sprawls across the fogbound, rolling hills to the southeast of Wickermoor Village, riddled with headstones, crypts, mausoleums, and every other kind of grave marker. It serves as the final resting place for all mortal beings in Wickermoor Hollow and has done so for millennia. None know who first built the cemetery, for it has always been there. It is said that the wrought iron fence that surrounds it inches forward night by night, forever welcoming the endlessly increasing deceased.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">For years, a ghostly orc known as Yorgrim has served as the sole gravedigger and sexton of the cemetery. However, he is not just a caretaker for the dead that he buries and for whom he performs the final rites. He also serves as a warden, for the cemetery’s true purpose is a prison for thousands of screaming spirits that seek only to corrupt and consume the souls of both the living and the dead.</p><p class=\"p7\">The cemetery’s secret is that it was built upon a tear into the Shroud, which normally serves as an impenetrable barrier around Druskenvald, but here it serves as a gateway for the twisted spirits to cross over into the realm freely. These souls are filled with inhuman wrath for being deprived of a true afterlife; left unchecked, they would spill across the valley and the entire domain beyond, feasting upon the living.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The haunted hills of Maidenmist Cemetery have never been safe for the living, but the warding lights of the necropolis have gone out, and their caretaker slowly succumbs to the corruption of the Shroud. Now, the cemetery is a prison overrun with rioting dead. Only the relighting of the balefire beacons and the sealing of the tear into the Shroud can stop the coming tide of death. Characters who are drawn to Maidenmist Cemetery by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Find Yorgrim, the Gravedigger.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Light the five extinguished balefire beacons.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Discover the source of the dead’s corruption within the sepulcher.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy the Chained Reaper and seal the tear to the Shroud.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Yorgrim, the key NPC, to convincingly convey his grim duty and descent into corruption. Refresh yourself on the stories of the other Fallen (see chapter 8) to provide the characters with inspiration in performing their rites. Review the locations of Maidenmist Cemetery so you are prepared to improvise encounters as the characters explore.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 9 characters.</p></div>"

Haunted by the failures of his past and the loss of his friends to their respective sins, he goes about his duties with grim determination, never relenting despite the constant cracking of his soul and the chains that bind the spirits he keeps imprisoned.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Penitent Pilgrim</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Yorgrim.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Before coming to Druskenvald, Yorgrim was a seer for his people, the orcs of the Shadestone Clan. He communed with the spirits of the deceased, performing their burial rites and guiding them to the afterlife. However, he was deceived by his chieftain and unwittingly performed a necromantic ritual that slaughtered his entire community and annihilated their souls with unspeakable and forbidden power.</p><p class=\"p7\">Yorgrim took his vengeance, but it was a hollow victory. His people were dead, and their souls would never find peace. As a self-imposed penance, the seer etched the name of every fallen orc onto a heavy stone that he chained to himself, committing to carrying the weight forever as he sought to wander the land and bring peace to souls that were not yet beyond help.</p><p class=\"p7\">For years, Yorgrim trudged across the land, a dour pilgrim performing burial rites for countless souls until his body finally gave out beneath the crushing weight of his penance. However, his spirit did not yield, and he arrived in Druskenvald not reborn but instead fated to forever exist as a ghost, still chained to the heavy gravestone even in death.</p><p class=\"p7\">In this new realm, with so many restless dead in need of peace, Yorgrim wandered Druskenvald, performing rites alone until he finally made connections with five other souls as powerful and burdened as his. Despite his gloomy disposition, Yorgrim developed an affection for and eventual friendship with Ol’ Jericho Sticks, Sir Marius Renathyr, Captain Briggsy Kratch, Lethica Nightborne, and Farryn of the Greenwood, regularly visiting each throughout his wayward travels.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Shroud Warden</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Shortly after meeting his new friends and softening his stony heart, he discovered the mysterious Maidenmist Cemetery in Wickermoor Hollow. Deep within the sepulcher at the center of the necropolis was a small tear into the primordial mists of death called the Shroud (see chapter 1), and the shrieks and whispers of the tortured souls within concerned Yorgrim deeply. He feared an apocalyptic reckoning should the shrouded abominations freely pass into Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p7\">Feeling as if he had discovered his true purpose, he bound himself to the cemetery and took up the mantle of its sexton and gravedigger, performing the burial rites for the thousands of dead he found there. His duty was to provide this service for every new death in Wickermoor Hollow. This prevented the spirits of the Shroud from slipping through to possess and reanimate the corpses that lay within the earth of the necropolis.</p><p class=\"p7\">However, as the years went on, the tear to the Shroud grew larger, and Yorgrim beseeched his friends for aid. All agreed, and each of the six unlikely companions offered a fragment of their soul to kindle great braziers of spectral balefire, the light of which repelled the Shroud and the abominable spirits within.</p><p class=\"p7\">After parting ways, Yorgrim would never see his friends again; the lighting of the beacons bound him to the cemetery as a jailer and warden of the shrieking spirits and occasionally restless dead within. In his duty, he took up a lantern tethered to the anima of his soul that serves as his primary weapon and tool to keep the unruly spirits chained.</p><p class=\"p7\">As each of his former friends fell one by one to the sin of the Horned King, the balefire beacons dimmed greatly, and Yorgrim’s nightly duties became far more challenging. When the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> crashed into Wickermoor Hollow, bringing the ghastly fog of the Shroud with it, the tear in the sepulcher grew immensely. And following the deaths of each of the Fallen, their respective balefire beacons have gone completely dark. Now, Yorgrim expends every measure of his being to keep the riotous and raging dead from spilling forth, his own soul weakening with every passing night.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Parley with the Gravedigger</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Yorgrim is dour, grim, and stoic, but he is not cruel. He views the characters as the only hope to relight the balefire beacons and investigate the source of the Shroud. He is not talkative and speaks with few words but doesn’t withhold important information that the characters need to know.</p><p class=\"p7\">These are some responses to common questions the characters may ask of this spectral sextant:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Who Are You?</strong> “I am called Yorgrim. This is my cemetery. I serve the dead here.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What Is this Place?</strong> “The graves of Maidenmist bear the dead of the hollow. Centuries of souls rest here. It was here before me. It will be here after me.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Are You Dead?</strong> “My life ended long ago, but my duty did not. It persists until I atone for my sins and failures. This is my burden to bear.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Who Is the Dog?</strong> “This is Isolde. She is a grim, a spirit bound in duty to the dead. We are of a kind. She is my sole companion.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What Is the Shroud?</strong> “The Shroud is an element. Like the air you breathe and the earth you stand upon. It is death incarnate. It should not be here. Not even in an afterlife.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What Are the Shrouded?</strong> “Souls once living but devoured and corrupted by the Shroud. They have lost everything they once were in life. Abominations.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>You Were Friends?</strong> “The monsters you killed were my friends. Before they succumbed to corruption, they had strong wills and good hearts, like you. They fell to their burdens, like you might yet. None are immune to the weight of failure.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Why Would We Perform Rites for Villains?</strong> “We will not perform the rites for the evil you faced. We do not mourn the Crimson Abbot, the Grinning Sinner, or the rest. I mourn who they were when there was light in their souls. It is for them we perform the rites. It is the only way.”</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Isolde, the Grim</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Isolde.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">After isolating himself, Yorgrim found companionship in Isolde (ih-ZOAL-duh), a type of guardian spirit known as a grim. These spectral watchers guard cemeteries, graveyards, and other burial sites and can take the form of any animal. Isolde (Neutral good <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmGhost000000000]{Ghost}</strong>) manifests as a black hound with bright white eyes.

In recent years, she has served as the primary messenger between Yorgrim and Mori Shade, the undertaker of Wickermoor Village. With a supernatural intuition that only a dog can possess, she can sense that Yorgrim is suffering from the gibbering of the Shroud and is close to breaking.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Shrouded</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The shrouded are malicious, ravenous spirits entirely stripped of their anima—the soul-stuff that retains an individual spirit's essence and identity. Having lost whoever they might have been in life, the shrouded exist as devouring forces of the primordial element of death itself, filled only with the hunger to corrupt and consume souls that retain their anima, whether they be living or dead. They only feel rage and hate for those who don't share their fate, forever drifting through the Shroud and seeking new prey to corrupt into shrouded themselves.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">In Maidenmist Cemetery, numerous shrouded have spilled forth from the tear in the depths of the great sepulcher, and some have even slithered out between the cracks of the ancient tomb. They drift through the ghastly rolling fogbanks or possess the corpses once interred in the earth but now shamble about the necropolis.</span></p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap19 middle-page\"><p class=\"h2\">Balefire Beacons</p><p>Six beacons of balefire, each with its own hue, are meant to roar in braziers around the cemetery to ward it from the encroaching Shroud. Five have gone dark and must be reignited to banish the eldritch fog and the vicious spirits within from all outdoor locations of Maidenmist Cemetery. This is the only way to open the doors to the Great Sepulcher (area Y2) so that the characters and Yorgrim can investigate the growing tear in the Shroud deep beneath the cemetery.</p><p class=\"p7\">The balefire beacons have gone out following the deaths of the Fallen, the powerful beings whose souls were used to spark the flames. To reignite these beacons, the characters must travel across the cemetery to assist Yorgrim in performing each of the Fallen’s final rites at their flame’s respective brazier. The beacons, their locations, and the Fallen whose souls they were sparked from are as follows:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Crimson Beacon.</strong> Flame of Sir Marius Renathyr (see chapter 14), found in the Highborn Crypts (area Y4).</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Violet Beacon.</strong> Flame of Lethica Nightborne (see chapter 17), found in the Cremation Gardens (area Y5).</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Amber Beacon.</strong> Flame of Ol’ Jericho Sticks (see chapter 13), found in the Potter’s Field (area Y6).</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Magenta Beacon.</strong> Flame of Captain Briggsy Kratch (see chapter 15), found in the Mausoleum Lanes (area Y7).</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Emerald Beacon.</strong> Flame of Farryn of the Greenwood (see chapter 18), found in the Burial Mounds (area Y8).</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Azure Beacon.</strong> Flame of Yorgrim, found in the Shadestone Sanctuary (area Y9).</p><p class=\"p5\">The Azure Beacon is the only one that remains ablaze. When each of the remaining five beacons is lit, its corresponding sconce above the doors of the Great Sepulcher (area Y2) and within the Balefire Chamber (area Y11) lights with the same-colored flame. When all six beacons are lit, the sepulcher's doors unseal.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Final rites</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">To perform the final rites of the Fallen, a 1-minute ritual led by Yorgrim must be conducted at a balefire brazier. During the ritual, the characters must slay the attacking monsters and succeed on six ability checks. The specific details to complete the ritual are as follows:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Spark the Flame.</strong> Special kindling connected to the Fallen, kept entombed at the respective cemetery location, must be placed in the brazier and ignited, beginning the ritual. Roll initiative! If 1 minute passes without the beacon becoming fully lit, the flame goes out, and a character can offer a fragment of their soul to restore the kindling, gaining Exhaustion level. The characters can then attempt the ritual again.</p><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sacrifice a Soul.</strong> The ignition of the flame draws the attention of Hostile cemetery monsters corrupted by the Shroud, committed to preventing the beacon from being lit. These monsters must be slain during the ritual as an offering to the balefire (see \"The Beacon is Lit\" below).</span></p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Hold Back the Shroud.</strong> The ravenous Shroud is drawn to the ritual, kept at bay with immense effort from Yorgrim. It billows around the fringes of the light cast by Yorgrim’s lantern (see “Balefire Lantern” earlier in this chapter), waiting for the light to be snuffed out. Everything outside of the lantern’s light is Heavily Obscured. Additionally, any character who leaves the light and steps into the Shroud is attacked by three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.LmakrDSQemeBWTj2]{Shrouded}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> (one of each variant).</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter19_Gravedigger.webp\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p></p></div></div><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Honor the Fallen.</strong> Once the balefire flame is lit, it burns small and must be stoked. As a Magic action, a character can make a contribution to the ceremony that honors who the Fallen were before they fell. The character makes a DC 15 ability check. Each of the Fallen has a list of suggested “resolution proficiencies” that have the best chance of contributing to the ritual. Other checks can work at your discretion, but the DC for such checks rises to 18 unless you feel the justification is especially fitting.</span></p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Stoke the Fire.</strong> Each successful ability check is one step toward finishing a Fallen’s final rites (see \"The Beacon is Lit\" below). With each failure, tormented souls from the Shroud take on mocking shapes of the Fallen and unleash hateful words to torment the gravedigger and the characters. Each creature that can hear this verbal assault must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 13]] saving throw or take [[/damage 1d6 psychic]]{3 (1d6)} Psychic damage and gain the &amp;reference[stunned apply=false] condition until the end of its next turn. A creature can choose to take an extra [[/damage 6d6 psychic]]{21 (6d6)} Psychic damage to avoid the Stunned condition.</p><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Beacon Is Lit.</strong> After the destruction of the guardian monsters and six successful ability checks, the ritual concludes and the balefire beacon is fully lit, banishing the Shroud from the cemetery location. All shrouded in the beacon’s location are destroyed, and the area loses the effects of the Shrouded Spirits, Wails of the Damned, and Corrupting Shroud features (see “Maidenmist Cemetery Features” earlier in this chapter).</span></p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Brilliant Success.</strong> How well the characters perform the final rites affects the encounter in the Balefire Chamber (area Y11) within the sepulcher. Each ability check during a ritual that succeeds by 5 or more is considered a Brilliant Success. The number of Brilliant Successes achieved during the ritual determines the balefire beacon’s intensity, as shown in the Beacon Intensity table below (important in area Y11).</p><p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s10\"><em><strong>Beacon Intensity</strong></em></span></p><table border=\"0\" class=\"foundry-header-red\"><thead><tr><th>Brilliant Successes</th><th>Beacon Intensity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2 or fewer</td><td>Glowing Beacon</td></tr><tr><td>3–5</td><td>Blazing Beacon</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Roaring Beacon</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

After each challenge his fortitude lessens, his spirit appears more hollow, and the maddening voices of the shrouded affect him more and more, leading toward his inevitable transformation into the Chained Reaper in the Tomb of the Shrouded (area Y15). Once all six balefire beacons are lit, Yorgrim’s balefire lantern dims, shedding Bright Light in a 5-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 15 feet.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Loyal Hound.</strong></em> While Yorgrim and the characters explore Maidenmist Cemetery, Isolde is left alone to defend the doors of the sepulcher against the Shroud. She dutifully devotes herself to keep her balefire lantern lit, slowly draining her spectral essence. After 16 hours, Isolde's spirit is spent and she fades away, allowing the ghastly fog of the Shroud to seep out of the door and coalesce around the sepulcher.</p><p class=\"p7\">Every 15 minutes after Isolde is gone, a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.LmakrDSQemeBWTj2]{Shrouded}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> (random variant) escapes its prison and lurks in the gloom, waiting to attack the characters when they return.

This trip through the mists of death leaves them stranded in the mysterious valley of Wickermoor Hollow, where isolated peoples are terrorized by restless dead, wicked hags, ravenous monsters, and many other creatures of the night that never ends.</p><p>From the very beginning, the characters’ fates are intertwined with that of Phillip Druskenvald, the lord of the land that he shaped and named after himself, as well as his clairvoyant wife, Adela. Despite their power, these well-meaning but naïve nobles are doomed to perish in the story’s climax from the machinations of a twisted fey goddess known as the Crooked Queen.</p><p>This primeval entity named Kehlenn is served by countless minions, including a secret cult of human worshippers, a coven of verminous crones, and a malevolent spirit called the Crooked Man—all of whom do her bidding throughout the valley to free her from her ancient prison deep within the dark wood.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/large-Holly_Bunyip.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>The means of this eventual return lies with a fledgling god born from sin itself.

While victory is possible, the cost will be tremendous, and many souls cannot be saved no matter what the would-be heroes do.</p><p>And yet, while there is only a ghost of a chance that salvation can be achieved, it is a hope all the same.

His dapper appearance and affable personality belie the immense power he holds. While he appears to be a tall, thin man with perfectly slicked back hair and a pencil-thin mustache as black as night, the truth is that he is a timeless lord of death with his origins lost deep within the Shroud itself . . . even to him.</p><p>Despite ruling in Druskenvald for many years, he was not always the realm’s master. Formerly, it had belonged to the fey goddess Kehlenn, who utilized the reincarnation magics of the domain to rebirth souls as flora and fauna in a natural world where life was brutal and short.</p><p>Phillip is another kind of deathless being who arrived from beyond the mist eons ago. He usurped the realm of rebirth, claiming its reincarnating powers for his own. He then reshaped the land into his own design, even renaming it after himself. In this new afterlife, Phillip provided souls the opportunity to be reborn as sapient mortal beings to enjoy a second chance at a “normal” life.</p><p>After the slow passage of millennia, Phillip forgot about his battle with Kehlenn or that there was ever a world before the one he forged himself. He now oversees the domain with his Crescent Court, composed of the thirteen lords and ladies of Druskenvald (see chapter 1). However, he finds governance tedious and prefers to enjoy the good life he brought to the afterlife, with all the messy and sinful comforts and indulgences that come with it.</p><p>While he maintains a general grasp of the current affairs of the thirteen major provinces of Druskenvald, Phillip is mostly ignorant of the happenings in Wickermoor Hollow, heightened by the crooked power of Kehlenn that shrouds it from his view. Even worse, while in the valley, Phillip has none of the supernatural powers that make him the most formidable being in the land.</p><p>He does not know, and will only learn too late, that in Wickermoor Hollow, Kehlenn has seized his power and weaves it toward her own aims in the creation of a newborn god of sin: the Horned King. While within the confines of the valley, Phillip is very nearly just a mortal man, which will lead to his inevitable destruction.</p><p>Phillip’s newfound impotence frustrates him, but he still decides to remain in the valley after being stranded there with the characters. His curiosity is stronger than his sense of preservation, and he cannot fathom a scenario where he could be in any real danger. He sees the presence of the characters as an opportunity to get to the bottom of what’s happening in Wickermoor Hollow while also helping the citizens he’s neglected for so long.</p><h2>Adela Druskenvald</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Adela_Druskenvald.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>Adela Druskenvald is the loving partner-in-crime of her husband Phillip. She rules Druskenvald alongside him, and while she similarly has a distaste for politics and bureaucracy, she often serves as a voice of reason and a reminder of the responsibility to help the people across the thirteen provinces.</p><p>While Phillip is an otherworldly entity from regions unknown, Adela was born a mortal woman and lived in the material world for the first three decades of her life. As a child, her paranormal experiences and prophetic visions led to her discovery of immense powers of divination and a strong connection to the spiritual world.</p><p>As a young woman, Adela’s curiosity and dauntlessness brought her face-to-face with Phillip aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, and the two fell in love at first sight. They were quickly married, and as a Druskenvald, Adela became immortal, enjoying her endless youth by seeking every new and exciting experience she could find.</p><p>While Adela has an exceptional gift of second sight, she doubts her own abilities, which often leads to her misinterpreting her visions. Despite this anxiety and her cheerful, almost ditzy demeanor, there is reason to believe that she is far more crafty, calculating, and deliberate than she lets on.</p><p>Even with her gift of prophecy, she is powerless to stop her fate as a sacrificial lamb in the ritual to free the Crooked Queen. Throughout the adventure, her visions become increasingly grave but also more difficult to interpret.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Kehlenn_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen</h2><p>Kehlenn is a primordial fey goddess who first created the plane of existence now known as Druskenvald. Before Phillip Druskenvald invaded her realm and made it his own, she was the Green Queen, who tended an afterlife of reincarnation into a realm of pure nature. Mortal souls would be reborn as plants and animals, and while the verdant world she ruled was natural, each life after rebirth was brutal and short.</p><p>When Phillip Druskenvald arrived in her green realm and supplanted her, he was unaware that a being of such power could never be completely destroyed, especially within the confines of the dimension she created. In her defeat, Kehlenn managed to slink into the darkest wood she could find and crawl beneath the roots of a single tree. Her physical form withered in the barrow, and her essence compressed into the trunk, bough, and branch of the tree that grew from it.</p><p>From this solitary spot, she slumbered in a near-deathlike stasis for eons, slowly reabsorbing the power of the land that surrounded her—a valley that would eventually come to be called Wickermoor Hollow. But what never slept was the hate she felt for Phillip Druskenvald and the mortal beings he brought with him to her once green domain. The bitterness and desire for vengeance twisted Kehlenn and the tree where she dwelled until all the Green withered and she took up the new title of the Crooked Queen.</p><p>Kehlenn has slowly been regaining strength century after century, eventually calling to minions that gathered around her like moths to a flame. The worship they paid her and the twisted rituals they conducted in her honor made her even stronger until all Wickermoor Hollow was her domain, despite still being entombed and imprisoned in the forest that had come to be called the Wytchwood.</p><p>With her servants enacting her heinous machinations, she readies herself for freedom and the revenge she so desperately seeks against Phillip and the people he rules over. Now she plots toward the disintegration of all sapient beings into nature and the annihilation and crooked rebirth of the world she had been robbed of.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Horned%20King_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>The Horned King</h2><p>Deep within the Wytchwood stalks a terrible beast that is the manifestation of sin itself. A fledging god of mortal desire that seeks to achieve incarnation to usher in the annihilation and crooked rebirth of Druskenvald, the Horned King is the fiendish servant of the Crooked Queen and her ultimate weapon in claiming vengeance against the man who usurped her.</p><p>Despite Kehlenn’s overall defeat, her eventual reawakening and growing power in Wickermoor Hollow has allowed her to achieve her greatest victory since she was cast down. Just as Phillip stole her domain in the forgotten past, she has claimed his inherent power within the confines of the valley, rending the usually-mighty lord of the land as little more than a mortal human.</p><p>What she found in the powerful and even eldritch energies spawned from the heart of Phillip Druskenvald was sin. The darkness and desire that lurk within humanity and nearly all sentient mortal beings are what the new lord of the land brought to her once-beautiful, green kingdom. And with it was the desperate, fear-driven desire to not just survive, but to thrive and live deliciously in comfort and abundance.</p><p>Kehlenn held onto this newfound fragment of Phillip’s soul, siphoning it to slowly regain her strength and weave a fledgling god of sin, desire, and wickedness into existence to serve as her consort and right hand. Taking the form of an enormous black goat with three blood-red eyes, the Horned King exists as an incorporeal fiendish spirit bound to the haunted Wytchwood where the Crooked Queen remains entombed and imprisoned (see chapter 24).</p><p>However, his sinful power spreads through Wickermoor Hollow, offering the mortals of his queen’s realm the chance to live the life they’ve always wanted at the cost of pledging and sacrificing their very soul. With each new covetous and terrified mortal who falls to sin and signs their name in the book of the Horned King, Kehlenn’s plan comes closer to fruition. And soon, with the inevitable downfall of Phillip Druskenvald, the beast that stalks the deepest woods and darkest hearts will be made flesh and ascend as an instrument of the Crooked Queen’s vengeance.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Crooked%20Man_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>The Crooked Man</h2><p>The essence of this ancient spirit has existed since the forgotten ages, a lingering remnant of the Crooked Queen's twisted power of rebirth. Despite this primeval origin, the Crooked Man has taken a myriad of forms over the millennia, always corrupting and killing a mortal host before being reborn with a new visage every century or so, favoring a brutalized human shape for as long as the species has dwelled in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>His current incarnation is the twisted shade of a man named Eustace Lockwood, who slaughtered his entire household in one bloody night after a slow descent into paranoia and malevolence through a malign witchcraft that plagued his dreams. His neck, torso, limbs, fingers, teeth, and even his top hat are bent at unnatural angles, truly living up to his name. While he can move about the whole valley, he primarily resides in the manor home built atop a remnant of Kehlenn’s power, aptly dubbed the Crooked House (see chapter 12).</p><p>Serving as the mouthpiece and instrument of the Crooked Queen while she remains trapped within the Wytchwood, he has orchestrated many of the horrors that have befallen the residents of Wickermoor Hollow. He also serves as a guiding force of the malevolent Cult of the Crooked Queen that has infiltrated the Followers of the Old Ways within the valley, constantly working in secret to bring about Kehlenn's return.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_Vermintol%20Coven_Finished.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h2>The Vermintoll Coven</h2><p>The only minions of Kehlenn on par with the Crooked Man are the three vile hags that form the Vermintoll Coven. All three of the ancient crones are fey beings from the time before Phillip, now just as twisted and hateful as the queen they’ve served for eons. Each member of the coven obsessively favors a verminous creature and has taken on the physical traits of the foul animals they command.</p><p>The ultimate purpose of the coven is to toll the death knell of the living beings fated for sacrifice and prepare their mind, body, and soul for the sacrificial rituals conducted in honor of the Crooked Queen. While these three sisters are united in their malign purpose, they truly despise each other, all seeking a place at Kehlenn’s left hand.</p><p>The youngest sister is Vessla Browntooth, the weasel hag, who corrupts the soul through wicked witchcraft and twisted dreams from the attic of the Crooked House (see chapter 12). The middle sister is Stonoga Blackstinger, the centipede hag, who corrupts the body through disease, venom, and loathsome fleshcrafting from the depths of Skitterdeep Mine (see chapter 16). The eldest sister is Golub Graygullet, the pigeon hag, who corrupts the mind through manipulation of information as the disguised postmaster of Wickermoor Village from her Roving Rookery (see chapter 20).</p><p>This coven is a constant threat plaguing the people of Wickermoor Hollow and subtly assisting the Cult of the Crooked Queen from the shadows. And despite being unwittingly fated to die themselves, they are destined to serve Kehlenn even after their deaths at the hands of the characters, shattering reality and unleashing the ultimate nightmare upon the valley.</p><h2>The Fallen</h2><p>The greatest victory of the Horned King after his birth from the sinful soul of Phillip Druskenvald was the fall of six powerful and wayward souls that found themselves in Druskenvald from the material world. Each of these beings had once been heroic in their own way, but all had deep flaws and demons both within and without.</p><p>While these former heroes never once directly heard the seductive voice of the goat in the woods, the sin that dwelled in each of their hearts was plied by the Horned King until they brought about their own downfall one by one. With each turn to despair, hopelessness, and eventually wickedness, the Fallen, as they came to be known by the servants of the Crooked Queen, turned into the monsters they once fought against.</p><p>The increasing evil perpetuated by the Fallen has added to the Horned King’s power as he seeks to spread sin from his prison within the Wytchwood. Now, each of the Fallen must die so that their wicked essence may be consumed and used as the catalyst for the black goat’s inevitable incarnation.</p><p>However, none of the Fallen actively serve the forces of the Crooked Queen and purely seek to achieve their own aims. They have no alliances with each other or even the lord of sin, who is ultimately responsible for each of their falls. These villains intimidate and slaughter the people of Wickermoor Hollow on their own volition, each offering a unique threat and challenge for the characters to confront.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKEDMOON_FULLPAGE_6%20Fallen.webp\" alt=\"\" /><h3><strong>Raum, the Harvest Terror</strong></h3><p>The friendly and helpful scarecrow tunesmith named Ol’ Jericho Sticks was once a beloved member of the agrarian community of Foxwillow, but his construction contained a ravenous demon of secrets within. Eventually, the whispers corrupted him into a fiendish crow-like fiend that terrorizes the people he used to cherish. Feasting on his victims’ flesh, souls, and secrets, Raum strikes from a demonic dimension of infinite cornstalks and replaces the bodies of his prey with grotesque pumpkin-headed effigies (see chapter 13).</p><h3><strong>Father Renathyr, the Crimson Abbot</strong></h3><p>Sir Marius Renathyr was once a gallant knight who served a god of morning and protected the innocent. However, he was tricked by a succubus duchess of hell into sacrificing everything he once stood for, transforming him into a bloodthirsty vampire. Now, Father Renathyr leads a rigid faith from the Crimson Monastery sworn to destroy wickedness at every turn, commanding legions of zealous followers to kidnap innocents so they may burn at the stake or be drained of blood to feed his undying hunger (see chapter 14).</p><h3><strong>Mister Crossroads, the Grinning Sinner</strong></h3><p>Once a pirate of fearsome renown, Captain Briggsy “The Kutlass” Kratch practiced hexing magic granted to him by a powerful death spirit he had bargained with. Driven by the desire for more wealth and power, he tricked and imprisoned his patron, harnessing the magic of jinxcraft for himself to become a master of misfortune. He now lurks in the swamps of the Drowned Crossroads, offering the truly desperate their hearts’ desire in a bargain that always ends in misery. After each deal turns bad, Mister Crossroads rips the spirits from his associates’ bodies and binds their shambling corpses to his will (see chapter 15).</p><h3><strong>Matron Lethica, the Weeping Widow</strong></h3><p>Lethica Nightborne was once a high priestess of a night goddess and committed to healing the sick and injured with blessings of the divine. However, following the painful loss of her husband, she turned to vile science fueled by the alien biology of a cosmic horror which she called forth into Druskenvald. Now, Matron Lethica oversees the gloomy sanatorium called Memory’s Rest, wiping the minds of her patients with an eldritch serum and performing grotesque experiments on their bodies (see chapter 17).</p><h3><strong>Gorthos, the Beast of Blight</strong></h3><p>A young antlered satyr named Farryn once devoted her life to tending a lush forest called the Greenwood until she became heartbroken following the death of her only love. In an attempt to bring this lover back, she followed the call of a dead god and transformed into a vile rotting husk of an abomination and blighted the entire woodland with her newfound power. Now, Gorthos lurks within Hartsblight Forest, spreading rot and decay with the help of a circle of twisted druids who revere and serve her (see chapter 18).</p><h3><strong>Yorgrim, the Chained Reaper</strong></h3><p>The orc gravedigger known as Yorgrim is the last to fall. Once a shaman who inadvertently led to the death of his entire clan, he spent a lifetime performing a penance before dying himself. However, he found no rest in death and his spirit became bound to Maidenmist Cemetery, where he tends to the spirits of the dead and serves as a jailer of the ravening souls from the Shroud within. Now, he is doomed to become a harbinger of death called the Chained Reaper following the incessant corruption of the gibbering spirits he guards (see chapter 19).</p></div>"

The prophecy that has been whispered by the cult of the Old Ways and the servants of the Crooked Queen demands the slaughter of all six of the Fallen, a sacrificial fool called Chuckles, and both Phillip and Adela Druskenvald. And only Kehlenn herself knows that even the Vermintoll Coven and the Crooked Man must be destroyed for the ritual of her glorious rebirth to achieve its full power.</p><p>Throughout the adventure, the characters will inadvertently advance the will of the Crooked Queen through their good deeds. Although they are viewed as pawns by Kehlenn, it’s through their actions that she might ultimately be defeated and sealed away within the Crooked Moon in the climax of the story.</p><p>This means that all the NPCs mentioned above are doomed. If the characters survive to the end of the adventure, Phillip and Adela, the Fallen, the Vermintoll Coven, and even many innocent residents of Wickermoor Hollow will all be dead. The events that take place will save the lives of Druskenvald as a whole, but it will come at great cost, perhaps even requiring the sacrifice of the characters themselves (see chapter 24).</p><h3><strong>Redemption and Salvation?</strong></h3><p>In Folk Horror, there is scarce redemption for the wicked, and the protagonists rarely survive unless they pay a terrible cost. <em>The Crooked Moon</em> adventure is written with this in mind. The villains are meant to be destroyed, and the Druskenvalds are doomed to perish, as is required by the ritual to unleash the Crooked Queen.</p><p>However, your players may sympathize with some of the villains and wish to spare them or find it unconscionable that major NPCs cannot be saved from a terrible fate. While the campaign is designed and written so that all of the Fallen, the Vermintoll Coven, and the Druskenvalds are dead by the end of the story, you may decide to allow the possibility to spare them.</p><p>The simplest way to achieve this is to remove the prophecy and rituals that require the sacrifice of the major figures in the campaign. Kehlenn can simply draw more power as wicked deeds spread through Wickermoor Hollow, eventually allowing for her attempted ascension in the climax of the story.</p><p>Alternatively, you can interpret the requirement for sacrifice in ways that do not lead to death. For instance:</p><ul><li><p>The Fallen must have the Horned King’s sin driven from their souls, causing the death of their wicked identity. For example, sparing and redeeming Lethica Nightborne still “kills” her Fallen identity of the Weeping Widow.</p></li><li><p>The Vermintoll Coven must be driven from their lairs so that they lose their source of power without being slain.</p></li><li><p>Phillip and Adela Druskenvald must lose their hope and their pride, with the act of falling so low being enough for Kehlenn to achieve her goals.</p></li><li><p>Any surviving and redeemed villains leave Wickermoor Hollow forever and don’t aid the characters in their quest.</p></li></ul><p>It is up to you how you approach the adventure and account for the changes and potential “butterfly effects” that result from choosing to spare these figures.</p></div>"

          "name": "Wickermoor Hollow",
          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap08 bottom-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">Wickermoor Hollow</p><p>The entirety of <em>The Crooked Moon</em> adventure takes place within the valley known as Wickermoor Hollow. This minor province of Druskenvald is isolated from the rule and watchful eye of the Crescent Court and especially Phillip Druskenvald, thanks to the rising power of Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen.</p><h2>Locations and Landscapes</h2><p>In Folk Horror, the landscapes where the stories take place are just as important as the vile antagonists and doomed protagonists that drive the action forward. The wide variety of rural locations and natural settings throughout this adventure are intended to increase the feeling of isolation among the characters.</p><p>Review the details of each location within Wickermoor Hollow so you can incorporate them into the adventure and leverage evocative descriptions to best achieve an atmospheric tone perfect for Folk Horror.</p><h3><strong>Wickermoor Village</strong></h3><p>At the heart of Wickermoor Hollow lies the town that shares its name. The oldest and largest settlement in the valley, it is still a relatively small and isolated village that does not get many visitors. Its people have built a community that lives in harmony with each other and with nature to survive the incredible dangers and lurking horrors that dominate the valley.</p><p>However, beneath the surface operates a sinister cult that serves the Crooked Queen and seeks to bring about her return, even in the face of their own annihilation. Even the friendliest, smiling face can belie a wicked worshipper of Kehlenn who intends to sacrifice their neighbor when the time is right.</p><p>Wickermoor Village sits on the banks of the Silverbell River that cuts through the valley from the Drowned Crossroads to Moonsong Lake. Nestled within the gloomy moors that rise near the center of the hollow, it serves as the hub of trade and commerce between the primarily human residents that call this place home (see chapter 11).</p><h3><strong>The Foxwillow Farmland</strong></h3><p>To the east of Wickermoor Village stretches miles of fertile farmland that has been turned into fields that grow all manner of crop. Many small farming settlements dot the landscape, but at the center of the farmers who work the soil is the community of Foxwillow. These nearly picturesque fields and hills serve as the breadbasket for the rest of Wickermoor Hollow (see chapter 13).</p><h3><strong>The Howlers</strong></h3><p>The western border of the valley is walled in by a towering mountain range with snow-capped peaks. The Howlers, named for the wind that rips through the towering summits, stand as the impassable barrier to much of the rest of Druskenvald. The town of Dawn’s Gate sits in the foothills, surviving on the hunting and mining that the mountains provide (see chapter 14).</p><h3><strong>The Drowned Crossroads</strong></h3><p>At the lowest point of the valley is the teeming swamp called the Drowned Crossroads. This treacherous bayou is known for its miles of still, black water, choking overgrowth, and lurking predators that threaten to swallow even the most experienced swampfolk. Its largest town, Murkwater Bend, is a lawless haven for anyone hoping to escape the societal rule of the other settlements across the valley (see chapter 15).</p><h3><strong>Moonsong Lake</strong></h3><p>The Silverbell River empties into the vast Moonsong Lake at the western edge of the valley, which is prone to bouts of rain that can last for weeks. At the center of the lake rests the Isle of Mourn, which once served as a place of healing despite the near-constant gloomy weather. However, its seemingly placid waters are teeming with wriggling parasites (see chapter 17).</p><h3><strong>Hartsblight Forest</strong></h3><p>The wood in the northwest corner of the valley has been overrun by a terrible blight that afflicts all plants, animals, and people that enter Hartsblight Forest. Thousands of varieties of fungus thrive in the alien-looking woodland as the dominant life form, and even the air between the trees is choked with virulent spores (see chapter 18).</p><h3><strong>Maidenmist Cemetery</strong></h3><p>The sprawling hills south of Wickermoor Village roll all the way to the southern border of the valley, covered in tombstones and crypts. Serving as the final resting place of the dead of Wickermoor Hollow, the vast Maidenmist Cemetery is a region of its own, and it’s even said that the iron gates inch further outward every passing night (see chapter 19).</p><h3><strong>The Wytchwood</strong></h3><p>The oldest and wildest part of Wickermoor Hollow is the forbidden forest called the Wytchwood. All those who venture past its shrouded tree line never return, and the eerie howls, roars, snarls, and bellows of the strange creatures within can be heard from miles away. People across the valley feel drawn to the wood, called by the beast that stalks between its primeval trees (see chapter 24).</p><h2>Ideologies and Power Groups</h2><p>While various beliefs are spread throughout Wickermoor Hollow, four primary ideologies have taken hold among most of the common folk of the valley. These factions are most prevalent among the residents of Wickermoor Village but can be found in other settlements as well. While some of these groups might have more members that are good or evil, membership in any of the ideologies doesn’t guarantee how any of its adherents will act.</p><p>Additionally, these groups are not factions in the traditional sense with official membership and processes for joining. Instead, people might be associated with a group based on their beliefs or actions but are not necessarily zealots or advocates for any particular worldview.</p><h3><strong>The Followers of the Old Ways</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Followers%20of%20the%20Old%20Ways-%20good%20and%20back%20combined.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>The Followers of the Old Ways kneel to the natural and supernatural world that surrounds them. This faith is the standard belief system of the people of Wickermoor Village, and its members believe that adhering to the Old Ways has allowed for their settlement to have survived for centuries and grow to a level of relative prosperity in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>Highly superstitious, those who revere the Old Ways bow to and seek to appease the protective and destructive sides of nature and its spirit world counterpart. The personification of the Old Ways is a primordial fey entity called the Green Queen who embodies both nature and magic. However, most worshipers do not know that the true identity of their goddess is Kehlenn, who has turned crooked after millennia of hateful imprisonment.</p><p>The Followers of the Old Ways believe that survival in a world such as Druskenvald is a privilege and a miracle—and never guaranteed. They accept with open arms nature’s blessings as well as the utter destruction and death it can cause.</p><p>To them, individual life is a tiny insignificance in the scope of the community; they are happy and willing to sacrifice themselves or others if it means honoring and appeasing the Old Ways and guaranteeing a greater existence and prosperity for the collective whole in the years to come. Most practitioners of the Old Ways perform numerous rituals in their nightly lives and always strive to listen to the elders and the wisest among them.</p><p>The majority are not evil or actively attempting to serve the Crooked Queen. Only the most devout and enlightened have formed a secretive cult of the Old Ways that practices malign and forbidden magic to serve Kehlenn, the Crooked Man, and the Vermintoll Coven.</p><p>This sect manipulates the unaware and more benevolent adherents of the Green Queen to bring about the ascension of the Crooked Queen and the eventual disintegration of all sapient life. These cultists know that they too will die but are seeking a glorious rebirth in the new crooked order of things. As soon as Phillip and Adela Druskenvald arrive in Wickermoor Hollow, they begin to advance their plans toward this end.</p><p>On the surface, the benevolent symbol utilized by the general members of the Followers of the Old Ways is a feminine face made from green leaves. However, the more malign cultists who seek to unleash the Crooked Queen recognize each other by wearing or displaying the symbol of an antlered hare. This might be a tattoo, a piece of jewelry, or an actual hare foot kept somewhere on them for “good luck.”</p><h3><strong>The Fold of the Patient Lady</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Fold%20of%20the%20Patient%20Lady.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>The members of the Fold of the Patient Lady believe in harmony between sapient life and the forces of nature. They reject that nature is brutal, destructive, and uncaring and instead believe that it provides everything that sapient life needs to thrive without need for archaic and barbaric sacrifice and appeasement.</p><p>This newer reinterpretation of the Old Ways is a more palatable and perhaps naïve view of nature that has been quite appealing to the folk of the valley, and it has gained in popularity outside of Wickermoor Village. There are adherents in many of the larger communities, but most of the practitioners live in remote communes in the wilds.</p><p>The faithful of this sect are genuinely grateful to survive in such a dour and dangerous world and believe that the goddess known as the Patient Lady is to thank, giving her the credit for the ability to survive and grow food in a realm with no daytime and no seasonal cycle. They also eschew any dabbling in the spirit world or supernatural realms, considering such a thing a foolish and dangerous invitation for malevolent forces to corrupt the wilds.</p><p>Its adherents still perform rituals and rites in honor of the Patient Lady, but they keep them incredibly simple and tied to the natural world around them. This can even take the form of basic meditation outdoors, a walk through the woods and fields with fellow faithful, or the utterance of a song or prayer at harvest time.</p><p>The members of the Fold of the Patient Lady wear symbols that represent the beauty and bounty of nature. Flowers such as daisies and primroses and fruit such as apples and pumpkins are frequent symbols of these folk.</p><h3><strong>The Brightsingers</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Brightsingers.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>Only a small handful of people in Wickermoor Hollow are among the faithful that call themselves the Brightsingers. This new monotheistic sect believes in one true divine power that brings light to the land of darkness. They hold that their omnipresent and omniscient god, the Brightsinger, is the only path to goodness and prosperity, holding that the realms of nature and spirit in Druskenvald are inherently wicked and corrupted.</p><p>They attempt to spread their belief through pilgrimage and missionary work, advocating for their beliefs through relentless kindness and benevolence, never scolding or criticizing members of other faiths. However, there is a supreme pride among them because they believe they themselves to be as godly as their deity. The Brightsinger is all, so each member of the faithful is a Brightsinger themselves.</p><p>They see his presence in the songbirds that still sing brightly in the land of eternal night. They alone preach unconditional love and light in the hollow, but it is often a self-righteous and self-aggrandizing love that holds little sway over the population who have seen too much suffering to believe in a love on that scale.</p><p>The Brightsingers wear brightly colored clothes and jewelry, particularly fashioned from valuable materials and displaying fine craftsmanship. This attire often depicts images of suns, torches, lanterns, or brilliantly colored songbirds.</p><h3><strong>The Newcomers</strong></h3><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_WICKVIL_Newcomers.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p>The group known as the Newcomers embraces reason, modernity, progress, and civilization. Often having traveled to Wickermoor Hollow from other provinces of Druskenvald or even from cities in the material world, they reject the beliefs and practices of the superstitious ideologies prominent in the valley.</p><p>Instead, they focus on what can be achieved and explained through knowledge, science, and technology. Phillip Druskenvald shares similar tenets with the Newcomers and easily makes friends with members of this scarce group throughout Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p>These folks are not an organized group, and they share no symbols or rites. They are identified as Newcomers by the other folk in the area rather than self-identifying as a cohesive group.</p></div>"

Having survived for centuries by heeding nature in its bounty and wrath, these simple folk have a certainty in their beliefs and an assurance that all will be well, despite the strange, supernatural, and often violent happenings around them. It is here where the characters must learn to live and find their place.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Wickermoor Village is the oldest settlement in Wickermoor Hollow, the valley for which it’s named. The circumstances of its founding are as forgotten as its founder, but the people that live there take comfort in the Old Ways they adhere to, which haven’t changed in many generations. While the village is simple and rustic, many comforts and services offered in other small towns can be found here, and things have been relatively prosperous for the community even in the face of the occasional death or terror.</p><p class=\"p7\">Despite being so isolated from the rest of Druskenvald, the people of Wickermoor Village are welcoming to outsiders, though they secretly try to persuade newcomers to join the community and worship the Old Ways.</p><p class=\"p7\">To the unwary visitor, the town seems uneventful. However, it harbors a secret. A wicked cult operates in the shadows, communing with the malevolent specter known as the Crooked Man and the trio of revolting hags called the Vermintoll Coven. They seek to unleash Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen, and bring about the incarnation of her consort, the Horned King. If not stopped, their scheming will lead to the disintegration of all Druskenvald.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Wickermoor Village will serve as the central hub for <em>The Crooked Moon</em> campaign, from which frequent excursions will take the characters to various settlements throughout Wickermoor Hollow. Phillip and Adela Druskenvald will reside here for much of the adventure.</p><p class=\"p7\">The village contains several NPCs and locations central to the events of the adventure’s main plot, as well as suggestions for various side quests. Many other NPCs have little direct bearing on the narrative of the adventure, but you can use them to expand upon your own subplots and encounters. Most NPCs can interweave with characters’ stories and goals through Fateweaving (see chapter 9).</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap11 bottom-page\"><p class=\"h2\">A Wickermoor Welcome</p><p>Once the wolf attack is dealt with, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The door of a large building facing the town square opens, and a short and portly middle-aged man emerges. He wears a finely tailored three-piece suit and a matching bowler hat, the latter of which he removes in deference as he approaches.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s7\"><em><strong>“A thousand apologies for the chaos, Lord Phillip! We were not expecting you this evening, and you caught us in the middle of one of our sacred traditions.</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p10\"><em><strong>Please accept my sincere and heartfelt welcome to Wickermoor Village. I am Mayor Wendel Somerton. I am so pleased you’ve finally accepted my invitation to our humble community.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s9\">Mayor Somerton welcomes the characters and the Druskenvalds with grace and warmth, explaining that the attempted sacrifice they stumbled upon was a yearly ritual to feed the beasts of the woods and the roots of the great oak with an offering of lifeblood. Such a sacrifice in honor of the Green Queen (see “Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen” in chapter 8) ensures bountiful hunts and healthy livestock for the coming year.</span></p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20maps%20internal/11-1_The_Founders_Round.webp\" /><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Sacrificed the Goat?</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters allowed the wolves to devour the baby goat, Mayor Somerton thanks them for not disturbing their customs and assures them that the Green Queen has witnessed their deference to the Old Ways and has granted them her vitality. The characters gain [[/damage 1d12 healing]]{6 (1d12) temporary hit points}.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Saved the Goat?</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters intervened and saved the goat, Mayor Somerton brushes off the interruption of the ritual and claims, “the oak still feeds on the blood of the stalking beasts.” However, a character who succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 17]] check can tell he is disturbed by the disruption but is feigning otherwise due to his desire to ingratiate himself with Phillip and Adela.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Mayor_Wendel_Somerton.webp\" width=\"250\" /><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>What Wendel Knows</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Mayor Somerton is pleasant and welcoming but carries himself with reserved poise. Use the details below to guide the conversation with him:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p12\">He assures Phillip and Adela that the Druskenvald Estate (area V24) is in pristine condition and its servants are ready to fulfill their every want and need.</p></li><li><p class=\"p12\">He shares the town’s history and provides a brief insight to the methods of the Old Ways (see chapter 8).</p></li><li><p class=\"p12\">He suggests establishments the characters should visit (see “Wickermoor Village” later in the chapter) and recommends the Green Queen Inn for lodging.</p></li><li><p class=\"p5\">He presents Wickermoor Village as a prosperous and happy town, but if pressed by a character who succeeds on a [[/check PER DC 15]] or [[/check ITM DC 15]] check, he admits that there have been more disappearances, illnesses, and deaths than usual.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Time to Traverse Town</strong></span></p><p class=\"p5\">When the conversation with Mayor Somerton winds down, Phillip bids the characters farewell.</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>“We’ve had some adventures, eh? Adela and I are exhausted, and I need to see whether this mayor is telling the truth about the state of this manor I apparently own. We’re going to go settle in now, but do come visit tomorrow for dinner!”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">If the characters state they want to stay with the Druskenvalds, Phillip politely declines. He says that he doesn’t know the situation at the estate, and the characters have done enough already. A character who succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 15]] check can tell there is a clear unease about him after the harrowing trip and perhaps more.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Parting Ways.</strong></em> Phillip gives each character [[/award 10gp]] and tells them to get rooms at the inn for the evening—his treat. Then, he and Adela take the path up the hill toward the Druskenvald Estate.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Watchful Eyes.</strong></em> Many townsfolk watched the attempted sacrifice through shuttered windows and cracked doors. Some devout Followers of the Old Ways (see chapter 8) may be offended and feel hostile toward the characters if they disrupted the ritual. Others may be more forgiving and see this as an opportunity to persuade them to convert.</p><p class=\"p7\">Some of the townsfolk recognize Phillip and Adela, but most are unaware of life outside of Wickermoor Hollow. The malevolent cultists in service of the Crooked Queen can see their presence strongly, and the more worldly Newcomers (see chapter 8) know of and admire Phillip’s lordship over Druskenvald.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/maps/map%20region/MAP_11_2_Wickermoor_Village.webp\" /><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>First Night in Town.</strong></em> If characters arrive in the Evening Hour, most businesses are closed. However, the characters can walk the streets to see what’s in town—and they can visit many of the locations and NPCs during the following night before their dinner with the Druskenvalds (see chapter 12).</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Getting Rooms.</strong></em> The only place that rents decent rooms in Wickermoor Village is the Green Queen Inn. Alda Farnum, owner and proprietor, offers single rooms for [[/award -1gp]] per night, or triple rooms for [[/award -2gp]] per night, which includes a hot bath and a hot breakfast in the Twilight Hour. The first night’s sleep for the characters is peaceful and uneventful.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>What Now?</strong></em> From this point forward, you are encouraged to play out the story based on your own inclinations and preferences, as well as the actions and goals of the characters. If you incorporate Fateweaving (see chapter 9) into the adventure, find reasons for the characters to run into their Connection NPCs (see “Wickermoor Village” below).</p><p class=\"p7\">Once the characters are ready to accept the Druskenvalds’ dinner invitation, they can travel up the hill on the northwest side of town to the Druskenvald Estate, which is ready to turn crooked (see chapter 12).</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter11_Wickermoor_Village.webp\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p></p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:4px;bottom:4px;left:4px;right:4px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p></p><p></p></div></div></div>"

Even the most inattentive person doesn’t need much time around Alda to see through her polite façade. Her brown hair is worn up under a hat, and her perfectly tailored outfits exude an air of quiet authority.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\">As a young woman, Alda became disenfranchised with the Old Ways, favoring the prosperity and comfort that modernity provides. However, when she happened upon an ancient tome filled with primeval rituals that harness Kehlenn’s essence, she quickly discovered that she could use such power to grow her wealth and station in life.

He serves as the leader of the Followers of the Old Ways, leading worship of the Green Queen and heading the rituals and rites to harness her power.</p><p class=\"p7\">This has made him a useful pawn of the nefarious cult of the Crooked Queen, unknowingly enacting the plans of her servants. The most impactful of these decisions was the gifting of the Lockwood Estate to Phillip Druskenvald and preparing for his potential arrival.

Her striking white hair is contrasted by an all-black wardrobe.</p><p class=\"p7\">Mori does not follow the faiths of Wickermoor Hollow. Instead, she adheres to the spiritual beliefs of the Strangers (see “The Shroud” in chapter 1) who serve as ferrymen of the dead. She learned much of these beliefs from Yorgrim, the gravedigger (see chapter 19), with whom she works closely in giving the dead their proper burial.</p></div>"

This plot is woven throughout the chapters of this adventure, with each new foe defeated bringing their plan closer to fruition. Refer to the “Back in Wickermoor Village” section of subsequent chapters to see how the town will be affected by the story’s development.</p><p class=\"p7\">However, the information earlier in this chapter includes just a handful of the people, places, and plots that are possible in Wickermoor Village. This town should provide the framework to create your own adventures that you can interweave throughout the events of <em>The Crooked Moon</em>. Use the details below as inspiration for fleshing out the adventure and making it truly your own.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Subplots</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">If you wish to give the characters some downtime from the main plot and steer them toward some lower stakes side quests, you can use the subplots below. You will need to create hooks to draw the characters’ attention to these plots and decide on the details to fit them best in your story. They can be used in between any adventure chapters when the characters return to Wickermoor Village.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>The Return of Gory Gus</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">A year ago, the cold, calculating killer Gus Strong—called “Gory Gus” by the population—was tried and then beheaded before the Oak of Many Faces (area V10) as punishment for his crimes. On the anniversary of his beheading, one of the townsfolk is murdered in the same way that Gus killed his victims. Evidence points to one of the characters being the killer. Clues can be found and followed to exonerate the character, showing that Gory Gus’s apprentice has picked up her master’s gory trade.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>A Bad Seed</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Villagers begin falling ill under mysterious circumstances during a special picnic celebrating a recent rich bounty of fruit, honey, and dairy. Clues at the picnic point to cursed apples being the culprit. The characters can investigate the apple orchard, where one of the townsfolk has entered a pact with Fiends in return for riches and power. The diabolist and the Fiends must be killed to break the withering curse that is affecting the picnic attendees.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>The Bloody Cup</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The village hosts an annual sporting and gaming event where teams from different parts of Wickermoor Hollow come together to compete. This year, the events of the competition turn bloody—or bloodier than normal—as “accidents” begin to plague the competition. The characters can compete on behalf of Wickermoor Village or watch, but without their intervention, the competition turns into a bloodbath.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>The Play’s the Deadly Thing</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Hickock and Company, a traveling troupe of actors led by the flamboyant George Hickock, comes to town to perform a play in the Green Queen Inn theater at the request of Alda Farnum. A cast member dies under mysterious circumstances. Can the characters solve the murder? More importantly, can they finish the play titled <em>The Prince in Gold?</em></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>The Lottery</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">A stranger comes to town, promising a great prize for people who willingly take part in a lottery. The stranger fails to reveal that, while the winner does receive a grand prize, someone—or several folks—lose the lottery and must pay a terrible price. The characters can intervene at risk of paying the price themselves.</p></div>"

Atop the highest hill in the gloomy moorland stands a titan made of wicker, casting its crooked shadow over a throng of devotees that sing praises to the Crooked Queen.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>A prophecy (see chapter 8) has been whispered among the Followers of the Old Ways since Kehlenn first stirred within her prison in the Crooked Tree. Following the deaths of the Fallen, the bloody revelries brought forth by the Lord of Fools, and the preparations for sacrifice conducted by the Vermintoll Coven, the final piece of the prophecy is put into place with the capture of Adela Druskenvald.</p><p>Adela’s sacrifice is all that remains to free the Crooked Queen and unleash her twisted, vengeful power upon Phillip Druskenvald and the domain he dared to steal. No fewer than thirteen souls must be consumed by flames within an enormous wicker effigy shaped into the form of the humanity that Kehlenn loathes so much. Among those doomed to burn is the beloved bride of her eons-old foe.</p><p>With the ritual set in motion and the ancient prophecy poised to come to fruition, the Followers of the Old Ways have erected a Wicker Man atop the highest hill in the moors north of Wickermoor Village. This sacred site, known as Rowan’s Rise, is where the Crooked Man makes his final play, drawing forth his ancient power.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Leaving the collapsed remains of the Crooked House behind, the characters follow the massive swarm of spirits—their ethereal cries now mingled with gleeful screams of dying victims—out into the moors toward Rowan’s Rise. Characters have these goals:</p><ul><li><p>Journey across the moors, saving innocent townsfolk from the monsters of the Crooked Queen.</p></li><li><p>Disrupt the ritualistic magic at the standing stones atop Rowan’s Rise.</p></li><li><p>Destroy the animated Wicker Man and annihilate the Crooked Man.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, review the NPCs of Wickermoor Village (see chapter 11) and decide who will be cultists and who will be captives based on the characters’ connections for the most dramatic climax. Read through the encounters across the moors so you can better improvise the innocents’ reactions to the horrors around them. Finally, familiarize yourself with the climactic battle, “Shadow of the Wicker Man,” so that you can deliver a satisfying ending to the Crooked Man’s story arc.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 12th level characters.</p></div>"

This sacred place draws the freed souls to it before they fly off in all directions and fade in an attempt to find rest. Now is the time to save the still-living souls.</p><h2>The Legend of Rowan</h2><p>Many years ago, a young woman named Rowan became enchanted by the moon that forever gazes upon Druskenvald, its gentle light a soft invitation from the heavens. She followed its beckoning glow from her bedroom in Wickermoor Village and disappeared into the moors. When she did not return home, a search party scoured the highlands all night before finding the last trace anyone would ever find of her. Her precious silver locket lay abandoned at the center of a ring of ancient standing stones, the portrait of her beloved sister within replaced by the image of an antlered hare.</p><p>The story told for generations was that Rowan soared into the night sky, flying higher and higher until she could sit upon the Crooked Moon, watching over the people of Wickermoor Hollow forever more. From then on, that great crowned hill was known as Rowan’s Rise.</p><p>Beneath the tale lies the truth… that Rowan became the first human sacrifice to Kehlenn when she first reawakened her power. And so, it is at this sacred site that the Followers of the Old Ways perform the final rites to release the Crooked Queen so that she can reclaim her usurped domain.</p><h2>Sacrifices</h2><p>Each encounter in this section places innocent villagers in peril. Every villager that dies loses their soul to the ongoing sacrificial ritual and feeds the Wicker Man atop the hill. This is made obvious to the characters when, after each death of an innocent, a mote of blue-green light rises from the corpse and is whisked toward the Wicker Man. Keep track of how many villagers perish in the encounters, up to a maximum number noted in each encounter. The total determines how much stronger the Wicker Man becomes in the final confrontation.</p><p>Should the characters fare poorly while moving across the moors or falter in protecting the innocents, they may find themselves overwhelmed. If they retreat, dozens of townsfolk will be sacrificed, and the Wicker Man will achieve its full power, turning its wrath toward Wickermoor Village and the valley beyond until all has turned to ash.</p><h2>What’s at Stake</h2><p>Before parting ways with the Jenkin family at the ruins of the Crooked House, Dani tells the characters that she senses that both Phillip and Adela Druskenvald are on the moors. Adela is trapped in a prison of wicker surrounded by terrified innocents and animals. She can sense Phillip desperately searching the moors but does not know where he is.</p><h2>Crooked Chaos</h2><p>When the characters arrive at the moors, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The moors outside of Wickermoor Village are treacherous even in the best of times.

Remember, there are no heroes here.”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The face of the Crooked Man is replaced by roiling storm clouds, leaving the scattered people to scream in even greater terror.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The Crooked Man has incited mass panic and calls forth the minions of the Crooked Queen to descend upon the numerous potential sacrifices.</p><p>If the characters attempt to get clarity regarding the situation by asking one of the people in their vicinity, choose an NPC who they’ve dealt with in the past and whom they trust.

These ancient agreements bind the land, its magical energies, its creatures—and you. The effects bring boon and bane alike. It may be best for some sinister characters to offer their bargains plainly, letting the lurking curses reveal themselves only when the time is right. Beware your entry into these iniquitous accords.</em></span></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20dark%20bargains/06_DARKBARGAINS_Entering_a_Dark_Bargain.webp\" /><h1 class=\"section\"><span class=\"s3\">Shake on It</span></h1><p class=\"p3\">Any bargain offered by an utterly unknowable, unfathomable power such as those that position themselves within the realm of Druskenvald must be carefully considered by you, your character, and the GM. These gifts are not to be offered lightly and should not be accepted lightly; their mere presence should herald significant roleplaying opportunities now and in the future.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Entering a Dark Bargain</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In nearly all cases, the power that is proposing a Dark Bargain is uninterested in negotiating the duration or eventual cost of this gift. However, there may be extenuating circumstances. There could be roleplaying scenarios or simply the current events in the adventure’s narrative that could cause the power to briefly—briefly!—consider negotiating. The GM has the final say on whether a given bargainer has the inclination to haggle. Generally, characters need the Dark Bargain far more than the powers need to grant it.</p><p class=\"p6\">In any event, Dark Bargains reflect the entity imparting them, as well as the circumstances and any prices asked in exchange. You and the GM should tailor the cosmetic details of the bargain to the character’s situation.</p><p class=\"p6\">There are multiple ways a character might be tempted with power in Druskenvald.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Character Creation</strong></span></h2><p class=\"p3\">With the GM’s permission, you can choose a Dark Bargain when you make your character. Work with the GM to determine the circumstances of your character entering into the bargain, who offered it, and what terms your character had to fulfill—or is still expected to fulfill—to make good on the deal.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\"><strong>During Play</strong></span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Dark Bargains can also come about during play in a campaign. There might be times where inscrutable powers have their own designs and see an opportunity for a character to further those ends in exchange for gifts. Others might be willing to negotiate a bargain as an alternative price to death or worse.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">In these cases, the GM might alter terms of the bargains, such as increasing, lessening, or even waiving the prices of the bargains entirely—though perhaps only for a short time, or as long as some other condition is met.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Birds.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h2><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Unique Bargains</strong></span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Each Dark Bargain is unique, and a character can enter into a given bargain only once. A character could be bound to multiple Dark Bargains at one time, but each one only once.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Removing Dark Bargains</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Dark Bargains are binding once sealed. There are tales and legends of those who have outwitted a bargainer or found a way to break a bargain’s hold on them, but the truth of such stories is left to the GM to decide.</p></div>"

Normally, curses are lasting or permanent negative conditions that require magic or significant effort to end. Chaotic Curses deviate from such curses in several ways:</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Fleeting.</strong> These curses are designed to last a brief amount of real-world time (15-30 minutes or less) and should fade before they become tedious.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Roleplay-Focused.</strong> They add whimsy, surprise, or mayhem to the game without heavily impacting mechanics or combat.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Unpredictable.</strong> These effects alter the characters’ beliefs, appearance, and actions in humorous or unexpected ways.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">Chaotic Curses are entirely optional and should be used with discretion. Groups that prefer less active roleplay or serious folk horror atmosphere should avoid these curses. For those that favor sillier games, even while confronting the many horrors described in this book, these curses add levity and entertainment.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Using Chaotic Curses</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Pangolin.webp\" width=\"200\" /><p class=\"p3\">To distribute Chaotic Curses, use one of the following methods:</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Tarot Deck.</strong> Shuffle a tarot deck and draw a card. Each card is associated with a curse (see the table below), and the card’s position—upright or reversed—determines which curse takes effect. The card can then be removed from the deck permanently or reshuffled into the deck each time.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Rolling Dice.</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>Alternatively, you can roll a d100 and check the corresponding curse on the table below.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Starting and Ending Curses</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/BES_Nightweave%20Spider%20copy.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">Chaotic Curses are best left up to the GM’s discretion, so they occur at unexpected times rather than during intense or pivotal moments. However, you can use mechanical triggers to determine when a curse begins and ends. Here are some ideas that might trigger Chaotic Curses:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p7\">Rolling a natural 1 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Whenever combat ends</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Finishing a long rest</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Touching a cursed object</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Entering a specific location</p></li></ul><p class=\"p3\">Ending curses can also be handled in a variety of ways:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p7\">Expending Heroic Inspiration</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\"><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplRemoveCurs]{Remove Curse}</em> or similar magic</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Healing magic above a certain threshold</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Finishing a short rest</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">GM pity</p></li></ul><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:relative;z-index:3\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px\"><span class=\"s6\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\"><strong>Tarot Interpretations</strong></span></span></p><p class=\"p9\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">The tarot deck is simply used for randomization.

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap01\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Land Between<br />Life and Death</p><p>Druskenvald <em>(DRUSK‑in‑vahld)</em> is a realm that exists outside the lands of the mortal and material. Enveloped in a seemingly endless expanse of eldritch gloom, it exists in a paradoxical state of limbo between the warring furies of life and death. Beyond the misty borders of this domain may lie countless worlds and afterlives, but Druskenvald stands apart—a self-contained demiplane where the living, dead, and everything in between can coexist.</p><p class=\"p2\">Within these confines is a landmass hewn into the shape of a crescent moon and a dark and roiling sea that stretches from its eastern coastline until it disappears into the haze. Looming mountain peaks to the north and south flank the lands between, forming an enormous continent-sized valley that nonsensically spans numerous environments in a relatively short distance and never experiences the turn of a season. The laws of nature and logic have no dominion over a place that is just as much nightmare and folktale as it is a land to explore.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The mystifying nature of Druskenvald is made most apparent by the thirteen major provinces that comprise it. As if pulled from a child’s storybook featuring a broad collection of varying tales, each of these territories has a wholly distinct biome, topography, and climate. From forest to moor, desert to tundra, swamp to farmland, they all exist side by side like a collection of bizarre patches stitched together upon a grandmother’s quilt. Despite the uniqueness of each Druskenvaldian patch, travel between provinces is not especially difficult, and borders can be crossed with a simple step.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_TimeTable_Cuckoo%20clock.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h2><span class=\"s2\">Night of the Crooked Moon</span></h2><p class=\"p1\">In Druskenvald, the sun never rises. Instead, the land is bathed in an orange glow from the horizon for a few brief hours at the height of dusk, only to be swallowed by the encroaching darkness that dominates the rest of the night.</p><p class=\"p2\">The Crooked Moon, an eternal crescent with the visage of a leering hag, hangs eternally overhead. Its light waxes and wanes with the cycle of each night as it moves through the sky with no discernible pattern, casting long, creeping shadows. At times, it looms large in the sky, its baleful eye glowering over the land with malicious intent. At other times, it shrinks to a small sliver nearly lost in the night sky, leaving the land blanketed in total darkness.</p><p class=\"p2\">The people of Druskenvald have adapted to their peculiar 24-hour “day” cycle from the Twilight Hour through the Witching Hour, dividing their time according to the shifting light in their own ways. Some rise as soon as the golden glow of the hidden sun shows itself above the horizon and settle in before the most treacherous hours of night. Others only wake during true darkness. While they may not agree on how to honor Druskenvald’s time, all peoples and provinces have aligned on the same naming conventions for the phases of each passing night.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Kehlenn, the Crooked Queen</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Before Druskenvald became the harrowing realm it is today, it was a place of vibrant life and rebirth, ruled by Kehlenn <em>(KEH‑linn)</em>, the Green Queen. This afterlife demiplane was an enormous forest, teeming with “green magic” that facilitated the natural cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Mortal souls would journey here to be reincarnated as plants, animals, and other natural beings, contributing to the eternal cycle.</p><p class=\"p3\">Kehlenn was a Fey queen, neither benevolent nor malevolent, but a guardian of this natural order. She believed in the sanctity of the cycle, where each death brought forth new life, and the essence of the departed merged with the vibrant flora and fauna of the realm. Her dominion was one of serene balance, where the natural world thrived in an endless loop of renewal, untouched by the corrupting influences of sentient ambition and desire.</p><p class=\"p3\">Kehlenn’s vision of peace reigned until Phillip Druskenvald arrived. Where he came from and how he discovered this realm of rebirth is forgotten to all including Phillip himself, but his appearance initiated a cataclysmic conflict that left Kehlenn a hollow shell of her former self. The once lush forest became the fog-shrouded landscape of Druskenvald. Kehlenn, now the Crooked Queen, retreated to the deepest and darkest wood within Wickermoor Hollow, a minor province and the only one not under the dominion of Phillip and his Crescent Court.</p><p class=\"p3\">In this weakened state, she lingers nearly dormant as she waits to reclaim her domain. Her bitterness festers, and she whispers the words of the Old Ways to those who will listen. Many of the monsters and creatures not shaped by the nature of their provinces have been made bent and crooked by the hateful spite of the Crooked Queen.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Phillip and Adela Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">Since coming to power, Phillip Druskenvald has attempted to shape the realm he named after himself into a reflection of his own ideals. A master of unchained ambitions, he envisions a realm where civilization crushes the wild pulse of nature, where order reigns supreme over the primal chaos of the afterlife. In his mind, he has crafted a sanctuary—a place where souls are reborn into lives filled with the pleasures and comforts they once knew, no longer bound by the harsh cycles of nature.</p><p class=\"p3\">In Phillip’s eyes, he is a benevolent ruler who has given the inhabitants of Druskenvald a second chance at life, which he believes to be the ultimate desire of every mortal. However, as the years have gone on, he has become out of touch with the people for whom he is responsible. Often aloof and completely unaware of the realities of living in Druskenvald, he presumes that the inhabitants of Druskenvald are having as good and easy a time as he is.</p><p class=\"p3\">At Phillip’s side stands his beloved wife Adela <em>(uh‑DELL‑uh)</em>, the most precious soul in existence to him. Adela was once a mortal woman living in the material world, but one born with immense powers of divination and prophecy. Her unbound curiosity, enthusiasm, and drive, along with an obsession with the spiritual world, drew her to seek out the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>. It is there she met Phillip, and the two fell deeply in love and were promptly married. She now assists her husband and is invaluable in the governance of Druskenvald.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_Weasel%2001.webp\" width=\"300\" class=\" centered\" /><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Crescent Court</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">The Druskenvalds do not rule the domain alone. There are thirteen major provinces, each with a lord or lady who governs and embodies the essence of their territory. Some of these nobles are members of the origin species of their province, while others, though different in form, still represent the province’s spirit. These diverse leaders form the Crescent Court, a council that governs all of Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p3\">The nobles of the Crescent Court enjoy a significant degree of autonomy in the governance of their provinces with little direct oversight from Phillip. As long as each province maintains order and does not disrupt the affairs of neighboring provinces or the Druskenvalds themselves, the lords and ladies are free to rule as they see fit.</p><p class=\"p3\">Several times a year, the Crescent Court gathers at Chateau Clair de Lune <em>(sha‑TOH KLAIR‑duh‑LOON)</em>, the Druskenvalds' sprawling manor. The home was built by Phillip to Adela’s exacting design, and it serves as an ideal place of residence and headquarters for the domain’s leadership. When court is called, there is pageantry and celebration, but important matters are discussed and crucial decisions are made regarding the governance of Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p3\">Oftentimes, the primary focus of the meetings is on the malefic machinations of the Coven of the Midnight Moon. This coven of thirteen witches is led by a powerful crone known as Mother Midnight. She and her daughters work in the shadows, terrorizing the thirteen major provinces of Druskenvald to some incomprehensible end.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Shroud</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">No matter the power of the beings that dwell in Druskenvald, virtually none can pierce the wall of fog that encircles it. The phantom gloom, known among the inhabitants of Druskenvald as the Shroud, appears as a dense gray mist that wails in a chorus of agonized voices. The Shroud is, in reality, the condensed essence of the primordial element of death itself given form. It lingers just beyond the fringes of the mortal realms and serves as the veil that separates the lands of the living and the dead.</p><p class=\"p3\">All souls not offered salvation by the hallowed or delivered damnation by the hells must pass through the Shroud on their way to the afterlife to which they are destined. They must first be led through the mist by the Strangers—timeless beings with the power to safely guide the dead to the other side. While these entities use many methods and take many forms, such as shepherds, ferrymen, reapers, or angels of death, all are bound to their solemn duty for eternity. Without the protective shield of a Stranger, the phantom mist annihilates wayward souls and devours their anima, the quintessential soul-stuff that provides all beings spiritual identity and sentience.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The Vagrant and the Ghostlight Express</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">The Vagrant <em>(VAY‑grint)</em> is the enigmatic Stranger who ferries souls to Druskenvald, possessing the unique ability to come and go from the domain as he pleases. All others must be guided by him aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, a spectral locomotive powered by the Shroud itself. The old black ghost train traverses the boundaries between life and death, unbound to any track as it courses through the mists. This mysterious mechanical ferry is the only means of passage in and out of Druskenvald for all, living or dead.</p><p class=\"p3\">None know the Vagrant’s origin, how he came to cooperate with Phillip, or his ultimate aims. Whether or not it is his true form, the visage he favors is that of an amiable frogman dressed in ragged clothing. The sole conductor of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, he is known by all passengers for his charming demeanor and love of stories and fiddle tunes.</p><p class=\"p3\">In the mortal realms, the Vagrant’s mirthful fiddle and haunting whistles herald the arrival of the ghost train, which emerges seemingly out of nowhere, rolling in on a bank of dense fog. It is said that only the dead may see this arrival, but there are a few fortunate, or perhaps unfortunate, living souls who have discovered how to gain passage while still alive.</p><h2><span class=\"s1\">The People of Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Souls that arrive in Druskenvald are reborn into a wide variety of species, including those which inhabit the world of the living. However, the realm’s predominant populace is comprised of thirteen distinct species, each having originated from one of the thirteen shrouded provinces.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">The origins of these species are as varied as the land itself, some rising from the landscape, others being crafted by the provincial lords, and still more arriving from magical phenomena, emerging into Druskenvald as fully formed adults, infants, or any age in between. In just as many instances, the rebirth is initiated by two parents seeking a child through biological, magical, or technological means.</p><p class=\"p3\">No matter the species, most inhabitants of Druskenvald emerge anew, their memories of a past life erased, allowing them to live their next life with a clean slate. A few cling to fragments of their former selves, their memories either shrouded in mist or vivid and unyielding. Even rarer are those with a fully clear picture of their past life, even remembering their moment of death. While many of these beings remain in their province of origin, others choose to roam across Druskenvald and settle in other communities.</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Besides the thirteen species native to Druskenvald, humans are the most populous species found in the realm compared to other folk such as dwarves, elves, or halflings. This is due to the deep connection that Phillip and Adela Druskenvald have to the domain they rule. Despite having become deathless, immortal beings long ago, their once-human hearts have left a clear imprint upon the land.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s1\">Death in Druskenvald</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">There is no guarantee of the fate that befalls those who die again while in the confines of this realm of rebirth. For many, the cycle starts once more, and the soul of the recently deceased is reborn as one of the species of Druskenvald. Sometimes, they return as the same species they had been in life, but just as often, they awaken as an entirely different one.</p><p class=\"p3\">Some experience a “Final Death,” where the soul simply fades into oblivion and ceases to exist. For those who were particularly wicked in their second chance at life, the Shroud claims it. The soul’s anima is devoured, and the spirit is transformed into a shrieking abomination doomed to wander the eldritch fog forever.</p><p class=\"p3\">Rarely, the souls of the dead are reincarnated by the original nature of Kehlenn’s domain and are turned into plants or animals by whatever lingering remnants of green magic still pervade the realm. These souls, marked by the Crooked Queen herself, are warped into the crooked monsters that lurk in the old places and stalk along the fringes of civilization.</p></div>"

When wayward souls cross the boundary from their world to wander among the oak, ash, and thorn, they belong to the trees. Dry your eyes. The Elderwood weeps for them now.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Elder Gallows -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p4\">Ardengloom <em>(AR‑din‑gloom)</em> is a warning whispered by candlelight, a wood so ancient that all know its name. In a time beyond memory, the primordial forest enveloped the entirety of Druskenvald. Though now only a fraction of its former glory, its towering, gnarled trees are the last barrier between civilization and the unknown. For as long as there have been voices, songs have been sung of the terrors that lurk in the umbral heart of the wood.</p><p class=\"p5\">The province of Ardengloom is a land of dark forests, twisting shadows, and echoes of the long-dead feyfolk who once dwelled there. Though dangerous to outsiders, deep within the twisting roots and choking shadows lies a shrouded society. Living in remote settlements throughout the great wood, the gnarlborn are a people grown from the forest itself, resembling their treant ancestors with bark-like skin and haunting, glowing faces. These folk, along with the other species of the dark forest, stand as sentinels against those who wish to exploit their primordial home.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Ancient Elderwoods</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">The Elderwoods are the oldest and largest of the trees within Ardengloom and Druskenvald as a whole. Within each of their broad trunks is a face of knotted wood and cracked bark. Should harm come to the wood in which they are rooted, they weep viscous, amber sap in response to that shared pain. It is believed that within each Elderwood is the soul of a long-dead Fey—the last remnants of a once-mighty oaken empire.</p><p class=\"p5\">The venerable language of the Elderwoods is so ancient that many folk of Ardengloom have forgotten how to speak it. Now, these primordial beings communicate the will of the woods through the subtle shifting of leaves or swaying of branches, while those attuned to the Old Ways may even hear their voices on the wind.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Mists of Tirna Féth</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">On nights when the moonlight pierces through the dense canopy, a soft, blue mist forms on the breeze and billows into the surrounding forests. The Mists of Tirna Féth <em>(TEER‑nuh FETH)</em>, as they are known in legend, blanket the wood in an eerie dew, thought to be the lost souls of the feyfolk that once thrived in the glades and glens of Ardengloom.</p><p class=\"p5\">Most who find themselves caught in the mist are trapped—forced to wander the gloom forever. The lost no longer have an understanding of time or place, and nearly all meet their end. The lucky few who emerge from the mists tell tales of being helped or hindered by confounding fey spirits or following the ghostly luminance of a will-o’-wisp.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/card/card%20tarot/01_INT_DRS_Ardengloom_Elder%20Gallows%20woodcarving.webp\" width=\"200\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Elder Gallows</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">Gnarled treants are not an uncommon sight in Ardengloom, and Elder Gallows is by far the oldest and largest of all who walk the woods. The lord of Ardengloom is so old that only the most timeworn of trees remember his true name, and none, not even the Elderwoods, dare speak it.</p><p class=\"p5\">True to his name, nooses hang interspersed among his knotted branches as a constant reminder of the fate that will befall those who encroach upon and dare to defile his primordial realm. Having borne witness to so much of the forest’s destruction, he has become bitter toward outsiders and even his fellow lords of the Crescent Court. However, his contempt is controlled by his unmatched patience, for he knows that he and the forest will outlast them all.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Silhouette</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">It is said that even the darkness fears the witch of Ardengloom, and those venturing into the tree line of the province who do not heed this warning never return. Appearing as a looming shadow with glowing embers for eyes, Sister Silhouette slinks between the trees of the deepest parts of the forest, twisting the shadows cast by her cursed lantern into a wicked extension of her form, enveloping and snuffing out the life essence of travelers lost in the wood. By the time her victims see the pinprick of light through the yawning darkness, it is too late.</p><p class=\"p5\">Sister Silhouette’s shadows are a malevolent, corrupting force capable of blighting even the mightiest Elderwood trees. This sickness corrupts the primordial fey spirits that dwell within the trees, causing black sap to run like tears down rotten bark. Every night, Sister Silhouette spreads the malady deeper into the wood and collects the vile sap to fuel her lantern so that it may eventually cast her shadow across all of Ardengloom.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Gloaming Gulch</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">Deep within the shrouded heart of Ardengloom lies Gloaming Gulch, a flourishing city built into the very trees themselves. Spanning from the tangled roots to the towering canopy overhead, the capital is the center of society for the gnarlborn and the other species that call the forest home. Great rings of standing stones are found on the forest floor, weathered by time and enveloped by moss and lichen. It is here that the Old Ones, a group of revered treants, hold the great Gnarlmoot. This assembly, led by Elder Gallows, gathers to discuss solutions to the problems plaguing the province.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Ardengloom_Petula%20Moon%20Shadows%20Gourd.webp\" width=\"200\" /><p class=\"p5\">Deeply isolated from the rest of the province, Gloaming Gulch is the closest thing Ardengloom has to a city. The concept of currency is wholly foreign to those who live here. Goods are bartered at grand treetop markets, and the entire way of life for the gnarlborn is predicated on a system of honor and respect. However, those who violate the laws and customs of the gulch find themselves facing merciless justice, and the bones of countless trespassers are forever lost among the roots of the Elderwoods.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Maze of the Dreamers</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p4\">Legends are told of a mysterious, overgrown maze built into the forest from stone, earth, branch, and bush. Marked by an archway that shimmers with emerald light, the countless miles of labyrinthian, enchanted woodland murmurs with the faint song of beasts, birds, and the old gods of the forest.</p><p class=\"p5\">Alluring song beckons unwary travelers into the Maze of the Dreamers. The lost are doomed to wander endlessly or be consumed by grasping brambles, choking ivy, or the gnashing jaws of the impossibly ancient creatures within. However, it is said that those who brave the labyrinth and best its challenges will arrive at the Green Dream, the dwindled ethereal realm of the few surviving fey folk from the lost ages of Druskenvald.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Ardengloom</span></h2><p class=\"p4\">Each journey into the tangled heart of Ardengloom tempts adventurers to confront the shadows that corrupt the ancient land.</p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s3\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.3j2rk2xKKPrQQ5Jl]{Ardengloom Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

Each one is a thread that connects past, present, and future. When woven together in their multitudes, the tapestry of fate is illuminated to those with clear eyes and open minds. No matter the lateness of the hour, if you look to the heavens and truly see, you will never be lost in the darkness.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Headmistress Narcissa Voss -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">Astramar <em>(ASS‑truh‑mar)</em> is a place of light in a realm shrouded in the darkness of eternal night. While the sun never rises, the glittering stars that shine down upon the towering mountains and rolling hills of the province cast it in luminant shades of blue, made even brighter by the magical ley lines that streak across its landscape. This azure brilliance illuminates not only the land and sky of Astramar but also the inquisitive and aspiring minds of the people who live there.</p><p class=\"p4\">The harpy-like azureborn are most prominent in Astramar, descending from the night sky as they are reborn. However, the province draws all those who wish to study the arcane arts from across Druskenvald—and even beyond the Shroud. While magical energies of all varieties radiate through the province, the cosmic guidance of the stars and other celestial bodies that fill the cerulean skies are especially leveraged by clairvoyants, soothsayers, and other such practitioners of divination magic.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Winds of Aither</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In eons past, the domain now known as Astramar was the site of an impossibly powerful ritual that called down storms of arcane energy from the stars themselves. This suffused the entire province with aither<em> (AY-thur)</em>—condensed arcane energy that spellcasters can draw upon to empower their magic. This volatile essence whips through the sky and crackles across the land, forming interconnected strands of power that are constantly shifting like complex wind patterns.</p><p class=\"p4\">The people of Astramar rely on aither for their magical way of life, looking to the skies and the landscape to trace the ley line patterns and following the stars to divine how they will change each night. They collect the arcane substance in azure crystals embedded in the ground or held aloft in the heavens atop great towers. These crystal foci send the winds of aither across the province, fueling the enchantments, conjurations, and countless other spells that provide a wondrous life to all its inhabitants, even those born without an affinity for magic.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Stygian Depths</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In stark contrast to the illuminated landscapes of Astramar, far below its mountainous surface is a sprawling network of caverns called the Stygian Depths, where far less wondrous and beautiful things lurk. Within these subterranean chambers, death itself thrives—the true cost of harnessing volatile aither.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">The aither-touched souls of Astramar’s mages are all at risk of being ripped from their bodies with one wrong incantation or misappropriation of a spell. When such a miscast occurs, the spirit is pulled into the underworld and joins the numerous souls that form the River Atropos, which snakes through the entirety of the Stygian Depths. The spectral waters of this river can be utilized for even stranger and more profane rituals, but meddling with the damned is extremely dangerous and can drain one’s youth, magic, and vitality in mere moments.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Headmistress Narcissa Voss</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">As well as ruling the whole of Astramar, Narcissa Voss <em>(nar‑SISS‑uh VAHSS)</em> serves as the headmistress of the illustrious magical academy Gandorhal. As an azureborn, her features are owl-like, with white feathers that almost appear as spectacles that frame wizened yet determined blue eyes. Voss is known among the other nobles of the Crescent Court for being especially stern, proud, and cold, but she exhibits surprising warmth and patience with all of her students and prioritizes their tutelage above most of her other duties.</p><p class=\"p4\">When she is not overseeing the academy or ruling the province from her tower in Lunarium, teleporting between both locations with a single incantation, she looks to the stars as a master of divination, seeking to foresee threats to her people. While she can see many possible futures, fate can always be twisted and changed, and she often joins her most powerful mages in weaving monumental spells that protect the peoples of Astramar.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Astramar_Headmistress%20Narcissa%20Voss%20marble%20facade%20fresco.webp\" width=\"400\" class=\" centered\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Effigy</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The deadly and stunning Sister Effigy dwells in a ruined city-sized stone palace deep within the darkest cavern of the Stygian Depths. Nearly statuesque in her appearance, with a head covered in writhing, venomous snakes, she is consumed by vanity and bitter jealousy for all those she perceives as more beautiful or powerful than her. Effigy draws the waters of the River Atropos and spins them like threads into malign and mutating spells that transform beast and person alike into horrific monsters.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Viewing herself as the loving mother of her creations, she waits and plots for the opportune moment when hordes of her monstrous children will spill up from the underworld and rampage across Astramar, tearing their great and beautiful cities down so that none shall be as impressive as her crumbling ruin of a lair. Until then, she magically molds new stone blocks, pillars, and statues for her ever-growing palace to feed her unquenchable thirst for grandeur.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Lunarium</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s6\">Lunarium <em>(loo‑NAR‑ee‑uhm)</em> is Astramar’s grand capital, filled with ornate spires and towers that reach high into the night sky, as if trying to reach the very stars from which the azureborn are created. Despite the diverse population of practitioners of the arcane, the city was constructed with flight-capable beings in mind, including floating domes, landing platforms, and structure entrances that lead out into the clouds. While easily navigable by the azureborn, those without flight must explore the city on floating arcane discs easily controlled by even the least magical of visitors.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">The capital, fueled by great arcane crystals thrumming with aither, contains numerous homes, schools, and cultural centers that shine like the stars the province reveres. One of the most prominent and famous landmarks of the city is the Dome of Cygnus, an enormous observatory said to have been built by Lunarium’s founder. Numerous enchanted telescopes protrude from the structure, allowing stargazers from across Druskenvald to seek answers from the cosmos above.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Astramar_Sister%20Effigy%20Buste.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Gandorhal College of the Arcane Arts</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Located on Lake Rommeda <em>(ROM‑meh‑duh)</em> in the misty moors of Astramar, Gandorhal <em>(GAN‑der‑hall)</em> is Druskenvald’s most prestigious magical academy. Students from across all thirteen provinces are drawn to this influential college to hone their arcane skills and knowledge by following a general curriculum that covers all types of magic.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, the institution provides the opportunity for students to specialize in one particular school, dividing each year’s class into eight houses to foster the growth of talent in each pupil’s selected focus. The labyrinthine halls of Gandorhal are filled with mysteries and dangers that some consider unacceptable for students so young, but the professors believe that the necessity to defend oneself with magic is the best path to mastery.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Astramar</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In Astramar, adventurers delve into arcane mastery and celestial mysteries that intertwine with magical academia, the sinister secrets of the Stygian Depths, and the volatile forces of the arcane landscape.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.cjxpS2y5xFRTw5TV]{Astramar Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

A warrior claims it with strength, a merchant with wealth, a priest with faith, and a monarch with birth. But claiming power does not grant it, and what these claimants hold is the mere illusion of it. True power is held by those who understand that all peoples, from the rulers to the ruled, care not for any of these ideals and are driven solely by the instinct to survive and reproduce.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Doctor Molder Underfoot -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">The plague-ridden province of Bubonia <em>(boo‑BOH‑nee‑ah)</em> is bleak and shrouded in clouds of miasma and toxic haze. Amidst the instability of rampant disease and strife, rival guilds work and scheme tirelessly to achieve their individual aims, hoping to become the next predominant faction that wields the power and wealth to control all others. Most of the plagueborn and other species of Bubonia lead humble and often short lives, filled with constant fear. However, the guilds provide an opportunity for a life of larger purpose, excitement, and riches.</p><p class=\"p4\">Mutant creatures, twisted by the province itself, wander on all manner of appendages and seek to destroy those still spared from their terrible fate. But perhaps even more dangerous are the plots of the province’s people, where loyalty is fleeting and assassination, backstabbing, and other heinous acts of treachery are common.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Pestilent Haze</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">A sickly, yellowish-green haze hangs in the air of Bubonia, filled with plague, poison, and mutagenic power. It is from these roiling, stinking plumes that newly rebirthed plagueborn emerge, but while the rat-like people are more resistant to the toxic atmosphere than other species of the province, none are immune to the pestilent haze. It works slowly and insidiously, infecting the body, mind, and soul of those who breathe it. Some exhibit terrible physical symptoms and perish, while others are turned to wickedness and commit acts of great evil, but the victims who suffer the worst fate are the ravening, plagued mutants.</p><p class=\"p4\">None understand the purpose of the haze or whether it has a will of its own, but every attempt to banish it from Bubonia has failed, and all that’s left to be done is to manage it and hope to survive. The best defense against the haze that the province’s people possess are huge, ancient windmills that dot the hills, built long before recorded history. The mills’ seemingly decrepit blades are sturdy enough to spin quickly, blowing miles of plague clouds away. However, certain schemers have discovered ways to use the windmills to harness the haze to their own unscrupulous ends.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Five Great Guilds</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">While Bubonia is represented in the Crescent Court, the true power resides among the many guilds that operate throughout the province. However, five great guilds dominate all others, spending equal time working together and sabotaging each other.</p><p class=\"p7\"><strong>The Doomsday Guild.</strong> This league of scientists, alchemists, engineers, and artificers sits at the top of the other four guilds as the ruling faction of Bubonia, simply due to being the only one that can ensure annihilation of the province should they be deposed. Known for their chaotic and destructive weapons of war and doomsday devices, they seek new glory for Bubonia through strange scientific advancement.</p><p class=\"p7\"><strong>The Cheesemonger Guild.</strong> This union of cheese merchants, butchers, bakers, and other tradespeople specializing in foodstuffs is the wealthiest guild, hawking often rotten wares to starving customers at exorbitant rates. Understanding that people are often motivated by their stomachs, they trade nourishment for power, tightening their grip with each transaction as saviors and exploiters.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Bellringer Guild.</strong> Often hidden away in crumbling abbeys across Bubonia, this order of monks, priests, and prophets worships the pestilent haze as a deity called the Great Plagued One. As the keepers of the primary faith of the province, they command legions of zealous adherents, spreading the holy word while administering salves and ointments that cure and spread the plague, all in the name of their pestilent god.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Ratcatcher Guild.</strong> This sordid syndicate of assassins, spies, and saboteurs prefers to skitter through the sewers and run-down alleys of Bubonia’s towns and cities. Known for being willing to kill any mark or infiltrate any space if the price is right, they slip through the shadows with envenomed blades to advance the aims of the powerful aristocrats who hire them.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><strong>The Boltflinger Guild.</strong> This order of monster and mutant slayers is filled with highly skilled hunters and trackers that brave the wilds and the haze to seek and destroy the threats to Bubonia. Given their mission to protect, they may initially seem like the noblest of the guilds; however, they believe no means are too extreme in wiping out the abominations that lurch through the miasma.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Bubonia_Doctor%20Underfoot%20scroll%20pencil%20art.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Doctor Molder Underfoot</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">In a province filled with schemers, its leader must be the one who schemes the best, and that is how Doctor Molder Underfoot maintains control. A plagueborn who has greatly extended her own life through the discovery of alchemical secrets, she serves as master of the Doomsday Guild as well as sitting at the Crescent Court.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Her arsenal of doomsday devices helps keep the other guilds in line, but it is her complete understanding of the minds of those around her that allows her to pull the right strings to always get what she wants. Despite how ruthless and calculating she can be, her ultimate aim is to develop a reliable immunity to the plague and a reversal of the haze’s mutations so that Bubonia can experience a new age of prosperity and safety.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Homunculus</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">As a province with such widespread death, Bubonia serves as the perfect laboratory for the unhinged genius known as Sister Homunculus <em>(huh‑MUNG‑kyuh‑luhs)</em>. Her advancements in strange science infused with occult magic, as well as her artificer skills in arcane machinery, eclipse even the most prestigious members of the Doomsday Guild. Regularly robbing the mass graves of those killed by the plague or the mutants forged by it, she fuses body parts together into horrific flesh-crafted abominations that serve her unquestioningly and assist her in performing increasingly vile experiments on living subjects.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Bubonia_Vellcinda%20Moon%20coin.webp\" width=\"250\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Castle Underbelly</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The capital city of Bubonia is built into the ruins of a colossal castle that had long been abandoned before recorded history. A strange sight to newcomers, this sprawling city is one of the largest population centers in Druskenvald and features ramshackle wooden additions grafted to ancient stone structures.</p><p class=\"p4\">The city is home to thousands of people of all levels of prosperity, separated by the different layers of the castle, with the rich and powerful residing at the tops of great towers connected by heavily guarded walkways, and the most downtrodden attempting to survive far below in a massive sewer system. It also contains the headquarters of all five of the great guilds, each prospering from the surprising amount of trade, commerce, and travel throughout the capital.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Bubonia</span></h2><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">Adventurers in this plague-ridden land face a myriad of challenges—from thwarting guild machinations to surviving the abnormal mutations that roam the blighted landscape.</span></p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.Zk8i8xFFGtaLn4hp]{Bubonia Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

Beneath fiendish volcanic peaks that belch forth ash and the ashborn</span> <span class=\"s3\">that thrive in the province, rich veins of gold and—even more valuable—hell iron ore draw treasure hunters, opportunists, and the truly desperate from far and wide to seek their destiny here.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">There is no law in Chernabos, save for what its people get away with or enforce, whether it be through their might, guile, or luck.

No matter how the dice fall, Chernabos is one hell of a place to make one’s fortune.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Hell Iron</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Hell iron is a fiendish metal, pitch black and streaked with red, perfectly suited for the construction of devilish machinery that can outperform entire factories owned by the largest captains of industry. When enormous deposits of hell iron were discovered deep within the volcanic landscapes of Chernabos, there was an overnight population explosion that dwarfed the various gold rushes the province had experienced for years beforehand. Enterprising folk from all over flocked to Chernabos to join the ashborn and other species of the province, and everyone profited.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Treacherous hell iron mines dot the hills, mountains, ridges, and volcanoes of the province, with the largest concentration bored throughout the hellfire-spewing Sulfur Mountain. The constant threat of cave-ins, hellfire eruptions, and the unearthing of malevolent Fiends deters many from stepping into a mine. Yet still they flock, for the fiendish metal is more valuable than gold, and coins and bars made from it are used as currency across Chernabos.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Chernabos_Ol-Mister-Scratch-playing-card.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Devil Rail</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Built and operated by the Midas Railroad Company, the <em>Devil Rail</em> is an enormous train constructed from hell iron, plated in gold, and fueled by hellfire. Intended to eventually serve as a direct competitor to the <em>Ghostlight Express</em>, it currently provides passage across the treacherous landscape of Chernabos on rails of fire and brimstone for a hefty fee of gold or hell iron, emerging from beneath the earth to collect its passengers from wherever they desire at a predetermined time.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">This relatively new service allows for once-impossible travel throughout the province in comfort and style, but like everything in Chernabos, it is fraught with risk. Those who board without a ticket, miss the train at the exact time of departure, or request an emergency spiriting from a life-threatening situation forfeit their soul, which is fed into the firebox to fuel the devilish locomotive.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Ol’ Mister Scratch</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">A hulking devil with red skin, golden eyes, a black mustache, and curved horns, Ol’ Mister Scratch maintains a cool and charming disposition despite his imposing stature, which contrasts drastically with the ashborn who comprise a majority of the people he rules over. However, this devil takes the decrees of the Crescent Court as mere suggestions and strives to keep his province lawless, where destiny is determined with free will and the flip of a coin.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">Conducting his scant lordly duties from the Deadwood Theater, which also serves as a saloon, hotel, and casino, he deals with the other powerful entrepreneurs of the province through temptation and manipulation. In truth, every soul that succumbs to sin in Chernabos becomes his, so he wheels and deals to ensure that business stays booming and greed remains king.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Malignance</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Gaunt and shrouded in a billowing black robe, the nearly skeletal Sister Malignance lingers atop Pale Mountain, which stands at the southernmost border of Chernabos. As the eldest of Mother Midnight’s daughters, the occult power of Malignance is immense, and she has used her mastery of necromancy to command death itself.</p><p class=\"p4\">Every night, she rides her white Undead steed along the towering wall of shrieking fog at Druskenvald’s border and pulls forth twisted, tormented souls that she dominates to her will. Whether bid by her mother or motivated by her own aims, Sister Malignance works tirelessly to weaken the Shroud’s barrier so that, like a breaking dam, a tide of death will spill forth and crash upon Chernabos and beyond.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Brimstone</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Brimstone, the capital of Chernabos, is a boiling cauldron of desire and desperation. Soot and smoke from chimneys mix with the sulfuric air, and its ashy streets are lined with saloons, gambling halls, theaters, and brothels a mere stone’s throw from places of commerce, trade, and industry. The city offers the tempting and truthless promise of sin without consequence, which draws folk from across Druskenvald who hope to change their fortune in a heartbeat without realizing that heartbeat may be their last.</p><p class=\"p4\">Countless games of chance are played throughout the city, with gamblers wagering gold, hell iron, or their own souls to win jackpots beyond imagination. Strong spirits of all varieties flow freely, but most prefer Brimstone’s signature liquor, Fiddler Johnny, which is made with poisonous cactus juice and rattlesnake venom. When damnation is on the line, disputes often turn heated and are settled with duels to the death.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Hotel Durango</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s6\">Despite what some folks say, Hotel Durango <em>(der‑AYNG‑goh)</em> isn’t a myth but it sure is hard to find. When someone’s luck runs out in Chernabos and they lose everything, they often wander off into the desert in delirious damnation. It’s to these lost souls that Hotel Durango appears. An impossibly large and remote hotel in the middle of the desert, it acts as a shimmering oasis for the desperate. The lights are inviting, and the door is always open, encouraging those who see it to stop for the night and forget their troubles.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Chernabos_%20Sister%20Malignance%20decorated%20gloves.webp\" width=\"400\" /><p class=\"p4\">Within the mirage-like hotel is everything one’s heart might desire: water for the thirsty, food for the starving, vices for the craving, companionship for the lonely, or some chips for the gambler who wants one last game. Once a soul checks into Hotel Durango, they leave the world they knew behind, find everything they’ll ever need, and can never leave. However, certain tales whisper of ways to find the hotel and free the souls within.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Chernabos</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In the untamed land of Chernabos, adventurers face a world where lawlessness and hellfire collide. From soul bargains in dusty saloons to fiendish menaces, each encounter promises both danger and opportunity.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.sAtWLk2XFV9tLG9Q]{Chernabos Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

Why should we? The wheels of time, progress, and industry don’t. We may be trapped between them, crushed beneath them, or cut down by them, but we will never be left behind. If we slow or stop for even just a moment, the beast will catch us.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Charlotte Heady, The Iron Maiden -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Edwardia <em>(ed‑WAR‑dee‑uh) </em>is a province of gray. Its sky, water, landscape, settlements, and even its people exist in a grayscale that colors every aspect of their society. The heart of Edwardia is ever pulled between two contrasting extremes, and the balance that its people maintain has allowed them to achieve a level of technological progress far beyond the wildest dreams of most of Druskenvald’s inhabitants, with sprawling cities, industrious machinery, and fantastic vehicles all powered by electricity captured from the province’s frequent storms. But progress has its cost, and for all the prosperity and comfort the province enjoys, there is just as much hardship and strife.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">The society that has resulted is one obsessed with dualities—life and death, good and evil, law and anarchy, wealth and poverty, peace and conflict, progress and regression, city and country. These opposing furies have manifested into a curse that marks every inhabitant of Edwardia and hangs over the province like the dense fog from which the wolfen curseborn emerge. Managing this affliction by maintaining balance is core to life in this province of gloomy hills, moors, and flatlands, with its people divided between a towering metropolis and the quaint countryside.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Grey</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Edwardia is intricately intertwined with the Grey, which is a term that references three parts of a whole. First, it is the name of the dense, gray fog that rolls across the province and shrouds its people in gloom for half of every night.</p><p class=\"p4\">Second, it is the name of the lifelong curse that marks every native of Edwardia, which some believe to be the result of living in the strange, oppressive fog. This malediction has no ongoing negative effects, but an afflicted individual who lives a life of any extreme meets an untimely end with total certainty.</p><p class=\"p4\">Third, this death is delivered by an entity called the Grey. It appears to the doomed in the fog as a huge, gray canid beast with two heads—a she-wolf’s on the left and a mastiff’s on the right—and allows its prey one last choice. Those who accept their fate are nuzzled gently by the mastiff, dying peacefully and painlessly within moments. Those who flee, fight, beg, or otherwise attempt to escape their fate are chased down and violently torn to pieces by the she-wolf.</p><p class=\"p4\">None know if this being is a spirit, a fiend, an angel, or a god, but the two-headed beast is revered and honored across Edwardia, serving as an eternal reminder to its people to strive for balance between all things. Some say that this malediction is a blessing, as it has driven the province to thrive despite the sacrifices required to balance the scales.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sparktech</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Edwardia is filled with industrious folk, including many inventors who have a keen eye toward progress. However, no advancement has had nearly as much of an impact as Sparktech, the invention by which Charlotte Heady transformed the province overnight. This revolutionary technology utilizes magnetized, bulb-shaped rods wrapped in coiled springs to capture electricity from the air and harness its energy to power a wide variety of machines and devices that are now the cornerstones of Edwardia’s civilization.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">While Sparktech is critical and widely used in Edwardia’s industry, transportation, energy, and commercial sectors, it is limited by its great expense to maintain, difficulty to repair, and high rate of fatal accidents. Additionally, attempts to spread the technology outside of Edwardia have failed catastrophically. Because endeavors to improve upon its design have brought the doom of the Grey upon many inventors, engineers, and scientists, the technology seems destined to remain at its current level indefinitely.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Edwadia_%20Charlotte%20Heady%2C%20the%20Iron%20Maiden%20Art%20Nouveau.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Charlotte Heady, the Iron Maiden</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Charlotte Heady <em>(SHAR‑lit HEE‑dee)</em> was once a curseborn who considered herself the ultimate renaissance woman, finding immense passion and success in every pursuit she tried, from invention to music to dueling to alchemy. But in the process of inventing Sparktech, a catastrophic accident annihilated her body and transmuted her soul into raw electricity. Through quick thinking, she was able to bind her soul inside a suit of iron armor before her crackling new form could dissipate. This was the moment she realized that balance could be achieved by embracing both extremes of duality in equal measure instead of walking a middle ground of mediocrity.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Now called the Iron Maiden, Heady leads Edwardia with this philosophy in mind, battling the Grey and the average with every action she takes. She acts as a ruthless inspector one night, before leading a fiery riot to the sound of raucous electric music the next. She strives to increase the province’s quality of life through rampant industrial growth while accepting the sickness and suffering caused by the subsequent pollution. The Iron Maiden takes no joy in the sacrifices that must be made in the name of progress, but she places the blame on the curse that she believes forced her hand.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Serenade</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Heartbreak defines and consumes Sister Serenade, the consummate tortured musician of the Coven of the Midnight Moon. Although she always possessed a complete disregard for mortal life, when she lost the love of her life many years ago, she was forever changed into a brooding, hateful witch who loathes joy in others. Donning a dramatic white mask and black cape, she weaves witchcraft through her bombastic music and magically manipulates the emotions of her victims toward malign ends.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">As if riding the sound waves of her songs, Serenade teleports herself and her massive, enchanted pipe organ across Edwardia and throughout its capital. She gives heart-rending performances that rip out people’s passion, joy, and free will, turning them into heartless, living automatons as gray as the fog of the province. She seeks to rob every last inhabitant of Edwardia of their color and vivacity to amass an army of emotionless, gray drones that follow her song and spread her suffering to all of Druskenvald.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Baskerton</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The fogbound, electric metropolis of Baskerton <em>(BASK‑urr‑tin) </em>is the largest city in Druskenvald, with numerous high-rise buildings that pierce the gloom with bright lights and crackling tendrils of harnessed lightning. A huge, diverse population of industrious folk live here across all social classes, always seeking to improve their lives with hard work. Its cobbled streets are filled with wondrous Sparktech vehicles that zoom past all manner of shops, factories, and other businesses. Statues, murals, and other imagery of the two-headed Grey are displayed prominently throughout the city, lest its people forget their unbreakable curse. Visitors to this capital can find myriad points of interest and intrigue.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Rex and Romula.</strong> The great twin clocktowers that stand at either end of Baskerton set the city’s rhythm, with every inhabitant waking, sleeping, and going about their night timed by the booming chimes that echo like howling in the night. They also serve as the primary docking stations for the airships that the wealthy use to travel to other provinces.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Progress Quarter.</strong> This district of workshops, laboratories, and universities draws inventors from across Druskenvald and beyond to perfect their inventions, showcase them to the public, and receive critiques from the most brilliant minds in the city.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Sumptown.</strong> Underneath the city are near-endless stretches of brick-lined sewers, slums, and service tunnels that have come under the control of rival gangs, forming a sinister haven for serial killers that pick off people who won’t be missed.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>The Cogs.</strong> The industrial heart of the city is polluted by miles of tightly packed factories, warehouses, and energy plants that operate through all hours of the night via revolving shifts that employ a huge portion of the city’s population.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>The Iron Opera House.</strong> This renowned theater, adorned with metal spikes, is owned by Charlotte Heady, providing a venue for avant-garde dramatic and musical performances featuring elaborate set design and experimental stage effects created by Sparktech machinery.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Edwardia</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In Edwardia, adventures span the sprawling urban surface and below, often involving solving macabre murders, unraveling conspiracies, or delving into the complex criminal underground.</p><p><span class=\"s1\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.cxOMEKsZVQk93yHm]{Edwardia Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

We all were born knowing how it goes, each one of us has a part in the harmony, and everyone will be singing it ‘til the very end. Lend me your voice, little one, and we’ll help this seed grow.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Methuselah -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">The harvest is a way of life in Enoch <em>(EE‑nock)</em>, a rustic countryside province that sprawls across miles of rolling farmland, its fields of plenty forming a patchwork pattern across the landscape. Serving as the primary breadbasket for all of Druskenvald, it is known to produce crops of every variety that are tended to by the hardworking people of the province and sold to one and all at vibrant, bustling markets and even shipped to other provinces.</p><p class=\"p4\">Crystal clear rivers weave through the fertile hills and humble woodlands that comprise most of the region, delivering enchanted water to crops that allow them to grow unnaturally large. The harvestborn, crafted with care by the lord of Enoch, join in celebration with the other folk of the province to show thanks for the bountiful and relatively peaceful life afforded to them. However, nowhere in Druskenvald is free from the dangers that lurk on the fringes of society.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Moonlit Harvest</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Despite having been driven from most of Druskenvald, primeval “Green Magic” hums throughout Enoch like a familiar tune and infuses the soil, water, and air of the province with unbound growth and fertility. The knowledge of how to harness this vital power has been passed from generation to generation through story and song, providing farmers the ability to complete a full agricultural cycle every month. This is a true miracle of nature, especially in a land of eternal night.</p><p class=\"p4\">After the seeds are sown and planted at the beginning of the month, the verdant magic surges within them, and vibrant stalks, vines, and stems burst to life at an immeasurable pace. If patient, one can actually watch the plants of Enoch grow to enormous size. By the end of the month, the fruits are sweet, the vegetables are succulent, and the grains are hearty. Then, the Moonlit Harvest is held, and all the folk of the province, young and old, head into the fields and orchards to reap the month’s bounty under a brilliant moon before ending the night with a celebratory festival.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Crop Trotters</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Crop trotters are giant turkeys with substantial speed, strength, and endurance that serve as the primary beasts of burden in Enoch. The province’s people have a great respect and appreciation for these birds, which are critical in pulling wagons, plowing fields, serving as mounts, and even guarding farms from predators and bandits. For many families, they are cherished as precious pets that sleep inside the home when the work is done.</p><p class=\"p4\">The breeding and rearing of crop trotters is an esteemed and invaluable profession, and many farmers donate a portion of their heartiest harvest to newly hatched poults to ensure the next generation is healthier than the last. Each year, a great race across Enoch called the Turkey Trot is held, and folk from across the province compete to win the title of Top Trotter with their trusted, feathered steed.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Enoch_Methuselah%20cat%20statue.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Methuselah</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The oldest living being in Enoch is also its leader—a black-furred cat-man with eyes as gold as the province’s grain fields at harvest time. No one knows where Methuselah <em>(muh‑THOO‑suh‑luh)</em> came from, how old he is, or how he began crafting and giving life to newly rebirthed harvestborn, but what folks do know is that if there’s something to learn about Enoch, the lord of the province can teach it. He bears the immense wisdom befitting his many years but has a sprightly energy that betrays a youthful soul.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">When he is not presiding over his lordly duties, he works the fields alongside his people, shares his knowledge of the agricultural cycle with aspiring farmers, tells tall tales with just a hint of truth, and warbles songs of the harvest to all who will listen—it’s said that even the crops sway to his tune. Favoring the rustic clothing of a farmer, he prefers a simple and peaceful life but occasionally hosts a lively gathering of Enoch’s musicians called the Cornhusk Jamboree and even leads the band while strumming his favorite guitar.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Nightmare</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Not even the seemingly idyllic Enoch is spared from its fair share of terror. The name “Sister Nightmare” is whispered behind closed doors and used as a threat and warning to children who disobey their parents, but the headless witch is very real. Galloping madly through the fields atop her coal-black steed with eyes, hooves, and mane of fire, this pyromaniac sets all ablaze with her flaming whip and pumpkin head that serves as a mockery of the harvestborn she terrorizes.</p><p class=\"p4\">With every ritualistic burning, the great plumes of smoke and ash surge with magical energy that induces supernaturally intense fear through waking nightmares. As the smoke spreads, so do the shrieks of horror, with many victims even dying from fright on the spot. Sadistically relishing the dread she inspires, Sister Nightmare will not stop until the skies of Enoch are filled with ash and screams.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Pumpkin Hill</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Atop the highest hillock in Enoch is the capital city of Pumpkin Hill, which overlooks miles of patchworked fields below. Packed dirt streets snake through homes, gardens, shops, gathering halls, and other rustic wooden structures before converging in a lively town square. Here, weekly markets and monthly festivals draw people from across the province to trade and celebrate the harvest. Corn husking and pumpkin throwing contests are common sights, and folk dances are stepped through with joyful abandon.</p><p class=\"p4\">Standing at the center of the city and rising from the highest point on the hill is Harvesthome Hall, where representatives from every community in Enoch gather to discuss and decide provincial matters, always advised by Methuselah. Just down the road is the famous Candlewick Tavern, which serves pumpkin ale renowned across Druskenvald. One of the yearly events that draws numerous visitors from other provinces is the Emerald Hunt, in which participants seek powerful gemstones said to contain fragments of the powerful green magic of Enoch.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Enoch_Alistra%20Moon%20Embroidery.webp\" width=\"300\" class=\" centered\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Bramblethorn Brothers’ Barnstead</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The Bramblethorn Brothers—Barnaby, Bertram, and Bartholomew—run the largest and most advanced farm in Enoch, an operation that threatens to take over its smaller neighbors’ steads. Favoring technological advancement over tradition, the brothers split up in their youth and studied in Edwardia, Bubonia, and Astramar, respectively, returning home with knowledge of strange science, engineering, and alchemy to turn the Barnstead into a “modern marvel of agriculture.”</p><p class=\"p4\">Their achievements included altering seeds to complete a full cycle in a single week, constructing tireless harvest constructs to endlessly work the fields, and modifying crop trotters to be even larger, more powerful, and vicious. Their headquarters now also serves as a laboratory, factory, and fortress, with bizarre new “improvements” made monthly. Although they produce extraordinary yields, side effects and mishaps are constant, and if unchecked, the Bramblethorn Brothers’ Barnstead could overtake the whole province.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Enoch</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In Enoch, adventurers often find themselves protecting the abundant fields from strange forces, unraveling eerie folklore that has come to life, and uncovering long-buried mysteries hidden in the heart of the province.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.L1IetAIaqIYJ7tS0]{Enoch Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

Will you join me for this dance?”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Catrina the Sweet -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">In Kalero <em>(kuh‑LAIR‑oh)</em>, life and death are celebrated with equal exuberance. This province is dominated by deep canyons formed by roaring rivers that snake through the land, their tall earthen walls carved out to construct settlements, roads, and innumerable individual tombs from which newly rebirthed relicborn emerge. These skeletal folk and the other people of the province adorn themselves in vibrant colors and marigold garlands as they paint beautifully intricate murals honoring those who came before.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">The dry wind here carries golden sand and the scent of burning incense as it whips through the bustling markets and colorful remembrance celebrations that take place at all hours of the night. But the gold of Kalero is not just from the desert sands, and swashbuckling adventurers are called from far and wide to seek vast treasure troves hidden throughout the province, whether within the ruins of a mesa-top city or lost in a shipwreck in a forgotten cove. In this place where history and legend are honored with great esteem, excitement and adventure await for all daring enough to seek it.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>River of Remembrance</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The River of Remembrance winds through the deep canyons that comprise most of the province, as wide and turbulent as a nautical strait. This prominent waterway forged Kalero, not just by shaping the landscape to its running course, but also by intertwining the region with the essence of memory. The great river’s waters contain the lingering memories of souls lost to the Shroud and are all that remain of who they once were. Those who peer into the rushing waters can see full spectral scenes playing beneath the surface in the fragmented moments of extinguished lives.</p><p class=\"p4\">This river is also the primary method of travel through Kalero and to the provinces beyond. Numerous ships of all shape, size, and construction navigate the waterways on all manner of voyages from trading to treasure hunting. However, the waters are often treacherous with sudden rapids and whirlpools, hungry river beasts, and the vicious pirates that lurk in the hidden coves throughout the bottom of the canyons.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Thousand Bones</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Rising up from the rocks, rivers, and sands of Kalero are the Thousand Bones—countless towering pillar-like rock formations that reach high into the sky above. Finding the footholds to scale the bones is a near-impossible task, made far more deadly by the violent gales that batter each zenith and the viciously ravenous vultures of colossal size that nest among the jutting spires.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, an endless number of explorers, fortune hunters, and thrill seekers make the attempt, for legend states that atop the Thousand Bones are the glittering ruins of cities made of gold, rubies, and long-lost magical technology. Adventurers believe that the secret to successfully reaching the top of the bones lies in the lost memories of the first inhabitants of Kalero, waiting in a forgotten tomb built into a remote canyon wall.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Catrina the Sweet</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Catrina the Sweet <em>(kuh‑TREE‑nuh)</em> leads the province like she leads the dance during Kalero’s unending celebrations—with unbound vivaciousness and a lust for life that can only be truly appreciated by the dead. As a relicborn, her skeletal features are adorned with a rainbow of intricate patterns and draped in swirling silks, jangling jewelry, sweet perfumes, and a veritable mane of curly locks that seem to have a mind of their own.</p><p class=\"p4\">While her unbound enthusiasm, joy, and passion for dancing and pageantry lead some adversaries to dismiss her as a legitimate threat, such folly always leads to defeat or death. Hand-in-hand with Catrina’s gregarious delight is a playful cunning and measured ferocity that she leverages to fiercely protect the past, present, and future of her province. Embracing the beauty of death has made Catrina one of the most respected and even feared leaders among the nobility of the Crescent Court.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Playtime</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">As the youngest, smallest, and most frail of Mother Midnight’s daughters, Sister Playtime is consumed by envy—of her sisters’ power and station, of the joyous community shared among Kalero’s people, and of the toys, friends, and parties she never had. Appearing like an uncanny doll with a porcelain face, Playtime has mastered the magic of memory and has the mind to turn her victims into her own living playthings.</p><p class=\"p4\">Not caring to earn true companions, she wipes and manipulates the minds and memories of the province’s people so they will offer her the adoration she desperately craves. She makes them play games with her that often end in disaster and death. Every night, her jealousy builds, and she will not be satisfied until all of Kalero is her personal playground.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Memento</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Built into the sheer stone walls of Kalero’s canyons and overlooking the winding River of Remembrance is Memento <em>(muh‑MEN‑toh)</em>. Every corner of this many-tiered capital city is etched with personal memories, and the streets are lined with altars of remembrance and reverence for the dead. Public art, decoration, and monuments of every imaginable hue make Memento a prism of a city that casts its colorful vivaciousness across the great walkways, staircases, and tunnels that connect the hive-like network of districts.</p><p class=\"p4\">Memento never sleeps, and at all hours of the night, there are lively bands playing, celebratory dances, and bustling shops offering flowers, sweets, and other goods. Visitors come from far and wide to experience the city’s famous Screaming Skulls—magical fireworks that scream through the sky in brilliant colors before exploding into complex patterns and images to the delight of all below.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Kalero_Caterina%20the%20Sweet%20Papercut.webp\" width=\"400\" class=\" centered\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Port Melee</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Nestled within a protected cove along the River of Remembrance is Port Melee <em>(MAY‑lay)</em>, the largest port in southern Druskenvald and the center of commerce in Kalero. Goods from every province are bought and sold in the crowded public markets of this flourishing town, and even rare items from beyond the Shroud can be procured in private negotiations. And for those who know where to find it, the infamous Dorado Auction House offers strange artifacts, exotic creatures, dangerous weaponry, and other curiosities found only on the black market.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Kalero_Ilinca%20Moon%20mural.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p4\">With so many riches concentrated in one location, Port Melee earns its name from the constant conflict with pirates, bandit gangs, and other cutthroats that conduct raids on the town in hopes of pilfering even a fraction of its wealth. However, the town is heavily defended with magical cannons that turn Screaming Skulls into projectile weapons, and a culture of martial prowess is fostered among the locals so they can sufficiently defend their homes. In fact, Druskenvald’s premier school of swordsmanship, the Mastered Hand, is one of the port’s oldest institutions, turning young aspirants into agile and deadly Wave Dashers, an elite league of duelists.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Kalero</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Amid Kalero’s vibrant celebrations and remembrance ceremonies, swashbuckling excitement and exploration await.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.MsZg3huASv3T3WpE]{Kalero Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

When the gods themselves wept tears of stone, we recovered. When the spiders and scorpions crawled to our call, we prospered. In the forgotten and abandoned places of the world, we did not find this paradise waiting for us. We built it.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- God King Xanatep -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">The far southeastern reaches of Druskenvald are covered in desolate, jagged mountain ranges and crumbled ruins devoid of life. However, deep beneath the earth in massive, sprawling caverns is Nerukhet <em>(NAIR‑oo‑KET)</em>, a grand province lit by glittering gemstone geodes that shine kaleidoscopic light across monumental cities and webbed tunnels from which the spider-like silkborn emerge. These people and the other species of the province strive for greatness in all aspects of life, with many hoping to establish their place in history as the chosen of their gods.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, the threads holding Nerukhet together are thin, with conflict and unrest always lurking beneath the surface of society—and far worse things squirming in the darkest depths.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Tears of the Gods</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The massive, sparkling gemstones found throughout Nerukhet are known as Tears of the Gods, which feature prominently in the long and storied history of the province. Legend says they were gifted by the gods of the land, who wept when the province’s First Kingdom upon the surface fell to a great cataclysm, calling the survivors to a new promised land to rebuild their civilization with these magical gems that hum with divine vitality.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Granting long life, sharp mind, strong body, and sturdy constitution, the tears are greatly coveted, but they are collected en masse by the wealthiest and most noble families of the province, passed on from generation to generation through great inheritances. Varying greatly in size, color, and power, they are used as currency and worn as signs of status and influence.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Bejeweled</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The people of Nerukhet live in harmony with enormous, divine insects and arachnids known as the Bejeweled, whose carapaces are encrusted with jewels. Believed to be the heralds of the gods, these creatures share a special psychic bond with the province’s inhabitants, with the long-lived creatures often loyally serving the same family for generations. Their hides, eyes, and mandibles glow with the same glimmering light that illuminates the province, and they assist with all manner of tasks required by their masters, from boring new tunnels to joining armies in war.</p><p class=\"p4\">The most numerous of the Bejeweled are spiders the size of large hounds, which can be found in every household, no matter their wealth and station. These spiders assist with everyday tasks and spin the silk that clothes and adorns the province. Huge locusts provide air travel across the vast subterranean province, and enormous scarabs are monumental in the construction of the homes, temples, and palaces of its cities. The rarest, most powerful, and most highly sought-after Bejeweled are dragon-sized scorpions that are used as symbols of divinity by the prominent houses that command them.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>God King Xanatep</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Said to be the only silkborn that has ascended to divinity and achieved immortality, God King Xanatep <em>(ZAN‑uh‑tep)</em> is the supreme ruler of Nerukhet. He begrudgingly pledges fealty to Phillip Druskenvald under the condition that he can rule his people as he sees fit. As the master of Vekloriash the Amethyst Dread—the largest and deadliest bejeweled scorpion to ever exist and the only to possess great dragonfly wings—he has remained unopposed since before the doom of the First Kingdom. While his pride is unmatched, his true aim is to increase the greatness of Nerukhet above all else.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s6\">Ruling from the top of the colossal monument-flanked ziggurat in Arakir, the Skittering City, Xanatep allows the various factions, houses, and families to squabble and settle disputes on their own, even as it comes to war. However, if such a conflict ever threatens the security or prosperity of the province, he descends upon the battle atop Vekloriash and brings an end to the fighting, often resulting in the total annihilation of both sides. Through the Tears of the Gods, he can see across all of Nerukhet, so few escape his watchful and merciless gaze.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Nerukhet_Faerlina%20Moon%20Silk%20Shawl.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Hourglass</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">While personal achievement and measured mastery of oneself are paramount in Nerukhet, extreme opulence and over-indulgence are a constant concern, especially among the wealthy and the noble. It is through parties and politicking that Sister Hourglass thrives and weaves an ever-growing web of deceit and treachery that threatens to topple the civilization of the province. While she is tall, curvaceous, and hypnotically beautiful with sleek arachnid features, the danger of her oft-leveraged seduction pales in comparison to her deadly cunning.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Spinning spells that manipulate the mind of her victims, she pulls the strings of the ruling classes and guides Nerukhet to its eventual self-destruction. Aiding her are swarms of spiders that feed her whispers and secrets she uses to tighten her grip around the province. On the rare occasion that her numerous disguises are uncovered, her eldritch webs and venomous fangs leave no witnesses.</p><p></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Arakir, the Skittering City</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The massive, many-tiered capital of Nerukhet is perhaps the premier wonder of Druskenvald, and those who have not seen it cannot imagine its sheer size and grandeur. Filled with glittering temples to the many gods of the province, imposing tombs of the most legendary historical figures, and magnificent palaces of the most prosperous houses, Arakir <em>(AHR‑uh‑KEER)</em>, the Skittering City stands as a monument to its people, who have achieved so much in the unlikeliest of places.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Illuminated by radiant geodes, the capital buzzes with countless bejeweled alongside the bustling lives of the silkborn and other people who live there. Beautiful gardens flourish with colorful vegetation that should not be able to thrive underground. The immense Lapis Library contains numerous ancient texts, both historical and poetic, that stretch back millennia. And the most infamous location in the city is the Tunnel of Claws, where wild and vicious bejeweled scorpions unclaimed by masters lurk and hunt.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Nerukhet_Xanatep%20gemstone%20statue.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Crawling Doom</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In the deepest and darkest pit of Nerukhet lies a ruined place of death and horror. In eons past, the people of the First Kingdom, who once thrived upon the surface, grew hedonistic, envious, and overzealous for grandeur. The province rotted from within, along with the hearts and souls of its people. They began worshiping a strange and terrible entity that promised wealth, greatness, and immortality in exchange for offerings of depravity. The people abided, society degraded, and the thing fed and grew until one awful night when the nameless horror brought doom to the kingdom.</p><p class=\"p4\">While the surface was left a wasteland, the remnants of the First Kingdom collapsed into a pit, where a fleshy, squirming aberration resides within the cursed depths of the province. This unthinkable horror shatters the minds of all who see it, and the mightiest priests and magicians of Nerukhet have sealed it away with intricate spells and blessings. However, every year that goes by, this protective barrier cracks, and the thing in the darkness waits.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Nerukhet</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">In the gleaming depths of Nerukhet’s gem-lit caverns, peril and intrigue await.

May salt foam and bilgewater forget the name of the Drowned!”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Captain Ephraim Wake -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">The roiling black ocean of Druskenvald is unnatural, mysterious, and treacherous. This is also how outsiders perceive the province that is so connected to and supported by the sea and the things that lurk within it. Olmarsh <em>(OAL‑marsh)</em> stretches along miles of rocky shoreline and flooded salt marshes, and it encompasses numerous islands that dot the waters off the coast. A shadow hangs over the province and slithers up from below, gripping its people in a paranoia of the unknown.</p><p class=\"p4\">Life here is simple and buoyed by the bounty of fish that the sea provides, allowing the people of the province to live beyond a meager existence limited by the scarce resources of the land. But there is a constant threat from the watery depths. Even the semi-aquatic deepborn fled to the surface in fear of the abyss from which they emerged. Worse still is the ever-present feeling of being watched by something from the night sky overhead. Above the waves, the cold, salty air is thick, almost viscous, and a strange fishy stink lingers in every corner of the province.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Light of the Drowned</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Pervading the dark waters of Olmarsh is an unceasing threat of eldritch, gibbering storms that whip up out of nowhere, swallow ships whole, and turn any survivors to incoherent babbling. The only defense against these storms and other cosmic intrusions are the numerous lighthouses that dot the coastline and isles of the province, each shining with an eerie, ghostly light. Crews that have the skill to navigate between these beacons and stay in the radius of their enchanted light are shielded from such strange phenomena.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">However, such a protective boon comes at great cost, for the lamps are fueled by the souls of those lost at sea. Each lonely lighthouse is manned and operated by a single keeper who also serves as a warden of the souls, keeping the flame lit while being battered by the incessant wails of the drowned. Such a position is considered a great honor and noble sacrifice, for every tender of the light is doomed to have their own mind shattered whilst providing safe passage for the minds of others.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Hungering Ones</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The most calamitous threat to ships and coastal settlements are the various colossal sea monsters that dwell in the abyssal depths of Druskenvald’s black ocean. They take myriad forms, including great shelled krakens, ghostly white megalodons, fiendish whale-like leviathans, and titanic adversarial crabs. Feared, yet also worshiped as deities, these Hungering Ones are offered food, treasure, and sacrifice to sate their appetite in the faint hope that a vessel or town is spared from their legendary wrath.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, for those daring, or perhaps foolish enough, a fortune can be made by slaying one of these behemoths and harvesting its corpse for a valuable psychedelic substance called Tide Ash, which can be found within the heart of each beast no matter its form. Even more desirable is a mythical shell that, when blown like a horn, binds the will of a Hungering One.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Olmarsh_Nezara%20Moon%20figurehead.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Captain Ephraim Wake</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">Captain Ephraim Wake <em>(EFF‑rum WAIK)</em> was a renowned deepborn sailor and one of the first lighthouse keepers to ever man the light of the drowned. He lasted longer than any keeper has before or since, but he eventually succumbed to the delusions of the enchantment in the lamp. Hearing a siren’s call out on the sea, he swam to meet it and was devoured by a Hungering One. None know what brought him back, but the next night, he returned to shore as a spirit who bore the secrets of the deep and the sight beyond the stars.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">As the lord of Olmarsh, Captain Wake appears as a burly green ghost with a great beard of tentacles and seaweed. He is typically clad in his eternally weathered captain’s outfit and is mostly lucid, though he is occasionally overcome with ravings of superstitions, curses, and dangers on the horizon—all of which are filled with truth and heeded by his people. This eldritch, perhaps cosmic, knowledge has allowed the people of the province to weather the numerous dangers both natural and supernatural, and his leadership continues to be invaluable in their survival.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Fathom</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Sister Fathom’s sorrow mirrors the sadness of Druskenvald’s people. When they cry, she sheds briny, inky tears that spill into the sea. With slimy skin, kelp-like hair, and scaled fins, she is a creature of the ocean and is bound to it as a prisoner of her own misery. When she surfaces and yearns for land, her tears spill forth in a great surge that crushes her back to the deep.</p><p class=\"p4\">Her eerie witchcraft conjures impossibly acidic ooze that can eat away a galleon in mere moments. A fleshy bulb that hangs from her forehead casts an enchanting light that can hypnotize and draw unwary sailors into her clutches. She seeks to steal the Light of the Drowned into her lure so that she may command all the sea monsters of Olmarsh to flood the land in a tidal wave of her tears, making the land-dwellers suffer as she does. Her misery forever craves company.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Ibbsmouth</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Ibbsmouth <em>(IBZ‑mith)</em> is the fog-bound coastal capital of Olmarsh and the biggest port city in Druskenvald. Crooked, drab streets wind their way through gray, weather-worn buildings that are populated with folk who seem just a little off. Despite the gloomy appearance, sailors, traders, fishermen, and hunters come from all other provinces to make port before seeking the supernatural bounty of the strange tides off the coast.</p><p class=\"p4\">Amidst the salty markets and docks covered in the blood of lesser sea monsters, eldritch and occult relics, often collected from the countless sunken ruins found in the marshes of the province, are traded behind closed doors and away from prying eyes. Unsettling, rundown chapels can be found honoring the various Hungering Ones that are often surprisingly full of worshipers, driven by equal parts adoration and dread. The most infamous location in the city is the Seven Sisters tavern, known for its seafood stew and the raucous clientele of salty dogs, cutthroats, and bad eggs.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Olmarsh_Captain-Wake-Flag.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Darktide Manor</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Far south of Ibbsmouth, along a stretch of particularly treacherous, windswept cliffs, is a cursed site known as Seabird’s Fall, where a legendary mariner once brought down an albatross—a foolish act that invited doom upon himself, his crew, and his entire family line. Here stands Darktide Manor, a towering, gloomy mansion that defies architectural logic. A combination of protective spells, lingering curses, marsh dangers, and sudden gales makes it perilous to reach, but those who knock on its heavy oaken door have found the headquarters of the Nautilus Order.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Bearing the symbol of the spiral shell, this secret society fosters the study of the strange, occult, and forbidden, seeking both magical and scientific pursuits. It also serves as a museum filled with curiosities from across Druskenvald and beyond, as well as a small university where only the most committed can succeed and survive. Initiation into the Nautilus Order involves venturing to a nearby black reef on a night that it rises above the surface of the sea and sacrificing something or someone precious to prove that your old life is over.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Olmarsh</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Amid Olmarsh’s fog-drenched shores and haunting waters, hidden terrors and twisted mysteries await.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.Ky0E1xvGw3hux1Yk]{Olmarsh Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

Blessed is the one, who in the name of piousness, temperance, diligence, and unity, sacrifices all they have and all they are to follow in the footsteps of the divine. This is the only path to the silver heavens and the blinding light of its joyous rapture!”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Archbishop Danton Alexandre Renault -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">In Pholsense <em>(FOAL‑senss)</em>, every life is measured, above all else, by its adherence to divine law. In the quiet provincial towns that dot the rolling hills, fertile farmland, and humble woodlands, life is quite peaceful, but there is always a lurking fear of making a wrong move and straying from the Silver Path. For within the province’s great cities, built from the same stone that the gargoyle-like stoneborn are carved out of, the zealous militants of this faith seek wayward and wicked souls to judge and purge swiftly and without mercy.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Whether the people of the province walk through crowded streets or sprawling fields, they strive to keep their footfalls along the path of righteousness so they might be rewarded ascension to the blinding light of the one true god. In Pholsense society, it is paramount to put the Silver Path above neighbor, family, and self, vigilantly watching for and reporting any transgression or heresy to the inquisitors responsible for dispensing the silver justice. Magic achieved through any means other than faith is deeply distrusted, and casting the wrong spell at the wrong time can ensure a fiery fate.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Silver Path</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The Silver Path is not merely a religion or divine philosophy; it is the god itself. Lacking the typical trappings of personification that mortals often attribute to their gods, this deity exists as an imperceivable divine will that upholds the five holy tenets: piousness, temperance, diligence, unity, and sacrifice. There is zero tolerance for sin or apathy that affronts these virtues. Pholsense has suffered far worse from the witchcraft of the Coven of the Midnight Moon than any other province, which has only emboldened their righteous fury.</p><p class=\"p4\">Most of Pholsense, including many of the stoneborn and other species of the province, serve as devout members of the faith, celebrating with regular ceremonies in a variety of houses of worship, from small chapels to grand cathedrals. All throughout the region, the near-constant ringing of great bells can be heard; the faithful claim this is the voice of the Silver Path and attempt to discern meaning from it. However, members of the hierarchical clergy insist only they can truly decipher the voice of their god, so they act as intermediaries with increasing authority all the way to the head of the church, Archbishop Renault.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>The Silver Hammer</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The Silver Hammer is a knightly order of inquisitors and crusaders dedicated to purity above all else, traveling across the province and unfalteringly seeking out evil as the Silver Path defines it. While many chapters of the knights genuinely want to protect the innocent of Pholsense from the machinations of Mother Midnight, the methods of some chapters are extreme and often cruel, justified as a necessity to rid the province of witchcraft and wickedness. Fair trials are rare when a suspicion takes root, especially when the malignant effects of curses are discovered.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">Practitioners of arcane and primal magic are deeply distrusted by the Silver Hammer and are sometimes dealt with indiscriminately, alongside actual servants of the mother of witches. However, magic-users who report and register their powers with the order and take a vow to use them in the service of good are generally tolerated or even tasked to fight alongside the knights to unleash their spells upon the wicked, fighting fire with fire.</span></p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Pholsense__Mother%20Midnight%20stained%20glass.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Archbishop Danton Alexandre Renault</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The ruler of Pholsense holds his lordly duty and loyalty to the Crescent Court firmly secondary to his embodiment and obedience to the Silver Path. Appearing as a tall, thin, silver-skinned human with shimmering angelic eyes, Archbishop Danton Alexandre Renault <em>(DAN‑tawn a‑lek‑SAN‑dur reh‑NOH)</em> leads the province under the same tenets with which he leads the church. He strives for perfection in all things, particularly in the carving of the stoneborn, whom he views, along with the other species of Pholsense, as his flock. He expects similar perfection from his people but regularly offers forgiveness for those who confess to sin and accept harsh penance.</p><p class=\"p4\">However, sin lurks at the heart of the archbishop, and each passing year, he becomes more fond of indulgence in food, drink, flesh, and coin, as well as the ramping sadistic glee with which he conducts interrogations, complete with torture. While his inner demons gnaw away at him, Archbishop Renault keeps this truth hidden in his corrupted heart as he delivers blistering sermons from his seat of power in Cyril’s Cathedral of the Silver Rapture.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Mother Midnight</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Where the hallowed ground of the Silver Path blazes brightest, the Coven of the Midnight Moon is at its strongest due to the oppressive presence of its matron, Mother Midnight, who looms over the province like a gloaming goddess of witchcraft and wickedness—a deliberate and direct mockery of Pholsense’s rigid god.<br />None know where the witch mother came from, but it is whispered that she has been in the domain as long as Phillip Druskenvald has ruled it. And it is the sin that lurks in the hearts of mortals with which she seeks, draws forth, twists, and consumes. While she does bear genuine love for her twelve daughters, she fosters competition and pits them against each other to ensure they are ruthless in the execution of their own machinations.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">She is a master of the general magic arts, with particular talent for shapeshifting, corruption of mind, body, and soul, potion brewing, and familiar conjuring and manipulation. She spends her time in Pholsense turning its people to sin and causing them to veer off the Silver Path. She slowly siphons occult energy from their corrupted hearts, which she will use to usher in a single night of sin that turns the province into a hellscape of wickedness and the staging ground for her conquest of Druskenvald.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Cyril</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">The shining, silver heart of Pholsense is its capital city, Cyril <em>(SEER‑ull)</em>. One of Druskenvald’s great metropolises, its grandeur and achievements in architecture and stonemasonry make the other settlements of the province, even its other cities, look like ramshackle frontier camps. Despite widespread poverty, famine, and disease throughout the province, the city is a monument of polished stone and glittering silver, filled with towering statues and complex, multi-tiered fountains. At the city center is the enormous Cathedral of the Silver Rapture, which rings dozens of colossal silver bells that chime through the city and at all hours of the night.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">It is also home to the headquarters of the Silver Hammer and its inquisitorium’s gaol, where the most wicked heretics are imprisoned and tortured, whether innocent or not. Near the city outskirts is the Cyril Orphanage, the biggest in Druskenvald. It houses thousands of children that have lost their parents to inquisition, witchcraft, or the dangers of living in the overcrowded and unsanitary districts of the city. Sprawling beneath the city are miles of catacombs so famous that visitors from across the other provinces travel to explore them—though not all return.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Pholsense</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">From grim trials to curses that fester like wounds, Pholsense calls forth those who dare challenge its fervent laws and break the chains of zealotry.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.rQYho8CDvDkwpqDj]{Pholsense Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

The reason is simple! The world is miserable, and this will never change. You know this. Blinski knows this. The people know this most of all. But if Blinski can show them wonder, make them smile, and help them forget misery for just one night, they might believe that change is possible. Such a thing is truly special, my friend. Blinski built this place to see the looks on the people’s faces when they believe.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Blinski II -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">Fun is not just a way of life in Picco <em>(PEE‑koh)</em>; it’s the law of the land. It is a place of high energy and constant motion, where all manner of play thrives outside the world of make-believe, and the wildest imaginations are made manifest by the great and powerful toymaker Blinski II, who wants nothing more than to grant every unfulfilled childhood wish. From within his walking mechanical workshop, he is always creating new toys, attractions, and other inventions of thrill, as well as the doll-like threadborn, which he crafts with the most love of all.</p><p class=\"p4\">To the ever-present tune of a discordant calliope, the people of the province go about their lives in frantic frivolity, surrounded by a fabricated landscape of cloth, decorations, and props as if pulled straight from a school’s stage play. While the endless fun is exciting and joyous, it is often dangerous, with the thrills occasionally turning deadly and the lack of rest leaving the uninitiated exhausted and even terrified.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Fun Tickets</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In Picco, it's not gold that buys goods and services. Instead, Fun Tickets are the province's currency, which take the form of shiny carnival tickets in vibrant colors that represent different uses, from purchasing food to securing passage in one of the huge hot air balloons that soar across the province. These tickets drive Funtopia’s economy—which by all reasonable accounts should simply not function—and they can be obtained in a variety of ways, including purchasing with coin, earning through work, winning as a game prize, or rewarded for succeeding in an incredible challenge.</p><p class=\"p4\">Rare and uniquely designed tickets procured through particularly death-defying feats have specialized magical power. Avid collectors travel from across Druskenvald in the hopes of finding these rare and prestigious prizes. There are rumors of exclusive attractions and artifacts that require one of these precious tickets to gain access.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Jolly Jangles</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">While Blinski’s vision of a happy Picco may seem like a lighthearted hope for the inhabitants, it is, in fact, a mandate that is held with immense gravity. To this end, the toymaker created Jolly Jangles, an enormous flying cymbal monkey that serves as the guardian of Picco. It was built with the ability to sense the overall mood of the province and sniff out negative emotions that might threaten to bring others down.</p><p class=\"p4\">Jolly Jangles flies throughout the province, visiting those experiencing prolonged sadness, anger, or other such unpleasantries. He first attempts to cheer them up with titanic pratfalls and folly, but he will eventually resort to absconding with the individual in question if the mood does not improve. These “downers” are brought to Blinski’s workshop for “tinkering” until unbound fun is restored.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Picco_Blinski%20II%20toystore%20hangout%20board.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Blinski II</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The gregarious Blinski II <em>(BLIN‑skee)</em>, known for booming laughter and infectious cheer, is the creator of Picco and most of its inhabitants, whom he builds and repairs with deep affection and care. A master toymaker, he is an automaton himself, with stout, rounded proportions that presumably resemble whomever “Blinski the First” was, although none remember any master of toys but this second incarnation. Finding the bureaucratic duties of lordship painfully dull, he prefers to travel the province in his mechanical walking workshop, have fun with his subjects, and offer free repairs to the broken.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">In a realm of eternal night filled with terror and misery, Blinski believes it his duty—as well as the duty of his people—to bring only joy, laughter, and light to the darkness. This childlike innocence and enthusiasm, despite being one of the oldest lords of Druskenvald, has made him a target of manipulation among his fellow nobles. This occasionally leads to questionable and even disastrous deeds, all committed with genuinely pure intentions but without full understanding of the consequences.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Antic</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The most unhinged and unpredictable of Mother Midnight’s daughters, Sister Antic is a frenzied witch of sadistic joy and delusion who strives for nothing but pure chaos. Antic has an immensely colorful personality, but her entire form, as well as all her spells and possessions, exists only in grayscale, as if she was made from paper and ink. Her proportions are unnatural, rounded, and elongated, and she wears an eternal grin.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Sister Antic can effortlessly manipulate reality around her, stretching and reshaping her body and her surroundings and conjuring anything from her imagination out of thin air in an instant. In the hands of a witch with a deliberate will, this seemingly impossible magic could make her one of the most powerful beings in existence, but the chaotic Antic never uses it to its full potential, instead favoring its application for comedic or dramatic effect. Her most intentional use of witchcraft is magical explosives, and she hopes that blowing up enough buildings and people will eventually lead to a Druskenvald of pure anarchy.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Funtopia</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">While the entire province of Picco is one big circus, the capital of Funtopia<em> (fun‑TOH‑pee‑uh) </em>is the heart of the festivities. Equal parts carnival, amusement park, and city, it is a wonder of magical engineering that allows for a society of living toys to thrive. A night’s work here usually consists of playing games for hours to earn Fun Tickets.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Funtopia’s food is rarely nutritious but supremely delicious, drawing adventurous eaters from across Druskenvald to sample the endless creative options, especially the legendary Jolly Jangles Waffles. The transportation system consists of elaborately constructed rides that carry commuters across town at extreme speeds, filling the air with screams of thrill and delight as they are delivered to any of the city’s themed districts.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Crazy Clown Hell.</strong> Kept uncomfortably hot and adorned with the imagery of devils, jesters, and hellfire, this is the center of thrill in the city, where all the most extreme, death-defying rides and attractions can be found. It also contains the headquarters of the Honk Legion, the premier union for Picco’s numerous fools, led by the beloved clown Chookels-Chookels.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Dinoworld.</strong> Amidst towering facsimiles of jungle trees, intricately constructed mechanical dinosaurs fill crowds with awe and delight in a district that encourages exploration and heroic adventure. Also serving as the university district, it features schools that teach only fun subjects.</p><p class=\"p4\"><em><strong>Strahdanya’s Castlemania.</strong></em> Shrouded in endless darkness, this spooky district focuses on delivering fun-filled frights with haunted houses, dark rides, and other scary attractions. It also serves as the drama hub of the city; every night, the castle-sized Cravencroft Theater shows a performance of the critically acclaimed stage play <em>Curse of Strahdanya.</em></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Friendlyville.</strong> The center of wholesome fun aimed at children and adults who are young at heart, this soft district is filled with cozy, pillow-like cottages and contains a large population of living, snuggly stuffed animals that provide relentless love and encouragement to all who visit. Overseen by Mayor Cream Cheese, a plump, stuffed llama, it also provides homes and support for the lost, broken, and misfit toys of the province.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Captain Bone’s Lagoon.</strong> This district-sized, pirate-themed water park features year-round aquatic attractions, such as wave pools, lazy rivers, and the infamous, never-ending Captain Bone’s Wild Slide. It also serves as Funtopia’s port, allowing ships from across Druskenvald to come and go with cargo and passengers that help keep the city thriving.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>Neonopolis.</strong> Lit by bright, vibrantly colored lights and painted with starry scenes of the cosmos, this is Funtopia’s music district, with concert venues and dance halls on every corner that feature all manner of musical performances. However, much of Neonopolis is under construction, with flashing signs bearing the promise that the city’s greatest attraction is yet to come.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Picco</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Step right up to Picco’s peculiar carnival of wonders, where adventurers will enjoy thrills, chills, and kills.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.KNv8wj0o98px6c6D]{Picco Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

There are no seasons here, yet they reek of summer. Green, soft, warm, weak. We are forged by the endless winter, so they think us monsters. What they do not know is that war makes monsters of us all. They should grovel in thanks that the northern winds do not carry war to their doorstep and make them face the monster that waits within them all.”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Wyrm Queen Sapphira -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\">Far to the frozen north of Druskenvald is an icy province of perpetual battle, where the dead fight, die, and rise again to perpetuate a war that has persisted so long that no one can remember what sparked the conflict. However, each of the three warring factions would scoff at being the first to suggest peace. Thus, the fighting rages on across the snow-bound landscape, where the bones of long-dead dragons rest and countless graves spawn the ghoulish graveborn.</p><p class=\"p4\">The hollow remnant of a once-great kingdom that united humanity and dragonkind, Syndramas <em>(sin‑DRAH‑mus)</em> is now a place of immense necrotic power. Any living thing that dies within its borders rises again as an Undead creature, joining the endless armies of graveborn and other species of the province. These tireless warriors spill forth from metal fortresses and vast grave cities, clashing with masterfully forged weapons and armor to earn glory for themselves and their legions in the eyes of their Wyrm Queen, Sapphira.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Sepulchral Legions</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Syndramas is eternally warred over by three militant legions, each with its own culture, territory, capital, and military hierarchy, as well as specialized tactics, weaponry, and occult arts. Though each is led by a grand general, all three factions pledge fealty to Wyrm Queen Sapphira, who allows and even encourages conflict, so long as it does not spill beyond the borders of the province. The victory condition of each legion is the total annihilation of the other two so they may earn the sole favor of their draconic monarch and prepare for the eventual conquest of the rest of Druskenvald.</p><p class=\"p4\">The Rimeshade Legion. Clad in heavy plates of drakkonite and armed with icy, runic blades, this legion relies upon the superiority of its war chest. Hoarding more resources than the other two legions combined, its armies are equipped with exceptional weapons and armor engraved with eldritch runes of frost and shadow, and they march to battle alongside immense war machines. Huge floating fortresses powered by ancient magic drift through the sky, allowing the Rimeshade Legion to bring the might of its armory to every front.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">The Bloodboil Legion. Every warrior of this faction has total devotion to the legion and their comrades, and this tight-knit fellowship allows this army to fight in perfect synchronicity. Each soldier fiercely pursues mastery of combat, aided by blood magic rituals that provide supernatural strength, precision, and battle instinct.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">The Marrowfeast Legion. Sheer numbers and viciousness allow this faction to compete in the war for Syndramas. Emerging from great hives made from dragon bone, hordes of innumerable warriors crash upon their foes like a wave, with each fallen soldier replaced by two more. The legion employs few complex tactics, though it frequently unleashes the vile necrotic magic of the province itself to wither and putrefy its enemies.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Drakkonite</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In the great conflict that destroyed the ruined kingdom that once thrived in Syndramas, countless mighty dragons perished, and their broken bodies have been covered by the frozen wastes. As mass death fell upon the great creatures by the thousands, their draconic essence was leeched into the province itself, forever changing the land and creating a new metal ore that would be called drakkonite <em>(DRACK‑oh‑nite)</em>.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Vast deposits of this dark and unnaturally cold metal can be found throughout Syndramas. Known for its immense sharpness, strength, and lightness, it is widely used across the province in the construction of weapons, armor, and structures. Because it is so highly sought after, even by warriors outside Syndramas, many of the deadliest battles have been fought over drakkonite mines.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/01_INT_DRS_Syndramas_Sapphira%20relief%20fresco%20PNG.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Wyrm Queen Sapphira</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s5\">The wintry dragon that would become the leader of Syndramas was the last being to die in the brutal civil war that destroyed a once-thriving kingdom. Having witnessed such wanton destruction driven by the squabbling of petty lords, including the extinction of her kind, her final moments were consumed by unbound rage and hate. This set off a necrotic chain reaction that turned the province into a land of undeath and resurrected Sapphira <em>(suh‑FEER‑uh)</em> as an immensely powerful necromancer. Now, she appears as a great skeletal dragon with desiccated gray flesh and patches of blue and white scales.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s6\">Sparing her dragon kin from such an existence, Sapphira raised the former humans of the kingdom, twisting them into the ghoulish graveborn and becoming their Wyrm Queen. She now rules them and the other species of her frigid domain with pride and ruthlessness, manipulating the three warring factions into constant conflict with promises of glory—in part due to a bitter vengeance but also out of necessity. The hungering necrotic wrath of the province has grown beyond the Wyrm Queen, and she knows that it can never abide peace. Should one legion ever claim victory, it would turn its sight southward to consume Druskenvald.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sister Howl</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Sporting a tall, broad, and muscular build, Sister Howl is the most physically imposing of Mother Midnight’s daughters. With razor-sharp teeth, long claws, patches of fur, and other bestial features, Howl prefers the thrill of close combat, unleashing primal instinct and raw fury enhanced by a self-empowering witchcraft that most of her sisters consider barbaric.</p><p class=\"p4\">Although she is disinterested in the broader machinations of the Coven of the Midnight Moon, Sister Howl plays along, taking any excuse to fight and kill. She leads an ever-growing horde of vicious beastmen that thunders across the frozen tundra, conducting raids and guerrilla warfare against all three Sepulchral Legions. They continually spread a curse of bestial bloodlust that twists even the most loyal soldiers into slavering pack members. She one day hopes to turn the Wyrm Queen herself into a mindless beast of mass destruction that would empower Howl to live by her own rules and even break away from her family.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Sepultura</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Sepultura <em>(seh‑pull‑TUR‑uh)</em> is an enormous, fortified necropolis that stands at the center of Syndramas. Built from gravestone and drakkonite, this mighty capital serves as a neutral territory where all three legions have agreed to a truce while within the city’s walls and for ten miles beyond its limits. Violating this non-aggression pact is considered such an egregious and dishonorable taboo that even the most treacherous and power-hungry people of the province find such a thing unthinkable. The rare schemer or brute who engages in any act of war within the city is personally dealt with by Wyrm Queen Sapphira herself within her mighty drakkonite citadel at the heart of the necropolis.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s5\">Sepultura is carved up into quarters—the Frost Quarter, the Blood Quarter, and the Bone Quarter for the Rimeshade, Bloodboil, and Marrowfeast Legions, respectively, and the Wyrm Quarter, which acts as neutral ground for meeting and mingling amongst members of opposing factions and for conducting military business with Sapphira’s personal army, the Queensguard. While visitors from other provinces are rare, much coin can be made in offering goods and services of comfort to soldiers who experience so few of life’s pleasures.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Dragons’ End</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">The most sacred site in Syndramas is a vast dragon graveyard in a hidden valley in the northernmost mountain range of the province. At Dragon’s End, miles of snowy landscape are covered in the massive skeletal remains of thousands of wyrms, drakes, and other dragonkin. The valley was the site of the bloodiest battle of the civil war that rendered the winter dragons extinct, and Sapphira occasionally makes a pilgrimage here to reflect in solitude—the only time she allows herself to feel any grief.</p><p class=\"p4\">Legend states that many powerful artifacts of war were lost in the battle and still wait, scattered among the bones. But would-be grave robbers must face numerous dangers, including the unforgiving elements, huge scavenging beasts that still feed on the dragons’ marrow, and lingering curses that helped bring an end to a civilization.</p><h2><span class=\"s3\">Adventures in Syndramas</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Amid the frozen wastes of Syndramas, conflict is ceaseless as Undead legions vie for dominion, each bound by bitter rivalries and ominous secrets etched in bone.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.ncMKx1Anxj6xRXLA]{Syndramas Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

Will you answer?”</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>- Tazri Swampcaller -</strong></em></span></p></blockquote><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">Despite existing in an otherworldly domain of death, the vast, tropical swamps of Zulrogg <em>(ZULL‑rawg)</em> teem with life. Underneath a dense canopy of twisting, vine-choked trees, each stage of the cycle of life, death, and rebirth thrives in harmony with the others, as do the plants, animals, and peoples of the province. Primal and ancestral spirits drift back and forth through the veil, offering their wisdom and guidance to those who seek it.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">Although this treacherous swamp is rife with dangers of all varieties, it also provides everything needed for survival to the people of the province, including the bogborn</span>,<span class=\"s3\"> who emerge from the mire after rebirth. Forming unbreakable bonds with the bog’s beasts, both natural and supernatural, they enjoy rich and fulfilling lives that are intertwined with the wilds and led by the wisdom of the spirit priests revered by this society.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Provincial Folklore</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Spirit Beasts</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s6\">The province is watched over by great wild spirits that are worshipped by the people of the province. Each one takes the form of a different creature of Zulrogg’s swamps, jungles, and shorelines and is said to possess the wisdom of all the ancestors who favored that particular spirit. While some spirits are more benevolent than others, all have a place in the guidance of Zulrogg’s inhabitants, from the most humble fisherman to the wisest spirit priest.</span></p><p class=\"p4\">Zulrogg’s society is based upon the reverence of and communion with these Spirit Beasts, and making regular offerings to different spirits for different things is a fact of life. However, this deep connection to mortals makes the spirits vulnerable, and malevolent ritualists seek to capture them and siphon their essence for their own ends. Some even seek to kill a Spirit Beast and claim its power for themselves.</p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Everblooms</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Zulrogg is overgrown with countless varieties of flowers, herbs, fruits, and other flora that all have a use as reagents in the rites, rituals, and medical practices of the province. A concoction, salve, or tincture to solve any problem can likely be procured in at least one of its stilted settlements. However, the supremely rare Everbloom is held in the highest esteem for its immense magical properties.</p><p class=\"p4\">Appearing as beautiful, delicate flowers with petals of pink, purple, orange, and gold, Everblooms radiate with the primal essence of rebirth, new life, and youth. They can only be found in remote locations at certain times under specific circumstances, and seeking them out requires the guidance of a Spirit Beast. If carefully harvested and stored without any damage to the petals, the most skilled spirit priest can utilize the flowers to create mixtures that perform miracles of healing, bring back the dead, and even grant immortal youth. This power is not taken lightly by the people of Zulrogg, and these concoctions are only given to those who have proven themselves in the eyes of the province’s spirits.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Noteworthy Folk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Zulrogg_Nazri%20Swampcaller%20mantle.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Tazri Swampcaller</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Although the bogborn spirit priest called Tazri Swampcaller <em>(TAZ‑ree)</em> is a member of the Crescent Court, she eschews any political authority and leads Zulrogg by example and spiritual guidance. Personally chosen by the great Hydra Spirit to be its speaker, she receives many heads' worth of wisdom and is widely considered to be one of the most insightful beings in Druskenvald. Despite her station, she spends much of her nights teaching the youth how to better commune with the spirits and discover which Spirit Beast they should choose to favor—a profound rite of passage for every member of Zulrogg society.</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s6\">Tazri has lived for many centuries, extending her life with Everbloom concoctions until she can find a suitable replacement to become the next speaker of the Hydra Spirit. However, when one looks upon her, it is difficult to determine her age, appearing youthful one moment and truly ancient the next. This is made more mystifying by her eccentric passion for collecting. She knows that the swamp never gives without purpose, so she takes any trinket or debris she finds and adds it to the stitched sack that holds her collection. It is said that these odds and ends become the most powerful reagents in her rituals.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sister Gizzard</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">In the twisted boughs of the deepest and most overgrown mire of Zulrogg is the thorn-tangled roost of Sister Gizzard. This fleshy, wrinkled witch with feathered, avian features resembles a bloated vulture and fittingly has a voracious appetite to consume raw, rotting flesh, especially that of sapient mortal species. She loves nothing in the world but her “children,” the countless grotesque carrion birds that she commands in huge flocks through the skies of Druskenvald. They serve as eyes and ears for the Coven of the Midnight Moon and can devour the flesh off of a victim’s bones in seconds.</p><p class=\"p4\">Her witchcraft specializes in rot, decay, and disease, and it perfectly prepares any creature for consumption—including supernatural beings, spirits, or gods. It’s this ability that makes Gizzard feared by all her sisters and even her mother, since she fully absorbs and claims the power of whatever entity she eats. In Zulrogg, her hungry eyes are set on the mightiest Spirit Beasts, and she hopes to eventually make a meal out of each of them to take the full primal power of the province for herself.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Storied Locales</span></h2><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Gurash’Atal</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">While many settlements are nestled throughout the swamps, jungles, and waterways of the province, the largest of the stilted cities is Gurash’Atal <em>(gur‑OSH uh‑TALL)</em>. Built atop the murky water and throughout the mossy trees, the wooden streets and structures are connected by an elaborate network of walkways and rope bridges that are intimidating to visitors but easily navigated by locals. Long-necked reptilian swamp beasts ferry travelers to different parts of the city, and great saber-toothed felines serve as mounts that can easily climb up and down the city’s various levels and leap between treetop platforms.</p><p class=\"p4\">Throughout Gurash’Atal, shrines are dedicated to the numerous Spirit Beasts, where offerings can be made to earn their favor and even receive mystical blessings. Swampstalker Lodge draws visitors from across Druskenvald to see the greatest trophies of Zulrogg’s long line of legendary hunters and learn tracking, hunting, and trapping from the masters. The bustling trading post run by the enigmatic Trader Senj has everything one needs for an expedition into the wilds.</p><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/01_INT_DRS_Zulrogg_Sister%20Gizzard%20Batik.webp\" width=\"300\" /><h3><span class=\"s5\"><strong>Sunken Temple of Rakan’Zahl</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p3\">Built millennia ago by a lost civilization, the ancient stone temple of Rakan’Zahl <em>(ruh‑KAHN ZAHL)</em> slowly sank into the swamp until it was completely swallowed by its stagnant waters. However, the chambers within have not flooded, and those who find the temple’s hidden entrance can discover a labyrinthian network of hallways, ritual rooms, and grottos overtaken by the flora and fauna of the bog.</p><p class=\"p4\">This place of ancient mystical power has also drawn the attention of a cult that worships the malevolent Bloodbat Spirit. They practice their malign rites in the damp stone chambers and seek to use the temple’s secret knowledge to help their patron become a god that rules all Spirit Beasts. They work toward a monumental ritual that would drain the blood and life essence of every person in the province to initiate and fuel this ascension to godhood.</p><h2><span class=\"s4\">Adventures in Zulrogg</span></h2><p class=\"p3\">Venture into the depths of Zulrogg’s overgrown swamps, where spirits call and ancient dangers await those brave enough to test the swamp’s primal powers.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.uAo2gq4fS1FDgFIl]{Zulrogg Quest Hooks}</strong></em></span></p></div>"

On a failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage and is poisoned for the duration. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. A creature poisoned in this way takes 1d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.

Folk go about their daily routines, and the pigeon hag watches and waits for the return of the Crooked Queen. She hides in plain sight amongst them, learning everything they know and guiding what they believe. Golub Graygullet, disguised as Postmaster Theodora Mayville, subtly controls the flow of information and manipulates the minds of the people so that they fall in place when the time is right to free Kehlenn. Until then, she bides her time and pulls the strings, every moment filled with haughty contempt.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A master plan is in the works, hatched by Golub Graygullet, who arrived in town seventy years ago with her dovecote that can secretly walk about the valley on pigeon legs. After the characters arrived in Druskenvald, she knew the time for sacrifice had arrived. Pulling the strings of the people of Wickermoor Village like a puppet master, she has helped guide the townsfolk’s interactions with the characters every step of the way through news carried by the pigeons she commands.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">Believing herself to be the true mastermind behind the Crooked Queen’s return, she sought the destruction of the Fallen and even betrayed her two sisters, understanding their deaths to be critical sacrifices to return her mistress to power. However, Golub herself has been deceived. Kehlenn promised the pigeon hag that she would serve at her left hand as a grandmother hag of legendary power, but this was a lie.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">The fabled prophecy and sacrificial ritual require one final conjuring from Golub before she herself is slain in sacrifice. Soon, she will be reborn with her sisters as a horrific abomination in the bowels of the Crooked House (see chapter 22). The minds of the townsfolk, so subtly influenced for years, must be made perfectly malleable for the revelry of the coming Lord of Fools (see chapter 21) and celebration at the feet of the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise (see chapter 23).</p><p class=\"p7\">One final bewitching enchantment is brewing to cause a mass hysteria whipped up by a sudden murder in town. It is through the violent urges of the agitated mob that Golub plans on finally disposing of the characters, whom she views as pawns that have outgrown their usefulness.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A shocking murder blamed on the characters whips the people of Wickermoor Village into a frenzied mob but was, in truth, caused by a bewitching enchantment cast by the pigeon hag, Golub Graygullet. Once the town descends into mass hysteria, she escapes in her Walking Dovecote, sending mind-broken monsters to wreak even more havoc. Before the village burns and its townsfolk tear each other apart, the Walking Dovecote must be found, and Golub must be killed. Characters spurred to seek out the dovecote by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Escape unjust imprisonment by the people of Wickermoor Village.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Uncover the true identity of Golub Graygullet.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Track down the Walking Dovecote and destroy Golub Graygullet.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p8\">This chapter is designed for four level 10 characters.</p></div>"

Her whispers and enchanting spells also manipulate people of all variety to her cause, and she even possesses the power to make mighty monsters her minions.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Golub Graygullet</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Gollub_Graygullet.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Golub Graygullet (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.KdPNwELUxUB6SwlF]{Pigeon Hag}</strong><span class=\"s8\">*</span>) is the leader of the Vermintoll Coven, as well as the eldest and most powerful of the three hags. Her short and stout body resembles the pigeons she adores, with taloned fingers, a beak-like nose, a puffed-up neck, and mauve skin.</p><p class=\"p7\">Just as it was her sisters’ roles to corrupt the soul and body of sacrifices to the Crooked Queen, Golub corrupts her victims’ minds through the control of information and magical enchantments she weaves. A malignantly proud creature, Golub views every mortal as merely a pawn, tool, or puppet to help advance her own aims, viewing her tactics of seeking, manipulating, and distributing information as far more tasteful than the more uncouth methods favored by her sisters.</p><p class=\"p7\">Golub is obsessed with not merely acquiring information, which she primarily gathers through the eyes and ears of her pigeon spies, but in controlling its flow. Every written communication in Wickermoor Village passes through her hands, and she alone decides what is passed on, withheld, or altered. She listens, watches, and whispers from her perch in the Walking Dovecote, choosing whether to deliver truths or lies that aid in her grand designs, even among the Vermintoll Coven and cult of the Crooked Queen.</p><p class=\"p7\">Preferring the comforts of town and leveraging the close proximity to the victims of her mental corruption, Golub lives among the people of Wickermoor Village disguised as Theodora Mayville, the postmaster (see chapter 11). To ensure a more reliable and long-term disguise, she wears the skin of the person she impersonates, needing to change bodies every decade or so to avoid drawing suspicion. The one thing she cannot change between personas is the vibrant lilac eyes cast by her bewitching enchantment. When Golub uses a victim's skin, the disguise is flawless and can't be perceived as false, even through magical means, which detect her as a Humanoid. Golub also has Advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks while in this disguise.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Peeping Albert</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Peeping Albert (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.HKOXEFjHbucrRayC]{Vermin Familiar} </strong>(Pigeon)</span><span class=\"s9\">*</span><span class=\"s5\">) is Golub’s pigeon familiar, a pudgy bird that eerily resembles a person, with a wrinkled bald head, human-like ears, and hands instead of talons. He serves as Golub’s most precious child and her chief spy. Albert gains a sick satisfaction from peeping on the townsfolk of Wickermoor Village and listening in on their conversations, eagerly awaiting the praise he’ll receive when he reports back to his mother.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Sharing Golub’s distaste for the weasel hag and centipede hag, Albert has a puffed-up superiority complex and looks down on his counterparts Filthy Jasper and Slippery Oswald. When the vile pigeon familiar is not spying on the villagers, he is always seeking new young women with lilac eyes so that Golub can prepare her next disguise.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Geneva Fairchild</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Geneva Fairchild (Lawful Good, human </span><span class=\"s7\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong></span><span class=\"s5\">) had a difficult upbringing in a superstitious household that believed her lilac eyes were an ill omen. Despite the strained relationship with her parents, Geneva grew into a compassionate and hardworking young woman in large part due to the tutelage of her mentor Theodora Mayville.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Theodora, who had lilac eyes herself, instilled in Geneva a pride for her unique feature that some in Wickermoor Village saw as a sign of malign witchcraft. The young apprentice to the postmaster learned everything she could about mail, freight, and even river shipping, eventually becoming an invaluable assistant in the post office’s day to day business.</p><p class=\"p7\">However, Geneva’s true role in assisting Theodora is serving as the unwitting next form of Golub Graygullet. The pigeon hag had not been planning on making the change to a new disguise for several years, but the characters’ arrival in Wickermoor Hollow has hastened her timeline. If the characters do not expose Theodora before the last of the Fallen has been destroyed, young Geneva is killed, her skin worn by Golub as a younger and more unassuming disguise.</p><h1></h1></div>"

The primary quest hook, “A Murder Most Fowl” below, occurs sometime after the defeat of the Chained Reaper (see chapter 19). If the characters uncover the true identity of Theodora Mayville before the Chained Reaper is defeated, see “Postmaster Exposed” later in this chapter.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">A Murder Most Fowl</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">While the characters are in Wickermoor Village, they are approached by Geneva Fairchild, who is in a blubbering panic. She tells them that she found Theodora Mayville murdered in the post office and is scared to go to the constable’s station because of Constable Squire’s callous nature and previous distrust for Geneva’s lilac eyes. She fears that because she was the last person seen with Theodora, she will be blamed for the murder, so she asks the characters to help her investigate the scene.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">In truth, Geneva Fairchild is dead, and her skin is being worn by Golub Graygullet the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.KdPNwELUxUB6SwlF]{Pigeon Hag}</strong></span><span class=\"s8\">*</span><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>(as detailed in \"Golub Graygullet\" previously). The false Geneva takes the characters to the post office (see area V20 in chapter 11), which has been locked (DC 15). A large “Closed” sign hanging over the door. Within, the stench of death is heavy in the air, and the corpse of Theodora Mayville is sprawled out on the floor, both of her eye sockets empty. As an action, a character who examines the corpse and succeeds on a [[/check MED DC 15]] or [[/check INV DC 15]] check determines that, while the corpse maintains a normal form, it has no bones or internal organs. In truth, this “second skin” is all that remains of Golub’s former disguise.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>The Master Stroke</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">This is a deception to turn the townsfolk against the characters. Before seeking them out, Golub sent a letter to the constable’s station from Theodora Mayville, accusing the characters of threatening her and Geneva with violence and claiming that the pair feared for their lives. A posse of townsfolk led by Constable Squire and Deputy Butterman make their way to the post office while the characters investigate.</p><p class=\"p7\">Geneva lingers by the door of the post office, never moving deeper into the room. When the characters discover that Theodora’s corpse has no bones or organs, if they accuse Geneva of foul play, or if enough time has passed for the posse to get close, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Suddenly, Geneva lets out a bloodcurdling shriek.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p12\"><em><strong>“They killed her!

Down the road, the town’s dovecote lurches back and forth, then suddenly rises into the air, held up by enormous, grotesque pigeon legs that protrude from its underside. Gray, feathery wings erupt from its shingled roof as the legs begin to strut away from Wickermoor Village, hopping through the air as its wings flap rapidly.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p12\"><em><strong>From the direction of the Founder’s Round, you hear the agitated shouting of at least a dozen angry voices.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">Golub casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplWordofReca]{Word of Recall}</em> to teleport to the Pigeon Roost (area R2) of her Walking Dovecote, commanding it to use its Dash action to flee from Wickermoor Village (see “Walking Dovecote Features” later in this chapter), heading northward through the moors. It is unlikely that the characters can catch up to the dovecote at this time, but if they do, see “Walking Dovecote” later in this chapter.</p><p class=\"p7\">The corpse of Geneva Fairchild remains on the floor of the post office, her eyes removed. Characters who examine the remains can determine that there are no bones or organs in the same manner as Theodora Mayville’s body.</p><p class=\"p7\">The posse of townsfolk consists of twelve <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmTough000000000]{Toughs}</strong>, led by Constable Doris Squire (Lawful Neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmKnight00000000]{Knight}</strong>) and Deputy Howie Butterman (Neutral Evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSpy00000000000]{Spy}</strong>). They have been bewitched to be Hostile toward the characters, and fail to notice the escaping dovecote. If the characters confront the mob, Constable Squire produces the letter from Postmaster Mayville containing the accusations of threats.</p><p class=\"p7\">As a Search action, a character who observes the crowd and succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 18]] check can discern that they have been Charmed with magic. The characters may be able to talk their way out of the situation, but if any of the posse see the corpses of Theodora Mayville or Geneva Fairchild, they attack and attempt to apprehend the characters to face trial for murder.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Postmaster Exposed</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">If the characters confront Postmaster Theodora Mayville—who is actually the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.KdPNwELUxUB6SwlF]{Pigeon Hag}</strong></span><span class=\"s8\">*</span> <span class=\"s5\">Golub Graygullet in disguise—before she kills Geneva, she attempts to dissuade the characters from their accusation and alleviate suspicion. </span>In truth, Theodora is dead and her skin is being worn for a flawless shapeshifted form (as detailed in \"Golub Graygullet\" previously).</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters persist in their accusations of villainy or attack Theodora, Golub is forced to act. She lets out a sinister cackle and casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplWordofReca]{Word of Recall} </em>to teleport to the Pigeon Roost (area R2) of her dovecote, which she commands to rise on its pigeon feet and flee Wickermoor Village. The corpse of Theodora Mayville is left behind, its eye sockets empty.</p><p class=\"p7\">A character who inspects the body and succeeds on a [[/check MED DC 15]] or [[/check INV DC 15]] check discovers that while the corpse keeps its form, it has no bones or internal organs. It is up to the characters to decide how they deal with the corpse and the postmaster’s disappearance.</p><p class=\"p7\">In her employer’s absence and following the shocking disappearance of the dovecote, Geneva Fairchild attempts to take over as the town’s new postmaster, swapping to mail delivery by rider on horseback. This persists while the characters continue their adventures and defeat the Fallen. On their travels, they might see the transformed dovecote walking far off in the distance, but never drawing near until the time is right.</p><p class=\"p7\">Once the Chained Reaper is destroyed, Golub makes her move and bewitches the town with a charm. Geneva accuses the characters of plotting to assassinate Mayor Somerton and whips the town into a violent mob.</p></div>"

However, spurred on by the accusations of murder and the enchantments of Golub Graygullet, they are now united in blaming the characters for their ills.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Until Golub Graygullet is destroyed, all of Wickermoor Village’s inhabitants are Hostile toward the characters. The streets are patrolled by groups of people at all hours of the night seeking the “murderers” that brought misfortune to their home. Each angry mob that wanders throughout the town consists of twelve <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmTough000000000]{Toughs}</strong> led by three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWarriorVeteran]{Warrior Veterans}</strong>, which attack the characters on sight and cannot be reasoned with.

The charm is powerful, but the use of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDispelMagi]{Dispel Magic}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplRemoveCurs]{Remove Curse}</em> is enough to suppress the effects of the enchantment for one hour. Once the hour has passed, the villager loses their sense once more and is whipped up into a frenzy against the characters.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>The Stealthy Approach</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Although the village is crawling with angry townsfolk at all times, the characters can attempt to sneak through town. For every 10 minutes spent in Wickermoor Village, the characters must succeed on a group [[/check STE DC 15]] check or be detected by a wandering mob (see “Mass Hysteria” above). The DC lowers to 10 if they hide within a building or similar structure to allow these mobs to pass, though nearly every door and window has been locked.</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters are staying at the Green Queen Inn, any possessions left in their rooms are removed and kept in the inn’s storage room. The door to the room is locked but can be picked with a successful [[/check SLT DC 15]] check using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbtulThievesToo]{Thieves' Tools}.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>The Birds</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Although the dovecote has walked off from Wickermoor Village, numerous pigeons roost on the roofs of every building in town. Golub can speak through them, regularly taunting the characters as they stealthily navigate town. Characters who attempt to climb on the roofs of any building or spend more than one hour outside in the open are attacked by four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.tKTrAX9RUUNwcG9Q]{Squabswarms}</strong><span class=\"s8\">*</span>.</p><p class=\"p7\">Peeping Albert (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.HKOXEFjHbucrRayC]{Vermin Familiar} </strong>(Pigeon)<span class=\"s9\">*</span>) remains in town as long as the characters are there, attempting to spy on them and commanding the mundane pigeons in service of their mistress. He can be spotted with a successful [[/check PRC DC 15]] check and flees if attacked.</p><h3><span class=\"s10\"><strong>Powder Keg</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The charm on the people of Wickermoor Village continues to increase in its potency as long as Golub Graygullet lives. While the town is united in its vitriol against the characters, it won't be long until they turn on each other as accusations fly regarding the aiding and harboring of the characters.</p><p class=\"p7\">If the charm persists for one week after first afflicting the townsfolk, tensions boil over and violence breaks out. Four townsfolk, including one named NPC (see chapter 11) are killed in the conflict. Three homes and one named location (see chapter 11) are burned beyond repair. For every subsequent week that passes, the number of people killed and buildings destroyed doubles.</p></div>"

Folk go about their daily routines, and the pigeon hag watches and waits for the return of the Crooked Queen. She hides in plain sight amongst them, learning everything they know and guiding what they believe. Golub Graygullet, disguised as Postmaster Theodora Mayville, subtly controls the flow of information and manipulates the minds of the people so that they fall in place when the time is right to free Kehlenn. Until then, she bides her time and pulls the strings, every moment filled with haughty contempt.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>A master plan is in the works, hatched by Golub Graygullet, who arrived in town seventy years ago with her dovecote that can secretly walk about the valley on pigeon legs. After the characters arrived in Druskenvald, she knew the time for sacrifice had arrived. Pulling the strings of the people of Wickermoor Village like a puppet master, she has helped guide the townsfolk’s interactions with the characters every step of the way through news carried by the pigeons she commands.</p><p>Believing herself to be the true mastermind behind the Crooked Queen’s return, she sought the destruction of the Fallen and even betrayed her two sisters, understanding their deaths to be critical sacrifices to return her mistress to power.

Soon, she will be reborn with her sisters as a horrific abomination in the bowels of the Crooked House (see chapter 22).

It is through the violent urges of the agitated mob that Golub plans on finally disposing of the characters, whom she views as pawns that have outgrown their usefulness.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>A shocking murder blamed on the characters whips the people of Wickermoor Village into a frenzied mob but was, in truth, caused by a bewitching enchantment cast by the pigeon hag, Golub Graygullet.

Her short and stout body resembles the pigeons she adores, with taloned fingers, a beak-like nose, a puffed-up neck, and mauve skin.</p><p>Just as it was her sisters’ roles to corrupt the soul and body of sacrifices to the Crooked Queen, Golub corrupts her victims’ minds through the control of information and magical enchantments she weaves. A malignantly proud creature, Golub views every mortal as merely a pawn, tool, or puppet to help advance her own aims, viewing her tactics of seeking, manipulating, and distributing information as far more tasteful than the more uncouth methods favored by her sisters.</p><p>Golub is obsessed with not merely acquiring information, which she primarily gathers through the eyes and ears of her pigeon spies, but in controlling its flow. Every written communication in Wickermoor Village passes through her hands, and she alone decides what is passed on, withheld, or altered. She listens, watches, and whispers from her perch in the Walking Dovecote, choosing whether to deliver truths or lies that aid in her grand designs, even among the Vermintoll Coven and cult of the Crooked Queen.</p><p>Preferring the comforts of town and leveraging the close proximity to the victims of her mental corruption, Golub lives among the people of Wickermoor Village disguised as Theodora Mayville, the postmaster (see chapter 11). To ensure a more reliable and long-term disguise, she wears the skin of the person she impersonates, needing to change bodies every decade or so to avoid drawing suspicion. The one thing she cannot change between personas is the vibrant lilac eyes cast by her bewitching enchantment. When Golub uses a victim's skin, the disguise is flawless and can't be perceived as false, even through magical means, which detect her as a Humanoid. Golub also has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks while in this disguise.</p><h2>Peeping Albert</h2><p>Peeping Albert (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.MCDX9BSPgJ1hfANf]{Vermin Familiar} </strong>(Pigeon)*) is Golub’s pigeon familiar, a pudgy bird that eerily resembles a person, with a wrinkled bald head, human-like ears, and hands instead of talons. He serves as Golub’s most precious child and her chief spy. Albert gains a sick satisfaction from peeping on the townsfolk of Wickermoor Village and listening in on their conversations, eagerly awaiting the praise he’ll receive when he reports back to his mother.</p><p>Sharing Golub’s distaste for the weasel hag and centipede hag, Albert has a puffed-up superiority complex and looks down on his counterparts Filthy Jasper and Slippery Oswald. When the vile pigeon familiar is not spying on the villagers, he is always seeking new young women with lilac eyes so that Golub can prepare her next disguise.</p><h2>Geneva Fairchild</h2><p>Geneva Fairchild (lawful good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</strong>) had a difficult upbringing in a superstitious household that believed her lilac eyes were an ill omen. Despite the strained relationship with her parents, Geneva grew into a compassionate and hardworking young woman in large part due to the tutelage of her mentor Theodora Mayville.</p><p>Theodora, who had lilac eyes herself, instilled in Geneva a pride for her unique feature that some in Wickermoor Village saw as a sign of malign witchcraft. The young apprentice to the postmaster learned everything she could about mail, freight, and even river shipping, eventually becoming an invaluable assistant in the post office’s day to day business.</p><p>However, Geneva’s true role in assisting Theodora is serving as the unwitting next form of Golub Graygullet. The pigeon hag had not been planning on making the change to a new disguise for several years, but the characters’ arrival in Wickermoor Hollow has hastened her timeline. If the characters do not expose Theodora before the last of the Fallen has been destroyed, young Geneva is killed, her skin worn by Golub as a younger and more unassuming disguise.</p></div>"

The primary quest hook, “A Murder Most Fowl” below, occurs sometime after the defeat of the Chained Reaper (see chapter 19). If the characters uncover the true identity of Theodora Mayville before the Chained Reaper is defeated, see “Postmaster Exposed” later in this chapter.</p><h2>A Murder Most Fowl</h2><p>While the characters are in Wickermoor Village, they are approached by Geneva Fairchild, who is in a blubbering panic. She tells them that she found Theodora Mayville murdered in the post office and is scared to go to the constable’s station because of Constable Squire’s callous nature and previous distrust for Geneva’s lilac eyes. She fears that because she was the last person seen with Theodora, she will be blamed for the murder, so she asks the characters to help her investigate the scene.</p><p>In truth, Geneva Fairchild is dead, and her skin is being worn by Golub Graygullet the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Xcn9r6lnzzE4O85V]{Pigeon Hag}</strong>*  (as detailed in \"Golub Graygullet\" previously). The false Geneva takes the characters to the post office (see area V20 in chapter 11), which has been locked (DC 15). A large “Closed” sign hanging over the door. Within, the stench of death is heavy in the air, and the corpse of Theodora Mayville is sprawled out on the floor, both of her eye sockets empty. A character who examines the corpse and succeeds on a [[/check MED DC 15]] or [[/check INV DC 15]] check determines that, while the corpse maintains a normal form, it has no bones or internal organs. In truth, this “second skin” is all that remains of Golub’s former disguise.</p><h3><strong>The Master Stroke</strong></h3><p>This is a deception to turn the townsfolk against the characters. Before seeking them out, Golub sent a letter to the constable’s station from Theodora Mayville, accusing the characters of threatening her and Geneva with violence and claiming that the pair feared for their lives. A posse of townsfolk led by Constable Squire and Deputy Butterman make their way to the post office while the characters investigate.</p><p>Geneva lingers by the door of the post office, never moving deeper into the room. When the characters discover that Theodora’s corpse has no bones or organs, if they accuse Geneva of foul play, or if enough time has passed for the posse to get close, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>Suddenly, Geneva lets out a bloodcurdling shriek.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>“They killed her! They ripped out her eyes! They’re coming for me! Please help!” She then looks at you with a sinister smirk before her body contorts with a sickening pop.

Down the road, the town’s dovecote lurches back and forth, then suddenly rises into the air, held up by enormous, grotesque pigeon legs that protrude from its underside. Gray, feathery wings erupt from its shingled roof as the legs begin to strut away from Wickermoor Village, hopping through the air as its wings flap rapidly.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>From the direction of the Founder’s Round, you hear the agitated shouting of at least a dozen angry voices.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Golub casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.76C0FdcxlU8F9Rl2]{Word of Recall}</em> to teleport to the Pigeon Roost (area R2) of her Walking Dovecote, commanding it to use its Dash action to flee from Wickermoor Village (see “Walking Dovecote Features” later in this chapter), heading northward through the moors. It is unlikely that the characters can catch up to the dovecote at this time, but if they do, see “Walking Dovecote” later in this chapter.</p><p>The corpse of Geneva Fairchild remains on the floor of the post office, her eyes removed. Characters who examine the remains can determine that there are no bones or organs in the same manner as Theodora Mayville’s body.</p><p>The posse of townsfolk consists of twelve <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thugs}</strong>, led by Constable Doris Squire (lawful neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knight}</strong>) and Deputy Howie Butterman (neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.13K3XK2A3wwxVKLD]{Spy}</strong>). They have been bewitched to be hostile toward the characters, and fail to notice the escaping dovecote. If the characters confront the mob, Constable Squire produces the letter from Postmaster Mayville containing the accusations of threats.</p><p>A character who observes the crowd and succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 18]] check can discern that they have been charmed with magic. The characters may be able to talk their way out of the situation, but if any of the posse see the corpses of Theodora Mayville or Geneva Fairchild, they attack and attempt to apprehend the characters to face trial for murder.</p><h2>Postmaster Exposed</h2><p>If the characters confront Postmaster Theodora Mayville—who is actually the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Xcn9r6lnzzE4O85V]{Pigeon Hag}</strong>* Golub Graygullet in disguise—before she kills Geneva, she attempts to dissuade the characters from their accusation and alleviate suspicion. In truth, Theodora is dead and her skin is being worn for a flawless shapeshifted form (as detailed in \"Golub Graygullet\" previously).</p><p>If the characters persist in their accusations of villainy or attack Theodora, Golub is forced to act. She lets out a sinister cackle and casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.76C0FdcxlU8F9Rl2]{Word of Recall} </em>to teleport to the Pigeon Roost (area R2) of her dovecote, which she commands to rise on its pigeon feet and flee Wickermoor Village. The corpse of Theodora Mayville is left behind, its eye sockets empty.</p><p>A character who inspects the body and succeeds on a [[/check MED DC 15]] or [[/check INV DC 15]] check discovers that while the corpse keeps its form, it has no bones or internal organs. It is up to the characters to decide how they deal with the corpse and the postmaster’s disappearance.</p><p>In her employer’s absence and following the shocking disappearance of the dovecote, Geneva Fairchild attempts to take over as the town’s new postmaster, swapping to mail delivery by rider on horseback. This persists while the characters continue their adventures and defeat the Fallen. On their travels, they might see the transformed dovecote walking far off in the distance, but never drawing near until the time is right.</p><p>Once the Chained Reaper is destroyed, Golub makes her move and bewitches the town with a charm. Geneva accuses the characters of plotting to assassinate Mayor Somerton and whips the town into a violent mob.</p></div>"

However, spurred on by the accusations of murder and the enchantments of Golub Graygullet, they are now united in blaming the characters for their ills.</p><p>Until Golub Graygullet is destroyed, all of Wickermoor Village’s inhabitants are hostile toward the characters. The streets are patrolled by groups of people at all hours of the night seeking the “murderers” that brought misfortune to their home. Each angry mob that wanders throughout the town consists of twelve <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thugs}</strong> led by three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.J8xjoG4Dxb8WkHtV]{Veterans}</strong>, which attack the characters on sight and cannot be reasoned with. They will initially attempt to knock the characters unconscious for imprisonment to stand trial, but if any villagers are slain by the characters, they fight to the death.</p><p>A character who observes the villagers and succeeds on a [[/check INS DC 18]] or [[/check ARC DC 18]] check deduces that the mob is bewitched by an enchantment. The charm is powerful, but the use of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse}</em> is enough to suppress the effects of the enchantment for one hour. Once the hour has passed, the villager loses their sense once more and is whipped up into a frenzy against the characters.</p><h3><strong>The Stealthy Approach</strong></h3><p>Although the village is crawling with angry townsfolk at all times, the characters can attempt to sneak through town. For every 10 minutes spent in Wickermoor Village, the characters must succeed on a group [[/check STE DC 15]] check or be detected by a wandering mob (see “Mass Hysteria” above). The DC lowers to 10 if they hide within a building or similar structure to allow these mobs to pass, though nearly every door and window has been locked.</p><p>If the characters are staying at the Green Queen Inn, any possessions left in their rooms are removed and kept in the inn’s storage room. The door to the room is locked but can be picked with a successful [[/check SLT DC 15]] check using @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.woWZ1sO5IUVGzo58]{thieves' tools}.</p><h3><strong>The Birds</strong></h3><p>Although the dovecote has walked off from Wickermoor Village, numerous pigeons roost on the roofs of every building in town. Golub can speak through them, regularly taunting the characters as they stealthily navigate town. Characters who attempt to climb on the roofs of any building or spend more than one hour outside in the open are attacked by four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.CMWondXMBbq2icnC]{Squabswarms}</strong>*.</p><p>Peeping Albert (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.MCDX9BSPgJ1hfANf]{Vermin Familiar} </strong>(Pigeon)*) remains in town as long as the characters are there, attempting to spy on them and commanding the mundane pigeons in service of their mistress. He can be spotted with a successful [[/check PRC DC 15]] check and flees if attacked.</p><h3><strong>Powder Keg</strong></h3><p>The charm on the people of Wickermoor Village continues to increase in its potency as long as Golub Graygullet lives. While the town is united in its vitriol against the characters, it won't be long until they turn on each other as accusations fly regarding the aiding and harboring of the characters.</p><p>If the charm persists for one week after first afflicting the townsfolk, tensions boil over and violence breaks out. Four townsfolk, including one named NPC (see chapter 11) are killed in the conflict. Three homes and one named location (see chapter 11) are burned beyond repair. For every subsequent week that passes, the number of people killed and buildings destroyed doubles.</p></div>"

Characters who keep their eyes to the sky and succeed on a [[/chjeck PRC DC 15]] check notice Peeping Albert flying 250 feet away. He will attempt to flee and warn Golub, and if he is not killed, the Walking Dovecote moves onto its next destination early (see “The Rookery Roves” above), uprooting itself and moving on that very night. The characters can see the dovecote walking in the far distance and must track it to its new location once more.</p><p>While Golub weaves her sinister spells and continues to twist the minds of the townsfolk of Wickermoor Village, she also dominates the minds of monsters and communities near the Walking Dovecote’s present location and sends them into the wilds to harry the characters’ travel.

A tall ladder against the wall is locked into a track that allows it to swivel around the circular room and provide access to each roost cubby.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>This level serves as the rookery for the carrier pigeons, with roosts and cages lining the perimeter of the space.

This is Golub’s roost, where she rests, performs her bewitching magic, and bides much of her time. Four large windows look out from the roost, which allows Golub to spot intruders. However, she prefers to focus on her witchcraft and leave the sentry duties to Peeping Albert.</p><p><em><strong>Stashed Secrets.</strong></em> Numerous cubbies on this level have been cleared of their roosting materials and instead are stuffed with the letters, journals, and other documents that Golub secreted away in her quest to acquire information on every inhabitant in Wickermoor Village.</p><p><em><strong>Creatures.</strong></em> This is where Golub Graygullet (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Xcn9r6lnzzE4O85V]{Pigeon Hag}</strong>*) spent her time while not performing the postmaster duties of Theodora Mayville. Now, it is her personal sanctum, and the sanctuary for her <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.76C0FdcxlU8F9Rl2]{Word of Recall}</em> spell. The pigeons in the roosts, out on the roof, and flying near the dovecote comprise three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.CMWondXMBbq2icnC]{Squabswars}</strong>* that amass and rush to Golub’s defense if she’s threatened. If Peeping Albert is still alive when combat begins, he joins the fight as well.

A once-vibrant forest has fallen to a virulent blight that consumes trees, animals, and people alike—threatening to seed all life with rapidly spreading decay. Deep in the heart of the dying woodland, the Beast of Blight nurtures this rot, delivering death laced with the promise of rebirth. Those willing to endure the poisonous reaches of Hartsblight Forest must unearth and purge the source of the blight to put a stop to the spreading menace before it turns all to rot.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p class=\"p5\">Hartsblight Forest was once a lush and verdant woodland at the edge of Wickermoor Hollow known as the Greenwood, home to a community of antlered, deerlike satyrs that cared for its flora and fauna. Now, it is a rotten place putrefied by Hartsblight, a fungal infection that brings decay to all living things.</p><p class=\"p7\">The first to surrender to the corruption of the blight was a young satyr named Farryn of the Greenwood, who followed the call of a dead primeval god to the origin of Hartsblight. Driven by the desperation of love, loss, and the hope for rebirth, she embraced the rot and forever changed into a monstrous embodiment of decay.</p><p class=\"p7\">Discarding the remaining shreds of who she once was, Farryn took the name of Gorthos, the Beast of Blight. This newly formed abomination spread rot through the forest, turning its plants, animals, and peoples to putrefaction. Now, Gorthos turns her attention to the lands beyond Hartsblight Forest, seeking to impart the blight upon all of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p class=\"p5\">Infectious fungal spores drift from the tree line of Hartsblight Forest, rapidly spreading through Wickermoor Hollow. The only way to put an end to the advancing disease is to seek out and purge the source of the Hartsblight. Characters drawn to Hartsblight Forest by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have the following goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Follow the trail of fungal spores to Hartsblight Forest.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Find the source of the disease.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Gorthos, the Beast of Blight.</p></li></ul><img style=\"border:none;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_ADV_HARTSBLIGHTFOREST_Gorthos.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the motives and history of Gorthos, the Beast of Blight, so that encounters between her and the characters are filled with tension. Understand the features of Hartsblight Forest and the effects of the blight to properly convey the oppressive nature of the diseased forest. Finally, a review of the climactic encounter, “Reign of Decay,” will ensure an intense and cathartic conclusion.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four 8th level characters.</p></div>"

        "The Beast of Blight": {
          "name": "The Beast of Blight",
          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap18 middle-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Beast of Blight</p><p>Gorthos was once a satyr devoted to the mystic rhythms of nature. As the Beast of Blight, she now spreads Hartsblight throughout Wickermoor Hollow. She believes that through death, decay, and the “Emerald Rebirth”—her distant dream where the world returns in its pure, green state—she can bring back her lost love, Gwenna. As the beast wallows in heartache in her den, decay creeps forth with the assistance of her zealous minions, every strained and sickly breath burdened by longing and the slow, relentless promise of entropy.</p><h2>Farryn of the Greenwood</h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Gorthos_and_Farryn.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Farryn was raised to follow the Old Ways. In the deep recesses of the Greenwood, her people—a circle of antlered satyr druids—revered the endless cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Knowing she would return to nature’s fold in time, Farryn was a devout student, tending to the old and new growth of the woods with boundless joy. She lived by the natural laws, her spirit bright and strong, and joined her kin in sacred songs and worship of the wild.</p><p class=\"p7\">The druids of the Greenwood believed that personal attachment was unnatural and would only lead tenders of the wild astray in their devotion to the endless cycle. Farryn shared this belief until she met a young human woman named Gwenna, who had traveled into the forest from Wickermoor Village. A worshiper of the Patient Lady, Gwenna held an innocent idealism that Farryn found infectious, believing that nature’s harmony could bring an end to the wicked witchcraft that hung over the neighboring Wytchwood.</p><p class=\"p7\">Although Farryn did not believe such a thing was possible, she offered Gwenna her help in exploring the Greenwood. The pair wove through the trees near the border of the Wytchwood, sharing stories, secrets, and a love that quickly blossomed. Farryn kept her new beloved hidden from her community, knowing that the druids would brand her as an oath breaker. But it mattered not; the young satyr had found a purpose more precious and beautiful than even the natural world.</p><p class=\"p7\">It was not long until Gwenna would pay for her naïve idealism. Less than a year after their first meeting, Farryn found her love on the forest floor, half eaten by a ravenous wolf monstrosity twisted by the malign power of the Crooked Queen. The druid drove off the beast, but it was too late. Gwenna had fed the creatures of the wood and would return to the earth, as decreed by the natural cycle. However, Farryn refused to accept Gwenna’s fate, overwhelmed with the agony of loss. In this moment of defiance and rejection of the natural cycle, she heard the call of Gorthos.</p><h2>Gorthos, the Dead God</h2><p class=\"p5\">The voice of an ancient Fey god reached Farryn, calling her deep into the forgotten heart of the Greenwood with ragged, sickly whispers and the strained bleats of dying deer. She followed, carrying Gwenna’s body to a hidden cave overgrown with fungus. Within was the enormous corpse of an ancient stag. These putrid remains would not return to the earth, instead enduring decay without end.</p><p class=\"p7\">This colossal heap of rotting flesh, fur, and bone was all that remained of Gorthos—a dead Fey god of decay from the forgotten age of the Green Queen. He told Farryn of the lost eons, when Kehlenn was pure and untwisted. A time when her realm was green with renewal. Gorthos was captive in his den, just as the Crooked Queen was captive to her misguided desire for vengeance and unnatural, crooked corruption. But an Emerald Rebirth, he knew, could restore him and the queen as they were before. Gwenna would also be restored, and she and Farryn could spend an eternity together in a vibrant world of green.</p><p class=\"p7\">Farryn shared the dead god’s dream and understood what she must do. Over many weeks, she ate his rotting flesh, taking in his knowledge, his power, his purpose, and his name. As she feasted, she rotted, changed, and grew. Each bite of Gorthos’s decaying flesh was added to her own form until the stag was no more, and she had become a huge, putrid abomination.</p><p class=\"p7\">Farryn then carried Gwenna’s deeply decayed body to the Greenwood’s sacred wellspring that nourished all living things in the forest. She laid Gwenna in the waters, a final offering to the god she had consumed—the god she had become. As Gwenna’s body submerged, the pool spoiled, spewing forth an explosive bloom of spores that would seed all life in the wood with Hartsblight.</p><p class=\"p7\">As the rot spread, she retreated to her putrid den and became one with the blight, filled with bitter hope that the death and decay of all things, even the Crooked Queen herself, would restart the natural cycle in an Emerald Rebirth. Then and only then might she see Gwenna again.</p><h2>Parley with the Beast</h2><p class=\"p5\">Gorthos is bound to her den deep within Hartsblight Forest but can speak through creatures that have succumbed to the blight, her voice raspy and thin. She views the characters as potential new hosts of the Hartsblight that can leave the confines of the wood and spread the decay across Druskenvald. She shares her vision of the Emerald Rebirth with emotionless certainty, seeking the characters’ acceptance of the blight without threats or aggression. However, Gorthos is prepared to kill the characters and remake them in her image should they ultimately refuse.</p><p class=\"p7\">Throughout this chapter, there are multiple opportunities for the characters to parley with Gorthos through a dying creature—a rotting stag carcass (area F1), the slain Halden Wreath (area F4), and a blighted gloomwood (area F8). Additionally, Gorthos can project her image to any point in the forest and can approach the characters when they attempt to rest within Hartsblight Forest (see “The Shadowing Beast” later in this chapter).</p><h2>Druids of Rot</h2><p class=\"p5\">The deerlike satyrs that once followed the Old Ways in the Greenwood now zealously worship Gorthos, serving as her chief agents in spreading her rot. These druids have been spared the slow and agonizing death and decay of the Hartsblight in exchange for the power to wield it and weave it through the woodland. They perform primeval rituals from eons past to quicken the spread of the sickness and deepen its effect, all united in the pursuit of the Emerald Rebirth.</p><h2>The Hartsblight</h2><p class=\"p5\">The Hartsblight is a rotting fungal disease that decays the body of any plant or creature it infects, spread by the will of Gorthos and her minions. It can also distort the minds of the infected, allowing the Beast of Blight to deliver vivid hallucinations that blur the line between what’s real and imagined.</p><p class=\"p7\">Exposure to the blight increases a creature’s Hartsblight level. There is no limit to the number of Hartsblight levels a creature can have, and all effects of the affliction are cumulative. A creature afflicted with Hartsblight suffers the following effects:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Consuming Rot. </strong>The creature subtracts its Hartsblight level from Constitution saving throws.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Feeble Flesh.</strong> Hartsblight reduces attack rolls by 1 for each level.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Overwhelming Affliction.</strong> Each time a creature reaches a Hartsblight level of 6 or higher, its current and maximum hit points are halved (minimum of 1 hit point).</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Spoiled Healing.</strong> When the creature regains hit points, it subtracts its Hartsblight level from the total (to a minimum of 0).</p><h3><strong>Studying the Blight</strong></h3><p class=\"p5\">Characters who assess the Hartsblight to understand it or seek a cure can make a [[/check NAT DC 15]] or [[/check MED DC 15]] check after spending 10 minutes examining the body or corpse of any creature or a plant infected by the blight. On a success, they learn the following:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">An infected creature that finishes a long rest can make a [[/save CON DC 10]] saving throw, reducing its Hartsblight level by a number equal to its Constitution modifier on a successful save or half as much on a failed save (minimum of 1 for either result).</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Effects that remove the poisoned condition, such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MAxM77CDUu8dgIRQ]{Protection from Poison}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}</em>, remove 1 Hartsblight level.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1]{Heal}</em>, or similarly powerful magic removes all Hartsblight levels.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Even creatures who have immunity to the poisoned condition or who don’t breathe are vulnerable to the spread of Hartsblight, as it seeps into flesh and bone as easily as it withers plants.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Hartsblight will continue to spread until the source of the blight is destroyed.</p></li></ul><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p> </p></div><aside class=\"gm-aside\"><h4><strong>Tracking Hartsblight</strong></h4><p class=\"p13\">Whenever a character is affected by Hartsblight, the player should track their character’s Hartsblight level.</p></aside></div>"

When the characters arrive, there is concern that Sister Rain (see chapter 11) has not yet shown up to lead the group in the pre-meal prayer.</p><p class=\"p7\">These concerns are justified when Sister Rain (neutral good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{Priest}</strong>) finally appears toward the end of the gathering, her face strained with deep concern. She has just returned from a visit to a commune north of Moonsong Lake that had been established by fellow members of the Fold of the Patient Lady, announcing that their crops have begun to fail and their livestock have fallen ill.</p><p class=\"p7\">Sister Rain attempted to assist the commune, but the affliction was beyond her ability to heal. Even worse, while she was treating an ill member of the commune, she experienced a sudden vivid hallucination of sprawling forests with brilliant emerald trees, its boughs filled with countless watching faces. By the time the vision faded, she was already a full night’s travel back to Wickermoor Village.</p><p class=\"p7\">She asks the characters to do what they can to help the commune, as she fears the threat is beyond any of the Patient Lady’s faithful. She has no coin to offer but is willing to part with a precious bottle of <em>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-treasury.Item.UCoJWjlXQaLofLJv]{Harvest Brew}</em>* for each character who answers her plea, which she hands over before they begin their journey. If the characters accept, she gives them directions to the commune and urges their swift departure.</p><h3><strong>Sporefall</strong></h3><p class=\"p5\">The following night, if the characters refused Sister Rain or linger in town, a strange phenomenon comes to Wickermoor Village. A light flurry of what initially appears to be snow begins to fall, but soon the town is coated in fine, powdery spores. This spore cloud persists for 8 hours, and any creature exposed to the spores for more than 10 minutes at a time must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw or gain 1 Hartsblight level.</p><p class=\"p7\">Sickness spreads quickly to people, plants, and animals alike, and fear rises as yet another disease afflicts Wickermoor Village with the threat of famine. To prevent panic, Mayor Wendel Somerton offers the characters [[/award 300gp]] each if they help put an end to the blight as he prepares to lead rituals of the Old Ways (see chapter 11) to help combat the spreading disease.</p></div>"

The entire settlement is covered in a layer of spores, and decayed corpses are scattered across the commune.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Spore Layer.</strong></em> The commune is coated in spores of Hartsblight. Any creature that touches the spores with their bare skin or leans in close to examine something covered in spores (such as a body) must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw or gain 1 Hartsblight level.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Decayed Bodies.</strong></em> The bodies of eighteen people can be found in and around the various dwellings. Dead chickens, ducks, goats, cows, and horses litter the livestock pen. A character who examines the bodies and succeeds on a [[/check MED DC 13]] or [[/check NAT DC 13]] check can determine that the corpses are far more decomposed than would be expected given the amount of time that has passed since death.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Blighted Crops.</strong></em> A small orchard and several vegetable gardens bear clearly blighted crops that appear shriveled and cracked with patches of blackened rot. A creature that consumes any food from the commune gains 1 Hartsblight level.</p><h2>Circle of the Hartsblight</h2><p class=\"p5\">When the characters have explored a majority of the commune, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The sound of distant drums breaks the silence—a growing rhythm accompanied by the call of horns.

Two centaur-like creatures stand at the lead, arms raised toward the commune.

If the characters do not intervene, wind picks up in the final minute and carries the cloud of spores toward Wickermoor Village.</p><h3><strong>Dealing with the Druids</strong></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters move toward the druids with aggression, roll initiative! The blighted satyrs don’t stop performing the ritual unless it is disrupted by hitting any of the minions of Gorthos with an attack or affecting them with a spell.

Each creature within 60 feet of the keeper must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 17]] saving throw or gain 1 Hartsblight level and be stunned until the end of its next turn as its mind is overwhelmed with a hallucination.

Motes of greenish-white spore matter drift down as the breeze shakes the sickly branches and wilted leaves, as if welcoming you to Hartsblight Forest.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">Hartsblight Forest is vast and trackless. To reach the source of the blight at the Befouled Wellspring (area F10) the characters must venture for miles toward the center of Hartsblight Forest. Map 18.1 shows the sections of the forest and their points of interest.</p><h2>Navigating the Forest</h2><p class=\"p5\">Hartsblight Forest is composed of three stands—distinct regions of increasingly blighted woodland, forming rings around the source of the forest’s sickness.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>The Blighted Wood.</strong> The first stand of the forest is diseased but has not fallen to the same level of putrefaction as the deeper woods.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>The Festering Wilds.</strong> Deeper into the forest the second stand becomes more wild and the blight is more present. Every surface in this part of the woodland is covered in a slimy layer of rot.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>The Rotten Heart.</strong> The third and final stand is the heart of the forest that has bloomed around the source of the Hartsblight. The trees here have been entirely consumed by rot, the low fungal canopy forms a cavern-like space overwhelmed with large green spores, and the heart of the forest looks like an alien landscape.</p><p class=\"p5\">The characters must pass through the areas of all three stands to confront the Beast of Blight and put an end to the Hartsblight.</p><h3><strong>Fleeing the Forest</strong></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters wish to leave Hartsblight Forest before the Beast of Blight is destroyed, they must pass through the forest’s locations in the reverse order that they encountered them, finally exiting the woodland after passing through the Altar of Rot (area F1).</p><p class=\"p7\">Once Gorthos is defeated and her control over the Hartsblight is eliminated, the characters can leave the forest without incident following a three-night trek.</p><h2>Hartsblight Forest Features</h2><p class=\"p5\">The concentration of the Hartsblight and the potency of its toxic effects grow stronger the closer the characters get to the heart of the forest. Unless otherwise stated, the areas of Hartsblight Forest have the following general features:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Choking Spores.</strong> Spores of Hartsblight float through the air and seep into every surface and creature within the forest. Creatures that travel through the woods must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 10]] saving throw or gain 1 Hartsblight level every time they travel from one area to another. Tying cloth or some other barrier around a creature's face grants advantage on the save.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Emerald Visions.</strong> The Hartsblight has hallucinatory properties and can be used by Gorthos to share visions. Each time a character gains Hartsblight levels, they can receive a vision at your discretion. These hallucinations might showcase the Emerald Rebirth or provide details of the Beast of Blight’s story (see “The Beast of Blight” earlier in this chapter).</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Lurking Beast.</strong> The projected image of Gorthos stalks the characters relentlessly, drawing near but always staying just out of view. When a creature fails a Wisdom (Perception) check, they see the subtle movement of a huge mass between the trees. It might be a glimpse of cracked antler, rotten flesh, blackened bone, or patchy fur.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Navigation.</strong> Moving from one area to the next takes [[/r 1d4]] hours of trekking through rough and fungus-choked terrain.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Rotting Undergrowth.</strong> The forest floor is overgrown with decomposing underbrush. The entire forest floor is difficult terrain and creatures can travel no faster than a slow pace.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Spoiled Provisions.</strong> All forms of food and water not stored within an extradimensional space spoil within minutes. A creature that consumes rotten food or contaminated water within Hartsblight Forest gains 1 Hartsblight level. Creatures that forego eating and drinking risk dehydration and malnutrition.</p><h2>The Dead of Night</h2><p class=\"p5\">While the characters may be resistant to sleeping in such a treacherous place, the increasingly overwhelming Hartsblight will likely require them to take several long rests throughout their travels. While it is wise to rest, dangers are still present in the darkest hours of night.</p><p class=\"p7\">Below are four optional encounters that can occur when the characters take a long rest. When they make camp, roll on the Dead of Night table to determine which event occurs, or choose one that fits based on their choices. Once the characters experience an encounter, it can’t be triggered again.</p><p class=\"p17\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.pTn21LG0585dwCAK]{Dead of Night}</strong></em></p></div>"

With not a single right angle in its bizarre construction, the abandoned manor is an uncanny monument to the Crooked Queen. Her minions infest the place, and the wicked weasel hag, Vessla Browntooth, is its primary corruptor. She twists the souls of the living and dead trapped within the crooked walls. Only with the death of this hag can the horrors of the Crooked House be put to an end.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Crooked House stands as a haunted manifestation of Kehlenn’s ancient power, twisted and alive with malevolent energy. It warps all who dwell within, unravelling and corrupting their very souls in preparation for sacrifice.</p><p class=\"p7\">Victims’ shattered souls and suffering feed the house, which reconfigures itself after each cycle of torment, shaping anew for the next doomed inhabitants. With each renewal, the gruesome process repeats itself—an eternal vessel for the Crooked Queen’s insatiable hunger for sacrifice.</p><p class=\"p7\">Steeped in the blood of its past, the Crooked House, now called Druskenvald Manor, readies its horrors for the unlucky pair that now call this place home. The Crooked Queen’s influence lingers, her vile energy feeding the house, and the tormented spirits within turn their gaze toward new prey.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">The Crooked House bends and contorts into its true twisted, ruined, and haunted form with the helpless Druskenvalds trapped inside. The Crooked Man, Vessla Browntooth, and the repulsive creatures within await new souls ripe for sacrifice. Characters drawn to the house by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Enter the Crooked House in search of Phillip and Adela Druskenvald after first meeting the Crooked Man.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Conduct a séance to commune with the spirit of Joseph Patrini, who can point the characters to the hag in the attic.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Investigate the house and face the spirits within to collect all six mementos from the ghosts of the slain Lockwood Household.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Find the secret door to the attic and use the mementos to gain access to the Cauldron Room (area H17).</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy the weasel hag Vessla Browntooth.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the history of the Crooked House and the tragedy that befell the Lockwoods to help improvise the spectral encounters, including the séance with Joseph Patrini.

Eustace Lockwood believed he was bringing his family to a peaceful valley, free from the city’s toils, where nature would cradle them.</p><p class=\"p7\">Their new manor, perched ominously atop a hill, loomed over a quaint village. Rebuilt by local hands upon the bones of its predecessor, it was grand yet unsettling. The builders didn’t question the hidden attic that appeared in the altered architectural plans—an attic soon claimed by Vessla Browntooth, her evil familiar, Filthy Jasper, and her swarm of twisted weasels.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s8\">The house was built atop the ruins of an ancient locus of Kehlenn’s primeval power, making it the ideal dwelling to corrupt and trap souls, all of which would feed the power of the Crooked Queen. And such an elaborate and crooked construction provided the hag with ample opportunity to torment the numerous inhabitants over the years.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">For a short time, the Lockwoods flourished. Eustace, his wife Petunia, children Sally and Arthur, and Petunia’s elderly mother Keziah enjoyed the manor’s deceptive warmth.

Illness and nightmares crept in—the work of Vessla’s vile enchantments. No medicine, not even the most skilled healers of Wickermoor Village, could combat the mounting corruption. Eustace, plagued by nightmarish visions, succumbed to madness, slaughtering his family and the Patrinis. The body of Francis was never found.</p><p class=\"p7\">Families came and went, all drawn to the village’s quiet charm. Yet, the tale always ended in tragedy. Eventually, the cursed manor was seemingly abandoned, falling to the village when no one dared return. Yet, no matter whether the manor was occupied or not, the circular window at the highest point of the house always shone with an eerie glow during the Witching Hour.</p><p class=\"p7\">Mayor Wendel Somerton, blind to the horrors, gifted the estate to the Druskenvalds, a move suggested by Randall Graham, the town’s scheming barber and doctor. Graham, knowing the house’s sinister nature and eager to see the Druskenvalds consumed, sought to unleash the house's malice on the new residents.</p></div>"

While the house has claimed many souls over the years, the ghosts of the Lockwood Household’s six victims manifest more strongly than the others.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Petunia Lockwood</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The dour but dutiful wife of Eustace Lockwood, Petunia, had been looking forward to moving to a more agrarian community. Her true love was in tending all manner of plants, especially her beloved bergamot trees. She viewed the Lockwood Estate as her chance to finally enjoy her husband’s wealth—which was the only reason she married him.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Sally Lockwood</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Sally was Eustace and Petunia’s first child, but she never received much attention from her parents. Suffering from regular nightmares, Sally developed phobias and paranoias at a young age. The only time she felt safe was when she was surrounded by her dolls and other toys.</p><p class=\"p7\">On the night of the murders, Sally managed to escape the Crooked House before succumbing to her wounds on the path down the hill. Her spirit eventually reincarnated into the dog now called Shuck (see “Shuck” below).</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Arthur Lockwood</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Arthur was born in Cyril but spent most of his short life in Wickermoor Village. He was a sickly baby, but no doctors that the Lockwoods hired could discover an underlying illness. His regular wailing led to him being left in the nursery for most hours of the night.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Keziah Endicott</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Keziah, Petunia’s elderly mother, was widowed at a young age, and she moved in with the Lockwoods. Coming from a wealthy and eccentric family, she developed many hobbies over her long life—landscape painting, taxidermy, and raising albino peafowl. Her active social life intrigued many strange folk from the town with a strong reverence for the Old Ways.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Joseph Patrini</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Joseph came from a long line of butlers and took the profession very seriously, so he unquestioningly followed his employers to Wickermoor Village. He brought his wife, son, and love of music. While the Lockwoods abandoned Pholsense’s faith of the Silver Path (see chapter 1), Joseph never wavered and believed the divine would protect him in his strange new home.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Gail Patrini</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Gail found less joy in being a housekeeper than her husband, but she relished being a mother. She never trusted her employers and found Keziah’s strange hobbies especially unsettling. Her intuition allowed her to save her son on the night of her death, sacrificing herself so that Francis survived.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Francis Patrini</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Francis, a clever and funny child, was the precocious son of Joseph and Gail Patrini. He was best friends with Sally Lockwood and would unsuccessfully try to get the girl to go on small adventures with him despite her inherent fears.</p><p class=\"p7\">He was saved from the murderous Eustace Lockwood by his mother but was deeply traumatized by the experience. He became unable to speak coherently, and the memories of his former life became fragmented, eventually becoming known to all in Wickermoor Village as Old Rusty (see chapter 11).</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Jenkin Family</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Jenkin family serves as caretakers for the Druskenvalds during their stay, having long tended the homes of Wickermoor’s elite. Three years ago, Mayor Somerton assigned them to the old Lockwood Estate, an honor laced with dread. Like the villagers, they had heard the whispered tales of the cursed house. Nevertheless, they moved in, preparing for the Druskenvalds.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Walter_Jenkin.webp\" width=\"250\" /><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Walter Jenkin</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">A handsome and affable sort, @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.X3EHiRDw1XdlevSh]{Walter Jenkin} (Lawful Neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong>), lost his voice within weeks of arriving. No healer could explain the sudden silence. Now, he communicates through writing and sign language, which his family also knows and can translate. Entering the manor makes him nervous, sensing its malice, though he never speaks of his fears.</p><p class=\"p7\">Known for his loyalty and dutifulness, Walter has an almost reverent respect for Mayor Wendel Somerton and his other former employers. And in this new position, he has already become devoted to the Druskenvalds, despite having only just met them.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Gilly_Jenkin.webp\" width=\"250\" /><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Gilly Jenkin</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.MLb6KhISPXDOhKnV]{Gilly Jenkin} (Lawful Neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong>) has known Walter since they were children, and they have loved each other just as long. She is not as devoted to the Druskenvalds as her husband; her concerns lie more with their daughter. She was pregnant with Dani when they first became employed by Mayor Somerton over a decade ago, and she is overly protective of the girl. Gilly feels the presence of the strange forces in Wickermoor Village, and she fears her daughter Dani has some sort of strong connection to these powers.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Dani_Jenkin.webp\" width=\"250\" /><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Dani Jenkin</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.UC10TAPDieUb6eYH]{Dani} (Neutral, human noncombatant </span><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong><span class=\"s5\">) was born to Walter and Gilly within a couple of weeks of their move to the mayoral manor to serve Mayor Somerton’s family. Now ten years old, she senses the ghosts and disturbing forces around her, knowing things a child shouldn’t. Though she cannot yet control her abilities, her bond with the powers of the Old Ways grows.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Shuck</strong></span></h3><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_CROOKHOUS_Shuck%20and%20Wisp_Finished.webp\" width=\"200\" /><p class=\"p5\">A red-furred dog that never leaves Dani’s side, Shuck (Neutral good <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWolf0000000000]{Wolf}</strong>) was a stray before the Jenkins took him in. Unbeknownst to the family, Shuck is the reincarnated soul of Sally Lockwood,<em><strong> </strong></em>a victim of the Crooked House who escaped just before her death. Shuck guards Dani fiercely. If any of the characters are evil, or if they use supernatural abilities that are in any way associated with the Crooked Queen, Shuck growls at them if they get anywhere near Dani.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Wisp</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The estate’s gray cat has earned Walter’s affection but terrifies Dani. The cat is no ordinary feline; it is a shapeshifted <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.N6ttfwgb1ckMzfST]{Ketgrinn}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span>, a Fey in service to Vessla Browntooth. Wisp stole Walter’s voice and torments Dani by speaking to her when they are alone. Shuck loathes Wisp, sensing his true nature, and stays close to protect Dani from the lurking evil. If the ketgrinn’s true form is exposed and slain, Walter’s ability to speak is restored.</p></div>"

This chapter is written under the assumption that the characters followed this quest hook to visit Druskenvald Estate.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Weaselly Weasels</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">While exploring Wickermoor Village, the characters notice a surprisingly large number of weasels scurrying about the town, eventually seeing Filthy Jasper himself scampering off holding a human tooth. Randall Graham, the barber-surgeon, approaches the characters and tells them he has seen the creatures stealing pulled teeth from his shop and scurrying up the hill to the Crooked House. He urges the characters to help put an end to the infestation.</p></div>"

Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>An old man with wild red-gray hair and filthy clothes scrambles toward you.

They feed. They laugh. Every step leads to his return. Its return. Her return. Disintegration. Annihilation.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">The characters can try to calm Old Rusty, but even if he’s made calm, he has nothing coherent to offer the characters. Rusty, whose true identity is Francis Patrini, was just a child when the Crooked House took his family away 70 years ago, and the traumatic experience left him forever changed.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Learning More</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters attempt to learn more about the Crooked House and its history, either now or at some other point when they're in Wickermoor Village, they don't get far. Most of the superstitious locals are so terrified of bringing evil upon themselves that they will not even speak of it out loud.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">Even the Newcomers, who pride themselves on reason, dismiss talk of cursed houses as mere fairy tales, unwilling to believe in the supernatural so close to home.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">They claim that while some of the families there have had bad luck, those same families may merely have been treating the place as a temporary vacation home before moving away. They genuinely believe—or hope—that the Crooked House is just a house, no matter how spooky its name and reputation are.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s13\">The most sinister members of the Followers of the Old Ways (see chapters 8 and 11) know the true history and encourage the notion that the house is perfectly safe. They need the house to feed on as many spirits as possible to quicken the return of the Crooked Queen.</span></p></div>"

His limbs jut off at odd angles, and his neck bends to the side in the manner of a hanged corpse. Clad in a tattered suit and a bent-top hat that covers his eyes, he smiles with an impossibly large grin filled with crooked, yellow teeth.</p><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>A Crooked Chat</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters strike up a conversation with the Crooked Man, be careful not to give away too much about the plot of the adventure too soon. Let the hints and the foreshadowing start in vague and unsettling means. Some answers he might give to those asking about him include:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">“Who I am is unimportant. What I am is for you to find out. I am your destiny. You will be crooked too.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Phillip and Adela are inside, waiting for you. They are getting to know the house. Or, more accurately, the house is getting to know them.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Phillip, Adela, you, and all your kind are a curse upon this once beautiful land. You will return from whence you came in blood and fire.”</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">“Go on in and enjoy the refreshments I’ve prepared for you. Phillip and Adela will be with you shortly.”</p></li></ul><h3><span class=\"s12\"><strong>Farewell for Now…</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the characters attempt to attack the Crooked Man in any way, he invokes the power of the Crooked House and simply disappears. Otherwise, after the Crooked Man has said everything he has to say, he doffs his hat toward the characters, gives a mocking bow, and vanishes. As if on command, a cacophonous boom of thunder shakes the house, and a violent storm rolls in. The sky opens up with pouring rain and howling winds.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">The Crooked Man appears to the characters at least once per floor (see “The First Floor,” “The Second Floor,” and “The Third Floor” later in this chapter), but no matter what the characters do, he will not attack them throughout their investigation of the Crooked House.

The plaque, though weathered, reveals the names: Eustace Lockwood, his wife Petunia, their daughter Sally, their infant son Arthur, and Petunia’s frail mother, Keziah. Standing beside them are their servants—Joseph and Gail Patrini, along with their son Francis.</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>The Druskenvalds.</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>The familiar faces in this portrait are rendered in a chilling light.

On a circular table by the cobweb-choked fireplace is a wooden spirit board of impeccable craftsmanship. A small heart-shaped planchette rests atop it, engraved with the initials “A.D.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s13\">This spirit board clearly belongs to Adela Druskenvald and can be used to conduct a séance that can give the characters critical information to unravel the mysteries of the Crooked House. A character who succeeds on a [[/check ARC DC 10]] check knows that to begin the séance, two or more characters must place a hand on the planchette and ask if there is a spirit in the room.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">If two or more characters agree to use the spirit board, it summons the spirit of Joseph Patrini, the servant who was murdered by Eustace Lockwood 70 years ago. A pleasant fire crackles to life in the fireplace, and the planchette moves to “HELLO.”</p><p class=\"p7\">The spirit board has numbers, letters, and the words “YES,” “NO,” “HELLO,” and “GOODBYE.” If one of the characters using the spirit board asks a question, the spirit of Joseph Patrini will answer to the best of his ability.</p><p class=\"p7\">His memories are muddled, clouded by time and the horrors he’s witnessed, and though far from omnipotent, he remembers the night of Eustace Lockwood’s rampage with grim clarity. He knows of the hag lurking in the attic and the six cursed mementos that will unlock the hidden chamber where she waits.</p><p class=\"p7\">You can decide what information to provide and what to hold back, but if clever questions are asked, be sure to reward the characters with useful information. Use this opportunity to provide clues, foreshadow, and increase the tension. Below are some possible questions and answers to guide your own play:</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Who are you?</strong> PATRINI</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Are Phillip and Adela here?</strong> YES</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Where are they?</strong> UPSTAIRS</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>How did you die?</strong> MURDER</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Who killed you?</strong> EUSTACE LOCKWOOD</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Who is responsible for this?</strong> HAG</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Where is the hag?</strong> ATTIC</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>How do we get to the attic?</strong> 6 MEMENTOS</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>What are the mementos?</strong> GEM KEY CUP DOLL BEAR PIN</p><p class=\"p13\"><strong>Where are they?</strong> EVERY FLOOR</p><p class=\"p5\">Roll [[/r 1d10]] every time the characters ask a question. On a 1, every character using the board takes [[/damage 1d4 psychic]]{2 (1d4)} Psychic damage. For each damage roll after the first, increase the damage die as follows: [[/damage 1d6 psychic]]{1d6}, [[/damage 1d8 psychic]]{1d8}, [[/damage 1d10 psychic]]{1d10}, and to a maximum of [[/damage 1d12 psychic]]{1d12}.</p><p class=\"p7\">As the séance draws to its close, Patrini offers one final, urgent message. This is your chance to reveal any critical information the characters may have overlooked. If they have gathered all the necessary clues, Patrini’s final words are etched in chilling clarity: “FIND MY SON HE LIVES.” This refers to Old Rusty, the groundskeeper of Wickermoor Village (see chapter 11).</p><p class=\"p7\">The planchette slowly drags itself to “GOODBYE,” and the fire in the hearth extinguishes with a hiss, plunging the room into a suffocating darkness. Any attempts to resume the séance are met only with cold, dead silence.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Mementos.</strong></em> A list of the locations of the six mementos needed to break the barrier to reach Vessla Browntooth is included in area H16.</p></div>"

All they remember is preparing for dinner and then passing out and experiencing horrific nightmares until rescued.</p><p class=\"p7\">Most of Vessla’s work in the Cauldron Room vanished when the house returned to its more pleasing configuration, but scratchings in the attic reveal that this hag was just the first of three in the Vermintoll Coven. The names of her sisters are among the scratchings: Stonoga Blackstinger and Golub Graygullet. Hundreds of human teeth remain, littering the floor.</p><p class=\"p7\">Despite the horrors the characters witnessed in the Crooked House, Phillip decides to stay in the mansion while in Wickermoor Village. Phillip is hopeful that whatever curse has been afflicting him will now be lifted. He pays each character [[/award 75gp]] for their assistance. Phillip and Adela insists the characters get some rest and take their time exploring Wickermoor Village.</p><p class=\"p7\">When the Jenkins return to the Druskenvald Estate, they are mortified to discover what had transpired but are relieved that the haunting has been purged.

The secret cultists try to conveniently “run into” the characters around town and go out of their way to gain their trust.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s5\">With Vessla Browntooth dead, the weasels that lived in the walls of the Crooked House have scattered and fled into Wickermoor Village, still influenced by their master’s spirit, which is tethered to Wickermoor Hollow. They can be found scurrying through the back alleys and in the walls of the town, particularly lingering around Randall’s Barber Shop to steal pulled teeth.</span></p></div>"

From the depths of what was once Glitterdeep Mine, rich with veins of gold, silver, and iron, the contamination spreads. Seventy years ago, a suspicious cave-in occurred, and the few rescuers who returned spoke of terrors before they condemned the mine, leaving it abandoned.</p><p class=\"p6\">Now called Skitterdeep Mine after its many-legged inhabitants, it is mentioned only in hushed tones, with wary glances over shoulders in fear of the crawling minions and the hag rumored to have brought ruin upon its darkened tunnels.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">A trio of ancient hags known as the Vermintoll Coven has long wrought their wicked magic upon the fields, forests, and villages of Wickermoor Hollow. Seventy years ago, the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger corrupted Skitterdeep Mine—a once thriving source of precious ores.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s7\">Using illusion, hearty food, and strong drink, she wormed her way into the miners’ trust. Then, she poisoned and twisted them all into grotesque abominations and collapsed the tunnels, trapping the wretched souls within. A cadre of knights attempted a rescue, but they too fell to Stonoga’s influence as she warped their flesh to create new minions.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">Over the years, fear and superstition shrouded the Skitterdeep Mine. Travelers still vanish near its entrance, taken as material for her pestilent experiments. The infestation has now spread beyond the mine, skittering throughout the walls, beneath the earth, and within the bodies of Wickermoor Village.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Wickermoor Hollow is infested with countless centipedes that devour foodstuffs, spread disease, and even burrow into the bodies of the townsfolk. The source of the infestation is the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger, who seeks a new supply of human flesh for her twisted experiments deep within her abandoned mine. With each passing night, the vermin that have taken over town claim more victims and devour more food stores, threatening widespread death and famine. Characters drawn to the mine by the Quest Hooks later in this chapter have these goals:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Discover and trace the source of the tunneling vermin to Skitterdeep Mine, and face the horrors within.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Stonoga Blackstinger and end the Skitter Plague.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with the centipede hag Stonoga Blackstinger, the key NPC. Review the Quest Hooks to provide a compelling reason for the characters to venture to the abandoned mine. Finally, read through the locations of Skitterdeep Mine so you are ready to improvise encounters as the characters explore.</span></p><p class=\"p6\">This chapter is designed for four level 7 characters.</p></div>"

Her unnaturally tall and lanky body has morphed over the years to more closely resemble the centipedes she favors, losing her nose and most of her toes and stretching her neck out by several feet.</p><p class=\"p6\">Just as it was her sister Vessla’s role in the coven to twist souls in preparation for sacrifice to the Crooked Queen, Stonoga is tasked with corrupting bodies. She cares not for the matters of mind and spirit, as all life to her is simply meat to be molded beneath her jagged fingers. But despite this, she has a jovial disposition, taking glee in savoring the suffering of her victims.</p><p class=\"p6\">Unlike her sisters, she prefers to hide away in the deepest, darkest holes in the earth where she can be embraced by the squirming swarms of her beloved centipedes. It is in these places that never see the light of the moon where she conducts her alchemy, witchcraft, and fleshcrafting.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s7\">Stonoga has been waiting for the night that her younger sister Vessla is slain, a moment foreseen and deemed a necessary sacrifice by her older sister Golub. The two older hags conspired to allow the weasel hag to be butchered in the Crooked House, but Stonoga has no idea that she herself was deceived. Golub Graygullet believed the middle sister needed to die too, as whispered by the Crooked Queen with the promise of being elevated within the inevitable crooked court of Kehlenn.

The familiar of Stonoga Blackstinger, he shares his mistress’s glee in the horrid reshaping of flesh into new forms. He can command the squirming hordes of centipedes that crawl throughout Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p6\">Rather than being a collector of body parts like his weasel counterpart Filthy Jasper, Oswald prefers to create grotesque homes out of his master's victims. He burrows deep into Humanoid carcasses and rearranges the rotting innards to his liking, often lurking within for weeks at a time. Sometimes, he even digs into a healthy person to corrupt and prime their body for flesh shaping while they still live.</p></div>"

The sick only have a few nights to live before succumbing to the affliction. A solution must be found before it’s too late.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Infestation</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The village is infested with thousands of centipedes sent by Stonoga Blackstinger. These vermin consume food stores, burrow into the flesh of the living, and spread a magical contagion that afflicts those bitten by the creatures (see “Skitter Plague” below).</p><p class=\"p6\">After the characters finish a long rest in Wickermoor Village, four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.tJfa26b7QkIdtyhY]{Skitterswarms}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> emerge from the walls and floor of wherever they are staying and attack. Creatures hit by the swarms’ attacks must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw or be afflicted with Skitter Plague. Dozens of small mundane centipedes crawl throughout the floorboards as well.</p><p class=\"p6\">When the characters step out into the streets of Wickermoor Village after dispatching the skitterswarms, many people are gathered here having fled their homes from centipede infestations. When asked about what’s going on, the plight is consistent across the townsfolk’s stories:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">They awoke with dozens of centipedes crawling in their beds, many having been bitten.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Their stored food is infested with centipedes, and much of it has been eaten.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Some larger, more grotesque, and especially vicious centipedes have dug into certain people’s skin.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">People quickly started falling ill, coming down with fever, breaking out into mauve-colored pustules, and vomiting black bile.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Over the next few hours, ten more villagers succumb to the unknown malady, all with similar stories. If nothing is done, the Skitter Plague will become an epidemic.</p><h2><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Skitter Plague</strong></span></h2><p class=\"p11\"><span class=\"s12\"><em><strong>Magical Contagion</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p5\">Skitter Plague was created by the hag Stonoga Blackstinger, and it spreads through the bites of her grotesque centipedes. A creature bitten by any kind of centipede under Stonoga’s control must succeed on a [[/save CON DC 12]] saving throw or suffer the following effects [[/r 1d4]] hours after infection:</p><p class=\"p12\"><strong>Fever. </strong>The creature gains 1 &amp;reference[exhaustion apply=false] level that can’t be removed until the contagion ends on the creature.</p><p class=\"p12\"><strong>Crawling Blisters.</strong> Blisters that feel like crawling centipedes form on the creature’s skin. When the creature finishes a Long Rest, it takes [[/damage 1d4 necrotic]]{2 (1d4)} Necrotic damage, and its Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The creature dies if this effect reduces its Hit Point maximum to 0. The reduction can’t be removed until the contagion ends on the creature. A Humanoid that dies from this contagion explodes into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.tJfa26b7QkIdtyhY]{Skitterswarm}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> at the next Midnight Hour, the corpse’s flesh and bones turning into a malleable putty-like substance that can be split apart and carried by centipedes back to Skitterdeep Mine.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s7\"><em><strong>Fighting the Plague.</strong></em> A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplLesserRest]{Lesser Restoration}</em> spell suppresses the effect of the contagion for 24 hours. Nightly at the Twilight Hour, an infected creature makes a [[/save CON DC 15]] saving throw. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the contagion ends for it.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Trail of Corruption</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The characters can investigate the town to find where the centipedes are coming from by succeeding on a group [[/check INV DC 15]] or [[/check SUR DC 15]] check, discovering a sprawling network of tiny tunnels in the earth that seem to be coming from the northwest of Wickermoor Village.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s7\">After deducing the direction from which the centipedes are burrowing into town, the characters are approached by Mrs. Oakum (see chapter 11), who works for Siv Harga at the butcher shop. She tells the characters that the centipede infestation perfectly matched stories that her father used to tell her about the old abandoned mine in the wooded hills northwest of Wickermoor Village. Use the details below to guide the conversation with her:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Her family used to live in a small community of hill-folk that worked in mining, logging, and trapping.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Decades ago, the old Glitterdeep Mine had a terrible cave-in that trapped dozens of miners within.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Thousands of huge, monstrous centipedes were seen skittering in the hills and into the mine.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">A large rescue party was organized, but those who went into the mine never returned.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The rumor among the community was that it was a hag that caused the tragedy.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Swearing vengeance, a posse of riders was rallied to kill the hag and her minions, but they were never heard from again.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Fear of vile magic and the loss of work in the mine caused the community to dwindle.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Folks who know the old story have called the abandoned mine Skitterdeep for years.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Mrs. Oakum offers to guide the characters through the hills but says she won’t get too close to the mine, fearing the hag that lurks in the depths. If the characters accept her help, the journey to the mine is the ideal opportunity to have her true identity as a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWerewolf000000]{Werewolf} </strong>be revealed through an inadvertent transformation, whether it be through danger that the characters experience or hunger triggered by a forest creature.</p><p class=\"p6\">If the characters don’t take it upon themselves to investigate the mine, Morgan the apothecary (see chapter 11) requests their assistance. They stress that if nothing is done, the sickness will overwhelm the town, and there will not be enough healers to tend to the ill—made worse by the indifference of the de facto surgeon Randall Graham, who believes the situation will resolve itself without taking drastic action. If necessary, Morgan offers the characters a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgGreaterPotion]{Potion of Healing (greater)}</em> each to find the cause of the sickness and eliminate it.</p><p class=\"p6\">Characters who monitor the health of afflicted villagers over the course of the night, or Morgan the apothecary if the characters don’t think to, realize that the illness is likely fatal over the course of several nights.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Sisterly “Love”</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">If the characters are not in Wickermoor Village when you wish to initiate the events of this chapter, a carrier pigeon finds them wherever they are, delivering a letter from postmaster Theodora Mayville. She informs them of the town’s infestation and her own suspicion that the centipedes were coming from Skitterdeep Mine.</p><p class=\"p6\">She claims that she sent out a rider, who normally delivers large parcels, to investigate the mine, but he never returned. Theodora implores the characters to head to the mine themselves and put an end to the infestation, offering [[/award 50gp]] to each character once the plague is halted.</p><p class=\"p6\">This is a ruse by Golub Graygullet (see chapter 8) to lure the characters into finding and killing her sister Stonoga as a sacrifice in honor of the Crooked Queen. If the characters follow this quest hook, they are confronted by a lone <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.CgbJgAILFFyH25Oi]{Fleshdobbin}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span><strong> </strong>when they are three miles out from the mine—the flesh-crafted parcel rider that Theodora had sent to his doom.</p></div>"

How can you truly appreciate the few, brief moments of sweetness in life without first tastin’ a whole bunch of bitter?”</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>- The Vagrant -</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Phillip Druskenvald is dead. Kehlenn has suffered her final defeat. The journey of these two souls, intertwined by fate since time immemorial, has finally come to an end. As they moved toward their inevitable destiny, they left an immeasurable amount of death, destruction, and despair in their wake. It is up to the survivors to pick up the pieces.</p><p>In the aftermath of the bloody and burning fall of the Horned King and the Crooked Queen, the story of <em>The Crooked Moon</em> comes to an end. What awaits the characters following this epilogue is up to you and your players.</p><p>Tables interested in epic fantasy may continue the adventure into the higher tiers of play, and you can even guide the characters all the way to 20th level in Wickermoor Hollow with the tools presented in chapter 26. However, concluding the adventure following the events at the Crooked Tree provides for the most thematic experience that stays true to the spirit of folk horror. This epilogue is written with this in mind.</p><h2>What's Become of Wickermoor?</h2><p>After the defeat of the Horned King and the Crooked Queen, the characters leave the Wytchwood to find Wickermoor Hollow forever changed by their time in the valley. Although its people have grown accustomed to difficult lives filled with hardship and horror, the events in the recent weeks have deeply shaken even the hollow’s hardiest folk.</p><p>Of all the places in the valley, Wickermoor Village has suffered the most since the characters first arrived from beyond the Shroud. Following the chaos unleashed by the minions of the Crooked Queen, some people search for a scapegoat to blame and exact vengeance upon, while others hope to leverage the instability to gain power. Most of the townsfolk, however, simply want to get their old lives back and return to some form of normalcy.</p><p>How the specific NPCs have been affected is largely dependent on the connections and choices that the characters made and how you chose to incorporate them throughout the adventure, especially during the burning of the Wicker Man atop Rowan’s Rise.</p><p>As the characters spend time in Wickermoor Village to wrap up their unfinished business, make sure to tie up plot lines and provide closure with the surviving NPCs that became important to the characters. The people of the various ideologies and groups of the village respond to the recent horrors in the following ways.</p><h3><strong>Followers of the Old Ways</strong></h3><p>With the cult of the Crooked Queen exposed and almost entirely wiped out, the followers of the Old Ways who revered the Green Queen and never fell to wickedness become more entrenched in their superstitions and beliefs, blaming the corruption of their kin on the influence of new and profane ideals brought to the valley over the years. They become more distrustful of nonbelievers and anyone outside of their community, even going so far as to drive off members of the other groups. Wickermoor Hollow and its settlements retreat into the comfort of the old ideals.</p><h3><strong>Fold of the Patient Lady</strong></h3><p>Many adherents of the Patient Lady see the apocalyptic inevitability of magic and strange supernatural power and conclude that they must escape this doom, trusting that the wilds will provide for them. They chase off their own members who have magical abilities, leave the settlements of Wickermoor Hollow, and relocate to the natural world they view as a paradise, even if they do not have the survival skills to withstand the harsh conditions that await them.</p><h3><strong>The Brightsingers</strong></h3><p>Unlike the Fold of the Patient Lady, the Brightsingers do not lose hope in their community, seeing the recent disasters as proof that the bizarre superstitions and grim rituals of the valley are heretical acts that nearly brought about the doom of Druskenvald. Energized with a zealous desire to convert the folk who hold outdated beliefs to their newer religion filled with light, love, and truth, they call more missionaries to the valley and begin to aggressively spread their faith.</p><h3><strong>The Newcomers</strong></h3><p>The death of Phillip Druskenvald represents the crumbling of everything he stood for. All his vision, forward thinking, progress, and enlightenment could not save him from the hate of the old things. The newcomers in the valley see that there is little left for them, and what little hope they had was foolishness. Most of these folk will leave Wickermoor Hollow behind and seek civilizations that share their ideals, perhaps even seeking passage aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> to discover new horizons beyond Druskenvald.</p><h2>Foxwillow</h2><p>While the once cheery and hardworking folk of Foxwillow had shared deep fellowship, the time spent trapped within the Fields of the Crow took a toll. The secrets unearthed and bared to all planted seeds of doubt, distrust, and shame amidst the efforts to rebuild. The Patient Lady is abandoned by the people, and strife slowly seeps back into the town. However, just when things look bleakest, a one-legged stranger from beyond the valley arrives to unite the community around a god of the four winds, and the fellowship of Foxwillow is restored once more, led by the vision of the man known only as Virgil.</p><h2>Dawn’s Gate</h2><p>If the fiendish identity of the Crimson Rose was not publicly revealed by the characters, the power vacuum and subsequent battles for control inevitably expose the truth of Viraxys, and the religion is abandoned after a violent falling-out. The former faithful and the townsfolk of Dawn’s Gate come together in their bitterness toward the faith that manipulated and terrorized them for so long. Worship of any kind is outlawed, and parties of riders regularly patrol to bring justice and vengeance to any missionaries or evangelists.</p><h2>Murkwater Bend</h2><p>With the threat of the shambling dead brought to an end, the people of Murkwater Bend were able to go back to their lives in peace, until the swamp trees of the Drowned Crossroads began blooming Snake Eye Magnolias, a flower with tremendous and versatile properties that are useful for healing, pleasure, spellcasting, and more. An enormous boom of prosperity comes to Murkwater Bend, and Vander Boone even contacts the Crescent Court with promises of their wildest dreams, including bringing their unruly folk to heel and a proposal to legitimize Wickermoor Hollow as an officially recognized province.</p></div>"

They may want to go home and put the horror of Druskenvald behind them, they might want to discover what awaits in the other provinces of the land of eternal night, or they could seek new horizons in other strange worlds within the Shroud. The possibilities are endless, but what matters is that their part in this story is over.</p><h2>There’s an Old Black Train A-Comin’</h2><p>During the Midnight Hour, when the characters are ready to depart Wickermoor Hollow, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote style=\"max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;padding:0.5em 2em;border-left:4px solid #a67c00;border-right:4px solid #a67c00;background:transparent;color:#a67c00;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-align:center\"><p><em><strong>The darkness of the Midnight Hour surrounds you as a heavy fog shrouds the valley in an eerie gloom. A faint, distant music sails through the air—a single fiddle. Then a shrill whistle that sounds of wailing souls pierces the quiet of night, heralding the rumbling, chugging, and scraping of a locomotive. A single circle of ghastly blue-green light grows larger in the fog as the engine of the Ghostlight Express thunders out of the gloom on rails of mist. It slows before screeching to a halt in front of you.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The darkened windows of the passenger car flank the single side door that opens with a creak.

He tells them that he owes them a ride and asks where they’re headed.</p><p>If Phillip and Adela are mentioned, he briefly removes his hat for a moment of silence before stating that he’s sorry to have heard what happened to them, but he shrugs and claims that death comes for everyone, even the deathless. He shares rumors that the power vacuum in the Crescent Court has led to a power struggle among the lords and ladies of the court, intensified by the recent increase of wicked activity from the Coven of the Midnight Moon.</p><p>When the characters give the Vagrant their tickets and tell him where they’d like to go, he agrees and welcomes them aboard the passenger car, which has no spectral passengers this trip.

Once a quiet town cradled by endless cornfields, now these fields devour any who dares enter. They belong to Raum, the Harvest Terror—a demonic scarecrow with the head of a crow, cursed with an insatiable hunger for secrets. His very being is nourished by forbidden truths, yet he doesn’t merely feed on them. He weaves them into chaos, turning neighbor against neighbor, sowing discord as effortlessly as seeds. Only the destruction of Raum can save this once-peaceful town.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">East of Wickermoor Village lies the town of Foxwillow, known far and wide as the breadbasket of Wickermoor Hollow. The people of this idyllic town are friendly, rural folk. They worship the Patient Lady, dutifully tend to the fields, help one another, and never speak ill of other souls… to their faces, at least. But evil lurks below the façade.</p><p class=\"p7\">Secret resentments have multiplied in recent months, darkening Foxwillow like the shadow cast by a murder of crows. People have grown suspicious of others, certain their neighbors harbor vile secrets. Crops have failed (sparing only the corn), insects swarm, and cattle waste away and die, while the Foxwillow folk blame each other for negligence, laziness, and stupidity.</p><p class=\"p7\">It began six months ago when Ol’ Jericho Sticks disappeared. A living scarecrow, Jericho had wandered Foxwillow for generations, crafting effigies for the fields and singing as evening fell. When he vanished into the corn, no trace of him remained. Whispers of murder spread, and hidden grudges tore the town apart.</p><p class=\"p7\">As blame grew, the crops withered—except for the cornfields to the east. Worse still, more townsfolk disappeared, their places taken by grotesque scarecrow effigies (see “The Harvest Terror” later in this chapter).</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Foxwillow is a haunted husk of a town. None dare trust enough to band together, nor is anyone brave enough to venture into the corn where the lost have vanished. Characters drawn to the town by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have these goals:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Venture to Foxwillow with the quest-giver, William Lodge.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Stop the survivors in Foxwillow from turning on each other.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Offer secrets to Raum (their own, or secrets learned within Foxwillow) to gain entrance to the demonic corn maze demiplane known as the Fields of the Crow.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Survive the dangers of the Fields of the Crow and find Raum.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Destroy Raum, the Harvest Terror.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, familiarize yourself with Raum, the key NPC, to infuse his menace throughout. A casual reading of the Foxwillow locations helps when you improvise interactions. Lastly, reviewing the climactic battle, “The Wicked Harvest,” ensures a smooth and gripping final encounter.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 4 characters.</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap13\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Harvest Terror</p><p>A strange and wonderful creature named Ol’ Jericho Sticks, a sentient scarecrow, came to Wickermoor Hollow years ago. The scarecrow, a wandering tunesmith, held a secret inside of him, literally and figuratively: a crow demon lurked within Jericho’s straw-stuffed body and was the true and terrible power that gave him life.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Ol’ Jericho Sticks</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Raum_and_Jericho.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Jericho was a haunted scarecrow—but a friendly one. He traipsed about the farmlands around Foxwillow, singing songs to drown out the sounds of sorrow within him. The people of Foxwillow loved the straw-stuffed drifter who wove through the rows of straw and stover, serenading the fieldhands on his banjo as they worked.</p><p class=\"p7\">But eventually, even music was not enough to resist the voice inside his head. As the decades passed, the demon that Jericho called “Virgil” grew in power and slowly spread his discord to the people of Foxwillow. As a result, the townsfolk became more suspicious of him, filling the scarecrow with increasing self-doubt. Virgil preyed on this uncertainty, manipulating the wounded psyche of his host until Jericho gave in to the whispers.</p><p class=\"p7\">When Jericho realized the demon inside him was gaining control, he retreated into the cornfields to keep his beloved Foxwillowers safe. Tragically, the struggle was short. His soul was devoured by Virgil, and the two merged into a new demon in the crumpled scarecrow body. He is now Raum, the Harvest Terror, a crow-like Fiend with a body of straw and rusted metal.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">The Scourge of Foxwillow</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Raum <em>(rah-OOM)</em> loves to destroy all that Jericho loved to create. He stalks the rural lands of eastern Wickermoor Hollow, wielding sharp blades and sharper words to drive fear into the hearts of all who live there. He takes special glee in luring people from Jericho’s beloved Foxwillow into his demiplane of endless corn mazes, the Fields of the Crow, to steal their bodies, souls, and secrets.</p><p class=\"p7\">Jericho is gone forever, but tiny scraps of his kindly consciousness still cling like rotten flesh to Raum’s vile bones. If the characters learn the tender secrets of Ol’ Jericho Sticks, what’s left of him fights back and aids them (see “Gathering Information” and “The Wicked Harvest” later in this chapter).</p><img style=\"border:none;margin:auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/MAP_41_Relationship_chart_crows.webp\" width=\"300\" class=\" centered\" /><h2><span class=\"s5\">Raum’s Curse</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Raum feeds on secrets and delights in destruction. Learning secrets sustains him and grants him greater power. Not only do they increase his demonic magic, but they also empower him to manipulate mortal hearts. He has two primary means of harvesting secrets:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Black-Feathered Spies.</strong> Murders of crows gaze hungrily upon Foxwillow in numbers great enough to make bare trees look flush with black leaves when they gather. They are always listening, waiting to report back bits of information to Raum.</p><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>Gateway to the Stalks.</strong> The second method is the gateway to the Fields of the Crow. All who approach it of their own free will are addressed by Raum directly. They are bidden to sacrifice a damning secret if they wish to gain entry to Raum’s domain. This sacrifice empowers Raum’s game statistics (see “The Wicked Harvest” at the end of this chapter). At your discretion, this secret sparks nasty rumors about the character who divulged it back in Foxwillow and Wickermoor Village.</span></p></div>"

Most of its people have been lured into the cornfield and vanished. All missing folk have been replaced in town by eerie scarecrows, described wherever they are in town (see “Areas within Foxwillow” later in this chapter). However, there are five noteworthy NPCs still in town.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\">These NPCs have complicated relationships and hide many secrets from one another that prevent them from trusting each other. When the characters meet the NPCs in town, use these descriptions and the Foxwillow Relationship Chart at the end of this section to help you roleplay them.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">William Lodge</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_William_Lodge.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">A tenant farmer of the wealthy Thatcher family, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.5jMZIjyURhd2xvmP]{William}</strong> (Neutral Good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong>) lives on the outskirts of Foxwillow and tends grains and gourds while raising livestock. As such, he has a close relationship with both the people of Foxwillow and of Wickermoor Village, which he often travels to monthly for market.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Changing William’s Attitude</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Though indifferent toward the characters when they meet him, his attitude increases one step to Friendly if they agree to join him in saving Foxwillow. His attitude decreases one step to Hostile if they intentionally cause destruction or loot the town (such as looting the statue in area J2) but increases one step if they take action to help (such as putting out fires when the town is burning).</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s9\">His attitude increases one step if the characters demonstrate selfless heroism or emotional tenderness. His attitude decreases one step if they are selfish or try to Influence him to learn a secret from him and fail their Charisma check.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>William’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Though unmarried himself, William had an affair with another farmer’s wife, Martha Langtree, who soon had a son with him. This son is the middle Langtree child, Isaac.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning His Secret.</strong></em> As an Influence action, a character convinces William to reveal this secret with a successful [[/check ITM DC 15]] or [[/check PER DC 15]] check.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Martha Langtree</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Martha_Langtree.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.evDgavXpsvSvXDzN]{Martha}</strong> (Lawful Good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong>) is a widow of ten years who works her farm with the help of her three children Adelaide, Isaac, and Rosemary. Lean and toned from years of hard work, she has a brash personality and is often called a force of nature by the townsfolk.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Martha loves all her children dearly but worries for them. Adelaide has acted strangely since Ol’ Jericho Sticks vanished, then Rosemary vanished a week ago. Just this dusk, Isaac went missing too and Adelaide seems unconcerned. Martha is at her wits’ end and inadvertently started a brawl in the Old Windmill (see “Foxwillow in Flames” later in this chapter) while William was out of town seeking aid.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Changing Martha’s Attitude</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Despite the horrors occurring at her doorstep, Martha is easy to befriend. She becomes immediately Friendly if they save Jonah from death in the “The Burning Mill” encounter. Otherwise, she is Indifferent.</p><p class=\"p2\">Her attitude increases one step if the characters demonstrate selfless heroism or emotional tenderness. Her attitude decreases one step if they are selfish or try to Influence her to learn a secret from her and fail their Charisma check.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Martha’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">Farmer Malachai, Martha’s husband, was a violent drunk, and Martha accidentally killed him while defending herself. She has kept this secret ever since to protect her children.</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning Her Secret.</strong></em> As an Influence action, a character convinces Martha to reveal this secret with a successful [[/check ITM DC 15]] or [[/check PER DC 15]] check. This secret is in addition to her extramarital role in William’s secret (see above).</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Adelaide Langtree</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Adelaide_Langtree.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.zr5NA2G0xwn86uBJ]{Adelaide}</strong> (Chaotic Evil, human<strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCultist0000000]{Cultist}</strong>) is the eldest child of Martha at twenty-five years old. She was a difficult child who played over-competitively with the other children and enjoyed morbid practical jokes to peeve her unpleasant father, like hiding rat carcasses in his boots overnight. Jericho was her best friend because she had a hard time making friends with other kids her age.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">As she grew older, Adelaide’s antisocial behavior deepened. Jericho vanished on her twenty-fifth birthday, and ever since, she’s wandered into the cornfields after her nightly work, only returning when it’s time for bed. Some whisper she killed Jericho, while others claim she’s searching for her only friend. None who followed her into the corn have ever returned.</p><p class=\"p7\">Three weeks after Jericho’s disappearance, she found him—now the monstrous, crow-headed demon, Raum. The Harvest Terror spoke with Jericho’s voice, calling himself her best friend, vowing to love her if she revealed her secrets. She confessed witnessing her father’s abuse and her mother’s fatal act.</p><p class=\"p7\">The demon Raum told her that he is an angel sent to reveal the evil secrets in Foxwillow. Confused, but seduced by his words, Adelaide has spent recent months gathering secrets and luring folks into the cornfields, where Raum spirits them away to wander forever in the Fields of the Crow.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Changing Adelaide’s Attitude</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Adelaide is fully in Raum’s thrall. She can’t be swayed from being Hostile toward the characters.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Adelaide’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">In her communion with Raum, Adelaide has learned William’s secret—that her brother Isaac is really her half-brother. She’s been manipulated into believing that her mother’s infidelity and her half-brother’s birth are the real causes of her fear and suffering in childhood. She was goaded by Raum into murdering Isaac, and she hid his corpse in the basement of the Old Windmill (area J1), where it is incubating a demonic servant of the Harvest Terror.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning Her Secret.</strong></em> Adelaide’s murderous secret is revealed when the characters find her brother’s corpse in the Windmill Cellar (area J9b). If her mother Martha is told of what happened, Martha weeps and gives the characters a handmade brass locket her brother made for her to try and earn her love as a child.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Jonah Sawyer</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Jonah_Sawyer.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\"><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.1ZWk2BR1uBsQcYMe]{Jonah}</strong> (Neutral Good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thug}</strong>) has a reputation as a rugged, broad-shouldered man with a humor as hefty as his sinewed frame. As Foxwillow’s butcher, he’s often seen in a bloodstained apron striding through town. His signature platform shoes, worn to keep his feet dry from pigs’ blood, earned him the nickname “Heels.” His only daughter, Liza, has gone missing in recent nights.</p><p class=\"p7\">Though he’s truly not responsible for all Foxwillow’s ills, Jonah has been on edge lately, burdened by guilt over the town’s curse and the disappearance of his daughter. In a fit of rage, he cursed William Lodge, and his shame has made him antagonistic toward his neighbors (see “Foxwillow in Flames” later in this chapter).</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Changing Jonah’s Attitude</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Suspicious by nature, Jonah is difficult to befriend. If characters talk with him about breaking the curse, he asks if they think whoever caused the curse was evil, or just misguided. His attitude increases one step to Friendly if they say they’ll be sympathetic to the curse-maker or that they’ll keep an eye out for Liza. If they suggest that they’ll kill the person who cursed Foxwillow, he becomes fearful and Hostile, refusing to speak at length.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Jonah’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Jonah has harbored resentment for William Lodge for years, though he no longer recalls why. By all accounts, William is well-liked and even sells livestock to the butcher. But Jonah recently discovered William had been selling him scrawnier stock than he sells to Siv Harga in Wickermoor Village, who pays a higher price for well-cared-for prize beasts.</p><p class=\"p7\">In a fit of ire, Jonah slaughtered a lamb and invoked an old folk hex his grandmother once whispered about. He cursed William’s fields and herds and—to his horror—the curse took root. Now, Foxwillow’s crops and livestock wither—save for the demon-infested cornfield, which thrives unnaturally. Jonah, wracked with guilt, grows defensive, fearing the town’s ruin rests on his shoulders.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning His Secret.</strong></em> As an Influence action, characters convince Jonah to reveal this secret with a successful [[/check ITM DC 15]] or [[/check PER DC 15]] check.</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Isaac Langtree</span></h2><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20gm/TOOL_MAP_40_Relationship_chart.webp\" /><p class=\"p5\">A boyishly handsome man of twenty-one, Isaac Langtree ran the Hooded Lantern, his family’s tavern, but he continued helping his mother on the farm when able. He vanished the night before the characters arrived, but not into the cornfield. He was lured into the basement of the Old Windmill (area J1) by his sister Adelaide and ritualistically murdered. His corpse is there still.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Isaac’s Secret</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Charm and good looks made him popular in town, but he secretly despised the quaint, folksy ways of his rural neighbors. He had developed an especially intense dislike of manual labor after apprenticing as a butcher under Jonah Sawyer in his youth. Each market night, he skimmed money from his mother and stashed it under a floorboard in the tavern in preparation to leave for a life on the road. He was trying to convince his sister Adelaide to skip town with him when she killed him.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Learning His Secret.</strong></em> Isaac’s duplicitous secret is revealed when the characters find his secret cache under a floorboard in the Hooded Lantern (area J4).</p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Scarecrow Townsfolk</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:auto\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/Holly_DECO_ADV_FIELDSOFTHECROW_Demon%20of%20secrets.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Most of Foxwillow’s people have vanished, lost in the Fields of the Crow. Their bodies, twisted under Raum’s control, are now grotesque scarecrows—burlap stuffed with straw and pumpkin heads carved into haunting mockeries of their former faces. Their spirits, however, are doomed to wander the endless maze of cornstalks. Only Raum’s destruction frees the lost spirits and turns the scarecrows back into people.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s6\">These scarecrows litter the town, sitting slumped in homes and shops, grim reminders of those they replaced. Descriptions of several scarecrows are found in each area.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Jumpscarecrow!</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the investigation of the town is slowing down, [[/r 1d3]] <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.Plgibu7fguyYVcTG]{Pumpkin Heads}</strong><span class=\"s10\">*</span> spring to life and attack. After the scarecrows are defeated, have a friendly NPC rush up and share a Vital Clue or Optional Clue they’ve learned (see “Investigating Foxwillow” later in this chapter) to give the characters a new lead.</p><p class=\"p7\">These scarecrows are the missing townsfolk’s mortal bodies. If a pumpkin head is reduced to 0 hit points by Fire damage (burning the body) or Bludgeoning damage (squashing the pumpkin head), the mortal body is also destroyed in a similarly gruesome way when it reverts back to its original human form after Raum is defeated. Other types of damage typically just muss the straw or burlap, leaving the mortal body with scars but no lasting wounds once reverted.</p></div>"

Jeremiah asks William to repeat it and pleads with the characters to listen. William Lodge is a salt-of-the-earth, middle-aged farmer with a folksy accent and an earnest love for his village in his eyes.

They must reach the center of the maze to find and destroy Raum. Along the way, they find wandering spirits of the people of Foxwillow. Destroying Raum saves these spirits, but freeing them from their listless wandering grants the characters boons in the final confrontation.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Time Pressure</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">While in the Fields of the Crow, the characters feel, with growing dread, their sense of self slowly slipping away. After three hours, the characters’ souls are ripped from their bodies, condemned to wander the Fields of the Crow for eternity. Their bodies transform into scarecrows, forever trapped in Foxwillow. This could mark the end of the campaign—unless a path to salvation remains. Perhaps a new band of adventurers is introduced, guided by the willful spirits of the fallen, or the Crooked Man, acting for the Crooked Queen, offers salvation at a dreadful price.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Which Way?</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">This maze has no map. Instead, those lost inside must choose the correct path at three Junctions to reach Raum. Each Junction is a 50-foot-radius clearing with three new paths to choose from: Left, Right, or Center. To discover which path is correct, a Search action and a successful [[/check PRC DC 18]] check allows the characters to discern which path has the loudest cawing of crows. On a failure, they only learn which path is the quietest (narrowing their options down to two). If the check fails by 5 or more, the crass cacophony of the crows surrounds them, making it impossible to discern the paths. The correct order of paths to follow is:</span></p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\"><strong>First Junction:</strong> Left Path</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><strong>Second Junction:</strong> Right Path</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><strong>Third Junction:</strong> Left Path</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">When the characters enter the maze, they travel through the winding, 5-foot-wide paths of the maze for 10 minutes before reaching a Junction with three paths and a random encounter (see “Random Encounters” below). If they choose the wrong path at any Junction, they wander for 10 minutes before reaching a Dead End (also a 50-foot radius clearing in the corn maze and a random encounter). They must then backtrack to the last Junction to choose again.</p><p class=\"p7\">If they choose the correct path, they wind through the corn maze for 10 minutes before reaching the next Junction. When they choose the correct path from the Third Junction, they travel for 10 minutes before reaching the center of the maze. See “The Wicked Harvest,” for the final battle against Raum.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Random Encounters</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Each time the characters enter a Junction or Dead End for the first time, roll once on the Cornfield Encounters table and once on the Cornfield Environment table below to determine what creatures are in that Junction or Dead End and what environmental effects are in play. Roll again if you roll a result that’s already been used. After all encounters and environments have been rolled, any further random encounter results in a Crowstorm with Disorienting Crowsong.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_FIELDS_FILLER.webp\" /><p class=\"p15\"><span class=\"s12\"><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.iOAphQmx4wgwdntu]{Cornfield Encounters}</strong></em></span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Controlled by Secrets.</strong></em> Adelaide Langtree (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.9qrckgonmfCl6Vsx]{Corvodaemon}</strong><span class=\"s10\">*</span>) is here.

This use of the spell plays on the character’s fears about their secret coming to light, so targets that have immunity to the frightened condition automatically succeed on the saving throw.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Crowstorm.</strong></em> The twisting maze of moving corn narrows, and suddenly the characters are surrounded by screeching crows from all sides.

The imposters use the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmDoppelganger00]{Doppelganger} </strong>stat block and immediately begin reading the character’s surface thoughts with <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsterfeatures.Item.w5mFTTFsdKC7TXgg]{Read Thoughts}<strong>.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p7\">As a Study action, a character who examines the figures and succeeds on a [[/check INV DC 15]] check—made with Disadvantage if the character is more than 10 feet away—notices subtle, unsettling warps of facial features that give away the disguise. Anyone that doesn’t succeed on the check is surprised when the imposters attack.</p><p class=\"p7\">The imposters’ chains vanish and they attack as soon as someone comes within reach, or when they realize their ruse failed. When defeated, they dissolve back into whisps of nightmare and fade away.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Lost Soul.</strong></em> The spirit of someone from Foxwillow is being tortured for any secrets it has left to hide by two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.9qrckgonmfCl6Vsx]{Corvodaemons}</strong><span class=\"s10\">*</span>. The spirit has AC 14, HP 40, and a Speed of 20 feet. It fails all ability checks and saving throws and can’t take actions. Only one demon attacks the spirit each turn, and they only use their Feeding Frenzy action when attacking the spirit; the other demon focuses on the characters. If someone destroys the demons or escapes from them to the next Junction before the spirit is reduced to 0 hit points and devoured, it thanks them and promises to aid them against the Harvest Terror before fading away.

Corn sprouts from the corpses in various states of decay—stalks rip out of chest cavities, biceps, and even mangled faces with lifeless, staring eyes. Choose twelve spaces in this Junction to place these corpses when the characters first enter it. A character who comes within 5 feet of a gruesome corpse or starts its turn within 5 feet of one must succeed on a [[/save WIS DC 13]] saving throw or gain 1 &amp;reference[exhaustion apply=false] level from horror and disgust.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Disorienting Crowsong.</strong></em> A murder of crows circles above the corn maze clustering thick enough to blot out the orange moon, and their song becomes a disorienting cacophony.

Roll initiative! This first phase of the battle is to stop the Harvest Terror from devouring secrets in the form of the amber-eyed crows, limiting his power. Three crows that break off from the mass are <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.9qrckgonmfCl6Vsx]{Corvodaemons}</strong><span class=\"s10\">*</span>. The demons seek to shred the intruders, prioritizing anyone attacking or catching amber-eyed crows (see “Growing Murder” below). The demons have the following special considerations:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">The demons lack the Multiattack action.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">If a corvodaemon takes any damage, it vanishes in a swirl of feathers and black mist. It reforms in an unoccupied space of the Harvest Terror’s choice on Initiative count 0 (losing Initiative ties).</p></li></ul><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Growing Murder</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">A murder of amber-eyed crows surrounds the Harvest Terror in a 5-foot Emanation with the following effects:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">A creature other than a demon has Disadvantage on attack rolls while in this area.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">A creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a [[/save STR DC 13]] saving throw or have the &amp;reference[prone apply=false] condition.</p></li></ul><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Devourer of Secrets</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">While the murder of crows persists, the Harvest Terror can take a Bonus Action to catch and devour one of the amber-eyed crows. Each time it does, the following occurs:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">The Harvest Terror gains [[/damage 10 temp]]{10 temporary hit points}. Each crow beyond the first increases this number by 10.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">The Emanation of crows increases by 5 feet.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">The characters can stop Raum from devouring crows in two ways:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Catching.</strong> A character can catch a crow with an Unarmed Strike to grapple it, catch it in a Net, or any other method that you deem acceptable. To grab a crow by hand, a character must enter the murder.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Destroying.</strong> An amber-eyed crow is a Tiny Fiend with AC 14, HP 5, and +0 to any D20 Tests it is forced to make. It automatically succeeds on Dexterity saving throws against areas of effect and takes no damage from such effects that would deal half damage on a successful save.</p><p class=\"p5\">Each time a crow is caught or destroyed, it vanishes in a puff of amber motes, and the characters hear a whispered secret, such as “I always loved you,” “I took it,” or something similar, with no indication of who the secret belonged to.</p><h3><span class=\"s8\"><strong>Ending the Phase</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">When the Harvest Terror devours three amber-eyed crows, or when six crows are destroyed or captured, the swarming murder explodes into feathers and its effects end. Any remaining corvodaemons have 20 hit points and no longer vanish when they take damage.

Led by one of the Fallen, the blood-stained fallen knight Marius Renathyr <em>(MAIR-ee-iss REN-uh-theer)</em>, the zealous and self-righteous adherents of the Crimson Faith swarm across Wickermoor Hollow, claiming all outside their faith to be impure, and that only conversion to the worship of their esoteric goddess, the Crimson Rose, will set them on the path to purity. Those who do not convert are kidnapped and burned at the stake, and those who resist are slaughtered.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>The Crimson Monastery looms high above Wickermoor Hollow in the mountain range called the Howlers, leering down at the town of Dawn’s Gate, which now trembles whenever the charging riders and baying bat hounds of the Sanguine Hunt thunder down the mountainside in search of fresh blood to spill. Any infraction against Father Renathyr’s obsessive code of virtue and purification makes that person a target. The people of Dawn’s Gate yearn for freedom from fear.</p><p>At the center of this twisted faith lies Viraxys <em>(vih-RAK-seez)</em>, a devil who calls herself the Crimson Rose. Renathyr, once a noble knight, was tainted by her, turning his piety into relentless zealotry. Should her corruption be exposed, the Crimson Faith would crumble into chaos.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Father Renathyr must die! Or so believe the people of Dawn’s Gate, who suffer most at the hands of his zealots.

However, the confrontation with Renathyr and the corrupting devil Viraxys inevitably ends in battle.</p><p>Before running this chapter, you should read about the NPCs of the monastery. Because the characters will be watched, knowing the clergy's methods of investigation and reactions to what they observe—whether the characters are hostile, deceptive, understanding, or stealthy—makes running the monastery more organic.

His name is whispered by the villagers of Dawn’s Gate and rapturously exulted by his flock. Though he was once a human knight of unimpeachable character, Father Renathyr is now a vampire sustained by the blood of his converts. His noble zeal was twisted into fear and cruelty by the devil that saved his life and granted him his vampiric immortality.</p><p>The tragedy of Marius Renathyr is inexorably tied to that of Lethica Nightborne, another of the Fallen (see chapter 17). This is the beginning of that tale.</p><img style=\"border:none;margin-left:10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Father_Renathyr.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><h2>The Knight’s Tale</h2><p>Sir Marius Renathyr was once a knight-errant of another world. His armor gleamed gold, his banner a lionhearted red. Cast into the fallen land of Druskenvald by means unknown, his conviction toward righteousness was undeterred. He gathered knights to his side to protect the innocent from monsters and wicked men.</p><p>One such innocent was a traveling priestess named Lethica Nightborne, a devotee to a goddess of sheltering night called the Nightmother. Accosted on the road by cruel men, Marius rescued her and delivered her safely to her cloister. Love blossomed between the knight of light and the priestess of darkness, but Marius remained chaste and returned to his questing.</p><p>Marius’s return to the cloister became frequent as their love burned, yet Marius’s sacred mission took its toll. Over the years, his kindness dulled, making way for zeal and wrath. It was this wrath that attracted a devil named Viraxys, who preyed upon men with wickedness; mortals acting upon their evil impulses by inflicting sorrow corrupted their souls, making them a delicious ambrosia on which she fed. Marius had slain his fair share of her puppets over the years, but now she saw her chance to make him into a puppet himself.</p><p>Seeking to ensnare him, Viraxys set a small army of bandits against Marius, leaving him near death. Whispering falsely as a goddess, she offered immortality in exchange for his blood and his service in her quests. Marius accepted and was made immortal—a vampire. His knightly sword transformed into a blood-soaked blade, a symbol that he was now her champion. Marius returned to his wife and revealed his affliction. Though Lethica loved him, his shame blinded him to her devotion.</p><p>Bloodthirst overtook him. In a moment of lost control, he nearly fed on his wife. Though regaining his senses in time, the guilt was too great, and Marius abandoned his love, wandering until he reached the town of Dawn’s Gate. There, Viraxys led him to a small monastery, where his knightly charm and renewed zeal for the Crimson Rose corrupted the monks into followers of his false goddess. Four years passed before Lethica found him again, now as Father Renathyr, fanatical leader of the Crimson Faith. Horrified, she fled to the Isle of Mourn.</p><p>Her story continues in chapter 17, but Renathyr’s must end here. He crusades now against all the sins of the world, real or imagined, and brings terror to Dawn’s Gate and beyond.</p><h2>Parley with the Abbot</h2><p>Father Renathyr spends his waking hours searching for those who will accept the teachings of his goddess, the Crimson Rose, or destroying those who reject his faith—either with fire or by feeding. In public, he masks his true form with <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.A3q2gTNqG6fvNGrv]{Disguise Self}</em>. He meets with the faithful, leading spirited services and offering devotion to his goddess in the Sanguine Cathedral (area M12), and he offers private guidance to those who seek it atop the bell tower (area M14). As abbot, he meets with each of his key clergy and initiates to ensure the piety of Dawn’s Gate, and that the townsfolk seek out nonbelievers.</p><p>In the late hours of night, Renathyr takes his own form of communion with his goddess, feeding in secret within a private sanctum beneath the monastery (area M16). Outwardly, he may appear compassionate and wise, the exemplar of a pious leader. Inwardly, he broods with growing bitterness, driven by the unquenchable need to deliver more souls to Viraxys.</p><p>If the characters meet Renathyr and speak with him, these are his answers to some common topics:</p><p><strong>Missing Persons.</strong> “We may take in those in need of our protection or atonement for wrongdoing, but we do not keep anyone prisoner. You are more than welcome to walk our halls if you do not trust my word.” This is a lie, and a successful [[/check INS DC 17]] check reveals it as such.</p><p><strong>The Pyre.</strong> “The pyre before you will only burn the wicked—those whose souls are tainted by impure, mortal blood. Those who accept the Crimson Rose into their hearts will be purified willingly, as part of our Crimson Faith. It saddens me that there are those whose pride is so great they refuse our goddess’s gift, for they leave me only one way of purifying them.”</p><p><strong>Your Crimson Goddess.</strong> “The Crimson Rose. I am her champion. In my darkest hour, she saved me from death and whispered to me the truth: that mortal blood is impure and the source of all suffering in this sorrowful land. It must be cleansed.”</p><p><strong>Entry to the Monastery.</strong> “By all means, my children. Think of it as home. We keep neither property nor secrets in this sacred community. All that is ours is yours.”</p><h2>Duchess</h2><p>Father Renathyr believes Duchess, the blade he keeps at his side, is sentient. The sword claims to be a divine tool bestowed by the Crimson Rose upon her champion so that he may cleanse the evil of this realm. Father Renathyr mutters to it constantly, both in response and unbidden, and has become addicted to heeding its commands.</p><p>In truth, it possesses no sentience of its own and is a conduit for Viraxys. She orchestrates Father Renathyr into committing acts of depraved cruelty to feed upon the tormented souls of those slaughtered by the Sanguine Hunt and burned alive by his Crimson Faithful. While she dines well upon the souls of the innocent, Renathyr remains her crowning achievement; it is no small joy for her to make someone fall, but to make someone as devoted as Renathyr fall is ecstasy.</p></div>"

Many are cowards who chose to convert to this cruel cult to avoid being slain by the inquisitors of the Sanguine Hunt, but most are well-meaning people who were brainwashed by the order’s overwhelming false love and black-and-white morality.</p><h2>The Bloodless</h2><p>The most devoted inner circle of this faith are vampires, turned by Father Renathyr personally in a ceremony of ascension called the Rite of Bloodletting. They call themselves “The Bloodless,” and their pale skin is a blessed sign that they are devoid of the impure blood that sullies mortal souls. They stalk the halls of the monastery and menace the town of Dawn’s Gate as part of Renathyr’s crusade to spread his depraved faith. All the Bloodless besides Renathyr’s priors use the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.6syYfa3idD1RDhwX]{Crimson Clergy}</strong>* stat block.</p><p>These vampire supplicants are so brainwashed that they would follow this path even if they learned the truth: that their goddess was a devil in disguise. However, the general faithful would not accept this revelation and would turn against them if it were revealed.</p><h2>Renathyr’s Priors</h2><p>Father Renathyr has elected his three closest confidants as priors of the Crimson Monastery: Houndmaster Jaeger, Friar Olaf, and Inquisitor Cromwell. In this role, they act as Renathyr’s “lieutenants,” forming the leadership of the faith and overseeing their respective duties. They are, without a doubt, the most faithful of the Bloodless, and any one of them could succeed Renathyr and keep the Crimson Faith alive if he is slain.</p><p>In return for their service, Father Renathyr has granted them a grotesque gift. Through profane rituals and blood magic, Renathyr has transformed each of his priors into <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.gIM2KVjsPra8DzZd]{Night Creatures}</strong>*. The priors are gifted with a potent disguise to keep their nature hidden from the Crimson Faithful and only shift into their true forms when “killed” (see “Houndmaster Jaeger,” “Friar Olaf,” and “Inquisitor Cromwell” below).</p><p>If the characters arrive at the monastery during a Night of Flames (see “Investigating the Village” below), the priors are in the Courtyard of the Rose (area M4) to witness the burnings. Afterward, they retreat to their individual quarters. Each prior is described in further detail below.</p><h2>Houndmaster Jaeger</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin-right:10px;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Sigmund_Jaeger.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.4jTIWt88wLHjgo5P]{Sigmund Jaeger}</strong> served Father Renathyr as a squire during Renathyr’s time as a knight, raising hunting dogs to track down men and monsters alike.</p><p>When the knight founded the Crimson Faith, Jaeger was the first Renathyr sought and the first to convert. The houndmaster had a loving family once, but—like Renathyr—he abandoned them, tempted by the promises of the Crimson Rose. He took only his hounds with him, which he turned into batlike hybrids using blood magic. Now a prior of the Crimson Monastery, Jaeger rears and trains the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.D0fw0qKqrqj5078T]{Bat Hounds}</strong>* and <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.T1xZTDCGuvMBSq8d]{Warhorses}</strong> used to track down the faithless.</p><h3><strong>Meeting Jaeger</strong></h3><p>Jaeger resides within his cabin (area M3) and trains his bat hounds near their houses (area M2a) outside the monastery walls. He treats the characters as treasured guests, so long as they show interest in the Crimson Faith. The moment they refuse the faith, he attacks, siccing his bat hounds on them.</p><p>Jaeger is a neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.rb7OJt822wIO52qY]{Bandit Captain}</strong>, but when he is reduced to 0 hit points, he takes on his true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.gIM2KVjsPra8DzZd]{Night Creature}</strong>* form with full hit points.</p><h2>Friar Olaf</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin-left:10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Friar_Olaf.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>As a young monk, Friar Olaf of the Silver Bells was the leader of the monastery before Renathyr took it over and became his second convert thereafter. In its early years, the cloister was called Silverbell Monastery, for it overlooks the Silverbell River in the valley below, and it was dedicated to the Patient Lady. There, Olaf and his monks tended to the infirm and to outcasts, but he longed in his heart for glory. He demanded payment from his charges and commissioned a great silver bell for the monastery inscribed with his name so that he would be remembered forever.</p><p>Renathyr’s arrival stoked Olaf’s hunger for reverence and immortality. It was simple to urge Olaf onward from stipends of coin to sacrifices of blood.</p><h3><strong>Meeting Friar Olaf</strong></h3><p>In his role as prior, Olaf is most often found leading sermons in the Sanguine Cathedral (area M12), though he may also be in his chambers (area M8). He is feared, not beloved, by the people of the Crimson Faith, making him the perfect foil to the adored Father Renathyr. He makes a show of kindness toward the characters as potential new converts but will gladly feed on anyone who questions him if he thinks they will not be missed.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.ObIeTdpjM6AfS21x]{Olaf}</strong> is a neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{Priest}</strong>, but when he is reduced to 0 hit points, he takes on his true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.gIM2KVjsPra8DzZd]{Night Creature}</strong>* form with full hit points.</p><h2>Inquisitor Cromwell</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin-right:10px;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Leona_Cromwell.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>Leona Cromwell was once a child of Dawn’s Gate, learning her letters and numbers under the shadow of Friar Olaf. Yet, over the years, her contempt for the pompous friar festered, driving her away from the monastery. She wandered to Wickermoor Village, picking up odd jobs and eventually working as a town guard. Her fate changed course when a group of highwaymen took her captive. Marius Renathyr came to her rescue and drove the bandits to the marshes south of Moonsong Lake. Rather than flee, she used her skills with a blade to slay their leader and demanded obedience from the weakened crew.</p><p>For years, she was known as Leona the Relentless, leading raids through Wickermoor Hollow. But the guilt of her deeds gnawed at her soul. She learned that the great Sir Marius who saved her life years prior had hung up his sword, and she traveled to his Crimson Monastery to repent. Father Renathyr, a twisted reflection of the knight he once was, spoke of the Crimson Rose, offering redemption for her tarnished soul. Stricken with guilt but unwilling to let go of the power she craved as a bandit queen, Leona accepted his gift.</p><p>Now, as prioress and head inquisitor of the Crimson Monastery, she leads the Sanguine Hunt with ruthless devotion; whenever their hooves echo through Wickermoor Hollow, it is Leona’s blade that cuts the path.</p><h3><strong>Meeting Inquisitor Cromwell</strong></h3><p>Cromwell is often away from the monastery, but the first time the characters visit Dawn’s Gate, she is present for the Night of Flames in the Courtyard of the Rose (area M4). After the pyre is cleared, she spends her time in her chambers (area M9) planning her next hunt. Cromwell is suspicious of the characters, for she knows all too well how people of great strength resist the call of the Crimson Rose. She resents their resolve and tries to kill them if goaded even mildly. If Renathyr is defeated while she is absent, she may return to revive his faith later—if you wish to create subsequent adventures in this region.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.uditOe4fAaZf66gc]{Cromwell}</strong> is a neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knight}</strong>, but when she is reduced to 0 hit points, she takes on her true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.gIM2KVjsPra8DzZd]{Night Creature}</strong>* form with full hit points.</p><h2>Crimson Faithful</h2><p>Most of the Crimson Faithful are simple people who have been taken in by Renathyr and his vampiric minions’ charisma. These initiates make up a majority of the congregation in the Crimson Monastery and are simple believers without rank or station. They revere the Bloodless as leaders of the faith, holding great respect for their closeness to Father Renathyr.</p><p>They are kept from thinking too deeply about the atrocities they commit, as their blood loss causes them to drift absentmindedly through their nights. They regularly sacrifice their impure blood in phony rituals of purification. They have a friendly attitude toward any newcomers until given a reason to think differently. Unless otherwise noted, Crimson Faithful are lawful evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners}</strong>.</p><h3><strong>Losing Favor</strong></h3><p>The characters are immediately welcomed in as prospective converts. However, if they commit three actions to upset the faithful, such as those listed below, all clergy members turn indifferent toward them within the hour. Being caught committing one more infraction turns them all hostile, and they attack on sight:</p><ul><li><p>Harm or threaten a member of the clergy.</p></li><li><p>Steal from a member of the clergy.</p></li><li><p>React negatively or disagree with the clergy’s torture, teachings, or bonfires.</p></li><li><p>Attempt to remove, kidnap, or free any creature from the monastery grounds without permission from Jaeger, Olaf, Cromwell, or Father Renathyr.</p></li><li><p>Trespass anywhere in the monastery.</p></li></ul><p>Anyone seen killing a member of the faithful instantly becomes an enemy of the faith. All the Crimson Faithful who witness or hear of the killing immediately become hostile.</p><h3><strong>Regaining Favor</strong></h3><p>Characters who have frustrated the Crimson Faithful enough to turn them indifferent can make them friendly again by committing three of the following actions and succeeding on a [[/check DEC DC 13]] check:</p><ul><li><p>Respond positively to torture or corporal punishment against the faithless.</p></li><li><p>Respond positively to or agree with the teachings of the Crimson Rose.</p></li><li><p>Respond positively to or agree with the bonfire killings the clergy commit.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Atonement</strong></h3><p>If the Crimson Faithful become hostile toward the characters, there’s only one way to win back their trust: repent. Characters attacked by hostile members of the Crimson Faithful aren’t killed but are instead captured and bound in the Dead Larder (area M11). They are held for up to three nights without food before they are mounted upon a pyre at the next Night of Flames, where they must recant their wickedness or burn.</p></div>"

They traveled together to the village of Dawn’s Gate after hearing tales of the beautiful bell of Silverbell Monastery, but they found that it had changed. The villagers praised someone called the “Crimson Abbot” with strained smiles, and when a stable hand took Gareth aside to tell him a secret about the village, neither the boy nor Gareth returned.</p><p>Melina fled the village and told Murdoch, hoping that he might know someone brave enough to find Gareth and solve the mystery of the Crimson Abbot.

Once a shining example of hope in the shadows of Druskenvald, the village had clung to the belief that the Patient Lady might one night deliver sunlight to Wickermoor Hollow. But that hope has long withered, buried alongside the optimism of the town’s founders.</p><p>Now, the village ekes out a living through hunting, farming, and mining silver and iron from the nearby mountains. Worship of the Crimson Rose is enforced with unwavering severity. Each night, the monastery’s bell calls the village to prayer at the Twilight and Evening hours. Any who worship another god, hide their sins, fail to kneel, or speak ill of the Crimson Faithful are swiftly taken to the monastery—and never seen again.</p><h2>A Cold Ale at Briar Public House</h2><p>Being a small community, there is little here for outsiders. Briar Public House was opened to provide a drinking spot for locals, but it also offers food and lodging for travelers and merchants who find their way into the small village. Briar Public House is owned and operated by Kristoff Gruber (neutral good, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</strong>), a portly, gruff man whose sour disposition belies his caring nature.</p><h3><strong>Investigating the Village</strong></h3><p>The people of Dawn’s Gate never speak ill of the Crimson Faithful in public. In fact, a successful [[/check INS DC 10]] check reveals insincere smiles and furtive looks over their shoulders. They speak truly that Dawn’s Gate rarely suffers the monsters or brigands that plague other parts of Wickermoor Hollow, but it’s clear they fear something else.</p><p><em><strong>Missing Person?</strong></em> Those who ask around the village for clues about the missing pilgrim, Gareth from Wickermoor Village, are stonewalled by smiling villagers. They say that they saw someone of that description come through the town, but he asked too many questions. If they wait until the Evening Hour bell, they see a huge bonfire alight in the mountains, and the villagers become slightly more talkative (see below).</p><p><em><strong>The Night of Flames.</strong></em> Every three nights, the Sanguine Hunt thunders through town and up the mountainside, returning from their raids. That evening, a fire burns atop the hill, its light visible for miles around. During this time, the villagers of Dawn’s Gate speak more freely, since all the Crimson Faithful in the village have returned to the monastery. They whisper that they are being watched, and that those who are taken to the monastery for “purification” are never seen again. That includes a man who matches Gareth’s description.</p><h2>Impromptu Ambush</h2><p>The characters may decide that intercepting the Sanguine Hunt on their next outing is the best course of action. The Sanguine Hunt returns to the monastery during a Night of Flames, and when the Twilight Hour bell rings on the following night, their departure from the monastery back into Wickermoor Hollow echoes across the countryside.</p><p>This unit of the Sanguine Hunt is an inquisition force of three lawful evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knights}</strong> led by Head Inquisitor Cromwell (neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knight}</strong>) all on <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.T1xZTDCGuvMBSq8d]{Warhorses}</strong>.

If Cromwell is reduced to 0 hit points, she transforms into her true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.gIM2KVjsPra8DzZd]{Night Creature}</strong>* form and presses the attack.</p><p>If the characters attack the Sanguine Hunt as they pass through Dawn’s Gate, five villagers wielding shovels and cleavers (neutral evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN]{Bandits}</strong> with descriptive changes but still use the Scimitar action) attack the characters to prove their loyalty to the Crimson Faith, but the rest of the villagers watch with rapt attention, hoping the characters triumph over the riders.</p><p>Cromwell is a fanatic and, if addressed or captured, speaks glowingly of Father Renathyr, the noble knight who hung up his sword to serve the Crimson Rose and purify the sullied blood of mortals in her name. Characters who press her for secrets about the cult and succeed on a [[/check ITM DC 18]] check learn each of the following pieces of information:</p><ul><li><p>The Crimson Faithful worship the Crimson Rose, a goddess who speaks directly to Father Renathyr through the blade Duchess, which marks him as her champion. All of Druskenvald will be cleansed of evil and made pure again if its people convert.</p></li><li><p>The leaders of the Crimson Faith are the Bloodless—mortals blessed by the Crimson Rose. Their bodies have been made pure by being drained of blood. Though they must drink blood to survive, unclean mortal blood is purified when it touches their lips.</p></li><li><p>Cromwell and her Sanguine Hunt bring the sacred word of the Crimson Rose to worshipers of other gods or any whose actions they deem impure. Those who repent may join the Crimson Faithful. Those who do not are taken to the monastery and encouraged to repent on a Night of Flames.</p></li></ul></div>"

Those who do not convert are kidnapped and burned at the stake, and those who resist are slaughtered.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Background</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Crimson Monastery looms high above Wickermoor Hollow in the mountain range called the Howlers, leering down at the town of Dawn’s Gate, which now trembles whenever the charging riders and baying bat hounds of the Sanguine Hunt thunder down the mountainside in search of fresh blood to spill. Any infraction against Father Renathyr’s obsessive code of virtue and purification makes that person a target. The people of Dawn’s Gate yearn for freedom from fear.</p><p class=\"p7\">At the center of this twisted faith lies Viraxys <em>(vih-RAK-seez)</em>, a devil who calls herself the Crimson Rose.

Should her corruption be exposed, the Crimson Faith would crumble into chaos.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Chapter Summary</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Father Renathyr must die!

Further, combing through the room descriptions of the Crimson Monastery will help you build tension and dread for your players, better equipping you to react to what the characters choose to do.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Finally, reading through the boss encounter “Bloody Tears” will help you run the final battle of this chapter in a dynamic and thrilling way.</p><p class=\"p7\">This chapter is designed for four level 5 characters.</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap14\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Crimson Abbot</p><p><span class=\"s7\">Father Marius Renathyr is the leader and abbot of the Crimson Monastery. His name is whispered by the villagers of Dawn’s Gate and rapturously exulted by his flock. Though he was once a human knight of unimpeachable character, Father Renathyr is now a vampire sustained by the blood of his converts. His noble zeal was twisted into fear and cruelty by the devil that saved his life and granted him his vampiric immortality.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">The tragedy of Marius Renathyr is inexorably tied to that of Lethica Nightborne, another of the Fallen (see chapter 17). This is the beginning of that tale.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">The Knight’s Tale</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Father_Renathyr.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Sir Marius Renathyr was once a knight-errant of another world. His armor gleamed gold, his banner a lionhearted red. Cast into the fallen land of Druskenvald by means unknown, his conviction toward righteousness was undeterred. He gathered knights to his side to protect the innocent from monsters and wicked men.</p><p class=\"p7\">One such innocent was a traveling priestess named Lethica Nightborne, a devotee to a goddess of sheltering night called the Nightmother. Accosted on the road by cruel men, Marius rescued her and delivered her safely to her cloister. Love blossomed between the knight of light and the priestess of darkness, but Marius remained chaste and returned to his questing.</p><p class=\"p7\">Marius’s return to the cloister became frequent as their love burned, yet Marius’s sacred mission took its toll. Over the years, his kindness dulled, making way for zeal and wrath. It was this wrath that attracted a devil named Viraxys, who preyed upon men with wickedness; mortals acting upon their evil impulses by inflicting sorrow corrupted their souls, making them a delicious ambrosia on which she fed. Marius had slain his fair share of her puppets over the years, but now she saw her chance to make him into a puppet himself.</p><p class=\"p7\">Seeking to ensnare him, Viraxys set a small army of bandits against Marius, leaving him near death. Whispering falsely as a goddess, she offered immortality in exchange for his blood and his service in her quests. Marius accepted and was made immortal—a vampire. His knightly sword transformed into a blood-soaked blade, a symbol that he was now her champion. Marius returned to his wife and revealed his affliction. Though Lethica loved him, his shame blinded him to her devotion.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\">Bloodthirst overtook him. In a moment of lost control, he nearly fed on his wife. Though regaining his senses in time, the guilt was too great, and Marius abandoned his love, wandering until he reached the town of Dawn’s Gate. There, Viraxys led him to a small monastery, where his knightly charm and renewed zeal for the Crimson Rose corrupted the monks into followers of his false goddess. Four years passed before Lethica found him again, now as Father Renathyr, fanatical leader of the Crimson Faith. Horrified, she fled to the Isle of Mourn.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Her story continues in chapter 17, but Renathyr’s must end here. He crusades now against all the sins of the world, real or imagined, and brings terror to Dawn’s Gate and beyond.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Parley with the Abbot</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Father Renathyr spends his waking hours searching for those who will accept the teachings of his goddess, the Crimson Rose, or destroying those who reject his faith—either with fire or by feeding. In public, he masks his true form with <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDisguiseSe]{Disguise Self}</em>. He meets with the faithful, leading spirited services and offering devotion to his goddess in the Sanguine Cathedral (area M12), and he offers private guidance to those who seek it atop the bell tower (area M14). As abbot, he meets with each of his key clergy and initiates to ensure the piety of Dawn’s Gate, and that the townsfolk seek out nonbelievers.</p><p class=\"p7\">In the late hours of night, Renathyr takes his own form of communion with his goddess, feeding in secret within a private sanctum beneath the monastery (area M16). Outwardly, he may appear compassionate and wise, the exemplar of a pious leader. Inwardly, he broods with growing bitterness, driven by the unquenchable need to deliver more souls to Viraxys.</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters meet Renathyr and speak with him, these are his answers to some common topics:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Missing Persons.</strong> “We may take in those in need of our protection or atonement for wrongdoing, but we do not keep anyone prisoner. You are more than welcome to walk our halls if you do not trust my word.” This is a lie, and a successful [[/check INS DC 17]] check reveals it as such.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>The Pyre.</strong> “The pyre before you will only burn the wicked—those whose souls are tainted by impure, mortal blood. Those who accept the Crimson Rose into their hearts will be purified willingly, as part of our Crimson Faith. It saddens me that there are those whose pride is so great they refuse our goddess’s gift, for they leave me only one way of purifying them.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Your Crimson Goddess.</strong> “The Crimson Rose. I am her champion. In my darkest hour, she saved me from death and whispered to me the truth: that mortal blood is impure and the source of all suffering in this sorrowful land. It must be cleansed.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s7\"><strong>Entry to the Monastery.</strong> “By all means, my children. Think of it as home. We keep neither property nor secrets in this sacred community. All that is ours is yours.”</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Duchess</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Father Renathyr believes Duchess, the blade he keeps at his side, is sentient. The sword claims to be a divine tool bestowed by the Crimson Rose upon her champion so that he may cleanse the evil of this realm. Father Renathyr mutters to it constantly, both in response and unbidden, and has become addicted to heeding its commands.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">In truth, it possesses no sentience of its own and is a conduit for Viraxys. She orchestrates Father Renathyr into committing acts of depraved cruelty to feed upon the tormented souls of those slaughtered by the Sanguine Hunt and burned alive by his Crimson Faithful. While she dines well upon the souls of the innocent, Renathyr remains her crowning achievement; it is no small joy for her to make someone fall, but to make someone as devoted as Renathyr fall is ecstasy.</p></div>"

The priors are gifted with a potent disguise to keep their nature hidden from the Crimson Faithful and only shift into their true forms when “killed” (see “Houndmaster Jaeger,” “Friar Olaf,” and “Inquisitor Cromwell” below).</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters arrive at the monastery during a Night of Flames (see “Investigating the Village” below), the priors are in the Courtyard of the Rose (area M4) to witness the burnings. Afterward, they retreat to their individual quarters. Each prior is described in further detail below.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Houndmaster Jaeger</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Sigmund_Jaeger.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Sigmund Jaeger served Father Renathyr as a squire during Renathyr’s time as a knight, raising hunting dogs to track down men and monsters alike.</p><p class=\"p7\">When the knight founded the Crimson Faith, Jaeger was the first Renathyr sought and the first to convert. The houndmaster had a loving family once, but—like Renathyr—he abandoned them, tempted by the promises of the Crimson Rose. He took only his hounds with him, which he turned into batlike hybrids using blood magic. Now a prior of the Crimson Monastery, Jaeger rears and trains the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.v1WqqEPtBHN6w2V4]{Bat Hounds}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> and <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWarhorse000000]{Warhorse} </strong>used to track down the faithless.</p><h3><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Meeting Jaeger</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Jaeger resides within his cabin (area M3) and trains his bat hounds near their houses (area M2a) outside the monastery walls. He treats the characters as treasured guests, so long as they show interest in the Crimson Faith. The moment they refuse the faith, he attacks, siccing his bat hounds on them.</p><p class=\"p7\">Jaeger is a Neutral Evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmBanditCaptain0]{Bandit Captain}</strong>, but when he is reduced to 0 hit points, he takes on his true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.eu7S5GyKBSigfsnb]{Night Creature}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> form with full hit points.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Friar Olaf</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Friar_Olaf.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">As a young monk, Friar Olaf of the Silver Bells was the leader of the monastery before Renathyr took it over and became his second convert thereafter. In its early years, the cloister was called Silverbell Monastery, for it overlooks the Silverbell River in the valley below, and it was dedicated to the Patient Lady. There, Olaf and his monks tended to the infirm and to outcasts, but he longed in his heart for glory. He demanded payment from his charges and commissioned a great silver bell for the monastery inscribed with his name so that he would be remembered forever.</p><p class=\"p7\">Renathyr’s arrival stoked Olaf’s hunger for reverence and immortality. It was simple to urge Olaf onward from stipends of coin to sacrifices of blood.</p><h3><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Meeting Friar Olaf</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">In his role as prior, Olaf is most often found leading sermons in the Sanguine Cathedral (area M12), though he may also be in his chambers (area M8). He is feared, not beloved, by the people of the Crimson Faith, making him the perfect foil to the adored Father Renathyr. He makes a show of kindness toward the characters as potential new converts but will gladly feed on anyone who questions him if he thinks they will not be missed.</p><p class=\"p7\">Olaf is a Neutral Evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmPriest00000000]{Priest}</strong>, but when he is reduced to 0 hit points, he takes on his true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.eu7S5GyKBSigfsnb]{Night Creature}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> form with full HP.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Inquisitor Cromwell</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Leona_Cromwell.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p5\">Leona Cromwell was once a child of Dawn’s Gate, learning her letters and numbers under the shadow of Friar Olaf. Yet, over the years, her contempt for the pompous friar festered, driving her away from the monastery. She wandered to Wickermoor Village, picking up odd jobs and eventually working as a town guard. Her fate changed course when a group of highwaymen took her captive. Marius Renathyr came to her rescue and drove the bandits to the marshes south of Moonsong Lake. Rather than flee, she used her skills with a blade to slay their leader and demanded obedience from the weakened crew.</p><p class=\"p7\">For years, she was known as Leona the Relentless, leading raids through Wickermoor Hollow. But the guilt of her deeds gnawed at her soul. She learned that the great Sir Marius who saved her life years prior had hung up his sword, and she traveled to his Crimson Monastery to repent. Father Renathyr, a twisted reflection of the knight he once was, spoke of the Crimson Rose, offering redemption for her tarnished soul. Stricken with guilt but unwilling to let go of the power she craved as a bandit queen, Leona accepted his gift.</p><p class=\"p7\">Now, as prioress and head inquisitor of the Crimson Monastery, she leads the Sanguine Hunt with ruthless devotion; whenever their hooves echo through Wickermoor Hollow, it is Leona’s blade that cuts the path.</p><h3><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Meeting Inquisitor Cromwell</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Cromwell is often away from the monastery, but the first time the characters visit Dawn’s Gate, she is present for the Night of Flames in the Courtyard of the Rose (area M4). After the pyre is cleared, she spends her time in her chambers (area M9) planning her next hunt. Cromwell is suspicious of the characters, for she knows all too well how people of great strength resist the call of the Crimson Rose. She resents their resolve and tries to kill them if goaded even mildly. If Renathyr is defeated while she is absent, she may return to revive his faith later—if you wish to create subsequent adventures in this region.</p><p class=\"p7\">Cromwell is a Neutral Evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmKnight00000000]{Knight}</strong>, but when she is reduced to 0 hit points, she takes on her true <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.eu7S5GyKBSigfsnb]{Night Creature}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> form with full HP.</p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Crimson Faithful</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">Most of the Crimson Faithful are simple people who have been taken in by Renathyr and his vampiric minions’ charisma. These initiates make up a majority of the congregation in the Crimson Monastery and are simple believers without rank or station. They revere the Bloodless as leaders of the faith, holding great respect for their closeness to Father Renathyr.</p><p class=\"p7\">They are kept from thinking too deeply about the atrocities they commit, as their blood loss causes them to drift absentmindedly through their nights. They regularly sacrifice their impure blood in phony rituals of purification. They have a friendly attitude toward any newcomers until given a reason to think differently. Unless otherwise noted, Crimson Faithful are Lawful Evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoners}</strong>.</p><h3><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Losing Favor</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The characters are immediately welcomed in as prospective converts. However, if they commit three actions to upset the faithful, such as those listed below, all clergy members turn indifferent toward them within the hour. Being caught committing one more infraction turns them all hostile, and they attack on sight:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Harm or threaten a member of the clergy.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Steal from a member of the clergy.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">React negatively or disagree with the clergy’s torture, teachings, or bonfires.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Attempt to remove, kidnap, or free any creature from the monastery grounds without permission from Jaeger, Olaf, Cromwell, or Father Renathyr.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Trespass anywhere in the monastery.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Anyone seen killing a member of the faithful instantly becomes an enemy of the faith. All the Crimson Faithful who witness or hear of the killing immediately become hostile.</p><h3><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Regaining Favor</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">Characters who have frustrated the Crimson Faithful enough to turn them Indifferent can make them Friendly again by committing three of the following actions and succeeding on a [[/check DEC DC 13]] check:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">Respond positively to torture or corporal punishment against the faithless.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Respond positively to or agree with the teachings of the Crimson Rose.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Respond positively to or agree with the bonfire killings the clergy commit.</p></li></ul><h3><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Atonement</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">If the Crimson Faithful become Hostile toward the characters, there’s only one way to win back their trust: repent. Characters attacked by Hostile members of the Crimson Faithful aren’t killed but are instead captured and bound in the Dead Larder (area M11). They are held for up to three nights without food before they are mounted upon a pyre at the next Night of Flames, where they must recant their wickedness or burn.</p></div>"

They traveled together to the village of Dawn’s Gate after hearing tales of the beautiful bell of Silverbell Monastery, but they found that it had changed. The villagers praised someone called the “Crimson Abbot” with strained smiles, and when a stable hand took Gareth aside to tell him a secret about the village, neither the boy nor Gareth returned.</span></p><p class=\"p7\">Melina fled the village and told Murdoch, hoping that he might know someone brave enough to find Gareth and solve the mystery of the Crimson Abbot. Murdoch describes Gareth Creed as a tall, dark-haired, short-bearded man with gray eyes.</p><p class=\"p7\">Traveling to Dawn’s Gate requires crossing the Silverbell River by either bridge or boat and following its southern side for about 3 nights until the burnt copper glow of the village’s lights are visible. Characters who camp within walking distance of the settlement are ambushed during the Midnight Hour by an <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.UefYwNtXs9J5eKya]{Alpengrendel}</strong><span class=\"s9\">*</span> that has come down from the Howlers to hunt.</p></div>"

Once a shining example of hope in the shadows of Druskenvald, the village had clung to the belief that the Patient Lady might one night deliver sunlight to Wickermoor Hollow. But that hope has long withered, buried alongside the optimism of the town’s founders.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\">Now, the village ekes out a living through hunting, farming, and mining silver and iron from the nearby mountains. Worship of the Crimson Rose is enforced with unwavering severity. Each night, the monastery’s bell calls the village to prayer at the Twilight and Evening hours. Any who worship another god, hide their sins, fail to kneel, or speak ill of the Crimson Faithful are swiftly taken to the monastery—and never seen again.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">A Cold Ale at Briar Public House</span></h2><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s7\">Being a small community, there is little here for outsiders. Briar Public House was opened to provide a drinking spot for locals, but it also offers food and lodging for travelers and merchants who find their way into the small village. Briar Public House is owned and operated by Kristoff Gruber (Neutral Good, human </span><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong><span class=\"s7\">), a portly, gruff man whose sour disposition belies his caring nature.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s11\"><strong>Investigating the Village</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The people of Dawn’s Gate never speak ill of the Crimson Faithful in public. In fact, a successful [[/check INS DC 10]] check reveals insincere smiles and furtive looks over their shoulders. They speak truly that Dawn’s Gate rarely suffers the monsters or brigands that plague other parts of Wickermoor Hollow, but it’s clear they fear something else.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Missing Person?</strong></em> Those who ask around the village for clues about the missing pilgrim, Gareth from Wickermoor Village, are stonewalled by smiling villagers. They say that they saw someone of that description come through the town, but he asked too many questions. If they wait until the Evening Hour bell, they see a huge bonfire alight in the mountains, and the villagers become slightly more talkative (see below).</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\"><em><strong>The Night of Flames.</strong></em> Every three nights, the Sanguine Hunt thunders through town and up the mountainside, returning from their raids. That evening, a fire burns atop the hill, its light visible for miles around. During this time, the villagers of Dawn’s Gate speak more freely, since all the Crimson Faithful in the village have returned to the monastery. They whisper that they are being watched, and that those who are taken to the monastery for “purification” are never seen again. That includes a man who matches Gareth’s description.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s6\">Impromptu Ambush</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The characters may decide that intercepting the Sanguine Hunt on their next outing is the best course of action. The Sanguine Hunt returns to the monastery during a Night of Flames, and when the Twilight Hour bell rings on the following night, their departure from the monastery back into Wickermoor Hollow echoes across the countryside.</p><p class=\"p7\">This unit of the Sanguine Hunt is an inquisition force of three Lawful Evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmKnight00000000]{Knights}</strong> led by Head <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.PKNi5C59d3sSZMtz]{Inquisitor Cromwell}</strong> (Neutral Evil, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmKnight00000000]{Knight}</strong>) all on <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWarhorse000000]{Warhorses}</strong>.

Characters who press her for secrets about the cult and succeed on a [[/check ITM DC 18]] check learn each of the following pieces of information:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">The Crimson Faithful worship the Crimson Rose, a goddess who speaks directly to Father Renathyr through the blade Duchess, which marks him as her champion.

Their bodies have been made pure by being drained of blood. Though they must drink blood to survive, unclean mortal blood is purified when it touches their lips.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Cromwell and her Sanguine Hunt bring the sacred word of the Crimson Rose to worshipers of other gods or any whose actions they deem impure.

One of them is a Neutral, human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmCommoner000000]{Commoner}</strong> named Gareth Creed (see “Quest Hook” earlier in this chapter). These events play out in order, unless the characters intervene:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p8\">Renathyr genteelly commands Friar Olaf to preach to the captives and incite them to repent.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Olaf approaches the pyre and accusingly brandishes a lit torch. He tells each of the captives in turn that their lives are worth living, if and only if they accept that their impure mortal blood makes their souls wicked. Only by opening their hearts to the Crimson Rose are they set on the path to purification. If not, their blood must be purified in holy flame.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">All but one of the captives, in turn, agree to convert, eliciting manic cries of prayer from the crowd. The gathered worshipers climb onto the pyre and untie the five who accept. These noncombatants join the congregation, shaken.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">Gareth, however, refuses. Renathyr frowns, Olaf grins wickedly, and the congregation jeers. Olaf repeats himself, Gareth refuses again, and Olaf lights the pyre.</span></p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Renathyr preaches for 1 minute as the flames climb higher, speaking on the futility of clinging to impure mortal blood and how such pride is the source of all Wickermoor Hollow’s many sorrows.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">Gareth then begins to burn alive, dying in agony over the course of another minute. The congregation falls into a reverent silence. The faint scent of sulfur fills the courtyard as his body is consumed.</p></li><li><p class=\"p8\">After Gareth dies, several of the faithful clean up the pyre, and Renathyr concludes his sermon and bids the characters welcome to the monastery. He urges them to rest, and he will speak to them in his Sanguine Cathedral (area M12) after the Twilight Hour bell.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Interrupting this Cruelty.</strong></em> If the characters interrupt the Night of Flames, Renathyr urges them to be silent, unless they succeed on a [[/check DEC DC 20]] or [[/check PER DC 20]] check attempting to convince Gareth to recant and save himself. It takes an additional successful check for Gareth to concede (the DC lowers to 10 if the character mentions Melina). Recanting, Gareth is freed like the others and rejoins the congregation, though he will flee to Wickermoor Village as soon as he is safe to get away.</p><p class=\"p7\">If the characters attempt to dissuade Father Renathyr or the crowd, or if they try to free Gareth, Renathyr commands his congregation to subdue them (the veterans in the crowd try to grapple them), before finally ordering the crowd to attack. With his sermon completed and the order given, he retreats to the Bloody Sanctum (area M16) to commune with Duchess until early Twilight.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>No Victory.</strong></em> A fight against the entire congregation is doomed to failure. Their best hope is to fight, retreat, and approach with stealth.

The gravity of the monastery’s influence is clear as it spreads its faith across the land.</strong></em></p><p class=\"p14\"><em><strong>Braziers flicker here, shedding an ominous red and orange light throughout the space. Hundreds of bats roost in the rafters overhead, casting eerie shadows that seem to writhe in the dancing fire. The faint smell of sulfur drifts on the hot air that passes through the flames.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p class=\"p5\">Renathyr only visits the belfry for two reasons: to meet with those who have ingratiated themselves with him and the other members of the Crimson Faithful, and privately during the Witching Hour every night to gaze upon the mist rising from Moonsong Lake.</p><p class=\"p7\">The characters are invited to join Father Renathyr here if they remain in good favor with the Crimson Faithful (see “Crimson Faithful” earlier in this chapter) for a full night after their arrival. But even if they surprise him here during the Witching Hour, he’ll be open to a more intimate conversation.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>The Abbot’s History.</strong></em> Renathyr is willing to talk about his goals and his past with those he feels are good candidates to join his clergy. If someone asks about his time before becoming abbot of the monastery, he’ll grip the hilt of his sword and mutter before changing the subject.</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Why do you come here?</strong> “The flames bring clarity. From up here, the view is... different, as though the world has been cleansed for a brief moment. You will understand, in time.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What do you see from this bell tower?</strong> “I see the land I swore to protect, trembling under the weight of its sins. I also see the life I left behind. But no matter how long I stare, it is only a reflection.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>How do I become a member of your clergy?</strong> “There is no single path. The Crimson Rose calls to those ready to hear her voice. We are all tested, in different ways.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Is there nothing that will make you stop?</strong> “Stop...? Stop cleansing the evil from this realm and spreading the love of the Crimson Rose? Never.”</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Calling for Aid.</strong></em> If combat breaks out here, Renathyr rings the bell, alerting all within the monastery to something unexpected, and he casts <em>Word of Recall</em> on his first turn to teleport to the Bloody Sanctum (area M16). When the bell rings, eight <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSwarmOfBats000]{Swarms of Bats}</strong> swoop down from the rafters and attack.</p><p class=\"p7\">Combat in the belfry is easily visible from the courtyard. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) each round after the bell rings, roll [[/r 1d4]] on the Reinforcements table below and increase the modifier (X) by 1 for each round that has passed.

He sealed and hid the entrance, now only using it when bringing victims to feed upon in the sight of his devil goddess, Viraxys.</p><p class=\"p7\">The entirety of this passageway counts as Difficult Terrain, as the blood and cramped conditions make traversal slow and arduous.

It is here where he converses freely with his supposed goddess through Duchess, speaking to him of the conquests to come. When not performing his duties as abbot, Father Renathyr retreats here to commune without prying eyes.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Renathyr is Present.</strong></em> If the characters arrived here shortly after the pyre was cleaned, Renathyr is here and attacks the characters (see “Bloody Tears,” below). Renathyr leaves for the belfry (area M14) just before the Witching Hour on a Night of Flames.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\"><em><strong>Renathyr is Absent.</strong></em> If the characters snuck in and arrived here before the crowd in the courtyard dispersed, Renathyr is not here. However, if the characters touch either the painting of his wife (see “Treasure” below) or the rose on the altar beneath it, his devil goddess, Viraxys, alerts him to intruders, and he casts <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplWordofReca]{Word of Recall} </em>to intervene (see “Bloody Tears” below).</span></p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Sickening Gore.</strong></em> Blood from the Holy Vein (area M15) fills the outer channel to a depth of 4 feet—Medium and smaller creatures must swim. Wading in the blood is Difficult Terrain.

It’s of fine craftsmanship and has a haunting quality, easily worth [[/award 500gp]] to a collector in Wickermoor Village. The roses crumble if touched, and that character gains immunity to the poisoned condition for 24 hours.</p><p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s7\"><em><strong>Journal.</strong></em> Renathyr’s journal contains an account of everything described in “The Crimson Abbot,” at the beginning of this chapter as Renathyr recalls it. In early entries, he knows he has become a vampire but is unaware that he is being manipulated by a devil. After the entry detailing the time his wife came to the monastery to save him but was turned away, Renathyr became convinced that he was tricked by a devil. Despite this realization, he now believes he is too far gone to atone. He only follows the wretched path he has been set upon. The pages become increasingly difficult to read as they become smudged or stained with blood until eventually the pages are completely smeared with red.</span></p></div>"

She claims to be a goddess, but those who succeed on a [[/check INS DC 13]] or [[/check REL DC 13]] check see through her deception and know she is clearly a vile Fiend. A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDetectEvil]{Detect Evil and Good}</em> spell or a paladin's Divine Senses reveals the blade to be a desecrated object with a fiendish resonance—she is a devil of deceit and desire. She might say:</p><p class=\"p10\"><em><strong>About Renathyr’s Defeat.</strong></em> “You are stronger than him and more controlled. You would use my power more effectively.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s10\"><em><strong>After Being Called a Devil.</strong></em> “Ha! You are cleverer than him, too.

Though you are not yet ready to become Bloodless, as he was, you soon will be. Wield my blade. Kill in my name. Do great deeds—heroic deeds in my name. Die in my name. I will gift you peace and power.”</p><p class=\"p10\"><em><strong>If Her Power Is Refused.</strong></em> “We shall see. Once you are broken, once my true power has bled you dry, then we shall see how proud and noble you still are.”</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Accepting Infernal Power.</strong></em> Characters who consider accepting feel an almost insurmountable hunger for the blood spattering the cathedral, and for that coursing through the veins of their companions. This is a pivotal decision, with dire consequences. Take a moment to impress that upon the player through their character's sensation of Viraxys's temptations. If a characters accepts, that hunger overwhelms them. Viraxys laughs with wicked glee and purrs, “Now you are mine.”</p><p class=\"p7\">The character claims the sword and becomes a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmVampire0000000]{Vampire}</strong>, and their alignment changes to Evil if it wasn't already. The character then becomes an NPC under your control and attempts to escape in the form of a bat or red mist. This is a grave decision, but it can serve as a dramatic end to a character and introduces a new enemy to harry the remaining characters as you see fit.</p><p class=\"p7\"><em><strong>Refusing Infernal Power.</strong></em> If the characters refuse Viraxys’s power, the devil hisses, “You are too weak to claim my gift. You lack resolve and are damned.” Then, the hellfire in the cathedral snuffs out, the stained-glass windows shatter, and the essence of Viraxys leaves the Crimson Monastery forever.

However, they can be used to set the tone for any Folk Horror adventure you wish to run. Below is suggested guidance for how to use all three albums to maximize the atmosphere of your dreadful folktales.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s2\">The Crooked Moon Soundtrack</span></h2><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The first album acts as a soundtrack for this book’s adventure campaign. In most cases, these songs aren’t literally occurring in the “canon” of the world (non-diegetic music) and can be utilized for conveying the tone of each character or encounter. Alternatively, if you wish to run a more musical campaign, you can find creative ways to incorporate each song into the context of the adventure (diegetic music). The list below overviews the characters and scenarios that have inspired each song.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Crooked Moon.</strong> A cultist of the Old Ways tells of the folklore and superstitions of Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>When It’s Time.</strong> The Vagrant welcomes wayward souls aboard the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> for their final journey.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Impossible.</strong> Phillip and Adela Druskenvald share a tender moment and celebrate what they’ve built.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>The Echoes.</strong> The spirit of Joseph Patrini laments the grisly fate of the inhabitants of the Crooked House.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Coal Eyed Birds.</strong> Ol’ Jericho Sticks is manipulated by his inner demon Virgil to join together as Raum.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Under Your Shadow.</strong> Father Renathyr leads worship of the devil goddess Viraxys, still wounded by lost love.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>By the Lagoon.</strong> Mister Crossroads makes a deal with a sinner and takes them to the <em>Dead Man’s Hand</em>.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Lullaby of the Sea.</strong> Matron Lethica sings a lullaby to Hugo, still consumed by the grief of her lost love.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Dead Trees.</strong> Gorthos dwells on who she once was, whom she once loved, and what she has become.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Cold Iron.</strong> Yorgrim tends to his penitent duties as the twisted souls of the Shroud corrupt him.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>No Fun to Die.</strong> Chuckles wakes up to lead a parade of revelry and usher in rebirth in Wickermoor Hollow.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Sing Ye Vermin.</strong> The Vermintoll Coven meets to brew a magic concoction and commune with their vermin.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Light of My Life.</strong> Adela reflects on her life and love before meeting a fiery fate in the Wicker Man.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Born King.</strong> Kehlenn takes her revenge against Phillip and transforms him into the Horned King.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Nightwind.</strong> The Vagrant returns at the end of the journey to take the survivors to their next destination.</p><h2><span class=\"s2\">Atmospheric &amp; Combat Music</span></h2><p class=\"p1\">The second and third albums feature looping instrumental tracks that evoke the themes of this book’s adventure, whether to set the tone while exploring a location or increase the tension and excitement during combat encounters. The table below suggests which chapters or scenarios to play these songs during, but they can be a thematic fit in any Folk Horror campaign.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Atmospheric Tracks per chapter</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Forgetting Glow.</strong> The Ghostlight Express</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Life Delicious.</strong> Wickermoor Village</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Silent Hours.</strong> The Crooked House</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Sunken Sky.</strong> Fields of the Crow</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Drained of Fear.</strong> The Crimson Monastery</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>A Place to Unwind.</strong> The Drowned Crossroads</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Wriggle Forth.</strong> Skitterdeep Mine / The Roving Rookery / The Crooked Nightmare</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Cradled in Dark.</strong> Memory’s Rest</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Rotted Rings.</strong> Hartsblight Forest</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Endless Twilights.</strong> Maidenmist Cemetery</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Round and Around.</strong> Fool’s Day</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Songs We’ve Borrowed.</strong> Wicker’s Vigil</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Half Forgotten.</strong> The Crooked Tree</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Creaking Bones.</strong> Outdoor Locations</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Blurring Faces.</strong> Indoor Locations</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Combat Tracks per chapter</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Riding too Long.</strong> The Ghostlight Express</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Thrashing Light.</strong> Wickermoor Village</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>These Splitting Walls.</strong> The Crooked House</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Talons.</strong> Fields of the Crow</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Hearts Agape.</strong> The Crimson Monastery</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Alligator’s Smile.</strong> The Drowned Crossroads</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Steaming Death.</strong> Skitterdeep Mine / The Roving Rookery / The Crooked Nightmare</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Shudders in a Teardrop.</strong> Memory’s Rest</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Her Rotting Throne.</strong> Hartsblight Forest</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Breaking.</strong> Maidenmist Cemetery</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Dizzy Dancing.</strong> Fool’s Day</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Fire Rising.</strong> Wicker’s Vigil</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Beneath Immortal Hooves.</strong> The Crooked Tree</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>Shrieks of Endless Night.</strong> Outdoor Locations</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>So Solemn and Grim.</strong> Indoor Locations</p><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:0px;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);z-index:1\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:absolute;inset:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);z-index:2\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p></div><div style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);position:relative;z-index:3\"><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;scrollbar-width:thin;scrollbar-color:var(--color-scrollbar) var(--color-scrollbar-track);margin:0.5em 0px;text-align:center\"><span class=\"s1\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">Find all these tracks and more at <a href=\"https://avantris.com/music\">avantris.com/music</a></span></span></p></div></div>"

To outsiders, it promises solace and a retreat from life’s troubles. But behind its iron doors lurks a nightmare. Beneath the polished facade and soft-spoken promises, Matron Lethica pursues her sinister ambition: the Lethic Serum. The concoction claims to cure all ailments—but at a terrible cost. Those who undergo its treatment lose more than their pain; their bodies mutate, their memories fade, and they become hollow vessels for Lethica’s cruel vision of salvation.</p><h2>Chapter Background</h2><p>Memory’s Rest Sanatorium rises from the mists of Moonsong Lake, a sanctuary for those seeking relief from their troubles. Its founder, Matron Lethica, has transformed the Isle of Mourn into a place of healing—or so its reputation would suggest. In truth, the sanatorium’s wards are filled with pained silence and the anguished cries of those seduced by this mask.</p><p>To perfect her serum, Lethica and her staff—the corrupted nurses, surgeons, and horrors born of her failures—have turned the sanatorium into a prison. Patients vanish often. Those who do not return have succumbed to the mutagenic effects of the Lethic Serum and have transformed into abominations in the image of the true source of the serum.</p><p>An eldritch horror known as the White Worm has been imprisoned by the matron in the caverns beneath the sanatorium. This otherworldly being’s ichor serves as the base of the Lethic Serum, and its alien mind gives endless inspiration for Lethica’s abominable experiments, treatments, and goal of twisting the bodies and minds of everyone. Only through the death of the widow can the people be spared this sickening evolution.</p><h2>Chapter Summary</h2><p>Memory’s Rest Sanatorium is a place of suffering, alchemy, and unspeakable transformation. The characters are tasked with uncovering its secrets and ending Lethica’s sinister dreams. To prevail, they must navigate the halls of the sanatorium, confront its many horrors, and face the Weeping Widow herself. Characters drawn to the sanatorium by the Quest Hook later in this chapter have several goals:</p><ul><li><p>Learn what is happening to patients in Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</p></li><li><p>Create an antidote to the Lethic Serum</p></li><li><p>Find Lethica’s secret Laboratory (area L27) and the cavern below.</p></li><li><p>Slay Matron Lethica, the Weeping Widow.</p></li></ul><p>Before running this chapter, study its most important NPC, the Weeping Widow, to understand her motivations and methods. Familiarize yourself with the sanatorium’s layout, key areas, and inhabitants so you are prepared to run encounters in whatever order the characters explore. Finally, review the climactic battle, “The Chemical Evolution,” to ensure a satisfying and epic finale.</p><p>This chapter is designed for four 7th level characters.</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"tcmpage border-chap17 middle-page\"><p class=\"h1 section\">The Weeping Widow</p><p>Matron Lethica, the Weeping Widow, was once a priestess of night but forsook her faith to pursue twisted science infused with otherworldly power. She seeks to “free” all people from their pain and sorrow, believing that erasing suffering is the only path to peace. She holds all she meets in contempt and disgust, using her seemingly noble purpose to manipulate and recruit a staff that is both loyal and adoring.</p><h2>Tragedy of the Widow</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Matron_Lethica.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p>Long ago, a white-haired elf named Lethica Nightborne was a high priestess of a goddess of evening, peace, and healing who takes the form of a barn owl. Her duty was to heal those sick in body or mind, which she achieved through blessings from her goddess, as well as the brewing of natural remedies. She found joy bringing peace to countless souls, but her life would be made complicated when she encountered her husband-to-be.</p><p>After meeting the traveling knight Sir Marius Renathyr, Lethica discovered a happiness greater than she ever thought possible. Their romance was passionate, and their marriage filled Lethica with purpose. Lethica believed she and her chivalrous love would make the world a better place.</p><p>Fate had another plan. After her husband bared his vampire fangs and attempted to feed upon her (see chapter 14), he fled in shame. She followed him and uncovered the extent of his wickedness, shocked to learn his soul was damned and pledged to a devil. The knight she knew and loved was dead, and her new life as a widow was one of endless grief.</p><p>To ease her suffering, she redoubled her commitment to the restorative pursuit that had once brought her such comfort. She found the Isle of Mourn, drawn by stories of crystalline pools in the caverns beneath the earth said to have miraculous healing powers. The legends were true, and after she verified the water’s potency, she began construction of a hospital on that very site, where she vowed she would bring an end to all pain.</p><p>Lethica used the waters of the pools to heal the sickly, but her joy did not return. She was hollow and bitter, and she grew resentful of her goddess for failing to prevent her tragedy. Disavowing her goddess and the Nightborne name, she turned toward scientific practices that allowed her to develop more potent medicines as the hospital continued its construction.</p><h2>Eater of Memory</h2><p>Lethica discovered she was a natural scientist and that her brilliance was unmatched. However, despite numerous breakthroughs, she could not cure every affliction. In particular, she found that several of her patients suffered from painful memories just as she did. This scientific dead-end troubled her until inspiration struck while she walked the endless caverns beneath the fledgling hospital.</p><p>She came across the ruins of a dead civilization that worshiped an eldritch being from beyond the stars who endlessly hungers for memories. For years, she studied the etchings of a forgotten language, learning how to make contact with a being known only as the White Worm. Lethica had finally found the secret that would allow her to unlock the full potential of her medicine.</p><p>In the cavern beneath the hospital, she performed a ritual that summoned forth the White Worm. By accepting its parasitic offspring within her form, Lethica appeased the creature and formed a psychic bond with it. Her skin turned pallid, her blood violet, and her tears an inky black that forever ran down her face and stained her cheeks. Then, Lethica activated the trap she had set, using her potent science to imprison the weakened grub and constantly drain its alien gore. This ichor, infused with the water of the enchanted pools, formed the base of the Lethic Serum, her greatest work.</p><p>When injected, the serum removed a subject’s memories, feeding them to the White Worm to keep it alive. While it remedied physical afflictions, it also warped the body into something wholly alien. Lethica saw this transformation as a cure to suffering and committed to spreading it to everyone, whether they sought it or not. This became the sole purpose of the completed hospital, which she dubbed Memory’s Rest Sanatorium.</p><p>Despite her proclaimed noble goal of freeing her patients from their pain, Lethica is equally motivated by a hatred that others should enjoy a blissful life when she cannot. Her foul experiments seek to perfect the serum and produce it at such a scale that the waters of Wickermoor Hollow would transform all living things within. She has even created a variety of apparatuses to pump the serum into the pools below the sanatorium.</p><div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;max-width:800px;margin:2em auto;background:transparent;--border-color:#a67c00;box-sizing:border-box\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20scenes/SCENE_Chapter17_Memorys_Rest.webp\" alt=\"\" /><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div></div><h2>Parley with the Widow</h2><p>Matron Lethica spends her waking hours immersed in her alchemy and overseeing the operations of Memory’s Rest Sanatorium. She meets with visitors to offer reassurances, veiled in kindness and empathy, while quietly assessing whether they can be swayed, used, or eliminated. She is most commonly met in the Matron’s Office (area L4), presenting herself as a visionary who carries the burden of humanity’s pain. She spends the remainder of her time in her quarters (area L19) or her Laboratory (area L27).</p><p>Any challenge to her authority or questioning of her methods is met with unwavering confidence. She maintains a calm and composed demeanor, speaking with the precision of a scholar and the gentleness of a healer. Do not be fooled, however; she is cold and ruthless, convinced her work will liberate the world from suffering—no matter the cost.</p><p>If the characters meet Lethica and speak with her, these are her answers to some common topics:</p><p><strong>Who Are You?</strong> “I am Matron Lethica, steward of this hospital. You may think of me as a healer—one who is unafraid to confront the hardships others dare not face.”</p><p><strong>Why Do You Operate this Place?</strong> “To salve the sorrows of this senseless world. I brew the antidote to pain itself.”</p><p><strong>What Set You on this Path?</strong> “My own loss drives me. My own sorrow. All the memories which I long to forget but mustn’t. I cannot be idle until I have erased the pain from others.”</p><p><strong>Why Do You Cry?</strong> “A side effect of my work. Nothing more.” A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check determines this to be a lie.</p><p><strong>Have You Tried Lethic Serum Yourself?</strong> “I must not. I endure so others may heal.”</p><p><strong>What is the Lethic Serum?</strong> “An alchemical distillation of my own design. It has yet to fail to erase the pain of those who accept its tranquility. It is the key to salvation.”</p></div>"

Born of a cursed fomorian bloodline, Hugo’s immense strength was overwhelmed by debilitating pain and horrific visions so severe that they harmed those around him and threatened to end his own life. His suffering drove him to Lethica during the earliest days of the hospital, where she promised comfort and relief through her alchemy. She kept her word—quieting the agony of his curse—but at the cost of turning him into a mutated servant entirely dependent on her.</p><p>The first step in silencing Hugo’s torment was to close his three eyes with needle and thread. In a short time, Hugo’s body became riddled with scars from countless surgeries. Metal tubes and implanted reservoirs ensure constant delivery of the alchemical cocktail that suppresses Hugo’s pain and emotions, though this was no mercy. Viewing Hugo as the perfect test subject due to his rapidly healing biology and seeming unwillingness to die, Lethica pushed his physical and emotional limits to advance her alchemical mastery. Despite this, Hugo’s devotion to Lethica is absolute—she soothed his pain and, in his eyes, everything she does is justified.</p><p><em><strong>Meeting Hugo.</strong></em> Accustomed to his own form of veil, Hugo relies on his other senses to navigate the world. He is attuned to the sanatorium and immediately rushes to pacify any commotion within its walls, though he mostly stalks the Second Floor to avoid disturbing new arrivals.</p><p><em><strong>Hugo’s Fate.</strong></em> Despite his near-death experience and agonizing transformation, fragments of Hugo’s sympathy and kindness survive. If he still lives when Matron Lethica is destroyed, Hugo is left adrift, overwhelmed by the loss. If approached with compassion and empathy, Hugo might abandon his violent ways and seek peace beyond the borders of Wickermoor Hollow, learning to forget the horrors he witnessed and discovering that he no longer needs Lethica to be free.</p><h2>Sarah Godlee and the Orderlies</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:10px 10px 10px 0;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Sarah_Godlee.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.VNDl4dT1f0NcMxfC]{Nurse Sarah Godlee}</strong> was one of the first to accept the Lethic Serum and serves as the second-in-command to Matron Lethica. Unlike the other orderlies, she wears no mask, as her form was only mildly contorted by the serum. Freed of the troubles that hindered her former life, she now runs the sanatorium’s night-to-night operations as its undisputed enforcer. While Matron Lethica cloaks her methods in gentleness, Godlee prefers intimidation, control, and cruelty.</p><p>Godlee thrives on power, both over the orderlies under her command and the patients she claims to care for. She sometimes pilfers valuables from the patients to indulge her sense of authority.</p><p>Nurse Godlee deeply admires Matron Lethica to the point of obsession, finding her employer’s decades-long grief over her husband a constant source of pain. She wishes for Lethica to let go of her past and forget Marius Renathyr just like the patients of the hospital. She believes removing collected mementos to be the right step, but would never dare cross her matron. However, she will find common cause with the characters if they can convince her they wish to help.</p><p><em><strong>Meeting Nurse Godlee.</strong></em> When the characters first enter the hospital, Nurse Godlee is overseeing the patients’ mealtime in the Common Room (area L9) on the First Floor. During waking hours, she retires to her quarters (area L17) to watch over the Airing Grounds (area L10) or tour the sanatorium to instruct Hugo and the other orderlies.</p><p><em><strong>The Veiled Orderlies.</strong></em> All fifteen of the orderlies who now preside over the sanatorium were formerly patients. Each of them wears the same, matching uniform. They also don stark white porcelain masks to conceal the unsightly deformities left by the Lethic Serum. While they are still capable of reasoning, the orderlies obey the commands of Matron Lethica and Nurse Godlee without question.</p><h2>Doctor Belkin and the Surgeons</h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Doctor_Belkin.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" /><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.BFRyWTWq2dJGFKye]{Doctor Belkin}</strong> is the architect of Memory’s Rest’s most horrifying experiments. When Belkin was first exposed to the Lethic Serum, its effects on him were unique. His mind opened to the White Worm’s influence, and he was found the following night in the caverns below the hospital having removed the top of his own skull—a colony of pale, writhing larvae now burrow within, driving his every thought. The White Worm had revealed the “truth”: salvation lies not in erasing trauma but in perfect symbiosis with the worm’s parasitic gifts.</p><p>Belkin is a fierce disciple of Matron Lethica, and he believes in spreading the White Worm’s influence to elevate all beings to a higher state of existence. His experiments focus on creating mutated hosts for more worms, ensuring their spread to the wider world. His reverence for his alien deity is immense, and Belkin is always looking for new converts to worship the worm. He will find common cause with the characters if made to believe they are genuinely interested in serving the eldritch entity.</p><p>When operating on the first floor of the sanatorium, the doctor hides his exposed brain with a surgery cap, bringing a calming demeanor to his nervous patients. He will treat the characters with kindness, but if he perceives the characters as a threat to the White Worm, he will unleash his experiments and surgeons to eliminate them.</p><p><em><strong>Meeting Doctor Belkin.</strong></em> Doctor Belkin spends most of his time in the Experimental Wing of the Second Floor monitoring his trials and testing subjects he thinks are strong enough to survive his extreme procedures. To maintain appearances, Belkin also conducts medical examinations for new admissions, using these moments to evaluate potential candidates for his operations.</p><p><em><strong>The Wormhost Surgeons.</strong></em> Belkin’s six acolytes have survived similar procedures under his scalpel. They are now extensions of his will, hosting their own colonies of parasites. To conceal their deformities, they wear bloodied surgical smocks, masks, and caps, though the faint squish of the larvae beneath their flesh often betrays them.</p><p>The surgeons work in chilling synchronization, communicating in low, guttural gurgles. While outwardly loyal to Belkin, their true allegiance lies with the White Worm.</p><h2>Patients of Memory’s Rest</h2><p>The patients (neutral, human noncombatant <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoners}</strong>) of Memory’s Rest Sanatorium represent a wide spectrum of suffering from every corner of Wickermoor Hollow. Each has been admitted seeking relief, only to become unwitting subjects in Matron Lethica’s experimental pursuits. All patients within Memory’s Rest are under the effects of the Lethic Serum, which relieves whatever malady brought them here but erases their memories and identity. The patients in the Patient Register table could be met by the characters during their stay in Memory’s Rest, though it is not comprehensive.</p><p>You choose where a patient is within Memory’s Rest at any given time, whether they are alone or escorted, and what their condition is. Consider also incorporating NPCs the characters already know to raise the stakes, making their presence in Memory’s Rest a personal and urgent surprise. You can plan the patients schedules in advance or improvise their behavior in response to the characters’ choices and actions.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.pPsG9KcIQx7QmS6H]{Patient Register}</strong></em></p></div>"

He tells the story of his cousin, who had long suffered a chronic affliction and sought care at a hospital on the western side of Wickermoor Hollow. This cousin can be any of the patients listed in the Patient Register table (see “Patients of Memory’s Rest” above).</p><p>Amos became concerned after receiving a letter allegedly penned by his cousin despite it sounding nothing like them and having completely different handwriting. In this correspondence, the cousin said, “Matron Lethica has healed me and given me purpose,” claiming they would not be returning home to the farm before assuring Amos that “All is well.”</p><p>Not trusting this sudden change, he implores the characters to find his cousin to discover the truth.

Lethica and her staff all possess ward keys.</p><p><strong>Reinforced Glass.</strong> Windows and glass within the sanatorium have AC 15, 15 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and sound can't pass through them.</p><h2>Exploring the Sanatorium</h2><p>Memory’s Rest Sanatorium operates with strict protocols designed to maintain control and secrecy. Newcomers are always escorted by orderlies (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.wYDQmBRsrRo8AAta]{Mutant Nurses}</strong>*) or other staff and are directed to specific areas on the First Floor only. Patients who have been admitted are permitted to move unaccompanied, but they may not enter Restricted areas like the Nurse Stations (area L5), Elevators (area L6), or the Pharmacy (area L8). Access to the Second Floor is strictly prohibited without being escorted by staff.</p><p>Characters who want to explore the sanatorium freely must rely on diplomacy (such as gaining the trust of Nurse Godlee or Doctor Belkin) or avoid detection (through stealth or by donning disguises). Use the guidelines and staff schedules provided in this section to track the staff’s attitudes toward the characters as they explore and to inform how encounters unfold.</p><p><em><strong>Hospital Staff.</strong></em> There are sixteen <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.wYDQmBRsrRo8AAta]{Mutant Nurses}</strong>*, including Nurse Sarah Godlee, who support the sanatorium’s night-to-night needs. They take shifts every 8 hours. Five orderlies remain stationary in their apartments (areas L14) on the Second Floor at any given time, resting and awaiting their duties. The remaining ten orderlies attend patients on the First Floor in pairs, wait for visitors in Reception (area L1), or assist Lethica when a patient is being treated with Lethic Serum in the Restraining Room (area L15).</p><p>There are seven <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aHAfPdP24eevOUSO]{Wormhost Surgeons}</strong>*, including Doctor Belkin, who live and work at Memory’s Rest. They visit the First Floor to examine new patients and perform surgeries only when necessary, spending most of their nights in the Experiment Lab (area L26).</p><p><em><strong>Visiting Hours.</strong></em> Visitors are welcome from the Twilight Hour through the Nightfall Hour. Sanatorium staff are indifferent toward guests that don’t disturb the placid atmosphere of the hospital. The first time a visitor performs an action that violates the Code of Conduct for Visitors causes staff to issue a stern warning. A second transgression causes staff to become hostile, and they attempt to subdue the characters with Lethic Serum. This Code of Conduct is displayed prominently on polished wooden plaques along many of the sanatorium walls.</p><p>Performing either of the following actions causes the staff to instantly become hostile, regardless of their previous attitude:</p><ul><li><p>Attacking sanatorium staff or patients</p></li><li><p>Being found in the Elevators (area L6) or on the Second Floor without an escort</p></li></ul><div style=\"position:absolute;inset:0;pointer-events:none;border:2px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:1\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:absolute;top:6px;bottom:6px;left:6px;right:6px;pointer-events:none;border:1px solid var(--border-color);box-sizing:border-box;z-index:2\"><p> </p></div><div style=\"position:relative;z-index:3\"><h4><strong>Code of Conduct for Visitors</strong></h4><ol><li><p><strong>Maintain Tranquility.</strong> Refrain from using bright lights or making loud noises.</p></li><li><p><strong>Respect the Healing Process.</strong> Avoid mentioning the patient’s past.

When it is injected into a Humanoid as an action, the target takes [[/damage 2d6 poison]] damage and must make a [[/save CON DC 21]]saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s speed becomes 0, it becomes &amp;reference[poisoned apply=false] for 8 hours, and it becomes &amp;refrence[stunned apply=false] while poisoned in this way. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of every hour, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target succeeds on the initial save, it becomes incapacitated for 1 hour. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>Success or failure, for the next 24 hours, the target can't remember anything from before it was injected by the serum. Until the target's memories return, it has disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks.</p><p>If a Humanoid is injected with the serum again while already poisoned by it, the target loses all of its memories permanently and suffers a mutation in 1d4 hours as determined by the Serum Effect table below.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.xxP4PjU1vXRGNnfR]{Serum Effect}</strong></em></p><h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3><p>Only an antidote can fully restore memories suppressed or removed by the Lethic Serum. A creature that has transformed into a mutant nurse can also be rejuvenated by the antidote, returning to its former self after a long rest.</p><p>To concoct the solution, its ingredients must be found and combined in a special alchemical process. Characters can learn of this antidote through clues found in the sanatorium, reading Lethica’s serum diagrams in her quarters (area L19), or by succeeding on a [[/check ARC DC 21]] or [[/check MED DC 21]] check after spending 1 hour analyzing a creature affected by the Lethic Serum. The antidote requires three ingredients:</p><p><strong>Mnemonic Residue. </strong>A silvery lavender ash harvested from the Crematorium (area L18), formed only by the incineration of creatures infused with Lethic Serum</p><p><strong>Noetic Extract.</strong> A pale viscous fluid siphoned from brains preserved in Monster Containment (area L22)</p><p><strong>Unrefined Ichor.</strong> An amethyst-purple liquid produced by the White Worm, found in Lethica’s Quarters (area L19), the Laboratory (area L27), or the Grotto of Tears</p><p>When all ingredients have been gathered, a character can craft the antidote in the Laboratory (area L27) or by using an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.i89okN7GFTWHsvPy]{herbalism kit} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.SztwZhbhZeCqyAes]{alchemist's supplies}. A successful [[/check ARC DC 18]] check or [[/check INT DC 13]] (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.SztwZhbhZeCqyAes]{alchemist's supplies}) check produces 1 dose per 10 minutes of work and consumes the ingredients. Failure depletes one random ingredient but does not destroy the others.</p><p>As an action or a bonus action, the antidote can be loaded into a syringe or injector. It can be injected into a creature with an action.</p><h2>Lockdown</h2><p>When Lockdown is triggered, Memory’s Rest Sanatorium transforms into a prison designed to contain patients, alchemical secrets, and intruders alike. Lockdown ensures control is maintained and that any threat to Lethica’s work is crushed.</p><p>At your discretion, Lockdown can be initiated whenever combat breaks out, a patient goes missing, a body is found, or a member of the staff suspects foul play. Covert panels are located every 20 feet along the corridors on both the First and Second Floor, which require a ward key to activate. These panels can be forced open and activated with a successful [[/check SLT DC 25]] @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.woWZ1sO5IUVGzo58]{thieves' tools}. Hidden switches are also located in the Matron’s Office (area L4) and Nurse Stations (area L5).</p><p><em><strong>Receding Light.</strong></em> The glass tubes that illuminate Memory’s Rest don’t immediately blink off when Lockdown occurs. As the glowing steam within the tubes vents out of the facility and through the Engineering Room (area L20), its violet light rushes out of rooms over the course of 3 rounds and retreats down hallways as though being chased by the shadows (see “Creeping Dark” below).</p><p><em><strong>Wailing Siren.</strong></em> As the light recedes, an ear-splitting alarm like a pained scream reverberates through the building and is loud enough to be heard across the entire island (see “Engineering Room” later in this chapter). It lasts 5 rounds before fading.</p><p><em><strong>Time-out.</strong></em> When the orderlies hear the siren, unless there is an immediate threat, they prioritize sedating all patients on the First Floor with their Inject action (dealing no damage), rendering them unconscious. Once this task is complete, they begin a thorough search through the sanatorium to find and eliminate danger and to communicate with senior staff like Nurse Godlee and Matron Lethica.</p><p>Doctor Belkin and his surgeons congregate in the Experiment Lab (area L26) and Monster Containment (area L22) to keep their experiments out of danger during Lockdown. Unless the source of danger is obvious, Hugo (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.mkR54wUHh2EX8eY6]{Serum Brute}</strong>*) patrols the main hallways and is hostile to any creature that isn’t a staff member. Lethica calmly makes her way back to her Laboratory (area L27) in the event of a Lockdown to ensure her research is safe before returning to the sanatorium halls.</p><p>During Lockdown, Memory’s Rest Sanatorium has the following features:</p><p><strong>Creeping Dark.</strong> Magic that suppresses sight fills the hospital, halving the range of all light sources and darkvision.</p><p><strong>Self-Acting Locks.</strong> Closed doors lock themselves, or lock automatically when they are closed. Elevators cease to function.</p><p>Only Lethica can authorize the end of Lockdown, which is typically performed by Nurse Godlee in the Engineering Room (area L20).</p><p><em><strong>Subdued and Sedated.</strong></em> If the characters are overwhelmed in combat, they are not killed. They awaken in the Sedation Hall (area L16), revived with 1 hit point. Their equipment is replaced with hospital gowns, and they are surrounded by Lethica and her orderlies. This is a disastrous scenario that can mark the end of the campaign without clever negotiation, luck, or external help.</p></div>"

What brings you to my sanctuary?”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Matron Lethica (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.rRPdaWWKHDjQi0II]{The Weeping Widow}</strong>*) sees any newcomers as potential new subjects for her experiments. She insists everyone can benefit from her hospitality, even those blessed with good health, and wholeheartedly welcomes any who wish to stay at Memory’s Rest or agree to undergo treatment. Use the guidance below to steer the conversation with Matron Lethica:</p><ul><li><p>Lethica’s goal is to get her guests to trust her by making them feel understood and probing for past trauma or grief she can offer to aid.</p></li><li><p>She offers the characters a soothing Tonic (see “Pharmacy,” area L8), which she is willing to drink herself.</p></li><li><p>If asked about her patients’ forgetfulness, Lethica explains it is a necessary step in their recovery, allowing them to heal without reliving their suffering.</p></li><li><p>If asked about the Lethic Serum, Lethica explains she is hard at work developing many new treatments to help her patients.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>The Widow’s History.</strong></em> Lethica is willing to talk about her purpose and her past, including her betrothal, though she only refers to Marius Renathyr as “Sir Marius” or “my late husband.” If a character mentions the Crimson Abbot or Father Renathyr, she falls silent before stifling a sob and changing the subject. If pressed, she commands her orderlies to enter and escort the characters off the premises. Afterwards, Lethica travels to her quarters (area L19), looking to her mementos for comfort.</p><p><em><strong>Tour the Facility.</strong></em> If Lethica suspects the characters are trying to investigate her operation, she invites them on a guided tour. During the trip, she casually guides them through the Behavioral Ward, Common Room (area L9), and Convalescent Ward, answering any questions politely and succinctly, before leading them to the Recovery Rooms (area L11) where they can rest. She leaves to continue her research and informs Nurse Godlee that the characters must be monitored at all times.</p><p><em><strong>Admitted to the Widow’s Ward.</strong></em> Lethica’s onboarding process for admitting the characters is as follows:</p><ul><li><p>She emphasizes that all patients must submit to treatment and to take their medication as instructed.</p></li><li><p>She instructs Nurse Godlee or another orderly to escort the characters for examination (area L12) if they have not already been evaluated.</p></li><li><p>She asks the characters to wear gowns found in their Recovery Rooms during their stay. Their equipment is to be left in their rooms or with Nurse Godlee.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>If Combat Breaks Out.</strong></em> If attacked while in the Matron’s Office, Lethica triggers Lockdown (see “Lockdown” earlier in this chapter) from a switch beneath her desk. The longcase clock gongs incessantly to alert nearby staff. Lethica fights if she must, and she attempts to escape to rally reinforcements, leaving the characters to fend for themselves.</p></div>"

It contains a unique blend of writhing alien tissues and serums that exhibit properties that fascinate Belkin.</p><p>Belkin doesn’t immediately consider the characters a threat and is indifferent toward them. Unless he knows they have endangered his experiments or if Lockdown is in effect, he sees their arrival as an opportunity.</p><p><em><strong>The Experiment.</strong></em> Doctor Belkin is preparing to conduct an experiment to produce his finest creation yet, which he hopes will serve as the next stage of evolution to be closer in nature to the White Worm. The abomination, a fused amalgam of former mutated patients, is concealed beneath a sheet on the operating table. He believes that the characters would serve as an ideal first combat test for this creature—and a satisfactory meal should the abomination destroy them.</p><p><em><strong>Belkin’s Offer.</strong></em> Belkin is always in search of new pupils and worshipers of the White Worm. Before unleashing his experiment, he offers them the chance to see truth beyond the reality of Druskenvald and witness the perfection of form. Characters who accept can undergo a 1 hour procedure that transforms them into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.aHAfPdP24eevOUSO]{Wormhost Surgeon}</strong>*.</p><p><em><strong>The Creation Rises.</strong></em> If any characters refuse the offer, attack the doctor, or speak ill of the White Worm, Doctor Belkin flips the switch to bring his horrific creation to life, which attacks the characters until it is destroyed. This vile amalgam of mutant and alien flesh uses the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.kr6r8bhSehACPfZ8]{Chimera}</strong> stat block, but it is an Aberration and its Fire Breath deals psychic damage. Belkin chooses to simply observe, but he joins the battle if attacked or when the creature is reduced to half its hit points or fewer.</p><p><em><strong>Undulating Tissue.</strong></em> If the contents of the glowing jar that Doctor Belkin was studying is released, it morphs into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.oVJEqyGVwzL0AldU]{Nameless Thing}</strong>* familiar and immediately bonds with the first creature that speaks after it emerges.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> A successful [[/check PRC DC 15]] check reveals the following items tucked away in corners and cabinets:</p><ul><li><p>A canister labelled “pheromones” (a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.63nb14yQRJMc4bIn]{Philter of Love}</em>)</p></li><li><p>Four <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.L887NdWEP5NqHCrQ]{Potions of Healing} </em>(greater)</p></li><li><p>A sealed vial of Lethic Serum</p></li></ul></div>"

Only Lethica knows how to find exactly what she is looking for in this disorganized space. For each minute spent searching the Laboratory, an item is found as determined by the Laboratory Item table, with a maximum of ten items that can be found.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-rollable-tables.RollTable.rAF7incgOghHwNjg]{Laboratory Item}</strong></em></p><p>A character looking for a specific item can also make a [[/check INV DC 16]] or [[/check PRC DC 16]] check to try and find it within the clutter.</p><p><em><strong>Distilled Memory.</strong></em> Dozens of crystal decanters containing glowing, violet-colored liquid can be found scattered throughout the Laboratory—Unrefined Ichor, harvested directly from the White Worm. Each container is labeled with a date and batch number. The substance is a key component in the antidote solution (see “The Solution” earlier in this chapter).</p><p><em><strong>Plunge Platform.</strong></em> The elevator platform on one side of the Laboratory descends to the Grotto of Tears 150 feet below. A lever to activate the lift juts out from the floor adjacent the platform. The descent takes 5 minutes, during which the platform creaks and groans. The shaft is pitch dark, with walls slick from the moisture of the waters below.</p><p><em><strong>The Widow’s Wile.</strong></em> In the corner of the Laboratory stands a mesmerizing orb of glass cradled on a pedestal, its surface alive with arcs of purple lightning. A creature that touches the orb experiences no ill effect and finds the orb cannot be moved. A character who succeeds on a [[/check INV DC 16]] or [[/check PRC DC 16]] check notices a subtle foot lever at the bottom of the pedestal.

They appear in this book’s adventure, and you can use them in your own encounters throughout the thirteen provinces of Druskenvald or anywhere else of your choosing.</span></p><p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia, serif\">The creatures in this bestiary are organized into three broad categories: “Crooked Moon Monsters,\" which are the traditional foes faced throughout a dreadful folktale, “Legendary Monsters” for the monsters of legend who serve as climactic antagonists in the adventure, and “Familiars,” which can be recruited by player characters in addition to being encountered as any other monster might. Within each category, the monsters are organized alphabetically. The tables in the pages to come lists every creature in Appendix A, along with the creature’s type and CR.</span></p></div><h2><span class=\"s1\">Using a Stat Block</span></h2><p class=\"p2\">This appendix is a companion to the core rules and adopts a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar with the monster stat block format, read “Monster Statistics” in the <em>Basic Rules </em>before proceeding further. A stat block referenced in bold with a <span class=\"s2\">*</span> appears in this book.</p><h3><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Monster Secrets</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p2\">Most of the monsters in <em>The Crooked Moon</em> have a secret weakness or other quirk that can influence interaction and battle with the creature, but the trick is knowing it before it’s needed. You can decide which nonplayer characters, writings, or other sources or methods might divulge a monster’s secret. A few examples of how the player characters could learn of it include:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p4\">Consulting with knowledgeable figures such as sages well-versed in peculiar creatures or hermits who have long lived in an area where a given creature lurks.</p></li><li><p class=\"p4\">Scouring libraries that hold lore.</p></li><li><p class=\"p4\">Talking with local folk who might have some factual information passed down in their superstitions and traditions.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p2\">Once they have a potential reliable source, a character who spends a number of hours equal to the monster’s CR (minimum of 1 hour) researching the secret must make an ability check using a skill proficiency determined by the monster’s creature type, as outlined in the Monster Lore table. The ability check used is usually Intelligence, but it could also be Charisma in the case of sourcing rumors and local folklore, at your discretion. The DC for the check is 10 plus the monster’s CR.</p><p class=\"p5\">On a success, the character learns the monster’s secret. On a failure, the sources don’t have reliable information, and the character can try again with a new source.</p><p class=\"p5\">If you decide that characters may have learned a monster’s secret during their own experiences, a character can make the ability check with a DC of 20 or the monster’s CR plus 10, whichever is higher. On a success, the character recalls the secret. On a failure, they can’t try this method with that monster again and must seek out a reliable source as above.</p><img style=\"border:none\"

The bitter cold of the mountain peaks infuses both their touch and their breath.</p><p class=\"p6\">Alpengrendel draw upon the timelessness of the mountains, healing from otherwise lethal wounds in the blink of an eye.

Unswervingly loyal companions, bat hounds aid vampiric masters in tracking prey, able to outrun horses and their riders once they smell blood. They seek out stragglers or quarry that are escaping during a hunt and drag them back for capture.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Secret.</strong></em> Running water keeps bat hounds at bay and can destroy them, a lingering remnant from the vampiric curse that spawned them.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><hr /><h2><span class=\"s2\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.39jY1cMlEslsjtuW]{Bayou Beast}</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/MONSTER_Bayou_Beast.webp\" height=\"250\" /><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><em>Spirit Hex-Bound to the Swamp</em></span></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Swamp</p><p class=\"p5\">Bayou beasts are elemental spirits bound into great mounds of swamp plant matter through jinxcraft magic. These hulks obey their creators unfailingly, often lingering long after their death and carrying out their final orders. The hexed seals, fashioned from carved trinkets and masks, that trap the spirit in its form impart their curse on the creature’s enemies.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Secret.</strong></em> The jinxcraft seals can be washed away with alcohol, hindering and even destroying the bayou beast.</p><hr /><h2><span class=\"s2\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.WNNEFUmuHFevNfqx]{Boneflayer}</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/MONSTER_Boneflayer.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><em>Voracious Carrion Eater</em></span></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Desert, Forest, Grassland, Mountain</p><p class=\"p5\">Boneflayers are cruel, vulture-like creatures that originated from a broken fey pact. The creatures aren’t content to wait for something to die and instead make their own carrion to gorge upon—they delight in snatching prey in their talons, carrying it into the air, and dropping it to its death. Boneflayers earn their name by using their sizeable, filth-riddled beaks to cleave flesh from bone and hoard the meat until it ages enough for them to enjoy.</p><p class=\"p6\">Cults sometimes use boneflayer killing grounds as a source of bones to burn in ritual bonfires, occasionally making pacts with the creatures to pay or trade for the creature’s castoffs. Villages that fear boneflayer attacks ward them off with thundering drums or gongs whenever they circle overhead.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Secret.</strong></em> A lingering result of the fey bargain that created them, boneflayers are disoriented and diminished by loud, thunderous noises.</p><hr /><h2><span class=\"s2\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.IJ00nQYAueHt1tJh]{Boogleswarm}</span></h2><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><em>Tricksy Fey Weasels</em></span></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Forest, Planar (Fey), Urban</p><p class=\"p5\">Boogleswarms are mischievous Fey spirits that take the form of weasels gathered into a slinking mob. These spirits covet and collect teeth of all kinds, but they favor the teeth of Humanoids most of all. Tales of tooth faeries might have their origin in boogleswarms, as they are known to enter into agreements to trade for teeth—such as those lost by children and tucked under a pillow—for rewards, favors, or safety.</p><p class=\"p6\"><em><strong>Secret.</strong></em> Boogleswarms go wild for sugar, whether pure or in heavily-sweetened foods like candy, and are compelled to take and consume any they find.</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/MONSTER_Boogleswarm.webp\" height=\"250\" class=\" centered\" /><hr /><h2><span class=\"s2\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.6yTudWiTYZlLAVNY]{Centipede Hag}</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/MONSTER_Centipede_Hag.webp\" width=\"250\" /><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><em>Hag of Pestilence and Flesh-Shaping</em></span></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Hill, Planar (Fey), Urban, Underground</p><p class=\"p5\">Centipede hags are grotesque witches that revel in disease and filth, filling their presence with the scuttling vermin they adore.

Then it comes to life and seeks to consume any nonbelievers—and sometimes even the faithful.</p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Wicker Man’s Lair</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\">The Wicker Man’s lair is the hilltop where it is constructed and venerated.</p><p class=\"p6\">The region containing the Wicker Man’s lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:</p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>Biting Flames.</strong> Within 1 mile of the lair, when fire damage is dealt to a creature outside the Wicker Man’s dedicated cult that has resistance or immunity to fire damage, the creature takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.</span></p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>Endless Praise.</strong> Within 1 mile of the lair, cultists of the Wicker Man who sing their cult’s praises or hymns can be heard up to 300 feet away, even through a <em>Silence</em> spell.</span></p><p class=\"p5\">If the Wicker Man dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</p><hr /><h2><span class=\"s2\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.9v5OzJNAF4k0phid]{The Wild Titan}</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/MONSTER_Wild_Titan.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><em>Ferocious Giant of the Wilderness</em></span></p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Arctic, Forest, Hill, Mountain</p><p class=\"p5\">Wandering the most inhospitable mountain ranges, the Wild Titan is the wilderness made manifest, created long ago by a forgotten will for a purpose that none know. Favoring solitude in the most remote places of the world, when it encounters settlements and “civilized” people, it wants only to turn them to primal savagery or crush them beneath its immense bulk.</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\"><em><strong>Secret.</strong></em> The name of the Wild Titan’s forgotten creator is its undoing. Recovering the lost name and carving its glyph form into a stone creates a zone that severs the titan’s connection to the wild.</span></p><h3><span class=\"s4\"><strong>The Wild Titan’s Lair</strong></span></h3><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s6\">The Wild Titan’s lair is a hollowed-out peak in the mountain range the creature stalks. If encountered in its lair, the Wild Titan has a challenge rating of 22 (41,000 XP).</span></p><p class=\"p6\">The region containing the Wild Titan’s lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:</p><p class=\"p8\"><strong>Whiteout.</strong> Within 1 mile of the lair, there is a 75 percent chance every day of heavy precipitation.</p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s6\"><strong>Wild Hunger.</strong> Within 1 mile of the lair, creatures always feel ravenously hungry, no matter how much they’ve eaten. A creature that finishes a long rest in this area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. A creature that doesn’t require food succeeds automatically.</span></p><p class=\"p5\">If the Wild Titan dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</p><hr /><h1><span class=\"s1\">Familiars</span></h1><p class=\"p2\">The creatures presented in this section are special beings who can form bonds with another and serve as a familiar—not just for a spellcaster, but for anyone. This bond creates a deep, magical connection and isn’t entered into lightly by these familiars. They demand respectful treatment, but in return offer loyal companionship and service. If the familiar is mistreated or wronged, it can sever the bond and may become a thorn in the side of their former companion.</p><p class=\"p3\">Learning to form a familiar bond with one of these creatures isn’t necessarily common knowledge, and you can treat discovering how to perform the ritual as a secret, as discussed in the “Monster Secrets” section in the Appendix A introduction.</p><p class=\"p3\"><em><strong>Familiar Bond.</strong></em> When a creature performs a 10-minute ritual using materials worth at least 100 gp (noted in each familiar’s subtitle), the familiar can form a magical bond with that creature to serve as its familiar. The bond ends when the creature dies, or when the familiar decides to end it (no action required). While the bond lasts, the creature and the familiar gain the following benefits:</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Bonded Sympathy.</strong> The familiar can choose to exclude the bonded creature from any area of effect it creates, such as a damaging sphere or the goatstealer’s Stench trait. Additionally, if the familiar has another feature that creates a bond (such as the devil’s glove’s Symbiosis bonus action), that bond forms as part of the familiar bond.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Channel Magic.</strong> When the bonded creature casts a spell with a range of touch while within 100 feet of the familiar, the familiar can use its reaction to deliver the touch when the spell is cast.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Telepathic Connection.</strong> While the bonded creature and the familiar are within 100 feet of each other, they can communicate telepathically. Additionally, as a bonus action, the creature can see and hear through the familiar’s senses until the start of its next turn, gaining the benefit of any special senses the familiar has.</p><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Revival.</strong> If the familiar dies while the bond exists, the bonded creature can restore the familiar to life with all its hit points by performing a 1-hour version of the Familiar Bond ritual (no further research required to learn this version).</p><hr /><h2><span class=\"s2\">@UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-bestiary.Actor.tVIL7O6UEFgPmWev]{Corn Dolly}</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;float:left\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20monster/FAMILIAR_Corn_Dolly.webp\" width=\"200\" /><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\"><em>Grain Husk Companion (Curved blade plated in gold)</em></span></p><p class=\"p7\"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Any</p><p class=\"p2\">Crafted from dried husks and bound with twine, corn dollies’ delicate forms are stitched together with rustic care.

The Constructs are spirits of deceased Humanoids drawn to the hollow corn husk shell, seeking refuge. These spirits retain faint traces of who they once were—a protective instinct entwined with a simmering fury.

While he brings joy to the townsfolk, Chuckles delights in mocking the characters, belittling their previous exploits, and even attacking villagers they care about, so long as it brings them one step closer to killing him. The characters’ goals are:</p><ul><li><p class=\"p7\">Play carnival games to earn tickets.</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Rescue the forced revelers through tickets or combat or by severing their enchantments.</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Free Phillip and Adela Druskenvald from their forced revelry.</p></li><li><p class=\"p7\">Destroy Chuckles, the Lord of Fools.</p></li></ul><p class=\"p5\">Before running this chapter, you should review Wickermoor Hollow’s townsfolk (see “Forced Revelers” below) to decide the most compelling NPCs to include in this chapter.

He dances and cavorts as the malevolent jester of the Horned King, tormenting mortals for his master’s vile amusement. Chuckles’s true form is a grotesque balloon with a leering clown’s face, draped in multicolored ribbons, usually resting atop a maypole. This totem projects a puppet-like jester illusion that calls itself Chuckles, luring victims into a false sense of security.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Tears of a Clown</span></h2><img style=\"border:none;margin:0 0 10px 10px;float:right\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20npc/NPC_Chuckles.webp\" width=\"300\" /><p class=\"p5\">Once, long ago, a troupe of performers roamed the lands of Druskenvald. Each had their role: Bjorn the Horned Bear, Apia the Queen Bee, Chateau the Dancing Manor, Libro the Singing Tome, Cloche the Chiming Bell, and Cicogna the Stilted Stork. Leading them all was Chuckles the Great Fool.</p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">Though Chuckles played the merry fool on stage, his heart was heavy, for his troupe, though beloved, was starving and impoverished. Clowning brought little coin. His tears caught the attention of the woman with a crooked smile, who whispered of a wonderful king who could erase his troubles if he would become his jester.</span></p><p class=\"p8\">Desperate, Chuckles followed the Crooked Queen into the Wytchwood and communed with the Horned King, whose power grew each year. Chuckles, driven by despair, would do anything for his troupe.</p><p class=\"p8\">“Anything?” asked the Horned King.</p><p class=\"p8\">“Anything,” said Chuckles, foolishly.</p><p class=\"p8\">“Forever?” asked the Horned King.</p><p class=\"p8\">“Forever,” said Chuckles, sealing his doom.</p><p class=\"p8\">Chuckles is now nothing more than a spirit dancing futilely at the right hand of the Horned King, yearning for death’s sweet release. If Chuckles frees his king, he too is set free. For ages, he has danced, waiting for the Fallen to be sacrificed. Now, he has arranged to be the final sacrifice for the Horned King, just as Adela Druskenvald will be for the Crooked Queen.</p><p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s7\">This masterstroke will prepare the Horned King’s spirit for incarnation through Phillip Druskenvald (see chapter 8), releasing Chuckles from his cursed servitude and letting him dance into the night one last time.</span></p><h2><span class=\"s5\">Parley with THE FOOL</span></h2><p class=\"p5\">The Lord of Fools views life as a cruel, endless joke, trapped in a wretched role as the Horned King’s jester. He craves not just the characters’ participation in his games but their hatred. Their wrath and other deadly sins are the true feast for the Horned King.</p><p class=\"p8\">These are some responses to common questions the characters may ask of this wicked clown:</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Who Are You?</strong> “Sweet sweeties, I’m Chuckles the Great Fool! There isn’t a person alive who doesn’t love my japes ‘n jokes. So if you don’t… then you must already be dead!”</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>How Do You Know Us?</strong> “Why wouldn’t we know who you are? You’re known far and wide as the heroes who are finally cleaning up Wickymoor Hollow!” (Chuckles is an agent of the Horned King and has been using <em>Scrying</em> to observe the characters.)</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Why Are You Happy to See Us?</strong> “I’m a kooky-crazy clown, sillies! And it’s festy-val time! Can’t I enjoy my own party?” (The characters are his only hope of escaping his torturous existence as the Horned King’s jester!)</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>What is this Festival?</strong> “Fool’s Day is a way to escape the sad-sad-suffering of this sad-sad-world. Don’t you want people to be happy? Besides, this year’s festy-val is speci-all.” (Fool’s Day is an age-old tradition, but this one is special.)</p><p class=\"p10\"><strong>Special, Huh?</strong> “Because of you, my hip-hip-heroes! You’re the guests of honor! The cream of the crop! The slayers of the fabulous Fallen! We’ve never had killers like you in our midst!” (This is the unvarnished truth. Even if it’s omitting the bit about the ritual.)</p><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/the-crooked-moon-2014/assets/art/art%20book/ADV_FOOLS_Seeking%20out%20the%20Revelers_Finished-LARGE%20VERSION.webp\" /></div>"
