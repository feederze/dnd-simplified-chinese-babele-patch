          "text": "<p>Twenty-two lairs that you can drop right into your campaign have arrived. Each is a home to a unique villain and is filled with lackeys, hazards, traps, and a treasure hoard with unique rewards. Every lair has been optimized to present a fun challenge for five player characters of a specific level, indicated in the lair's description and on the Lairs by Level table.</p>\n<p>The lairs are presented in ascending order of their challenge.</p>\n\n<h2>Maps</h2>\n<p>Each lair has a map that indicates all hidden information, like traps and secret doors. Digital versions of these maps (along with player versions that don't include the secrets) are included with your purchase of this book.</p>\n\n<h2>Cardinal Directions</h2>\n<p>Most lair maps include a compass rose, even if the location is on a plane other than the Mundane World. Most planes of @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00best01.JournalEntryPage.00bestiary000000#the-timescape]{The Timescape} are circular planets as well as planes, so they have a north, south, east, and west. But for the rare planes without cardinal directions, the compass rose is still included to make interpreting the map easier.</p>\n\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.Eo4nBFtBfUvHFXB9]</p>\n\n<h2>Area Descriptions</h2>\n<p>Each lair area begins with bullet points that overview the room's most important features, giving you all the information you need to run that area upfront. Some of these are meant to be shared with players, while others are for the GM's eyes only, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“If you see a description in quotation marks like this, read or paraphrase it to the players when their characters first enter the area — provided they can sense their surroundings properly. This text describes what the characters immediately notice.”</li>\n  <li><em>(If the characters did X in area Y…)</em> “If a quotation starts with a parenthetical condition like this, only read or paraphrase it to players if those conditions apply.”</li>\n  <li><strong>(Secret)</strong> If a bullet starts with this parenthetical subheading, don't read it aloud! This description contains information for the GM, and it shouldn't be revealed to players until their characters investigate the area further. Hidden creatures, traps, and more could be presented this way.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<aside class=\"help\">\n  <p>On each map, the rooms have a Note placed onto the map. It is advised for the GM to turn on Notes Display; to do this, go to the <i class=\"fa-solid fa-bookmark\"></i> Journal Notes layer and make sure <i class=\"fa-solid fa-map-pin\"></i> Toggle Notes Display is enabled.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<h2>Treasure Hoards</h2>\n<p>The bulk of a lair's treasure is in a hoard listed at the end of the lair. Each treasure hoard includes a unique magic or psionic item and another unique reward, such as a recipe for a new poison.</p>\n<p>Treasures not included in the hoard are sprinkled throughout the lair. These appear in the “Treasure” subheading of the area where they are found.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"help\">\n  <p>Many of the adventures in this module include enrichers that aid you in viewing a passive skill of the party. This requires that the party is set up with a Party actor. To do this, create a new actor of the \"Group\" type in the <i class=\"fa-solid fa-user\"></i> Actor directory on the right, then drag-and-drop the player characters into it. Make sure the group actor is also set to \"Party\".</p>\n  <p>Once this is done, right-click the group actor and select the “<i class=\"fa-solid fa-star\"></i> Set as Primary Party” option. You will now be able to easily see who passes the DC of a passive check when hovering over the enrichers! You can test it seeing who has a [[/skill perception 20 passive format=long]].</p>\n  <p>As an added bonus, this party actor can also be the target of the Award enrichers, acting as a group fund for the party. For example, you can click here to grant the party, or individual characters, a single copper piece: [[/award 1cp]].</p>\n</aside>\n\n<table>\n  <caption>\n    Lairs by Level\n  </caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Optimized Level</th>\n      <th>Lair</th>\n      <th>Lair Boss</th>\n      <th>Boss Ancestry</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2nd</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.mz9CLygNijShHkm6]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.G5Nt2ygGX23dvwre]</td>\n      <td>Goblin</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3rd</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.QaXzXklsLxoHQBb4]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.4upTFOYk32kxwJrv]</td>\n      <td>Orc</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.6bUgCYmaKC3jYO5C]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.cFAqqlAH6dBBXIce]</td>\n      <td>Hag</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.Oe5WqOG3iomoiyFn]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.7DnFCsafgoIwwG0X]</td>\n      <td>Human</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.YFI9ag720kCpF7hk]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.VeB0SC2kLdxwo3oC]</td>\n      <td>Hobgoblin</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.GPjlHknxBp9pG1dm]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.kqhSbKFzNLB5RRHF]</td>\n      <td>Incorporeal Undead</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.UqJJdDZesYgRI2H7]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.d7Gaj3Ae3m6TrkX9]</td>\n      <td>Medusa</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.GTvgKNuyJVzpLaif]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.kJ3qzEL81312ljGj]</td>\n      <td>Fire Giant</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.MbwqnFHhplZYSXQA]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.omAZph43cPSoJaMJ]</td>\n      <td>Olothec</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.57E25yc3ebZUuvfO]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.BNpAFVGyzOlJQZP8]</td>\n      <td>Overmind</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>11th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.2mf21k77W6nAws0G]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.xs7gBfuaWerZWwBy]{Aurumvas}</td>\n      <td>Demon</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>11th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.ui82A4R0yHLL9Pmz]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.5NOtk8JJQKZd4it5]</td>\n      <td>Mummy</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>12th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.QMLSuqM1abO5Xje1]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.GZ7eCQrqfgmJ07cp]</td>\n      <td>Voiceless Talker</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>13th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.0auRADM5o6FtIM4G]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.BQ6Wr45R4wwfFttf]</td>\n      <td>Devil</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>13th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.JgstXmKWQux5HdE6]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.saJzilrk4WCmIz39]</td>\n      <td>Vampire</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>14th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.37SLPUXtQ7VtyBoJ]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.SqkLKLmDDeDmj8ul]</td>\n      <td>Dragon</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>15th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.DFWOLroI3eNTPrwR]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.gqiFSANZtBT0RvLG]</td>\n      <td>Dragon</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>16th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.d8nB5UtPH0IccZi4]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.UCnLxAvHE1VAiVrv]</td>\n      <td>Dragon</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>17th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.O8uzkmIkXCQHN6yu]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.HuVpJEPh3RWvO0zF]</td>\n      <td>Dragon</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>18th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.iXLwWiVhQT1VC1d5]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.ZXGPGnVJ5MRUzX2R]</td>\n      <td>Dragon</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>19th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.iPuZs5zydN0M0npR]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.WtpGZJ4PIEvzGLG6]</td>\n      <td>Elemental</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>20th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.Ir0aLSUaw52CSTLp]</td>\n      <td>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.NP3Nuxvh9QLGw1uR]</td>\n      <td>Lich</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"

These items conjure allies who can be immediately enhanced by the summoner, increasing the item's value and effect to the elementals who use them. Some elementals might also use items that create a damaging area of effect if their allies are immune to the damage's type. For instance, a force of iron who forms an ishkrar with several cruxes of fire and fire sparks can use a <em>necklace of fireballs</em> or the Shooting Stars effect of a <em>ring of shooting stars</em> without fear of harming their allies.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.WDlcBehJ41Ms0OlK]</p>\n\n<h2>Essence of Mist</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00essenceofmis00 inline]</p>\n<h2>Essence of Storms</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00essenceofsto00 inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.qebXpgzxAELZebbL]</p>\n<h2>Essence of Tides</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00essenceoftid00 inline]</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Content Warning: Blood and Suffocation</h3>\n  <p>The force of blood, blood seneschal, and essence of mist manipulate the blood and breath of their enemies.

This includes some not found in this section of the book, like the fossil cryptic in the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00envi01.JournalEntryPage.00cave0000000000] environment. When you build an encounter with elementals, pay special attention to their bonus action options. That way, when initiative is rolled, you'll already know how each elemental can aid their allies.</p>\n  <p>Many elementals can use only their convocation once or twice per day. It's best to use these options at the start of an encounter instead of waiting for later rounds of combat, since an elemental could perish before they get the chance to do their cool thing.</p>\n  <p>You can create unique elementals by swapping one convocation for another. For instance, you could create an essence of storms who is infused with air and earth properties by trading the creature's Convocation of Air for the force of earth's Convocation of Earth. You could even rename the creature the essence of sandstorms.</p>\n  <p>When you swap the convocations of two elementals, pay close attention to each creature's challenge rating. You'll likely want to adjust the numbers for damage, saving throw DCs, and other effects to better match the stat block you're using. Look at that creature's original convocation to get some target numbers.</p>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Elemental Retainers and Companions</h3>\n  <p>This book presents two elemental retainers who are fully sapient (like most other elementals in this section).

These giants understand that their skills in battle complement one another. Marble giants wade into battle alongside basalt and granite giants. In times of peace, different stone giant groups share new secrets of rune magic and trade with one another.</p>\n  <p>This may leave you wanting more stone giants than the three in this book. You can create new stone giant stat blocks by taking a non-stone giant stat block from this section, giving it the stone giant's False Appearance and Stone Flesh traits, and giving it resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from mundane attacks that aren't adamantine. Then pick a type of stone you think fits the new stat block, and you're done! For instance, you could modify the fire giant red fist to create an obsidian giant, or you could use the frost giant wind sprinter to make a zircon giant.</p>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Giant Lairs</h3>\n  <p>Giant lairs are filled with clothing, furniture, tools, weapons, and even treasure that is sized for beings over 15 feet tall. The inside of a giant's lair should make the players feel as though their characters have shrunk as they navigate familiar setups, such as a mead hall, from a new perspective. Normally trivial activities, like grabbing an amulet off a table, become herculean tasks that require planning, preparation, and risk of bodily harm! This change of pace is fantastic fun.</p>\n  <p>You can use the following guidelines to help you create challenges in a giant's lair.</p>\n  <p>\n    <em><strong>Ceilings.</strong></em> The ceilings in a giant's lair should be at least 20 feet high to allow the giant plenty of space to move around without needing to squeeze.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <em><strong>Climbing Furniture.</strong></em> A character can climb a piece of furniture in a giant's lair with a successful [[/skill athletics 15]] check.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <em><strong>Doorways and Halls.</strong></em> The doorways and halls in a giant's lair should be at least 15 feet wide so the giant can comfortably move down the halls without squeezing. If multiple giants live in the lair, consider making the halls even wider to accommodate multiple giants at once. Likewise, doorways should be at least 15 feet tall.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <em><strong>Giant Potions.</strong></em> Giant-sized potions have the same amount of magic in a greater amount of liquid. A Medium or smaller creature must use three actions to consume the potion. The potion takes effect after the third action is used to consume it. If more than 1 minute passes between actions used to consume the potion, the potion loses its magic and has no effect.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <em><strong>Giant Scrolls.</strong></em> A scroll must be unrolled before it can be read. A Medium or smaller creature can unroll a giant-sized scroll as an action.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <em><strong>Object Dimensions and Weights.</strong></em> Objects sized for giants have dimensions that are typically two to three times the size of the human equivalent and weigh about eight times as much. Using encumbrance rules in giant lairs helps the characters figure out how many of a frost giant jarl's gold busts they can carry.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <em><strong>Opening Doors.</strong></em> Large, Medium, and Small creatures can open a door in a giant's lair as an action. Tiny creatures can't open the doors. If the door is latched or locked, the latch or lock is 10 feet above the floor. A Medium or smaller character can climb up to it with a successful [[/skill athletics 17]] check.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <em><strong>Stairs.</strong></em> Stairs in giant lairs count as difficult terrain for Medium and smaller creatures.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <em><strong>Traps.</strong></em> Giants often craft traps meant to keep out other enemy giants as well as smaller folk. As such, their traps often affect larger areas. Their flame jets shoot wider and higher than humanoid traps, their pits are deeper, and their scythes cut at multiple heights.\n  </p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.tFnWredrSzBLkRY5]</p>\n\n<h1>Stat Blocks</h1>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.GFby73S3whuJo52T]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.0XnG43Zy5U5njbxK]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.dDSN7y1khcafxs3d]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.kJ3qzEL81312ljGj]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.3Pn0c44ekmC6R1Kv]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.S43Dm9FsYquFqpCY]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.kPZfJGupiBHLe4ZM]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.69IjiOIcZILRwU9z]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.v9gDu1ygZAR9wA2k]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.fDpp0wLlHt3QXCB0]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.0FE4K9eqLXPnj8CC]</p>"

We found out during playtesting that they worked a little too well together after these little lizards murdered several dozen player characters. As a result, we reduced the power of the kobolds quite a bit, but a squad of these small dragons is still a formidable force against squishy 1st-level characters. One unlucky critical hit against a 1st-level wizard spells that hero's doom.</p>\n  <p>When employing these kobolds against a 1st-level party, use the kobolds with a challenge rating of 1 or lower (unless you're looking to make things deadly). Save the artifex and shieldscale dragonlin for the next adventure! We also recommend using no more non-minion kobolds than there are characters in a single encounter. If you want 1st-level characters battling it out against an entire kobold legion, that's what the tiro is for.</p>\n  <p>Oh, that reminds us, if you want to playtest future MCDM products and see what killer creatures we create next, join our Discord community by going to <a href=\"http://mcdm.gg/discord\">mcdm.gg/discord</a>.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.LuFvRciwshuBvsyk]</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Running an Artifex</h3>\n  <p>The artifex's shenanigans are more believable if they're waiting at the battlefield when the characters arrive — the idea is that the artifex is triggering traps they have already set. How they trigger traps is up to you. They could throw their chain hook to pull hidden levers, use a wand or mechanical contraption, or even yell commands to other kobolds toiling in tunnels under the battlefield.</p>\n  <p>You can increase an encounter's difficulty by giving the artifex allies who can push characters into the traps, or by staging the combat in tight quarters so the traps are more likely to hit multiple characters.</p>\n  <p>You can decrease an encounter's difficulty by reducing the size of the traps, by placing the traps in predetermined areas and letting characters make ability checks to detect them, or by staging the combat in an open area where the characters can spread out.</p>\n  <p>If the characters dare to challenge a kobold legion in their own lair, an artifex makes an excellent leader of the defense. Give the artifex a way of seeing throughout the lair, such as a network of mirrors, and let them trigger traps anywhere within the lair.</p>\n  <p>Lairs let you deploy traps that wouldn't make sense in open combat, such as:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>A tripwire that sends a boulder rolling down the hallway.</li>\n    <li>A tightrope over a lava pool and a concealed kobold on the other side waiting to cut the rope.</li>\n    <li>A pool of blood that conceals a few @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.HB3gb6h57Nh1UDjr]{Blood-Borne Oozes}.</li>\n    <li>Maze-like corridors and moving false walls that disorient the characters and lead them toward an ambush.</li>\n  </ul>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Upholding High Standards</h3>\n  <p>No legion would let their glorious standard lie trampled beneath the boots of their enemies.

To aid in customizing the animals in this section — or even creating new ones — some creatures are accompanied by tables of optional features you can add to their stat blocks. These features are often based on real-world creatures the stat block can represent, and the table gives examples of those creature varieties.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Challenge Rating Adjustments.</strong></em> If an optional feature increases a creature's challenge rating, this is indicated in parentheses at the end of that feature. If a creature's original CR was less than 1 and you select a feature that adds 1 to their CR, their CR increases to 1 regardless of whether their original CR was 0, 1/8, 1/4, or 1/2.\n</p>\n<p>Since optional features increase a creature's power, they shouldn't be added to a companion creature without the GM's permission. This applies even to features that don't impact their official challenge rating.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Repurposing Stat Blocks.</strong></em> You can use these tables to inspire the creation of various animals in your fantasy world — perhaps a certain island is home to bears who have webbed feet and can breathe underwater while hunting aquatic prey, or maybe a powerful devil is accompanied by an infernal lion who exhales gouts of flame.\n</p>\n<p>You can also reflavor stat blocks and optional features to represent other real-world creatures. For example, an albatross isn't technically a bird of prey, but you can make an excellent albatross stat block by using a @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.kr9aYfG0EjjbPDLm] with the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.features.Item.HzZst44ZAlQ3m9G4] and @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.features.Item.z4EPBDRroIv0yEix] features from the Optional Bird of Prey Features table.

While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the snowfox senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other.

Allowing the Animal Handling skill to influence wild beasts increases the versatility of a skill with a very limited number of uses in a typical game. It may be that you allow any character to attempt to use the skill to influence wild animals or that you restrict this special use to specific characters connected to nature, like druids and rangers.</p>\n  <p>If you do allow Animal Handling to be used to influence wild animals, remember that skills aren't magic. The same way a single successful Charisma (Persuasion) check isn't likely to turn a hostile bandit who wants to kill you into an ally ready to fight by your side, a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can't turn a wolf the barbarian just punched in the face into a loyal pet. But it might convince the wolf to scurry off in search of easier prey.</p>\n</aside>"

Using multiple types of bugbears at once can increase the GM's mental load and make it easy to forget things in combat. Before running a combat with three different bugbears, you may wish to get a feel for how they affect battle by trying one bugbear with other allies, like goblins or hobgoblins.</p>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Bugbear Tactics</h3>\n  <p>Most bugbears prefer to start a fight with an ambush. They pick a spot where they know their foe will pass through, set the area with traps, then hide with their allies and wait. When it's time to strike, a bugbear positions themself and moves as necessary so that as many allies as possible benefit from their Bugbear's Inspiration trait.</p>\n  <p>When commanding others, bugbears coordinate their allies to focus fire on healers first so that the rest of their foes go down more quickly. If losing a battle, bugbears retreat to a secondary location, where they can hide and spring out to gain the upper hand against any pursuers. These secondary locations are stocked with potions and ammunition and guarded by traps.</p>\n</aside>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Bugbear Magic Items</h3>\n  <p>Bugbears benefit from magic items that enhance their stealth capabilities, such as the <em>cloak of elvenkind</em> or <em>potion of invisibility</em>. Since bugbears position themselves in battle to be close to their allies, magic items that provide benefits to nearby companions, such as the <em>rod of alertness</em> or a <em>spell scroll</em> of <em>mass healing word</em>, make excellent choices.</p>\n  <p>Bugbears are generous with their magic items. Before a battle, a bugbear may lend or even gift one of their items to an ally who can make better use of it. During a fight, a bugbear might toss a potion or magic weapon to a cornered ally. A bugbear whose defeat is imminent could quickly cast off a magic shield or scroll so a friend can grab the item before their enemies.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.YGmng9BOgasoC355]</p>\n\n<h1>Stat Blocks</h1>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.LYsG2YY9hqyPKY3B]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.QhIxjgGCKR5APQld]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.oJ6dIPGUhKjqoaQS]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.gPW2P24TaefCjcKF]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.yXPGYFtQzdWyhbym]</p>\n\n<h2>Retainers</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.xWeqsEZKamcaY6Pd]</p>"

These fuel their bloodthirsty powers, and while starved for souls, a demon can scarcely think.</p>\n\n<h3>Soul Count</h3>\n<p>A demon's stat block states the number of souls a given demon has already consumed at the beginning of combat. This number is presented right under their hit points in a similar fashion.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"help\">\n  <p>You can adjust the formula used for the initial number of souls a demon has by unlocking an NPC sheet. You can then click the \"Formula\" button to roll the amount automatically.</p>\n  <p>You can use this feature for Demons of your own making by enabling it in the \"Special Traits\" menu!</p>\n</aside>\n\n<h3>Soul Devourer</h3>\n<p>Demons can gain more souls by slaying other creatures, as described in their Soul Devourer trait. Unlike hit points, there is no maximum limit to a demon's soul count.</p>\n\n<h3>Soul-Fueled Power</h3>\n<p>Most demons have one or more features that require souls to use.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Passive Traits.</em></strong> Passive traits automatically take effect after a demon's soul count crosses the threshold described in that trait. The trait remains active until the demon's soul count drops below the threshold, and the trait reactivates when the demon's soul count equals or exceeds it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Active Features.</em></strong> During an encounter, a demon can burn souls to use or enhance certain abilities. When they do, their soul count decreases by the number indicated. This cost is sometimes noted in parentheses at the beginning of an ability, such as “(Costs 1 Soul).” Other times, the text of the ability itself describes it, such as saying “the demon can burn 1 soul” for an additional effect.</p>\n\n<h3>Lethe</h3>\n<p>When a demon's soul count drops to 0, they fall into a state known as lethe — a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume. See a demon's Lethe trait for more information.</p>\n\n<h3>Soulsight</h3>\n<p>Demons have a special sense called soulsight, allowing them to perceive each creature, other than Constructs and Undead, within a certain radius. Soulsight doesn't rely on sight but counts as “seeing” for features that require sight. Neither physical objects (including total cover) nor supernatural effects can impede soulsight unless otherwise stated. A demon's stat block lists the radius of their soulsight under “Senses.”</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Adjusting Lethality</h3>\n  <p>Soul devouring makes demons deadly opponents. To give characters a better chance of living through their encounter with a demon, you can reduce the DC of the saving throw — or you can remove the saving throw entirely, and only allow a demon to devour a soul when a creature dies within 60 feet of them through other means. On the other hand, you might like to scale up the deadliness with more powerful demons! If so, instead of always using a DC 11 saving throw, you can set the DC equal to 8 + the demon's proficiency bonus.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.dSUAyN1Eo3zjiy5x]</p>\n\n<h2>Demonic Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>Mortal scholars classify demons in nine categories — the higher a demon's category, the more powerful the fiend. Though demons don't use these classifications themselves, scholars are correct that demons have a hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.</p>\n<p>Each time a demon consumes a soul, there's a chance they may evolve into a more powerful demon. Though Category 1 demons typically become Category 2 demons after consuming just one soul, there's no known pattern to how more powerful demons evolve. For example, some Category 2 demons evolve to Category 3 after consuming just one soul, while others must devour thousands before earning a promotion. This evolution can be instant, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether these evolutions are aided by consuming souls that are especially corrupt or heroic.</p>\n<p>The following sections describe the most common types of Category 1-5 demons, though there are many other types of demons within these categories.</p>\n<h2>Pitling</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00pitling0000000 inline]</p>\n<h2>Ruinant</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00ruinant0000000 inline]</p>\n<h2>Tormenauk</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00tormenauk00000 inline]</p>\n<h2>Wobalas</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00wobalas0000000 inline]</p>\n<h2>Chimeron</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00chimeron000000 inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.GLjYeDHaPjXY50qI]</p>\n<h2>Category 6 and Beyond</h2>\n<p>After devouring thousands of souls, a demon who reaches Category 6 develops a unique form and individual identity — the latter of which persists through future evolutions.

These rituals are costly and dangerous, and those determined to see it through are typically desperate, driven, or simply foolish. This section explains the rules for summoning devils, the costs involved, and the consequences of such a ritual.</p>\n<h2>The Ritual</h2>\n<p>To perform a ritual to summon a devil, a creature must meet the following requirements.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Material Components.</strong></em> The ritual requires the following material components, which are consumed regardless of whether the ritual succeeds:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>500 gp worth of brimstone</li>\n  <li>500 gp worth of obsidian</li>\n  <li>250 gp worth of magical incense, chalk, and candles</li>\n  <li>125 gp worth of Celestial blood, blessed by a priest (if such blood is unavailable, the priest can bless 250 gp worth of Humanoid blood in its place)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Personal Sacrifice.</strong></em> A creature who attempts to summon a devil must sacrifice their vitality as follows, regardless of whether the ritual succeeds:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The summoner rolls a number of d10s equal to their level or challenge rating (minimum of 1) and loses hit points equal to the result.</li>\n  <li>The summoner also expends half their maximum Hit Dice with no effect. (If the summoner has less than half their maximum Hit Dice available, they can't perform this ritual until they regain enough Hit Dice.) Hit Dice expended in this way can't be regained until the <em>greater restoration</em> spell is cast on the summoner twice within the same hour, or by means of a <em>wish</em> spell.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Ritual Length.</strong></em> When summoning a devil, a creature can perform either an instantaneous or hour-long ritual.\n</p>\n<p>A desperate creature can use their action to perform an instantaneous ritual, which has a greater chance of failure. However, the exacting steps performed in an hour-long ritual reduce the summon check DC by 3.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>True Name.</strong></em> A creature who knows a devil's true name can speak it aloud when performing the ritual. Invoking a devil's true name reduces the summon check DC by 5, and if the ritual succeeds, it summons the specific devil whose name was spoken.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Summon Check.</strong></em> To finish the ritual, a creature must make a summon check. This is a DC 18 Charisma check, though the DC decreases if the summoner performs an hour-long ritual or uses a devil's true name. @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00best01.JournalEntryPage.00devils00000000#ritual-consequences]{Ritual Consequences} details the results of a successful or failed summon check.\n</p>\n<p>Another creature can assist the summoner with the ritual by taking the Help action. They are branded with the same infernal rune as the summoner, as described in @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00best01.JournalEntryPage.00devils00000000#ritual-consequences]{Ritual Consequences}.</p>\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.ihCb7YdQ4vuFs6rr]</p>\n\n<h2>Ritual Consequences</h2>\n<p>Succeed or fail, summoning a devil has weighty consequences.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Branded.</strong></em> Succeed or fail, a creature who attempts or assists in a summoning ritual is branded by an infernal rune on a prominent part of their body, such as their head, chest, or back. This rune marks them as someone who has tried to summon a devil. Communities and individuals who recognize the meaning of the rune may treat the summoner with fear, suspicion, or contempt.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Success.</strong></em> If a creature succeeds on the summon check, roll on or choose from the Summoned Devil table to determine what type of devil is summoned (unless the summoner spoke a devil's true name during the ritual, thereby summoning that specific devil). At the GM's discretion, other devil types can be summoned instead.\n</p>\n<p>A successful ritual binds the devil to a contract with the summoner. The devil must help the summoner with a specific task, such as finishing the current battle or aiding in a single quest objective. At the GM's discretion, a devil may be willing to extend the contract, but this has additional consequences for the summoner's soul and requires further payment, often in the form of favors.</p>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.tables.RollTable.erHhZL4gCetRqfZn caption=false rollable]</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Failure.</strong></em> If a creature fails the summon check by 4 or fewer, no devil is summoned.\n</p>\n<p>If a creature fails the summon check by 5 or more, a devil is summoned as in the “Success” section, but the fiend isn't contractually bound to the summoner and can act as they please. At the GM's discretion, the devil could still offer a contract — one that asks much of the summoner.</p>\n<p>If a creature fails the summon check by 10 or more, they suffer the consequences of failing by 5 or more, and an additional planar entity — such as a demon, an Elemental, or a Celestial — is also summoned. This additional entity is hostile toward the summoner.</p>\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.fJM8xXzDb7Py3ALg]</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Finding Components and True Names</h3>\n  <p>Most of the material components required for summoning devils can be purchased at churches or magic shops. The characters might also come across these components in a cult hideout, an abandoned wizard's tower, or the lair of any creature who has cause to consort with fiends.</p>\n  <p>Characters might discover a devil's true name in a dusty tome after months of research, or they could hear it from the lips of a lesser devil with a score to settle. If you're using the domain rules in <a href=\"https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/kingdoms-warfare\">Kingdoms &amp; Warfare</a>, the characters can discover a devil's true name with a successful Lore test (DC equals 10 + the devil's challenge rating).</p>\n</aside>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the end we got Zalkith's devil-lieutenant to switch sides.

The design team still really liked the stat block's mechanics, so we changed the lore and adjusted some language and, voilà, the marsh hydra was born.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Rot Angel</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00rotangel000000 inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.v3zdRQNClrunX88R]</p>\n<h2>Swamp Dryad</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe03.JournalEntryPage.00swampdryad0000 inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.HR1LJmHyN4gZLLaC]</p>\n\n<h1>Stat Blocks</h1>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.JJPuT7rIo7hPsZCx]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.Dm1Tmsw691vgBHPq]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.jB2TpdM5YL5rtTXa]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.CRRohp2FdInD6cEG]</p>"

Each companion's <em>ferocity</em> is a measure of their tenacity and fury, and of how those things build in battle. As a companion's ferocity increases, they gain access to powerful new actions, but they also become more difficult for a caregiver to control.</p>\n<p>If a companion isn't incapacitated at the start of their and their caregiver's turn, their ferocity increases by 1d4 + the number of enemies the companion can see or hear within 5 feet of them. For the purpose of increasing ferocity, a group of creatures who share a single stat block (such as a swarm of rats) counts as one creature. Ferocity increases round after round during combat, and there is no maximum to the level of ferocity a companion can gain.</p>\n\n<h3>Rampage</h3>\n<p>After rolling to increase ferocity at the start of their turn, if a companion has 10 ferocity or more and isn't incapacitated, they run the risk of entering a <em>rampage</em>. The companion's caregiver can make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check (no action required) to try to stop the companion from entering a rampage. To make the check, the caregiver must not be incapacitated, and the companion must be able to see or hear the caregiver. The DC for the check equals 5 + the companion's ferocity. On a success, the companion acts normally on their turn. On a failure, or if the caregiver doesn't make the check, the companion enters a rampage.</p>\n<p>When a companion enters a rampage, they immediately move up to their speed toward the nearest creature they can sense and attack that creature with their signature attack, dealing extra damage equal to half their ferocity if the attack hits. If at least one ally and one enemy are nearest and equidistant to the companion, the caregiver's player rolls any die. On an odd number, the companion attacks an ally. On an even number, the companion attacks an enemy. The caregiver's player determines which specific equidistant ally or enemy the companion engages (and can choose their own character if they wish).</p>\n<p>A companion who can't reach a creature to attack while in a rampage uses the Dash action to move as far as they can toward the nearest creature they can sense. If a companion can't sense any potential targets, they move as far as they can in a random direction determined by the GM, avoiding danger.</p>\n<p>When a companion who has entered a rampage resolves their action or ends their turn, their ferocity drops to 0 and they're no longer in a rampage.</p>\n\n<h3>Reducing Ferocity</h3>\n<p>To prevent a companion from entering a dangerous rampage, a caregiver has several options at their disposal for reducing the creature's ferocity.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Ferocity Actions.</strong></em> Each companion has three actions in their stat block that cost ferocity to use. To use one of these ferocity actions, the caregiver's character level must be equal to or greater than the ferocity action's level, and the companion must spend the necessary amount of ferocity before they use the action. If the companion doesn't have enough ferocity to spend, they can't use the action.\n</p>\n<p>Ferocity actions always use the companion's action, meaning they can't be used as part of an opportunity attack. Ferocity actions can't be used while a companion is in a rampage.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>End of Combat.</strong></em> When a combat encounter involving a companion ends and the companion isn't dying, the companion regains hit points equal to their ferocity, and their ferocity drops to 0. The GM determines when a combat encounter ends, typically at the point when creatures stop acting in initiative order.\n</p>"

As somewhat more social versions of wild creatures, companions are often cleverer and more versatile than their untamed counterparts.</p>\n\n<h3>Hit Dice</h3>\n<p>Most creatures without character classes have their Hit Die type determined by their size (d4 for Tiny creatures, d6 for Small creatures, and so forth). However, companions are special and use a d8 for Hit Dice regardless of size.</p>\n\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>A companion shares a unique bond with their caregiver and can understand basic commands in one language chosen by the caregiver. However, the companion can't read, speak, or write any language, even if similar creatures normally can.</p>\n\n<h3>Proficiency Bonus</h3>\n<p>Because a companion's effectiveness and survivability depend on the training and expertise of their caregiver, a companion's proficiency bonus is equal to their caregiver's proficiency bonus. Additionally, some of a companion's statistics refer to their proficiency bonus, abbreviated as PB. Other statistics use a number of dice equal to a companion's proficiency bonus; these are expressed with PB in place of the number of dice. For example, if a companion has a +2 proficiency bonus, PBd6 means 2d6.</p>\n\n<h3>Signature Attack</h3>\n<p>Each companion has an action designated as their <em>signature attack</em>. A signature attack is always a melee attack, and it's typically the creature's best natural attack. A companion uses their signature attack when they enter a rampage.</p>\n<p>Each companion also has special actions that they can use only by spending ferocity during their turn, with some of those actions making use of the companion's signature attack.

Some elementals contain just one of these components, but the greatest embody multiple as creatures of ash, blood, ice, and similar reagents.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Duality of Form.</em></strong> Elementals are mercurial creatures of transformation, creation, and destruction. Though the deities first created the Mundane World, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn't suit an elemental, they break it down with fire, wind, or another element, then build it anew.</p>\n<p>Elementals themselves also change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are knights wrought of iron, lizards ablaze with fire, and angels of pure sunlight.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Rebirth and Reformation.</em></strong> When an elemental dies in the Mundane World, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain strength. Should the spirit return to the Mundane World, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reactive Harmony.</em></strong> Each elemental can bolster themself or another elemental with the primordial power they embody.

When the elementals sought a peaceful resolution to this conflict, their diplomats were assassinated by evil mortals, igniting a war which the unprepared and disorganized elementals lost.</p>\n<p>Surviving elementals retreated to remote locations, fortifying their positions beneath the waves, within volcanoes, and in other places uninhabitable for humanoids.

The mortal becomes a hag — aged, clawed, and cruel — a powerful representative of the unseelie in the Mundane World. In exchange, hags use their magic to bring about the misery that evilarchfey crave.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hiding in Plain Sight.</em></strong> Though hags typically appear as older humanoid women, their true form is as vicious and nasty as their nature. They prefer to show the world a charitable face, but the general wisdom concerning hags is that the more beautiful their appearance, the deeper the rot within. However, this theory has never been confirmed, as few who see a hag's true form live to tell the tale.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dealmakers and Heart-Breakers.</em></strong> Since old age can't kill hags, the oldest among them accumulate as much knowledge, magic, and repute as ancient dragons. They are happy to share their wares … for the right price. Rather than ask for paltry coin, a hag usually bargains for something dear to the customer — perhaps their ability to love, the sound of their child's laugh, or their left pinky toe.</p>\n<p>Adding insult to injury, those who deal with hags almost always discover the product is worse than advertised. Mortals should pay close attention to the precise wording of their agreements, lest they end up with a hex they thought would be a gift. Such curses often lead to the corruption of good but desperate folk, and some get so twisted up in fey deals that they become hags themselves.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What's in a Name?</em></strong> Hags give themselves whimsical names, and older hags often select monikers like Auntie, Granny, or Nanny. Such relatable names help entice their favorite prey: the innocent. Who would fear Granny Gumdrops or Auntie Twothumbs?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Collaboration and Covens.</em></strong> Hags are often viewed as solitary beings due to their foul tempers and tempestuous natures, but they aren't opposed to dealing with others when it suits their needs. Green hags form close relationships with local forest beings, night hags cavort with deal-loving devils, and sea hags bargain with other denizens of the deep to keep merfolk away from their lairs. The most infamous hag collaborations are covens, formed when three hags like — or at least tolerate — each other very much and choose to spend a life together.</p>\n<p>Due to their preferred lairs and varying ambitions, hags typically work with hags of the same kind, though mixed covens aren't out of the question. While in a coven, hags share magic energy, increasing the power of each member of the coven.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Loyal Underlings.</em></strong> Hags are treacherous by nature, and they only recruit creatures they trust to be loyal underlings. Most of these creatures lack sapience (such as animals, constructs, and undead), though hags sometimes command weaker fey who are too scared to betray them.</p>"

But they are not like us.</p>\n  <p>— <cite>Lydia Lockwood, Occultist</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Vampirism is a curse of blood. A curse that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life. They become beings of pure vitality that nonetheless hunger for life's essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims. Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their mortal forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vampire Spawn.</em></strong> A vampire's power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and by their master's orders. Thanks to adventurers and zealous priests, few vampire spawn survive long enough to become true vampires.</p>\n<p><strong><em>True Vampire.</em></strong> After about a hundred years of undeath, a spawn grows in strength and intelligence, becoming a true vampire. They learn to control their thirst and earn new gifts, allowing them to turn their victims into vampire spawn and to charm humanoids. These benefits let the vampire blend into humanoid society, often by masquerading as a long-lost relative of their old family or taking up their former profession. Meanwhile, they carefully choose prey and build a protective army of spawn and thralls.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vampire Lord.</em></strong> Most vampire lords have spent more than three hundred years in undeath. Some are created through powerful magic. Most have been so corrupted by their curse that they have no moral code and stop at nothing to get what they want. After centuries of amassing resources, vampire lords have the power to achieve nearly any goal. Some build empires. Others seek godhood. A few lie dormant, buried in sarcophagi while the ages flow past, waiting to awaken in new worlds ripe for the plucking.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Strengths and Weaknesses.</em></strong> Though most vampires shun sunlight, some know a secret ritual to counteract this weakness. Vampires don't require food, water, or air, but their bodies become desiccated husks if they don't regularly drink the blood of living beings. Each vampire has a special resting place, typically a coffin or similar vessel, where they can regenerate after an arduous battle. While thus recuperating, they can't move.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vampire Thralls.</em></strong> True vampires and vampire lords can cast <em>geas</em>, which charms other creatures to do the vampire's bidding. Vampires use this spell to charm creatures in positions of authority. Most have at least one or two thralls working in local governments, which allows the vampire to prey on the populace without any interference from law enforcement or military.</p>\n<p>Though magic makes reliable thralls, vampires also rely on promises and coercion to maintain a reliable feeding ground and enact sinister plots. Some humanoids are so desperate for power that they will kill for a vampire in exchange for a promise of being turned into one of the undead some day. Vampires also rely on their servants and supernatural abilities to uncover the crimes and misconduct of mortals in power. Those secrets are used to blackmail people into doing a vampire's bidding.</p>\n<p>Whenever a servant disobeys a vampire, swift retribution comes in the form of teeth to the neck. At least they can serve as a drink. There is always another who can take the thrall's place.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Exsanguinating Weapons.</em></strong> Vampire lords can summon exsanguinating weapons made from the blood of their enemies. Only they can wield these weapons, and when a vampire is destroyed, their exsanguinating weapons disappear. The most infamous of these weapons is Sanguinus, the sword of Count Rhodar von Glauer.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Blood-Starved Vampires.</em></strong> When a vampire goes without blood for a year or more, their body shrivels, becoming a living husk. The vampire's thirst for blood becomes their singular focus as their weakened form craves it. These blood-starved vampires often band together for survival, since a single blow can turn one to dust. A blood-starved vampire must drink the blood of scores of humanoids to be restored to an unweakened state.</p>"

Each is merely a pleasant distraction and chance to keep his wits sharp.</p>\n<p>Harlo hired Jutkarr for his expedition as an expert in traps and locks.

Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.iG22whwub4djJgs1]</p>\n<h2>Foreword</h2>\n<p>Better monsters — that was the directive for this book. Heck, “Better Monsters” was almost the title. When I first started freelancing for MCDM in 2019, Matt was already talking about making a new monster book. Awesome, I love those! But Matt didn't want to just fill the gaps in the core rules. He wanted to <em>replace</em> the monsters in the core rules. That's the kind of thinking that made me want to work full-time at MCDM.</p>\n<p>Monsters are central to the game, especially fighting monsters — or fleeing from them. The longest core rule book is entirely dedicated to creature stat blocks. And the overwhelming majority of a player character's class features, spells, feats, magic items, and so on are combat-related, so a GM can never have enough monsters. It's a unique thrill to describe a horde of angry bandits or a reality-warping gibbering mouther to a group of friends immersed in a collaborative story. It's an even better feeling when that monster's unique abilities support the stories we have in our brains. Remember the first time you were in a game and a troll regenerated that arm the fighter had just sliced off? Or when a basilisk turned the rogue to stone? Oh, what about the first time you slew a freakin' dragon? It'd be cool if all combat encounters gave you those feelings.</p>\n<p>After eight years of the fifth edition of the world's oldest roleplaying game, I was hungry for a new kind of monster. So was the rest of the MCDM team. We wanted dragons with more than bites, claws, and breath weapons. We wanted villain showdowns that didn't abruptly end in the first round because each spellcaster saved their highest-level spell slot for the battle. We wanted bands of creatures with synergizing stat blocks, companion creatures and retainers who leveled up alongside the heroes, and cinematic battles against swaths of minions. We wanted monsters that were fun for the GM to run and fun for the players to fight. And we were pretty sure you wanted those things too.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the support of over 27,000 Kickstarter backers, the work of dozens of authors, artists, community managers, consultants, editors, and producers, the ingenuity of hundreds of playtesters, and the deaths of 165 player characters (may they rest in peace), you're now reading that book. Better monsters mean a better game, and that was our team's goal: to make them fun to run and fun to fight. We wanted to make a book with lore, stat blocks, and art so good that you can replace your core rule book with ours … or at least use ours just as much.</p>\n<p>This book wasn't easy to make, but it was a joy to create. A lot of thought and care went into each statistic, sentence, and brush stroke. I hope you have just as much fun using these creatures as we did writing and illustrating them. Thank you for letting our imagination be apart of your story.</p>\n<p><cite>Ex animo,</cite></p>\n<p>\n  <cite>James Introcaso<br />MCDM Lead Game Designer</cite>\n</p>\n\n<h1>Where Evil Lives</h1>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.7w3bj8ajOGcmPdzZ]</p>\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p><strong>Design Director:</strong> James Introcaso</p>\n<p><strong>Designers:</strong> Teos Abadía, Willy Abeel, Ted Adams, Leon Barillaro, Rudy Basso, Bianca Bickford, Carlos Cisco, Alex Clippinger, Matthew Colville, Celeste Conowitch, Makenzie De Armas, Alecson de Lima Junior, Marcello De Velazquez, Sam Ellis, Jamie Flecknoe, Paul Foxcroft, Dave Friant, Imogen Gingell, Scott Fitzgerald Gray, V.J.

All Lairs</em>.</p>\n  <p><cite>Matthew Colville</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We ended up making two books. Before <em>Flee, Mortals! The MCDM Monster Book</em> even launched on Kickstarter, we knew that hitting our lairs stretch goal might mean another book's worth of content. When <em>Flee, Mortals!</em> reached the layout stage, we realized that our fateful prediction was correct. We could either cut fifty pages of content from the lairs and other parts of <em>Flee, Mortals!</em>, or we could break out the lairs into their own book, add more content, and bring our dream book of dungeons and boss battles to life. Since you're reading this, you know which route we took.</p>\n<p>The truth is that these lairs deserve to be in their own book. Each little slice of hell contains story hooks, background information, detailed hazards and NPCs, a villain, unique rewards, and all the stat blocks you need to run them. You can use this book without ever referencing <em>Flee, Mortals!</em></p>\n<p>The real stars of this book are the villains. Each is abominable in their own way; every lair boss is a unique monster, from their personality to their stat block. When a group of heroes invades a villain's home, that evildoer fights like hell to end the threat. We've given each villain the beefy, playtested stat block they need to stand up to even the most optimized parties.</p>\n<p>Each lair was specially crafted for the villain and their allies. A lair is an extension and example of its villain's power and personality. Lord Syuul performs his wicked experiments in a laboratory made of flesh. Kiona the Dread Lord obsessively researches the <em>Codex Mortis</em> in her extradimensional library. The once-proud Ithu'rath plots their grand return to the top in a crumbling castle.</p>\n<p>The boss battles and lairs in this book have saved my game nights. If I don't have anything prepared or if the players zig when I expect them to zag, I can easily grab a story hook or tempt them with some unique treasure and get them into one of these places where evil (and fun!) lives. When I'm scheming for the perfect capstone encounter to end a killer adventure, I reach for this book.</p>\n<p>The authors packed so much delicious evil into these bosses and their homes. I am incredibly grateful to them as well as all the artists, consultants, editors, playtesters, and the rest of the MCDM team who worked super hard to make more pages of content in one year than we ever have before. We, uh, learned a lot — a whole friggin' lot.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy reading and running these lairs as much as we enjoyed making them. Go, brave adventurers. Only you have the heart to face evil where it lives.</p>\n<p><cite>Ex animo,</cite></p>\n<p>\n  <cite>James Introcaso<br />MCDM Lead Game Designer</cite>\n</p>"

A creature is your <strong>ally</strong> if they're inclined to help you or fight alongside you — or if you believe they're inclined to do so. However, you are not your own ally, so if you target your allies with an effect, it doesn't affect you. A creature is your <strong>enemy</strong> if they're inclined to oppose you or fight against you — or if you either believe they're inclined to do so, or you plan to pick a fight with them regardless. If in doubt, it's up to the GM to decide whether a creature counts as an ally, an enemy, or neither.</p>\n\n<h2>Conditions</h2>\n\n<p>Some of the creatures in this book inflict — or are immune to — the following new conditions.</p>\n\n<h3>Dazed</h3>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe01.JournalEntryPage.00dazed000000000 inline]\n\n<h3>Flanked</h3>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe01.JournalEntryPage.00flanked0000000 inline]"

When a creature manifests a power, they create an effect that has similar rules to casting spells, with the following exceptions.</p>\n<h3>Not Magic</h3>\n<p>Powers don't create magical effects, so they're unaffected by features and spells like <em>antimagic field</em>, <em>counterspell</em>, and <em>dispel magic</em>. The damage from a power attack isn't magical. If a rule affects only spells or magical effects, it doesn't affect powers. However, psionic powers are supernatural, so if a rule affects supernatural effects, it does affect powers (see @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00mundaneandsu00]).</p>\n<h3>Power Orders</h3>\n<p>Every power has an <em>order</em> that is an expression of its level of strength. Powers of the 1st order are the weakest (equivalent to cantrips in strength), and 6th-order powers are the strongest.</p>\n<h3>No Components</h3>\n<p>Powers don't have material, somatic, or verbal components.</p>\n<h3>Concentration</h3>\n<p>Like spells, many powers require you to concentrate to maintain their effects. However, unlike spells, a creature can simultaneously concentrate on more than one power, up to a number equal to their proficiency bonus. If a creature fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, all the powers they are concentrating on end.</p>\n<p>A creature can't have multiple manifestations of the same power active at once. Additionally, a creature can't concentrate on a power if they're concentrating on a spell or other effect.</p>\n<h3>Manifesting Multiple Powers</h3>\n<p>Unlike player characters, if a creature's stat block allows them to manifest a power as a bonus action, they can still manifest another power of 2nd order or higher as an action on that turn. For example, a creature who manifests the <em>jaunt</em> power as a bonus action can also make a 2nd-order power attack as an action. Similarly, many Multiattack actions let a creature make multiple power attacks on a turn, even though each attack is a power of its own.</p>\n<h3>Power Attacks as Opportunity Attacks</h3>\n<p>When an enemy's movement provokes an opportunity attack from a creature whose stat block includes a melee power attack, the creature can use their reaction to make a melee power attack against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.</p>\n<h3>New Powers</h3>\n<p>A character playing a talent — the class found in the MCDM supplement <a href=\"https://mcdm.gg/talent\">The Talent and Psionics</a> — can use the rules in that book to learn new powers from the creatures in <em>Flee, Mortals!</em></p>\n\n<p>The powers are listed in @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00appe00.JournalEntryPage.ZXlxMeeskuAfOipj]</p>"

They can only make that saving throw either at the start or end of their turn, as specified in the stat block.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Behind the Design: Save Ends Effects</h3>\n  <p>Save ends effects are one way of saving space in stat blocks and making them less complex for GMs to run at the table. Much like how stat blocks just reference the poisoned condition instead of spelling its rules out each time, we didn't want to fill up the pages by repeating long sentences similar to this one: “A target poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success.”</p>\n</aside>"

Each retainer has a simple stat block — though these are similar to other creature stat blocks, retainers follow a few different rules.</p>\n\n<h3>Level</h3>\n<p>A retainer's level equals their mentor's level. As a retainer levels up, their hit points increase (see “Hit Points and\n  Hit Dice”) and they gain combat features (see “Features”). Additionally, a few of their statistics increase when their mentor's proficiency bonus does, including attack bonuses, skills, and save DC (see “Proficiency Bonus”). Their other statistics typically remain the same regardless of their level.</p>\n\n<h3>Armor Class</h3>\n<p>Unlike player characters, a retainer's armor class isn't determined by a particular set of armor they don (like studded leather). Instead, each retainer's armor class is simplified to one of three armor types:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Retainers with light armor have AC 13.</li>\n  <li>Retainers with medium armor have AC 15.</li>\n  <li>Retainers with heavy armor have AC 18.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This rule is optional, and can be enabled by changing the Armor Class calculation on a given retainer's stat block. By default, they are set up to use the default armor class of the armor they are wearing.</p>\n\n<h3>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h3>\n<p>Retainers gain one Hit Die per level. Their hit point maximum is based on the size of their Hit Die, as shown on the Retainer Hit Points table.</p>\n<p>Retainers have exceptionally high hit points — sometimes even higher than their mentor. This allows the party to enjoy the presence of a beloved retainer without worrying about losing them to an unlucky roll of the dice or decision by a single player. The GM often awards characters with retainers in lieu of other treasure. Such rewards shouldn't be lost easily.</p>\n<table>\n  <caption>Retainer Hit Points</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Hit Die Size</th>\n      <th>Hit Point Maximum</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>d6</td>\n      <td>6 times their level</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>d8</td>\n      <td>7 times their level</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>d10</td>\n      <td>8 times their level</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>d12</td>\n      <td>9 times their level</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Proficiency Bonus</h3>\n<p>Because a retainer's effectiveness and survivability depend on the training and expertise of their mentor, a retainer's proficiency bonus is equal to their mentor's proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>Some of a retainer's statistics refer to their proficiency bonus, abbreviated as PB. Other statistics use a number of dice equal to a retainer's proficiency bonus; these are expressed with PB in place of the number of dice. For example, if a retainer has a +3 proficiency bonus, PBd10 means 3d10.</p>\n<p>A retainer adds their proficiency bonus to any saving throw they make.</p>\n\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>Each retainer has a <em>signature attack</em> they can make using the Attack action each round. Retainers can use their signature attack to make opportunity attacks, even if their signature attack isn't a melee weapon attack.</p>\n<p>A retainer gains new features at 3rd, 5th, and 7th level. Some features can only be used a certain number of times per day (as noted in the retainer's stat block).</p>\n<p>Additionally, if a retainer's signature attack is a weapon attack, they typically gain an extra attack at 7th level (as noted in their stat block), allowing them to make two signature attacks per round instead of one.</p>\n\n<h3>Gear</h3>\n<p>When a retainer joins the party, they typically carry clothes appropriate to their position, a suit of armor, a weapon, and an explorer's pack. If the retainer casts spells, they also carry a spellcasting implement. Any additional equipment must be provided to them by their mentor.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Magic Items.</strong></em> Retainers can use magic items like anyone else. For example, a <em>+1 weapon</em> increases their attack and damage rolls by 1, and <em>+1 armor</em> of the appropriate type (light, medium, or heavy) increases their AC by 1.\n</p>\n<p>One happy side effect of having retainers is that as a player character levels up and acquires better equipment, they can pass their obsolete items on to the retainer.</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.laDvDaJ658JIi8MP]</p>\n\n<h1>Dying Retainers</h1>\n<p>When a retainer is reduced to 0 hit points, they follow the same rules as player characters. If not killed instantly by massive damage, they fall unconscious, make death saving throws, and can be stabilized or healed.</p>\n\n<h1>Optional Rule: Shared Attacks</h1>\n<p>If a player wants to speed up their retainer's turn, they can make <strong>shared attacks</strong> at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p>When the mentor hits a creature with an attack, if their retainer can see or hear them, the retainer is inspired by their mentor's success. On the inspired retainer's next turn, for each successful attack their mentor just made, the retainer can automatically hit a creature of their choice within range with their signature attack, up to the number of attacks the retainer can make.</p>\n<p>If the mentor hit with fewer attacks than the number of attacks the retainer can make, the retainer can make additional attack rolls for those attacks to see if they hit.</p>\n\n<h1>Retainer Encounter Balance</h1>\n<p>When building encounters, the GM should consider a retainer as akin to a powerful combat-focused magic item. A retainer gives a party a significant power boost; they not only dish out more damage and provide more hit points for enemies to target, but they also create complications to challenge the party's foes.

Minions can't spend Hit Dice to heal during a short rest because they have none.</p>\n<h2>No Damage Rolls</h2>\n<p>Minions don't roll for damage because their attacks deal a static amount of damage. They also can't score critical hits.</p>\n<h2>Shared Turns</h2>\n<p>Typically, all minions of the same stat block act on the same turn. Since they share a turn, the minions can each move into position then each use an action if they wish, instead of each moving and taking an action individually.</p>\n<h2>Minion Trait</h2>\n<p>Every minion has the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.features.Item.GZy3ygstXmG777Hl]{Minion} trait, which affects the creature in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If the minion takes any damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, their hit points are reduced to 0.</li>\n  <li>If the minion takes damage from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum; otherwise they take no damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Behind the Design: Minion Trait</h3>\n  <p>You might ask, why not just give minions 1 hit point and take no damage when they save for half, like in fourth edition? First, spells that use a creature's hit points to determine effectiveness — like <em>color spray</em> and <em>sleep</em> — would devastate all minions, even those meant to challenge high-level characters. These spells are still effective against minions, just not devastating!</p>\n  <p>Second, spells and effects that deal damage without any attack roll or save — like <em>magic missile</em> and <em>spike growth</em> — would lay waste to minions with 1 hit point. This fits the fiction for minions with low challenge ratings, like goblins and zombies. But the balance of combat and fiction breaks down to near-silliness at higher levels when the same spells easily take down powerful devil minions.</p>\n  <p>Finally, high-level spells with a save for half damage — like <em>fireball</em> or <em>meteor swarm</em> — would feel wasted against minions with 1 hit point. Why use a higher-level spell when a lower-level one will do? Similarly, the fourth edition design could lead to a kobold minion illogically surviving a <em>fireball</em> spell while a “stronger” standard kobold next to them dies, despite both creatures succeeding on their saving throw. By contrast, under this book's minion rules, spellcasters still have a good reason to use high-level spells against minions.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Overkill Attacks</h2>\n<p>Powerful weapon attacks can kill more than one minion in a single maneuver called an <em>overkill attack</em>.</p>\n<p>As already discussed, a weapon attack requires only 1 point of damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, regardless of their hit point maximum. However, when a weapon attack's damage does exceed the target minion's hit point maximum, the attack becomes an overkill attack and the damage dealt beyond the minion's hit point maximum becomes <strong>overkill damage</strong>.</p>\n<p>Overkill damage can be applied to a second minion who has the same stat block as the target and is in overkill range (see below). Damage against the second minion is counted as if you made a weapon attack against them; since it only takes 1 point of weapon damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, <em>any</em> amount of overkill damage immediately knocks them out. But wait, it gets better — if the initial attack's overkill damage exceeds the second minion's hit point maximum, the leftover overkill damage can roll over to a third minion, and so on! In other words, for each time the overkill damage exceeds the new target's hit point maximum, the attacker can choose an additional minion to reduce to 0 hit points.</p>\n<p>For example, when a weapon attack deals 18 damage to a minion with a hit point maximum of 5, the overkill damage is 13. If there are three additional minions of the same stat block in overkill range, they can all three be immediately reduced to 0 hit points, since the overkill damage exceeded the target's hit point maximum more than twice over.</p>\n<p>Overkill attacks can't be made as part of an opportunity attack.</p>\n<h3>Overkill Range</h3>\n<p>Minions must be within a certain range to qualify for an overkill attack, determined by whether the attack is a melee or ranged attack. In addition to the examples below, the “Overkill Damage Illustrated” sidebar demonstrates how to calculate overkill damage</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Melee Overkill Attacks.</strong></em> When a creature hits a minion with a melee weapon attack, other minions within reach of the attack are in <strong>overkill range</strong> and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can't target minions outside the weapon attack's reach.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Lady Ulnock the paladin battles a horde of goblin minions (each with 6 hit points). She hits a goblin minion with her longsword and uses Divine Smite, dealing 8 slashing damage and 11 radiant damage to the target for a total of 19 damage. Since Lady Ulnock dealt 13 points of overkill damage — more than the hit point maximum of two additional minions — she can choose up to three additional goblin minions within 5 feet of her (the reach of her longsword attack) and reduce them to 0 hit points. If there are no other goblin minions within 5 feet of Lady Ulnock, she can't damage additional minions with this attack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Ranged Overkill Attacks.</strong></em> When a creature hits a minion with a ranged weapon attack, other minions in a line originating from the creature in the direction of the target, to a distance equal to the weapon's short range, are in <strong>overkill range</strong> and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can't target minions outside the line or beyond the weapon's short range.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Perigold Quickfingers the rogue is hidden and takes aim at a group of zombie minions (each with 6 hit points) with his light crossbow (which has a short range of 80 feet). He hits a zombie minion with his crossbow, dealing extra damage thanks to his Sneak Attack, for a total of 14 damage. Since Perigold dealt 8 points of overkill damage — more than the hit point maximum of one additional minion — he can choose up to two additional zombie minions in an 80-foot-long line extending from Perigold in the direction of the target, reducing them to 0 hit points. If there are no other zombie minions in the line, then Perigold can't damage other minions with this attack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Overkill Damage Illustrated</h3>\n  <p>Imagine a fighter is making a melee attack with a shortsword against a lackey, and two more lackeys are within overkill range of that attack. Each lackey is a minion with 6 hit points. In example A, the attack hits and deals 4 piercing damage. This kills only the targeted lackey. A successful attack against a minion always kills the target.</p>\n\n  <div class=\"overkill\">\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"modules/mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives/assets/layout/overkill-silhouette4.webp\" />\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"modules/mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives/assets/layout/overkill-silhouette0.webp\" />\n      <figcaption>Example A</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"modules/mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives/assets/layout/overkill-silhouette0.webp\" />\n    </figure>\n  </div>\n\n  <p>In example B, the attack is a critical hit and deals 13 piercing damage. This kills the targeted lackey with 7 overkill damage remaining, which spreads to the other minions within the fighter's overkill range. So a second lackey within 5 feet of the fighter takes 6 piercing damage and dies, leaving 1 overkill damage remaining. The third lackey takes that last point of overkill damage and dies.</p>\n\n  <div class=\"overkill\">\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"modules/mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives/assets/layout/overkill-silhouette6.webp\" />\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"modules/mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives/assets/layout/overkill-silhouette6.webp\" />\n      <figcaption>Example B</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure>\n      <img src=\"modules/mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives/assets/layout/overkill-silhouette1.webp\" />\n    </figure>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n\n<h2>Group Attacks</h2>\n<p>Each minion has at least one <strong>group attack</strong> action that speeds up play. In a group attack, two to five minions of the same stat block who share a turn can all use their action to join the attack, provided the target is within the original attack's reach or range for each minion.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Make a single attack roll for the group attack. It counts as one attack.</li>\n  <li>A group attack roll gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for each minion who joins the attack. (For example, if four goblin minions make a group attack together, the attack roll has a +4 bonus.)</li>\n  <li>If the group attack hits, multiply the damage by the number of minions who joined that group attack. (For example, if four goblin minions hit with a group attack that deals 1 damage, their group attack deals 4 damage.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GM decides how many minions join a group attack. For instance, if five minions surround a target, the GM may decide to have all five attack at once to speed up combat, or may break up the attacks among smaller groups to increase the odds that some minions hit while others miss. A single minion can even use their group attack action on their own — they make the attack as a normal creature would, and simply don't benefit from the group bonuses described above.</p>\n<h3>Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>\n<p>A group attack is only made with advantage or disadvantage if all the minions joining the group attack have advantage or disadvantage on the attack roll. Otherwise, the attack is made without advantage or disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Cover and Concealment</h3>\n<p>If a target has cover or concealment from some but not all minions, the GM should divide the minions into multiple groups based on the type of cover or concealment they have, then make a separate attack for each group.</p>\n<h3>Target Response Effects</h3>\n<p>If a group attack triggers a reaction or similar effect that would normally affect a single attacker, such as the <em>fire shield</em> or <em>hellish rebuke</em> spell, the target of the group attack picks one minion who joined the attack to be affected by the effect.</p>\n<h3>Group Opportunity Attacks</h3>\n<p>If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from more than one minion of the same stat block at a time and those minions have a melee group attack action, the minions can each use their reaction to join a group attack as an opportunity attack.</p>\n<h2>Optional Rule: Group Saving Throws</h2>\n<p>Though minions often make saving throws individually, there are times when rolling individual saving throws for each minion could slow down the fight, like when a cleric surrounded by eighteen shade minions uses Turn Undead.</p>\n<p>When many minions with the same stat block need to make a saving throw against the same effect at the same time, you can make one saving throw for a group of up to five minions at a time. All minions in a group use the result of the saving throw.</p>\n<p>For instance, if thirty-four goblin minions need to make a saving throw against a <em>hypnotic pattern</em> spell, the minions would make a total of seven saving throws against the spell: six for thirty minions divided into six groups of five, and one more save for the remaining group of four minions.</p>\n<h2>Optional Rule: Tough Minions</h2>\n<p>Minions of a higher challenge rating, such as abyssal ghouls or fire giants, make for powerful foes. Consequently, it could break the game's verisimilitude for an NPC commoner to kill such a minion with a single attack. To keep minions believable, you can use the following rule.</p>\n<p>When a minion's challenge rating is at least 6 higher than an NPC's challenge rating, that NPC's actions and traits affect a minion as if they didn't have the Minion trait, reducing the minion's hit points like a normal creature instead of automatically dropping them to 0.</p>\n<p>This rule shouldn't be applied to player characters — they're heroes who can always kill a minion in one hit.</p>\n<h2>Special Traits</h2>\n<p>Many minions have traits that give them strength in numbers but become less powerful as their allies are defeated. For example, an enemy who starts their turn within 5 feet of three or more goblin lackeys must succeed on a saving throw or take damage from the lackeys' Tiny Stabs trait.</p>\n<h2>Challenge Ratings</h2>\n<p>Minions have a challenge rating just like any other creature. However, their experience point value depends on their challenge rating, as shown on the Minion Encounter Building table. Aside from their damage output, the Minion trait, and their experience point value, a minion's statistics are on par with a standard creature of the same challenge rating.</p>\n<p>When the rules reference a challenge rating, such as the <em>polymorph</em> spell or the cleric's Destroy Undead feature, use the minion's listed challenge rating as normal. For instance, a 5th-level cleric can affect Undead creatures with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower with their Destroy Undead feature — so this feature can affect rotting zombie minions (CR 1/4) but not shade minions (CR 1).</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.hOM62akGz6i6Hxjy]</p>\n\n<h1>Building Minion Encounters</h1>\n<p>Minions present opportunities for memorable, cinematic encounters. Keep the following tips in mind to achieve maximum fun while planning and running combat encounters with minions.</p>\n\n<h3>Encounter Difficulty</h3>\n<p>When building encounters against a single foe, the core rules advise matching the characters with a creature whose challenge rating (CR) is close to the average party level. What happens when you add minions to the mix?</p>\n<p>You can use the Minion Encounter Building table to determine how many minions are equivalent to one standard creature of that CR for encounter building.</p>\n<p>You can increase a minion's challenge rating using the rules in the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00minions0000000#modifying-and-making-minions]{Modifying and Making Minions} section.</p>\n\n<h3>Tell Your Players</h3>\n<p>While it's tempting to pit your unsuspecting players against a horde of fire giants just to watch their eyes pop out of their faces in surprise, minion encounters are more fun overall if you share the rules for minions with your players before they get into an encounter. They'll understand how overkill and group attacks work, spend their resources more efficiently, and be able to help you track the fight more easily, which is worth a lot more than the shock value of a sea of foes the players don't know are minions.</p>\n<p>If you want the best of both worlds, end a session with the characters confronting a horde of creatures before rolling initiative. At the start of the next session, reveal those creatures are minions and share the rules.</p>\n\n<h3>Minion Encounter Building</h3>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>CR</th>\n      <th>XP</th>\n      <th>Minions per Standard</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0 or 2</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1/8</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1/4</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1/2</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>40</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>90</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>140</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>220</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>225</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>285</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>360</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>485</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>500</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>590</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>720</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>12</td>\n      <td>840</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>13</td>\n      <td>1,000</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>1,150</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>15</td>\n      <td>1,300</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>16</td>\n      <td>1,500</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>17</td>\n      <td>1,800</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>18</td>\n      <td>2,000</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>19</td>\n      <td>2,200</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>2,500</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>21</td>\n      <td>3,300</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>22</td>\n      <td>4,100</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>23</td>\n      <td>5,000</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>24</td>\n      <td>6,200</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>25</td>\n      <td>7,500</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>26</td>\n      <td>9,000</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>27</td>\n      <td>10,500</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>28</td>\n      <td>12,000</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>29</td>\n      <td>13,500</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>30</td>\n      <td>15,500</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Not Too Many</h3>\n<p>When you're planning your encounters, think of five minions as one standard creature. While it might be exciting to throw a hundred minions at the characters, that's like them facing twenty standard creatures. It can be done and might even be fun, but it's not the typical minion experience and results in a much longer battle than normal. Keep the following tips in mind when adding minions to an encounter:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>When the characters are 10th level or lower, most encounters work well with ten to twenty minions in addition to other creatures.</li>\n  <li>When the characters are 11th level or higher, they're more efficient at killing minions, and many of the poor critters will die before even acting. Most high-level encounters work well with twenty to thirty minions.</li>\n  <li>If you find mid battle that minions are dying too quickly to present a challenge, you can have reinforcements join the fray.</li>\n  <li>Though too many minions can cause a problem, you don't want too few either. If you're using minions in your encounter, plan to include at least enough minions to count as one standard creature, as shown on the Minion Encounter Building table. You won't break anything if you include fewer — the encounter just isn't likely to be as satisfying.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Add Standard Creatures</h3>\n<p>Minion encounters become more dynamic if you add some standard creatures allied with the minions. A hag coven surrounded by ogre minions or a red dragon tyrant commanding fire giant minions present more interesting encounters than copies of the same enemy, challenging the characters to use diverse tactics.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Minion Bands</h3>\n  <p>A combat encounter with more than five minions per character can become deadly if all minions act on the same turn — the characters cut down minion hordes on their turns but then suffer massive damage as a sea of minions pour down on them. While many groups like this challenge, you have the option to divide the minions into different bands that act on different initiative counts. If you do this, minions can only join group attacks with minions in the same band. At the start of a new round, two or more bands of minions can reorganize into one band, acting on the lowest initiative count of the bands that combined.</p>\n  <p>If you divide minions into bands, be sure to distinguish which minions belong together. For gridded combat, you could use a colored marker for each miniature. In a theater of the mind encounter, try group descriptors like “zombie dwarves” and “zombie elves.”</p>\n</aside>\n\n<h3>Cut the Choke Points</h3>\n<p>Since minions are most effective in numbers, avoid encounters in cramped dungeon tunnels and similar choke points. Combat becomes dull in tight quarters if only a couple minions can attack at a time.</p>\n\n<h1>Modifying and Making Minions</h1>\n<p>You can increase a minion's challenge rating or create new minions using the Minion Statistics by Challenge Rating table. To change an existing minion's challenge rating, adjust their proficiency bonus, hit points, and damage dealt by their attacks. If a minion's proficiency bonus changes, their AC, ability modifiers, attack bonuses, and the DC for ability checks and saving throws made to resist the minion's traits and actions have the same adjustments. For example, if the minion's proficiency bonus increases by 1, so do their AC, ability modifiers, attack bonuses, and DCs.</p>\n<p>If you're using the table to create a new minion, you can lift statistics directly from the table. If the minion doesn't wear armor and their AC is less than 10 plus their proficiency modifier, consider giving the creature natural armor that grants a bonus to AC equal to their proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>The table is merely a guide — feel free to tweak the math to get the specific minion you desire.</p>\n<table>\n  <caption>Minion Statistics by Challenge Rating</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>CR</th>\n      <th>Prof. Bonus</th>\n      <th>Hit Points</th>\n      <th>Damage</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>+2</td>\n      <td>≤ 4</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1/8</td>\n      <td>+2</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1/4</td>\n      <td>+2</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1/2</td>\n      <td>+2</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>+2</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>+2</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>+2</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>+2</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>+3</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>+3</td>\n      <td>13</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>+3</td>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>+3</td>\n      <td>15</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>+4</td>\n      <td>16</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>+4</td>\n      <td>17</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>+4</td>\n      <td>18</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>12</td>\n      <td>+4</td>\n      <td>19</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>13</td>\n      <td>+5</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>+5</td>\n      <td>21</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>15</td>\n      <td>+5</td>\n      <td>22</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>16</td>\n      <td>+5</td>\n      <td>23</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>17</td>\n      <td>+6</td>\n      <td>24</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>18</td>\n      <td>+6</td>\n      <td>25</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>19</td>\n      <td>+6</td>\n      <td>26</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>+6</td>\n      <td>27</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>21</td>\n      <td>+7</td>\n      <td>28</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>22</td>\n      <td>+7</td>\n      <td>29</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>23</td>\n      <td>+7</td>\n      <td>30</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>24</td>\n      <td>+7</td>\n      <td>31</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>25</td>\n      <td>+8</td>\n      <td>32</td>\n      <td>13</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>26</td>\n      <td>+8</td>\n      <td>33</td>\n      <td>13</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>27</td>\n      <td>+8</td>\n      <td>34</td>\n      <td>14</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>28</td>\n      <td>+8</td>\n      <td>35</td>\n      <td>14</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>29</td>\n      <td>+9</td>\n      <td>36</td>\n      <td>15</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>30</td>\n      <td>+9</td>\n      <td>37</td>\n      <td>15</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"

          "name": "Using Creature Roles",
          "text": "<p>Creature roles help you build interesting encounters with varied challenges. While including every role in a combat encounter makes the battle too complicated for most groups, a fight with creatures who are all the same role typically leads to dull, grindy combat — and few players (or GMs) enjoy combat where both sides are just standing still and rolling to hit without anything dynamic or dramatic happening. For instance, an encounter with a controller, a skirmisher, and two soldiers is more interesting and fun than an encounter with four soldiers.</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.HEgrQpCQpDIQfPmF]</p>\n<h2>Ambusher Creatures</h2>\n<p>Ambusher creatures can hide, become invisible, or otherwise disappear from sight on their turns. They typically spend half their turn attacking a player character, and the other half slipping away and hiding. They focus on taking down a single character, sometimes dragging their target into the place where they hide.</p>\n<p>Encounters that include ambushers should have plenty of cover, giving them places to hide. Adding other creatures — typically brutes, minions, skirmishers, or soldiers — keeps other player characters busy while the ambusher focuses on taking down a single target.</p>\n<h2>Artillery Creatures</h2>\n<p>Artillery creatures are great at ranged combat and can damage player characters who typically hang back behind beefier counterparts. Most artillery creatures are weak in melee, so add some brutes, minions, or soldiers for them to hide behind during combat.</p>\n<p>On their turn in combat, an artillery creature typically tries to move away from any foes within 30 feet, puts a brute, soldier, or other ally between themself and the threat, then attacks that enemy. If forced into melee, most artillery creatures do whatever they can to get away, including using the Dash or Disengage action. If no enemies are closing in, artillery creatures move to keep the player characters at the edge of their range and often attack the biggest threat to their allies first.</p>\n<h2>Brute Creatures</h2>\n<p>Brute creatures hit hard and have a lot of hit points. Their damage output can't be ignored, so player characters often focus on taking down brutes instead of other creatures who have fewer hit points or are weaker in melee. Brutes need to get up close to perform their most devastating attacks, so they work best on smaller battlefields. On their turn in combat, brutes move toward the closest group of enemies and attack, preferring to engage multiple foes at once. Brutes tend to be simpler to run than other creatures, so you can include a lot of them in an encounter.</p>\n<h2>Controller Creatures</h2>\n<p>With their ability to debuff, hamper, and move player characters, controllers make a dynamic addition to any battle. They tend to have more complicated actions and traits with unique effects, so most combat encounters shouldn't have more than one or two controllers.</p>\n<p>Many controllers work best when they have brutes, minions, skirmishers, and soldiers protecting them and taking advantage of the effects they create. Controllers often use their biggest and most powerful effects at the start of an encounter, affecting as many foes as possible. If the controller can't affect multiple characters or use their most powerful feature, they focus on manipulating the battlefield and repositioning so they can use that feature on their next turn.</p>\n<h2>Leader and Support Creatures</h2>\n<p>Leader creatures are action-oriented (see @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00actionorient00]{Action-Oriented Creatures}) and fight best alongside allies. Support creatures function much like leaders, but they lack villain actions and are less complex.</p>\n<p>Leader and support creatures can summon reinforcements, buff their allies, and grant allies extra movement and actions. As long as a leader or support creature stays in the fight, their allies are enhanced. They are most effective when protected by and buffing artillery, brutes, minions, skirmishers, and soldiers. You typically shouldn't use more than one leader or support creature in an encounter, as their overlapping enhancements can turn a seemingly normal encounter into a fatal one.</p>\n<p>Leaders and support creatures remain close to their allies so their features can benefit as many creatures as possible.</p>\n<h2>Minion Creatures</h2>\n<p>As discussed in the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00minions0000000]{Minions} section, minions allow you to create cinematic battles where the characters feel heroic as they cut through several foes at a time. Using minions of a challenge rating within 2 of the characters' average level also keeps them dangerous and relevant. When minions work together, they can't be ignored, as they deal a lot of damage and can lock down the characters. Minions make excellent protectors for ambushers, artillery, controllers, and leaders.</p>\n<h2>Skirmisher Creatures</h2>\n<p>Skirmisher creatures make battles dynamic. They can move to attack vulnerable player characters who are weaker in melee, then retreat (if they can do so safely) to protect their artillery, controller, leader, and support allies. Since they can outrun and outmaneuver player characters, this forces the heroes to act tactically. Skirmishers pair well with each other creature role, including other skirmishers.</p>\n<h2>Soldier Creatures</h2>\n<p>Soldier creatures defend their allies by drawing the player characters' attacks. They make excellent protectors for ambushers, artillery creatures, controllers, leaders, and support creatures. Soldiers don't need to stay very close to the creatures they protect — and it's better if they don't. A soldier who breaks away from their charge can lock down a threat far from the rest of the fight.</p>\n<p>During combat, soldiers engage characters who are strong in melee. A soldier battles as many foes as they can reach so their allies can freely move. If more than one soldier is in a battle, they typically split up, each fighting a different character.</p>\n<h2>Solo Creatures</h2>\n<p>Solo creatures are action-oriented (see @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00actionorient00]{Action-Oriented Creatures}). Their villain actions and lair actions allow them to hamper and harm foes outside of the normal turn order. They're encountered alone and fight most effectively in environments with plenty of space to move around and find cover.</p>\n<p>Solo creatures use every movement advantage they have, burrowing, climbing, flying, swimming, or teleporting around the battlefield on their turn. They focus on the character threatening them most, but also position themselves to target as many foes as possible with their area-of-effect features.</p>\n\n<h1>Encounter Building</h1>\n<p>Building combat encounters using the game's core rules is complex, time-consuming, and doesn't work for the play style of many groups. The core rules state that most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight medium-difficulty encounters per adventuring day. This is good advice for classic dungeon crawls, but in adventures that fit more into the heroic fantasy genre, player characters rarely face more than three or four encounters before settling down for a long rest. When GMs use the core guidelines for such adventures, heroes often aren't pushed to satisfying limits — especially at higher levels where their daily resources are vast.</p>\n<p>The guidance in this section presents a more flexible way of planning a challenging (but survivable) adventuring day. It replaces the advice in the core rules and allows you to better dial in the challenge of an encounter with less preparation time.</p>\n\n<h3>Encounters per Day</h3>\n<p>An adventuring day is the time between the end of one long rest to the end of the next. How many combat encounters should adventurers face between those long rests? The answer really depends on how difficult the combat encounters are. To help plan encounters, each level of encounter difficulty has a <strong>daily encounter points rating</strong>. See @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00usingcreatur00#step-1:-choose-encounter-difficulty]{Step 1: Choose Encounter Difficulty} for each difficulty's rating.</p>\n<p>To give the characters a good but survivable challenge, fill each adventuring day with encounters that total 6 to 8 points over the course of the day. Here are some examples of daily encounter combinations:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Two easy encounters (1 point each), one standard encounter (2 points), and one hard encounter (4 points), for a total of 8 points</li>\n  <li>Three easy encounters (1 point each) and one hard encounter (4 points), for a total of 7 points</li>\n  <li>Three standard encounters (2 points each), for a total of 6 points</li>\n  <li>Two standard encounters (2 points each) and one hard encounter (4 points), for a total of 8 points</li>\n  <li>Two hard encounters (4 points each), for a total of 8 points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The daily encounter budgets have been calibrated so it's likely a party will run out of resources but survive the adventuring day. If you want a more challenging adventure day that doesn't ensure a party's survival, give yourself a daily encounter points budget of 12 points.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Choose Encounter Difficulty</h2>\n<p>Begin building your encounter by determining how difficult you want the threat to be. This section provides guidance on choosing an encounter difficulty and how many daily encounter points each encounter is worth.</p>\n<p>Though this section uses familiar language regarding encounter difficulty, the meanings of these terms don't align perfectly with the core rules. For instance, for parties of 5th level and beyond, the core rules might call an encounter “hard,” but under our guidelines the encounter is standard or even easy. And some “deadly” encounters in the core rules are merely hard encounters under our guidelines. These differences account for fewer encounters in a day.</p>\n\n<h3>Easier than Easy: Trivial Encounters</h3>\n<p>Trivial encounters require barely any effort on the part of the characters — like a group of 20th-level heroes taking on a handful of crawling claws or goblins. The characters are guaranteed to survive the fight and won't spend many resources. These encounters can be fun to occasionally throw into your game, but for many groups, the novelty disappears quickly. Too many trivial encounters can feel like a waste of time.</p>\n<p>A trivial encounter is worth 0 daily encounter points.</p>\n\n<h3>Easy Encounters (1 Point)</h3>\n<p>Unless the characters have already depleted many of their resources and hit points, easy encounters won't threaten their lives. Easy encounters are great for adventures that don't give the characters much time to rest or for times when you want the heroes to feel like superheroes.</p>\n<p>An easy encounter is worth 1 daily encounter point.</p>\n\n<h3>Standard Encounters (2 Points)</h3>\n<p>Standard encounters are the most common for many adventuring groups. These battles deplete significant resources and hit points. While character death is uncommon in standard encounters, it isn't impossible, especially if a player makes a poor tactical choice or just finds the dice are against them.</p>\n<p>A standard encounter is worth 2 daily encounter points.</p>\n\n<h3>Hard Encounters (4 Points)</h3>\n<p>Hard encounters are typically climactic encounters with bosses and their minions — or anything else that puts the characters' lives in peril. Hard encounters are winnable, but the characters need all their resources, wits, and luck to survive.</p>\n<p>A hard encounter is worth 4 daily encounter points.</p>\n\n<h3>Extreme Encounters (8 Points)</h3>\n<p>Extreme encounters are ones where the characters will likely not survive if they try to fight to the bitter end. Such encounters rarely or never appear in most campaigns — though if the characters are level 17 or higher, they can typically survive (or come back to life after) such encounters.</p>\n<p>An extreme encounter is worth 8 daily encounter points.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Avoiding Combat</h3>\n  <p>The characters might avoid combat encounters through stealth, clever negotiation, luck, or other unforeseen circumstances. You have two options when this happens. First is to let the heroes have the extra resources going into the next battle — clever thinking should be rewarded! But if your group likes to fight, you can always add another combat encounter to the adventuring day (if it fits within your daily encounter points budget).</p>\n</aside>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Determine CR Budget</h2>\n<p>Once you choose the desired difficulty of your encounter, you can determine its CR budget. To do so, you'll need to know the average character level of the party (rounding down).</p>\n<p>Using the Encounter CR per Character table, find the row that lists your party's average character level, then find the column that lists your desired encounter difficulty. The number in that intersecting cell is your CR budget <em>per character</em> — just multiply that number by the number of characters in the party, and that's your total CR budget to spend in the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00usingcreatur00#step-3:-spend-cr-budget]{Step 3: Spend CR Budget} section.</p>\n<p>For example, if you wanted to build a hard encounter for a group of four 5th-level characters, you would multiply 2 ½ (from the Encounter CR per Character table) by 4 (the number of characters) to get a total CR budget of 10.</p>\n<p><em>*Given how low a character's hit points are at 1st level, there isn't much difference between an easy and a standard encounter.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n  <caption>Encounter CR per Character</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Average Character Level</th>\n      <th>Easy</th>\n      <th>Standard</th>\n      <th>Hard</th>\n      <th>CR Cap</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1st</td>\n      <td>1/8*</td>\n      <td>1/8*</td>\n      <td>1/4</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>2nd</td>\n      <td>1/8</td>\n      <td>1/4</td>\n      <td>1/2</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3rd</td>\n      <td>1/4</td>\n      <td>1/2</td>\n      <td>3/4</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4th</td>\n      <td>1/2</td>\n      <td>3/4</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5th</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1 ½</td>\n      <td>2 ½</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6th</td>\n      <td>1 ½</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7th</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>2 ½</td>\n      <td>3 ½</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8th</td>\n      <td>2 ½</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9th</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>3 ½</td>\n      <td>4 ½</td>\n      <td>13</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10th</td>\n      <td>3 ½</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>15</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>11th</td>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>4 ½</td>\n      <td>5 ½</td>\n      <td>16</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>12th</td>\n      <td>4 ½</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>17</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>13th</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>5 ½</td>\n      <td>6 ½</td>\n      <td>19</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>14th</td>\n      <td>5 ½</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>15th</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>6 ½</td>\n      <td>7 ½</td>\n      <td>22</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>16th</td>\n      <td>6 ½</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>24</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>17th</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>7 ½</td>\n      <td>8 ½</td>\n      <td>25</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>18th</td>\n      <td>7 ½</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>26</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>19th</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>8 ½</td>\n      <td>9 ½</td>\n      <td>28</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>20th</td>\n      <td>8 ½</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>30</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Companions and Retainers</h3>\n<p>For the purpose of encounter building, if the player characters adventure with one or more companions or retainers, consider them player characters but subtract 2 from their actual level. However, if a companion's caregiver is a beastheart, don't count the companion as an extra character — the beastheart and companion together have the equivalent power of one full character.</p>\n\n<h3>CR Cap</h3>\n<p>Some creatures who fit into your CR budget are too much for the characters to handle. Those monsters deal a lot of damage and create effects that are difficult to overcome for characters under a certain level. That's why the Encounter CR per Character table provides a challenge rating cap for each average character level. When you're building your encounter (see @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00usingcreatur00#step-3:-spend-cr-budget]{Step 3: Spend CR Budget}), don't add any creature with a challenge rating higher than the average character level's CR cap.</p>\n\n<h3>Solo Creatures</h3>\n<p>When you use a solo creature, you shouldn't use the above encounter-building rules. Instead, refer to the CR cap for the average character level, then depending on how difficult you want the encounter to be, select one solo creature within the CR range indicated on the Solo Creatures Encounters table.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <caption>Solo Creature Encounters</caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th rowspan=\"2\">Group Size</th>\n      <th colspan=\"4\">Encounter Difficulty</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Trivial</th>\n      <th>Easy</th>\n      <th>Standard</th>\n      <th>Hard</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4-5 characters</td>\n      <td>CR cap minus 7+</td>\n      <td>CR cap minus 5-6</td>\n      <td>CR cap minus 3-4</td>\n      <td>CR cap minus 0-2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6-7 characters</td>\n      <td>CR cap minus 6+</td>\n      <td>CR cap minus 4-5</td>\n      <td>CR cap minus 2-3</td>\n      <td>CR cap minus 0-1</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>For example, a group of four 5th-level characters has a CR cap of 8. A solo creature with a challenge rating of 1 or less is a trivial encounter for them, and a solo creature with a challenge rating of 6-8 is a hard encounter for them.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Low-CR Solo Creatures.</em></strong> The above guidance applies to most of the solo creatures in this book, but the ankheg is an exception — CR scales differently at low levels, and at CR 2, the ankheg has the lowest CR of any solo monster in this book. If a party has four or five characters, you can pit the ankheg (or another solo creature of CR 4 or below) against a party that's one level lower than indicated by the Solo Creature Encounters table. If a party has six or seven characters, you can pit the ankheg against a party that's two levels lower than indicated by that table.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Spend CR Budget</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your CR budget, spend it! Select creatures you want to use in the encounter and add their challenge ratings together until you get as close as you can to your CR budget. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If you're building a hard encounter, don't go over your budget (unless you want to create an extreme encounter).</li>\n  <li>If you're building an easy encounter, don't go under your budget (unless you want to create a trivial encounter).</li>\n  <li>Remember that when encounter building, minions don't count as a full creature. Refer to the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00minions0000000#building-minion-encounters]{Minion Encounter Building} table to determine how many minions count as one creature of their CR.</li>\n  <li>You typically shouldn't use more than three non-minion creatures per character. For example, a party of four player characters usually shouldn't fight more than twelve non-minion creatures at a time. Going beyond this limit could increase the difficulty of an encounter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance, if you're building a hard encounter for four 5th-level characters, you have a CR budget of 10 with a CR cap of 8. You could build any of the following encounters with these guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.oJ6dIPGUhKjqoaQS] (CR 3), a @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.pXIlc6y56vPRKUvH] (CR 4), and an @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.2iElhrhyKElR0vBl] (CR 3)</li>\n  <li>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.4upTFOYk32kxwJrv] (CR 5), ten @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.DHWWCrTe5ptVrsQ9]{Orc Blitzers} (CR 1/2 minions), and two @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.PVc35FqDD1Yj4wRI]{Orc Ramparts} (CR 2)</li>\n  <li>Four @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.vTGOSUEgJWn78e6Z]{Gnoll Abyssal Archers} (CR 1/2), a @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.h8s0NtUyG62EunQ9]{Gnoll Bonesplitter} (CR 4), four @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.RG46F3n2OQxsVIWZ]{Gnoll Marauders} (CR 1/2), and ten @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.53NRrdJYS4LhWu91]{Gnoll Wildlings} (CR 1 minions)</li>\n  <li>A @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.uhKi9cqcfAHwm8h0]{Gibbering Mouther} (CR 2) and a @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.w204aSoRouuH2fP4]{Time Raider Nemesis} (CR 8)</li>\n  <li>Five @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.MzK9Zb0fL2B09YsU]{Ogres} (CR 2)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Start Slow</h3>\n  <p>The creatures in this book have more flexibility and depth than those presented in the core rules. Many of their attacks do more than simply damage enemies. Their unique traits, bonus actions, and reactions make them more interesting — but also more complicated than other creatures. That little bit of complexity can add up if you use a lot of different stat blocks in an encounter.</p>\n  <p>Until you're used to running complex encounters, take it easy the first few times you use a stat block from this book — we recommend not using more than three unfamiliar stat blocks in an encounter. While it might be tempting to use every gnoll in one grand battle, give yourself time to figure out how these creatures work before using a bunch of stat blocks at once.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<h1>Tweaking Difficulty</h1>\n<p>While these new encounter-building guidelines can help you target the difficulty of an encounter, it's impossible for any system to account for the countless details that vary widely from game to game. Keep an eye out for the following factors when building encounters, and tweak the difficulty as needed.</p>\n\n<h3>Party Composition</h3>\n<p>A well-rounded party with a cleric, a fighter, a rogue, and a wizard is going to handle combat differently than a group of four barbarians. The new encounter-building system works well for the former group, but a group of typical barbarians tears through combat with melee-focused enemies … and loses just as quickly against foes who force them to make a lot of Intelligence or Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n<p>Keep the mix of character classes and other features in mind as you build encounters. Play to the characters' strengths when you want to ensure success. Exploit their weaknesses when you want to challenge them — but do so sparingly. First and foremost, the game should be fun.</p>\n<p>You can increase the encounter's difficulty one step (for example, from standard to hard) if the encounter exploits most of the characters' weaknesses. Decrease it one step if it plays into most of their strengths.</p>\n\n<h3>Player Play Styles</h3>\n<p>The mechanics of fifth edition reward system mastery. Experienced and rules-invested players often build characters who are more powerful than average by synergizing ancestries, classes, feats, spells, and other elements of the game. Likewise, players who are less experienced or rules invested may build characters below average power. Depending on who plays in your group, you may need to tweak the numbers to challenge (or avoid slaughtering) the characters.</p>\n\n<h3>Magic Items</h3>\n<p>The core rules make some brief suggestions about distributing magic items, but there are no hard-and-fast rules about how many or what kind of magic items to give to characters. Some GMs shower characters with countless baubles and <em>vorpal swords</em> while others hand out one <em>potion of healing</em> once every five levels. Most games are somewhere in between. Keep in mind that a group with many powerful magic items is going to have a much easier time at any level. And especially at higher levels, a group with few magic items will have a tougher time battling powerful creatures — doubly so when a party without magic weapons has to overcome a creature's damage immunities and resistances!</p>\n<p>If a character has more magic items than the average suggested in the core rules, consider that character to be one level higher when determining the party's average character level.</p>\n\n<h3>Short Rests</h3>\n<p>The number of short rests the characters take during a day influences the difficulty of encounters, especially if the characters have important class features that recharge during a short rest (like the warlock's Pact Magic). A short rest after every battle makes things a lot easier, and no short rests at all makes the adventuring day much tougher the longer it goes on.</p>\n<p>If the characters take more than two short rests during an adventuring day, add an extra 2 points to your daily encounter budget.</p>\n\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>Combat encounters don't typically occur in big empty rooms. Hazards, terrain, traps, and even the shape of an environment can change the difficulty of an encounter. An encounter is easier if there's a choke point where the characters can easily fight a group of dangerous monsters one at a time, while a <em>sphere of annihilation</em> rolling through a hallway can make an easy battle turn deadly.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you may need to increase the encounter's difficulty by one step if it includes an environment that deals damage to the characters but not their enemies, or if it inflicts the blinded, charmed, dazed, frightened, petrified, poisoned, paralyzed, restrained, stunned, or unconscious conditions or similar effects on the characters but not their enemies.</p>"

          "text": "<p>This chapter presents seven villain parties in order of the threat they present in combat. As you introduce these villains to your game, keep the following guidance in mind.</p>\n<table>\n  <caption>\n    Villain Parties by Optimized Level\n  </caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Optimized Level</th>\n      <th>Party</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3rd</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.00graveorder0000]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.00abominations00]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.00blackironpac00]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.00wilderkith0000]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>11th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.00amethystknif00]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>13th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.00soulbinders000]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>15th</td>\n      <td>@UUID[.00halloweddark00]</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Portraying Villainy</h1>\n<p>All the parties in this section are explicitly villains. These characters aren't neutral mercenaries who can be negotiated with and possibly recruited. They're remorseless people who want to do bad — sometimes deeply awful — things. And in many cases, they do these things with glee. These are horrible people.</p>\n<p>We believe that the more explicitly evil your villains are, the more motivated many players are to fight them — and the more triumphant players feel when their heroes win. But this is just a matter of taste, and many GMs and players aren't interested in that kind of fantasy. They might prefer a more relatable or comedic villain, or they might prefer adventures where the heroes are pitted against nature (although this book will be of little use in that event). We like those things too!</p>\n<p>The creatures in this book all conform to a certain tone of realism and plausibility filtered through the lens of drama. But it's difficult for even this mighty tome to compete with real-world villainy in terms of sheer horrific evil — and some players don't want their games to compete like that. It's essential to know your table, talk to your players, and get a sense of what kinds of drama they enjoy and engage with. If you read these entries and find a villain's motives or methods too awful for your table, you have the option to reskin them, keeping their statistics and changing their fiction. We recommend using safety tools, like the ones found in the free <a href=\"https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit\">MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit</a>, to facilitate clear and concise communication with your players about anything that makes them or you uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>This book took care of designing, testing, and balancing the powers and features of these villains. The way you use them now is up to you. If you like the implementation of the Black Iron Pact but find their bigotry gross, you could make them the leaders of a cult, a secret society trying to overthrow a beloved leader, or whatever makes sense for your world!</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, this book is yours. These villains are yours. Use them however you see fit.</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.cQsjpK0CRDQbmzgl]</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Individual Villains</h3>\n  <p>While the villain parties presented in this chapter are meant to fight the characters together, you can always have the heroes take on villains individually before the final showdown. Those individual fights should still be memorable, so give your villain a few henchmen, a cool consumable magic item, and a decent means of escape (or resurrection).</p>\n</aside>\n<h1>Optimized Party Level</h1>\n<p>Each villain party is optimized to battle five characters of a specific level, as noted on the Villain Parties by Optimized Level table. These challenges were calculated assuming all members of the villain party are encountered in combat together. They're designed to give characters of the optimized level a fun challenge, especially if the heroes have already expended some resources on another encounter or two.</p>\n<p>Each party's villains are meant to be fought together as a group. They are a difficult encounter for a party of the optimized level, so don't throw too many prelude encounters at your characters. They'll need all the spell slots, powerful features, and other resources they can get to survive!</p>\n<h1>Villain Party Actions</h1>\n<p>Villain party actions work much like an action-oriented creature's villain actions (see @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00rules1.JournalEntryPage.00actionorient00]{Action-Oriented Creatures} in the introduction), with the following changes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Instead of one creature having three villain actions, a party shares a pool of five villain party actions.</li>\n  <li>Each villain party action is performed by a specific creature in the villain party, and each can be used once during an encounter after an enemy's turn.</li>\n  <li>The party can take these actions in any order, but only one villain can use theirs each round.</li>\n  <li>A villain action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't incapacitated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each party's section presents their villain actions in a recommended order for dramatic effect, often saving the most devastating for last. Odds are that you won't use every villain party action in a single encounter, as some creatures will be defeated before they get to use their action. That's okay! If every villain action were used in an encounter, it would be deadly indeed.</p>\n<h1>Slow Burn</h1>\n<p>To create the most dramatic showdown with a villain party, you should build tension between the characters and their adversaries before it all goes down. Make the players eager for a chance to take down these wicked foes.</p>\n<p>To start, have the characters learn about the evils of the villains firsthand before ever coming face to face with a member of the group. For instance, you could have the characters stumble upon the aftermath of the Wilderkith's destruction of a peaceful community before ever meeting the terrorists.</p>\n<p>Then you should have the characters interact with lackeys of the villain party. They might even cross swords with one or two of the individual members of the party or see them from afar. Give the characters ample opportunity to ruin one or more of the party's plots and learn about each individual villain. The more information they gain and plans they foil, the better!</p>\n<p>Eventually, after enough foiled plans at the hands of the characters, the villain party should strike back. This could be the moment of the final showdown if you're running a shorter game, or you could have the villain party hit the characters where it hurts. Just like the characters might be researching the villains, the evildoers look into the heroes. The villain party might raze a location important to the characters, harm or kidnap one of their NPC allies, or destroy or steal an object of great personal importance. The villains should make it clear they were the ones who did this and leave an obvious message for the characters that says something like, “Back off if you don't want more bad things to happen to everything you love.”</p>\n<p>After all this, if the characters haven't decided to take on the villains directly, then the evildoers bring the fight to them. They lay a trap and spring it the first chance they get, laying it all on the line to get rid of the characters who have caused them so much anguish.</p>"

It's dark and raining, and they were still cramming chunks of elf flesh in their mouths when you fled. But as you catch your breath, your mind explodes in pain, driving you to your knees.

You can similarly skip the descriptions of them butchering bodies, eating people, and other violent and gory details.</p>\n  <p>The Abominations' origin story involves countless rounds of experimentation on sapient creatures followed by the murder of any creations deemed “imperfect.” If this is hurtful for anyone in your game, you could decide that N'shalla and Evae's earlier creations were unable to live for more than a short time (if at all), or simply skip the experimental batches entirely.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.Bo7kONKFFnhdDX7j]</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Perhaps some evil deity brought the Abominations' creators together. Maybe it was just a cruel trick of fate. After their respective orders exiled them for magical experimentation on unwilling subjects, the druid N'shalla and the mage Evae Yawn crossed paths — and instantly fell in love. With their passions and forbidden knowledge combined, the twisted pair took up their dark work.</p>\n<p>Determined to create bloodthirsty monsters who would exact revenge on the lovers' old organizations, N'shalla and Evae produced batch after batch of monstrosities, destroying any they considered less than perfect. Evae began each creation by growing a lifeless humanoid husk from raw materials, and N'shalla replaced its head and limbs with wild animal parts. Then together, they gave the monsters life… and when the creatures inevitably proved flawed, the evil lovers ended them and started over yet again. After ten years of failure, Evae and N'shalla finally believed themselves victorious — they had created a band of five creatures who seemed the ultimate combination of strength, beauty, ferocity, and cold intelligence. But the monstrosities weren't obedient. They were hungry.</p>\n<p>N'shalla's final words before being torn apart were, “You are not our children. You are abominations!” After devouring both creators, their children remained hungry. They went hunting.</p>\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<p>The Abominations have one goal — consume the flesh, organs, and bones of powerful humanoids. They zealously believe this makes them stronger, both physically and spiritually. The obsessed predators have no other hobbies or interests. There is only the next hunt.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>The monstrosities set up camp outside of humanoid settlements, observing the population for days before selecting the most worthy meal. Adventurers make the finest meat, for they hold great power — and few common folk investigate the deaths of heroes with a dangerous lifestyle. The Abominations have a particular taste for those who practice arcane or nature magic, as it reminds them of their first meal. Such prey is slowly and ritualistically sacrificed, taken apart and devoured joint by joint.</p>\n<p>The villains typically wait patiently for prey to venture out of a city or town before striking, but if a target is particularly tempting, they're willing to risk sneaking into a settlement at night. They kidnap and later enjoy their meals together in a safe location, rather than eating victims on the spot, and they never stay in a single hunting ground for long. While traveling from one city to the next, they eat waylaid travelers and errant farmers, though this is far from their preferred diet.</p>\n\n<h1>Party Members</h1>\n<h2>Boog</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00boog0000000000 inline]\n\n<h2>Ceemal</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00ceemal00000000 inline]\n\n<h2>Excess</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00excess00000000 inline]\n\n<h2>Klar</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00klar0000000000 inline]\n\n<h2>Sair</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00sair0000000000 inline]\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Sair's Got Range</h3>\n  <p>Sair's flying speed paired with the 120-foot range of their Psionic Bolt attack means they never need to engage the characters in melee.

Because this evil exists in the real world, roleplaying the Black Iron Pact could make the game unsafe and unfun for some players. Discuss these topics with your group before running the Black Iron Pact to gauge their enthusiasm for taking on such villains. Some players may be eager to take down these bigots, while for others, the injustice might hit too close to reality. You can always change the motivations of the Black Iron Pact, perhaps making them cultists who want to claim the greatest city in the world for a tyrannical deity. That's an evil enough agenda for most heroes to take action!</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>A secret society created to overthrow Capital's political and cultural structure, the Black Iron Pact draws its name from Ajax's sobriquet, the Iron Saint. Iron is a metal with deep symbolism to the tyrannical saint.</p>\n<p>The five most powerful members of the pact — the High Command — formally lead the society and serve as its strike team. The identity and whereabouts of the Black Iron Pact's original founder are closely guarded secrets, known only to Ajax and the High Command.</p>\n<p>The pact's true numbers also remain a mystery, and many citizens work for them unknowingly. Such subterfuge ensures the pact's agents can't be traced back to the High Command.</p>\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<p>The Black Iron Pact's primary goal is the conquest of Capital and the installation of Ajax as its ruler and god. The pact's agents are true believers of Ajax's gospel, which seeks change through force and violence. Their evil belief is that humans are the true owners of this world, and as such, only humans can join the Black Iron Pact, though the society employs nonhuman pawns when risk of capture or death is high. Additionally, many members of the pact — notably senior member Erasmus and his wife Avalla — openly sneer at the idea of guilds (essentially scorning everyone in the middle class), and they object to anyone but a human man holding public office, owning any assets, or even learning to read.</p>\n<p>To achieve Ajax's conquest, the pact seeks the location of Ringwell, a long-lost ancient repository of powerful and dangerous items from a fallen empire. They intend to plunder the vault and deliver the greatest artifacts to Ajax.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>The High Command maintains a private demiplane known as the Cyst, a small worldlet only a few miles across which senior members can access through magic items called the <em>iron rings</em> (see @UUID[.00blackironpac00#magic-items]{Magic Items} later in this entry). The Cyst is both a stronghold and a staging area for the pact's combat missions, though most rank-and-file members don't know of its existence.</p>\n<p>The leaders of the High Command deal with their enemies as a team, bringing overwhelming force to any conflict. They don't allow any survivors who might report their existence, since High Command includes nobles and guild leaders whose membership in this cult must remain secret.</p>\n<p>The Black Iron Pact enacts their plans only after meticulous research and forethought. When members of the High Command assault an objective, they catch their enemies unaware and unprepared, ensuring victory. If things go awry, they can retreat using an <em>iron ring</em>.</p>\n<h1>Party Members</h1>\n<h2>Lord Erasmus Deseo</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00lorderasmusd00 inline]</p>\n<h2>Canon Athenodorus</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00canonathenod00 inline]</p>\n<h2>Cloak</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00cloak000000000 inline]</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Who is Cloak?</h3>\n  <p>We have intentionally left the identity of Cloak a mystery so that you can better work the Black Iron Pact into your campaign's story.

For her crime, a council of archfey imprisoned her in the Gemhollow — an ancient crystal deep in Arcadia, the realm of fey. For millennia, she watched as civilizations sprang up and hurt nature in their attempts to tame it. Her rage and desire for vengeance festered until a group of curious elves broke her free.</p>\n<p>The vengeful dryad appealed to the elves, plants, and forest fey to help her save the Mundane World from humanoid expansion.

To this band, burning a city is an act of pure good, as the ash makes way for the next generation of plants so the cycle of nature can continue.</p>\n<p>The Wilderkith despise those who cut down trees, dig mines, or otherwise try to tame or take from the land. Their doctrine holds no hope for such people, believing them destined to destroy themselves and the world around them.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Wilderkith know they aren't as powerful as all the major civilizations of the Mundane World. Their vandalism alone can't turn the tide, but no other group possesses the courage to end the disease of civilization. The Wilderkith seek any power that can help them restore untamed wilderness, rule over it, and prevent the rise of future civilizations.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>The Wilderkith rely on guerilla warfare, using their understanding of the land to their advantage. They strike poorly defended settlements in the dead of night, destroying all they can before retreating into the forest, then back to the Gemhollow. This crystal prison once held Anthracia, but the Wilderkith turned it into a fortress — one they can ritually summon to a new location.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, the Wilderkith set their sights on bigger targets, using destruction to send a message to those who think they're safe behind tall stone walls. Rapid plant growth reclaiming fresh ruins is a common Wilderkith calling card.</p>\n<h1>Party Members</h1>\n<h2>Anthracia, Princess of Venom</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00anthraciapri00 inline]\n\n<h2>Logger</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00logger00000000 inline]\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">What is Logger?</h3>\n  <p>Logger is a one-of-a-kind plant creature created by Anthracia from the branches of her tree.

Harlo and his expedition discovered a dagger made of a purple crystal unlike anything they had seen before. When they removed the strange weapon from its stone dais, thunderous energy collapsed the vault and shattered the dagger, releasing an explosive pulse of violet psionic power.</p>\n<p>After recovering from the blast and escaping the ruins, the five survivors found they had acquired strange new powers and a shared telepathic link. With this new development, Harlo revealed his true nature as the head of a small criminal organization. He convinced the others to use their new powers to help grow and expand his group's influence — in exchange for a share of the profits and power, of course. They renamed the organization after the strange alien relic that had gifted them new powers and opportunities, and together, they reforged Harlo's small criminal enterprise into a blossoming underworld syndicate.</p>\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<p>The Amethyst Knife seeks three things above all: wealth, influence, and control. They're willing to acquire these through any means necessary, caring little for who gets hurt or what must be sacrificed in the process. To the Knife, the ends always justify the means.</p>\n<p>The syndicate is always expanding their network of spies, informants, and in-pocket influential figures. Most recently, the Amethyst Knife set their sights on the noble houses of the great port city of Capital, dispatching spies and underlings to infiltrate those houses and discover new opportunities.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>The Amethyst Knife builds its wealth in every criminal scheme imaginable: smuggling, protection fees, assassination contracts, and more. Its bosses then invest the money from these criminal enterprises into legitimate businesses — which prove remarkably profitable, thanks to the Knife coercing local leaders to make favorable laws and scaring the competition out of the game.</p>\n<p>While the bosses of the Amethyst Knife let nothing stand in their way, they avoid attracting too much attention. The group uses subterfuge and pawns to avoid the ire of law enforcement and so-called heroes. Bribing or blackmailing prominent figures, subverting laws and contracts, threatening loved ones, and manipulating marks into desperate situations are all common tactics.</p>\n<p>When subtle manipulations fail, the Amethyst Knife strikes their foes with swift, merciless violence. Minor threats and obstacles can be resolved with freelance assassins or mercenaries, but serious opposition merits intervention from the Knife's bosses. Using their psionic powers, shared minds, and varied skill sets, they wait for a vulnerable moment. If an attack goes awry, the Amethyst Knife fades into the shadows to find a better approach — such as slowly picking off a rival group one by one.</p>\n<h1>Party Members</h1>\n<h2>Harlo Honeygrin</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00harlohoneygr00 inline]\n\n<h2>Jutkarr Flintfingers</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00jutkarrflint00 inline]\n\n<h2>Llyvessa</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00llyvessa000000 inline]\n\n<h2>Treyvan von Hirnschmann</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00treyvanvonhi00 inline]\n\n<h2>Victory “Vic” Graves</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00victoryvicgr00 inline]\n<h1>Magic Items</h1>\n<p>After returning from their fateful expedition, two members of the Amethyst Knife used the shattered remains of the crystal dagger to forge psionic items for themselves.

In the case of the Soulbinders, their ignorance and greed bound their souls into cursed items that feed off the life force of their wielders.</p>\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.uA0f2wDpG0CKUSgo]</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Content Warning: Possession</h3>\n  <p>The Soulbinders are a once-humanoid collective transformed into sapient, cursed magic items. They possess, transform, and burn the life force of their wielders. If your group would rather avoid the topic of possession, you can instead make the Soulbinders power-hungry warriors whose magic weapons draw on their own life force.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Millennia ago, the Soulbinders were a mortal band of explorers. Prince Ellan Farra traveled with his sage advisor, a duo of mercenaries, and a spelunker guide to find their eternal reward — a scroll containing an ancient ritual to grant immortality.</p>\n<p>When the party found the ancient text, their ambition blinded them to the ritual's true cost. Each explorer offered a personal treasure, expecting the ritual to consume it. Instead, as the scroll disintegrated, the spell destroyed their bodies and trapped their souls in these objects. Worse, the Soulbinders learned that to fuel their power and truly experience immortal life, they must consume the souls of others, puppeteering the body of each unsuspecting victim until their life force burns out.</p>\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<p>No record shows how long the Soulbinders have existed, and even they have long forgotten. Unsatisfied with their cursed existence, their hunger remains unsated, for their immortality means nothing without power. The Soulbinders have resolved to achieve godhood, escape their prisons, and elevate their souls to a higher existence.</p>\n<p>The Soulbinders believe that in forcing people to worship them as gods, they will in fact become gods. Their main goal is to bring new lands and peoples under their control, then use those resources to acquire even more. The group also searches for new sources of magical power that might hasten their deification.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>The Soulbinders' unquenchable ambitions and dark magics often require the sacrifice of innocents or other unspeakable acts of violence.</p>\n<p>To function, each Soulbinder also needs a body to possess and transform into their old self — and to acquire such a body, a hapless mortal must attune to the cursed item that binds the villain's soul. Once possessed, the victim remains distressingly aware of their former body's actions. The Soulbinders who have obtained bodies aid those who lack one, often by offering unsuspecting adventurers a cursed item as a reward or by planting it where it might be discovered by a chosen traveler. After possessing a user, the victim's soul is consumed over time and the bodies eventually burn out into dust.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Blackstone Manor.</strong></em> The Soulbinders operate from a fortified mansion they call Blackstone Manor, built from the old temple ruins where they first discovered the cursed ritual. A secret passage in the manor's cellar hides the Walk of Bones, an ancient vault and shrine bearing walls inlaid with ash and bone fragments from the Soulbinders' possessed victims.\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">It's Not Me!</h3>\n  <p>Even after a Soulbinder's magic item settles its curse on a new victim, the Soulbinder must wait until the victim's will weakens enough for possession. In the meantime, the Soulbinder builds a friendly relationship with their wearer, striving to convince them that the curse is caused by some other magical force in their life. Since the ill effects of the curse don't manifest for days, it's usually easy to blame the curse on other newly acquired objects or recent events.</p>\n</aside>\n<h1>Party Members</h1>\n<h2>Argan Rael</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00arganrael00000 inline]\n\n<h2>Kishina Darrowind</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00kishinadarro00 inline]\n\n<h2>Prince Ellan Farra</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00princeellanf00 inline]\n\n<h2>Radlee “The Grim” Thugram</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00radleethegri00 inline]\n\n<h2>Scarlet Shadow</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00scarletshado00 inline]\n<h1>Magic Items</h1>\n<p>Each Soulbinder wears a magic item that houses their eternal soul:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Argan Rael:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.items.Item.B3Dl94TWL3uMHDBA]</li>\n  <li><strong>Kishina Darrowind:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.items.Item.Pp3YI6SD5hkDNjq8]</li>\n  <li><strong>Prince Ellan Farra:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.items.Item.EqF0WGmb6On7rh5c]</li>\n  <li><strong>Radlee “The Grim” Thugram:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.items.Item.3cwLjb6toob1Yv3w]</li>\n  <li><strong>Scarlet Shadow:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.items.Item.tf77g2CT9U6OOTco]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a Soulbinder's body is killed, their magic item can be recovered as treasure.

Performing this ritual near all five items restores each Soulbinder's original body and transfers their souls out of the items back into their bodies.

If you or your players wouldn't enjoy a game with such themes, you should focus the cult's actions on the ritual to bring back the dragon instead of terrorism and torture.</p>\n  <p>Draven Malas is a blood mage who can boil the blood of his foes. If such descriptions would ruin the fun for anyone in your group, his magic can affect the energy and vitality of foes instead.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>For many, the Sun Eater was a figure of mere myth and nightmare — but not for Aronar and Athmia Valkys, half-elf twins born under an eclipse. Every birthday brought them whispered promises of power and visions of a dragon swallowing the sun. The twins traveled deep to a forgotten underground temple where they found vials of Qazyldrath's blood. In a profane ritual, the twins each consumed a vial of blood; in return, Qazyldrath set one of the wyrm's eyes in each of their heads, granting them supernatural powers. The wyrm also bestowed magical rings on the twins as a mark of favor.</p>\n<p>Though Aronar and Athmia were Qazyldrath's first priests of the modern age, the dragon sent similar whispers to three more chosen. Each arrived at the slumbering wyrm's church and gained a dragon's blessings: the tiefling Caithas grew wings, Vivienn's human body was empowered with dragon sinew, and Draven's human blood was replaced with that of a dragon.</p>\n<p>Together, they are the Hallowed Dark — and they will expunge every trace of light from this world.</p>\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<p>The Hallowed Dark ultimately wish to restore Qazyldrath to power and end this wretched world. In exchange, the dragon promises dominion over the shadowed world to come.</p>\n<p>Methodical, patient, and cruel, the cultists know the path to the lightless world is a long and arduous one — and in the meantime, they relish the suffering they inflict on their path to forever dark. This apocalypse cult commands as much terror as the Sun Eater they seek to reawaken, becoming nightmares for all who cross their path.</p>\n<h2>Methods</h2>\n<p>Qazyldrath communicates intermittently with the Hallowed Dark through visions, dreams, and impressions, drawing their priests to dark corners of the world. In these remote places, the cult enacts a series of costly and prolonged rituals to reawaken the Silent Decay. The rituals require rare, void-touched components: fallen stars and meteorites, the hearts or minds of eldritch entities, deep-mined iron wielded by those who travel between planes, and more.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the cult spreads darkness and fear. They believe terror crushes hope, and without hope, people will buckle when the end approaches. The Hallowed Dark has committed many atrocities — terrorist attacks on temples and government buildings, destruction of systems that provide societal structure and safety, wanton slaughter, and torture of those they bother to leave alive. If the whimpering mortals they spare go wailing to others about Qazyldrath's return — well, all the better.</p>\n<h1>Party Members</h1>\n<h2>Aronar Valkys</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00aronarvalkys00 inline]\n\n<h2>Athmia Valkys</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00athmiavalkys00 inline]\n\n<h2>Caithas</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00caithas0000000 inline]\n\n<h2>Draven Malas</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00dravenmalas000 inline]\n\n<h2>Vivienn Dirroze</h2>\n@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe04.JournalEntryPage.00vivienndirro00 inline]\n<h1>Magic Items</h1>\n<p>Qazyldrath entrusted Aronar and Athmia with two rings: Aronar with the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.items.Item.ODBMbvaqroZ2r6by] and Athmia with the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.items.Item.ehDm1wN266gzwgJC].</p>\n<h2>Sun Eater's Soul</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.items.Item.ODBMbvaqroZ2r6by inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.RenA5W7IcoHnEpcT]</p>\n<h2>Sun Eater's Mind</h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.items.Item.ehDm1wN266gzwgJC inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[cite=false Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe09.JournalEntryPage.WFtEqW7nlrepqRlt]</p>\n<h1>Villain Party Actions</h1>\n<p>The Hallowed Dark has five villain party actions.
