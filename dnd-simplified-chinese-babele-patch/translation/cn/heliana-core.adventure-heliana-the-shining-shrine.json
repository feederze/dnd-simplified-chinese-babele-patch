      "description": "<p>Greetings, hunter! What you have here is a monster hunt from <em>Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting</em>. Heliana's hunts require your players to find the monster, picking up clues along the way, and then defeat it in an epic multi-wave boss battle. Be<strong> really obvious</strong> with the clues; make sure to give out the associated handouts. After the clues have been collected, but before the boss fight begins, the players should always have a chance to long rest and use what they've learned to prepare for the fight ahead.</p><p></p><p>This hunt makes full use of the Tracking, Harvesting, Crafting, and Cooking rules from Heliana's—be sure to read up on those! Using the Cooking rules to prepare magical meals is a great way the players can monopolise on the clues! Each of these Foundry Adventures comes with:</p><ul><li><p>PDF of the hunt.</p></li><li><p>Three clue handouts to be given to the players before they meet the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Handouts of the fantastical things the players might see along the way.</p></li><li><p>Walled and lit scenes, with each wave's monsters separated by level.</p></li><li><p>Actors with original tokens.</p></li><li><p>Lair actions given their own actor (be sure to put it at initiative count 20!).</p></li><li><p>Magic items that can be found during the hunt, as well as those that can be crafted from the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Spells that the monsters and magic items use.</p></li></ul><p>This hunt, The Shining Shrine, is optimised for a party of 4 with an average party level of 2, 7, or 12. Characters who complete this adventure should earn enough experience to progress all the way to 3rd level, onethird of the way to 8th level, or two-fifths of the way to 13th level. The adventurers must rid a holy hot spring of a territorial and radiant fey owlbear.</p><p></p><p>After gathering information about this creature, the hunt culminates in a three-wave boss battle against a variety of fey. This battle is deadly and uses the party’s entire daily XP budget. Equipment for an extended fight and a means of creating magical darkness will prove great boons in this endeavour.</p>",
