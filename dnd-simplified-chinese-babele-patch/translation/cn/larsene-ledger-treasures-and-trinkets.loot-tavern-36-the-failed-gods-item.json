      "description": "<p>With a word, this two-finger signet ring becomes incandescent with the heat of the waxen god's ire. Its brand can bless a creature or, if the brand is twisted and distorted in the process of being applied, curse the creature.</p><p>This ring has 5 charges and regains [[/r 1d3]] expended charges daily at dawn. As a bonus action while wearing the ring, you can speak the ring's command word, causing the waxen god's emblem to become searing hot until you remove it, or until you use a bonus action to repeat its command word and deactivate it.</p><p><strong><em>Brand of Protection.</em></strong> While the ring is heated, you can use a bonus action to touch it to a willing creature within your reach and expend 1 charge. The target takes [[/r 1d4]] fire damage and gains the benefits of the shield of faith spell for 10 minutes.</p><p><strong><em>Brand of Castigation.</em></strong> While the ring is heated, you can use an action to make a melee spell attack (+7 to hit) against a creature within 5 feet of you and expend 1 charge. On a hit, the creature takes [[/r 2d4]] fire damage and is cursed for 1 minute. While cursed in this way, its AC is reduced by 2. The creature can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on a success. You must concentrate on the effects of the brand, as if on a spell.</p>"
