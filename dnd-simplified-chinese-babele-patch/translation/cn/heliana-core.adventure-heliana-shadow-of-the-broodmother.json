      "description": "<p>Greetings, hunter! What you have here is a monster hunt from <em>Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting</em>. Heliana's hunts require your players to find the monster, picking up clues along the way, and then defeat it in an epic multi-wave boss battle. Be<strong> really obvious</strong> with the clues; make sure to give out the associated handouts. After the clues have been collected, but before the boss fight begins, the players should always have a chance to long rest and use what they've learned to prepare for the fight ahead.</p><p></p><p>This hunt makes full use of the Tracking, Harvesting, Crafting, and Cooking rules from Heliana's—be sure to read up on those! Using the Cooking rules to prepare magical meals is a great way the players can monopolise on the clues! Each of these Foundry Adventures comes with:</p><ul><li><p>PDF of the hunt.</p></li><li><p>Three clue handouts to be given to the players before they meet the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Handouts of the fantastical things the players might see along the way.</p></li><li><p>Walled and lit scenes, with each wave's monsters separated by level.</p></li><li><p>Actors with original tokens.</p></li><li><p>Lair actions given their own actor (be sure to put it at initiative count 20!).</p></li><li><p>Magic items that can be found during the hunt, as well as those that can be crafted from the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Spells that the monsters and magic items use.</p></li></ul><h3>About This Hunt</h3><p>This hunt, <em>Shadow of the Broodmother</em>, is intended for 3 to 7 characters with an average player level (APL) of <strong>5</strong>, <strong>11</strong>, or <strong>17</strong>. Characters who complete this hunt should earn enough experience to progress one-quarter of the way to 6th level or halfway of the way to 12th or 18th level. The adventurers must find and defeat the remnants of a rare swamp aboleth that has purportedly already been killed by a group of celebrated adventurers. After hunting for clues about this aberration, the hunt culminates in a three-wave boss battle. This battle is deadly and uses the party’s entire daily XP budget. A party well-equipped for an extended fight, as well as means of alleviating disease and mind control, will prove beneficial on this monster hunt.</p><h3>Credits</h3><p><strong>Lead Designers</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Lead Writer</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Rule Development</strong>: Max Wartelle, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih</p><p><strong>Additional Writing</strong>: João Araújo, Mage Armoire, Tony Casper, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Jethro Mellors, Duncan Watson</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Phylea, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Formatting</strong>: Sally Kay Clark, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Proofing</strong>: João Araújo, Sally Kay Clark, Jessic Gombart, Victor Matyiku</p><p><strong>Art Directors</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Layout</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Cover Illustrator</strong>: Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Interior Illustrators</strong>: Diogo Assunçao, Hannah Elizabeth Baker, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Luciano Javier Carreira, Ivy Dolamore, Aleksa Drageljevic, Sam Jumisko, Michelle Mueller, Derek Murphy, Mikhail Palamarchuk, Joris Sanchez, Ognjen Sporin, Bryan Syme, Chaouki ‘’Ciao’” Titouhi, Denis Zhbankov</p><p><strong>Cartographers</strong>: Cze &amp; Peku, Mad Cartographer</p><p><strong>Cacophonics the Bard</strong>: Jack Patchett</p><p><strong>Ambience</strong>: Michaël Ghelfi Studios</p><p><strong>Marketing Consultant</strong>: Ricardo Evangelho</p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong>: Ethen Adams, Sally Kay Clark, Ricardo Evangelho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Piotr “Narb” Wiśnios</p><p><strong>Playtesters:</strong> A11star, Adam Bohkari, Addy, aj, alpha_spark, Alzebub, Balbowa, Blanket, Buront, Catbath, Constantine, cypheur, Danger7778, Derpy, Douglas, Erunas, Feria, Ghost, GremlinRemy, GrimOptimist, Igris, Jambo Kaka, jasoncelic, Jesse Marek, JonDemand, junkdroid, Kaniki, Kensho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Kobe Montour, Korren, Kristjan the Necrom, luke4495, Megan Pisarik, MementoMorrie, MonoXideAtWork, MrMonneypenny, Naming Fae, narnia3756, NeK0z, Neldu, NickWolf8 , One True Doge, Osirusblue, Phillip , PulsarCologne, RabidAmazonian, Relle, Rohdry, RutledgeHusband, SendHelp, Shadowpaine, Siggy, Sir Mk, SleepySpartan, Solo, Stevie Friesth, Taoko, teepea298, TheNewBadHombre, TinyKitty, Toria, Truwolf, Ulysses, victorcree, Victor Matyiku, vivacia, Watermelon, wyvernvalet, Zachary Nix</p><p><strong>FoundryVTT Conversion: </strong>Phillip \"ChefTinyT\" Lewis, Jan \"Vauxs\", Zach \"Gander7\" Allen</p>",

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p><p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.</p><p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.</p><p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p></section><p>The swallybog uses control water.</p>",

class=\"None\"><em>Aboleth broodmothers weave a rich genetic tapestry with the ecosystem in which they settle. A broodmother does not evolve via the mechanisms proposed by many famous zoologists, but rather assimilates the adaptations that other species develop through natural selection. After ingesting an organism, special enzymes within a broodmother’s gastric tract extract useful genes and mutations, apportioning them to the relevant organs in the broodmother’s form. One of those adaptations was a failsafe: a means of storing its memories, gathering biomass, and reforming itself.</em></span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Sidebar_Quote-Last-Signoff\"><span class=\"None\"><em>— Dr. Doolots, Anthrozoologist</em></span></p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/adventures/heliana-shadow-of-the-broodmother/images/journal/Broodmother-Sketch-Broodmother.webp\">"
