      "description": "<p>Greetings, hunter! What you have here is a monster hunt from <em>Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting</em>. Heliana's hunts require your players to find the monster, picking up clues along the way, and then defeat it in an epic multi-wave boss battle. Be<strong> really obvious</strong> with the clues; make sure to give out the associated handouts. After the clues have been collected, but before the boss fight begins, the players should always have a chance to long rest and use what they've learned to prepare for the fight ahead.</p><p>This hunt makes full use of the Tracking, Harvesting, Crafting, and Cooking rules from Heliana's—be sure to read up on those! Using the Cooking rules to prepare magical meals is a great way the players can monopolise on the clues! Each of these Foundry Adventures comes with:</p><ul><li><p>PDF of the hunt.</p></li><li><p>Three clue handouts to be given to the players before they meet the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Handouts of the fantastical things the players might see along the way.</p></li><li><p>Walled and lit scenes, with each wave's monsters separated by level.</p></li><li><p>Actors with original tokens.</p></li><li><p>Lair actions given their own actor (be sure to put it at initiative count 20!).</p></li><li><p>Magic items that can be found during the hunt, as well as those that can be crafted from the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Spells that the monsters and magic items use.</p></li></ul><h3>About This Hunt</h3><p>This adventure, <em>Hare Raising</em>, is intended for 3 to 7 characters and is optimised for a party of 4 with an average party level (APL) of <strong>4</strong>, <strong>10</strong>, or <strong>16</strong>. Characters who complete this adventure should earn enough experience to progress one third of the way to 5th, 11th or 17th level, respectively. The adventurers travel to the Bonefields, deal with several groups of unique NPCs, and tackle the bonemonger’s osteomantic magic.</p><p>While travelling to the Bonefields, the party has three scripted encounters with NPCs: the Grey Knight, The Knights Who Say Mi, and Jim theEnchanter. All three of these groups have interacted with the bonemonger in some way, and dealing with them imparts information as to how the bonemonger might fight. After battling the bonemonger’s animated bones, the party can attack the “dire rabbit”, as it is known to the locals. The fight need not be to the death; the bonemonger is actually a trader who can be persuaded to parlay, which is easier the more hurt he becomes.</p><h3>Credits</h3><p><strong>Lead Designers</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Lead Writer</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Rule Development</strong>: Max Wartelle, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih</p><p><strong>Additional Writing</strong>: João Araújo, Mage Armoire, Tony Casper, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Jethro Mellors, Duncan Watson</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Phylea, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Formatting</strong>: Sally Kay Clark, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Proofing</strong>: João Araújo, Sally Kay Clark, Jessic Gombart, Victor Matyiku</p><p><strong>Art Directors</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Layout</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Cover Illustrator</strong>: Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Interior Illustrators</strong>: Diogo Assunçao, Hannah Elizabeth Baker, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Luciano Javier Carreira, Ivy Dolamore, Aleksa Drageljevic, Sam Jumisko, Michelle Mueller, Derek Murphy, Mikhail Palamarchuk, Joris Sanchez, Ognjen Sporin, Bryan Syme, Chaouki ‘’Ciao’” Titouhi, Denis Zhbankov</p><p><strong>Cartographers</strong>: Cze &amp; Peku, Mad Cartographer</p><p><strong>Cacophonics the Bard</strong>: Jack Patchett</p><p><strong>Ambience</strong>: Michaël Ghelfi Studios</p><p><strong>Marketing Consultant</strong>: Ricardo Evangelho</p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong>: Ethen Adams, Sally Kay Clark, Ricardo Evangelho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Piotr “Narb” Wiśnios</p><p><strong>Playtesters:</strong> A11star, Adam Bohkari, Addy, aj, alpha_spark, Alzebub, Balbowa, Blanket, Buront, Catbath, Constantine, cypheur, Danger7778, Derpy, Douglas, Erunas, Feria, Ghost, GremlinRemy, GrimOptimist, Igris, Jambo Kaka, jasoncelic, Jesse Marek, JonDemand, junkdroid, Kaniki, Kensho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Kobe Montour, Korren, Kristjan the Necrom, luke4495, Megan Pisarik, MementoMorrie, MonoXideAtWork, MrMonneypenny, Naming Fae, narnia3756, NeK0z, Neldu, NickWolf8 , One True Doge, Osirusblue, Phillip , PulsarCologne, RabidAmazonian, Relle, Rohdry, RutledgeHusband, SendHelp, Shadowpaine, Siggy, Sir Mk, SleepySpartan, Solo, Stevie Friesth, Taoko, teepea298, TheNewBadHombre, TinyKitty, Toria, Truwolf, Ulysses, victorcree, Victor Matyiku, vivacia, Watermelon, wyvernvalet, Zachary Nix</p><p><strong>FoundryVTT Conversion: </strong>Phillip \"ChefTinyT\" Lewis, Jan \"Vauxs\", Zach \"Gander7\" Allen</p>",

They are far-travelling aberrations, each developing extremely specific obsessions such as light, words, or bones. Astral hermits study their area of interest in meticulous detail, using it as a medium through which to learn more of the world.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Corporeal Forms.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">A male astral hermit is made up of two bodies: his heart and his hearth. An astral hermit’s hearth is a maze-like construction at the centre of which is a portal to the Astral Plane. The astral hermit’s heart is how he presents himself to the world. Usually, this is in a form that is inviting to creatures of that plane, a tactic which ensures plentiful trade.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Reproduction.</strong></em></span><span class=\"None\"> Male and female astral hermits lead two very different existences. A male astral hermit’s hearth is his bower, and his heart can never travel further than a few hundred feet from it. The abundance and richness of its treasures (which to the common person may appear as worthless relics) help to impress females of the species, which flit through the Astral Plane searching for portals into the hearth’s of other hermits. When a union is formed, eggs are produced and jettisoned into the astral expanse.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Crafters and Enchanters.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">Astral hermits are innately magical beings, able to imbue items or creatures with enchantments shaped by their subject of obsession. Unable to travel far from their hearths, astral hermits create reputations of skill with enchanting and use that as the currency with which they trade for relics that further fuel their obsession.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2 _idGenParaOverride-1\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Bonemonger.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">The bonemonger’s obsession is bones. Fossilised, inscribed, splintered, or fresh, the bonemonger can read the history of every bone that passes him, learning much of the creatures to which they once belonged. The bonemonger has also learnt to animate these bones with his necromantic magic, allowing them to act as guards, workers, and scouts. The bonemonger chooses the form of a tiny white rabbit as his heart, an unassuming form that is nevertheless extremely deadly when threatened.</span></p>",

              "text": "<h2>Bonemonger</h2><p>Little is known about astral hermits thanks to their propensity to set up shop in hard-to-reach locations. They are far-travelling aberrations, each developing extremely specific obsessions such as light, words, or bones. Astral hermits study their area of interest in meticulous detail, using it as a medium through which to learn more of the world.</p><p><em><strong>Corporeal Forms.</strong></em> A male astral hermit is made up of two bodies: his heart and his hearth. An astral hermit’s hearth is a maze-like construction at the centre of which is a portal to the Astral Plane. The astral hermit’s heart is how he presents himself to the world. Usually, this is in a form that is inviting to creatures of that plane, a tactic which ensures plentiful trade.</p><p><em><strong>Reproduction.</strong></em> Male and female astral hermits lead two very different existences. A male astral hermit’s hearth is his bower, and his heart can never travel further than a few hundred feet from it. The abundance and richness of its treasures (which to the common person may appear as worthless relics) help to impress females of the species, which flit through the Astral Plane searching for portals into the hearth’s of other hermits. When a union is formed, eggs are produced and jettisoned into the astral expanse.</p><p><em><strong>Crafters and Enchanters.</strong></em> Astral hermits are innately magical beings, able to imbue items or creatures with enchantments shaped by their subject of obsession. Unable to travel far from their hearths, astral hermits create reputations of skill with enchanting and use that as the currency with which they trade for relics that further fuel their obsession.</p><p><em><strong>Bonemonger.</strong></em> The bonemonger’s obsession is bones. Fossilised, inscribed, splintered, or fresh, the bonemonger can read the history of every bone that passes him, learning much of the creatures to which they once belonged. The bonemonger has also learnt to animate these bones with his necromantic magic, allowing them to act as guards, workers, and scouts. The bonemonger chooses the form of a tiny white rabbit as his heart, an unassuming form that is nevertheless extremely deadly when threatened.</p><h2>A Bonemonger's Lair</h2><p>The bonemonger’s lair is its hearth, a nacre-coated spiral, folding in on itself and distorting gravity so that down is always towards its centre. Bones adorn every surface, and can be animated to prevent intrusion by unfriendly folks Trinkets for trade can be found among the bones, making a newly formed lair a veritable hoard.</p><p>The area around a bonemonger’s lair becomes distorted by its aberrant magic, often mixing with the background magic of the plane on which it finds itself The bonemonger’s predilection for anything osseous leads to a lair that animates bones in a variety of ways. Often, this mingling of magic results in the spontaneous formation of <em>zones of retributive truth</em>, areas that punish those who lie or fail to answer questions in a timely manner.</p><h3>Regional Effects</h3><p>The area within 6 miles of the bonemonger’s lair has the following properties:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Osteomancy.</strong> Bones never really settle and always seem to be in different positions than when observed a moment ago. Sometimes, entire severed limbs might drag themselves around with no apparent goal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Veritae Mucoformus.</strong> <em>Zones of retributive truth</em> spontaneously form.
