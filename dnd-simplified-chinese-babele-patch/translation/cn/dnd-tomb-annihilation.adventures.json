Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied.</p><p>When they finally succumb, they can’t be raised—and neither can anyone else, regardless of whether they've ever received that miracle in the past. Temples and scholars of divine magic are at a loss to explain a curse that has affected the entire region, and possibly the entire world.</p>",

Painfully shy, chwingas prefer to move about unseen.</p><p>If two or more chwingas live in the same area, each one will take shelter in a different plant, rock, or body of fresh water. Though no two chwingas look exactly alike, they resemble 6-inch-tall animated dolls with strange masks, spindly limbs, and wild hair. Their appearance is sometimes foreshadowed by cool breezes, the sweet smell of flowers, and dancing fireflies. Their mere presence makes a natural setting more lush and vibrant.</p><p><em><strong>Humanoid Fascination</strong></em>. Chwingas shun most other creatures, but they find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more humanoids, its curiosity sometimes gets the better of it, and it shadows those creatures for a short time to observe them. If it takes a liking to a particular humanoid, a chwinga might use its cantrips to aid it, or might bestow a magical gift before departing. The features that attract a chwinga to a particular humanoid can vary. In some cases, a chwinga might simply like the way a humanoid walks or the way it combs its hair. Other times, it might be smitten by a humanoid’s ability to play music or to eat copious amounts of food.</p><p><em><strong>Elemental Nature</strong></em>. Chwingas sleep but don’t require air, food, or drink. They don’t have names and have no ability to speak. When a chwinga dies, it turns into a handful of flower petals, a cloud of pollen, a stone statuette resembling its former self, a marble of smooth stone, or a puddle of fresh water.</p>",

To be understood by most speaking creatures, he must “shout” a scent. Dragonbait’s known scents include: brimstone (confusion), roses (sadness), lemon (pleasure or joy), baked bread (anger), violets (danger or fear), honeysuckle (tenderness or concern), wood smoke (devotion or piety), tar (victory or celebration), and ham (nervousness or worry).</p><p>Dragonbait stands 4 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 150 pounds, and has a dry, wrinkled hide. He wields a holy avenger longsword and carries a blue, red, and white shield. Though he has traits in common with paladins, Dragonbait isn’t a member of any class. Using an ability known as the Shen-state, he can determine the alignment of any creature within 60 feet of him.</p><p><em><strong>An Unexpected Friendship</strong></em>. Dragonbait met Artus Cimber in Port Nyanzaru, and the two became fast friends. As Artus spoke of his quest to reunite with his wife, Alisanda, he was comforted by Dragonbait’s quiet manner and unusual methods of communication. With a smile and a nod, Dragonbait agreed to help Artus. A frequent visitor to Chult, the saurial understood the dangers of the jungle all too well.</p><p><em><strong>Using Dragonbait</strong></em>. Dragonbait has never been to Omu and doesn’t know where the city is located. If the characters convince Artus Cimber to help them destroy the Soulmonger, Dragonbait wants to help as well.</p>",

In addition to protecting the defenseless plant, the zombie acts as fertilizer for the young creeper vine, which grows to full size in seven days. Once it is fully grown, the new yellow musk creeper becomes mobile and bursts from its zombie host, whereupon the zombie collapses into a mound of dead offal. If the zombie is destroyed before the creeper emerges, the creeper withers and dies.</p><p><em><strong>Small Yellow Musk Zombies</strong></em>. A Medium humanoid transformed into a yellow musk zombie uses the stat block presented in this section. A Small humanoid transformed into a yellow musk zombie becomes a Small undead with 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points, but otherwise has the same statistics.</p>",

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.TkJ8Wtg1L7TZtspm]{dispel evil and good}</em> spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying the Staff.</strong></em> A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface.

The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to the ring.</p><p>The [[lookup @item.name]] is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.t6scHTmpmHBTZGTX.JournalEntryPage.YHsuCV4IZZZoyDap#sentient-magic-items]{Sentient Magic Items}). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring about the wearer’s doom.</p><details><summary><strong>More Details</strong></summary><div class=\"advice\"><h4><strong>Control Attempt</strong></h4><p>[[/save ability=cha dc=12+3 format=long]].

The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others.</p><div class=\"advice\"><h4>Ability Checks</h4><p>[[/r 1d20 + 2]]{Intelligence +2}</p><p>[[/r 1d20 + 2]]{Wisdom +2}</p><p>[[/r 1d20 + 3]]{Charisma +3}</p><p><em><strong>Nondetection.</strong></em> The [[lookup @item.name]] defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.</p></div><p><em><strong>Frozen Time.</strong></em> As long as you wear the ring, you don’t age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn’t catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn’t protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.qoFEjfrANBdrCP6m]{ghost}.</p><p><em><strong>Cold Immunity.</strong></em> While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don’t suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see <em>chapter 5</em> of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>).</p><p><em><strong>Magic.</strong></em> The [[lookup @item.name]] has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:</p><ul><li><p>You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of –30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.<br /></p></li><li>You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.DEHllCkN9GLW7cNF]{Bigby’s hand} (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.RpKjTlYASrfqUPVA]{cone of cold} (2 charges), <em>flesh to ice</em> (3 charges; as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.kozNy29b0X6exFhY]{flesh to stone} except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WN2LWEljYU6QqnRH]{ice storm} (2 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MImfWCzEPRMYD3Xp]{Otiluke’s freezing sphere} (3 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.dhqBY4TvVjxVmOZd]{sleet storm} (1 charge), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.9gYGkrL6qFTsE6fw]{spike growth} (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fzZnVKLmBMo2f5up]{wall of ice} (2 charges).</li><li>You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can’t have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: &amp;Reference[charmed apply=false], &amp;Reference[exhaustion apply=false], &amp;Reference[frightened apply=false], &amp;Reference[paralyzed apply=false], &amp;Reference[petrified apply=false], and &amp;Reference[poisoned apply=false]. The ice creature obeys only its creator’s commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses [[/damage 1d10 average]]hit points per minute as it melts. Use the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.t6scHTmpmHBTZGTX.JournalEntryPage.3RM2KPMlMrSXngN3]{guidelines} in chapter 8 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Other Properties.</strong></em> The [[lookup @item.name]] is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can’t break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as a mighty ice primordial named Cryonax.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying the Ring.</strong></em> The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.</p></details><p></p>",

When the characters meet the priest for the first time, he’s in the midst of a heated conversation with three members of the Zhentarim (NE male Tethyrian human assassins) who are looking for Artus Cimber.</p><p>The Zhents have come to the temple to see if Zitembe can cast a spell to aid in their search. Although the assassins offer payment in the form of a 500 gp ruby, Zitembe senses their evil intentions and shoos them away. The assassins seem hesitant to leave without satisfaction, but the arrival of the characters changes their minds, and they depart with scowls on their faces. The characters’ timely arrival makes Zitembe predisposed to help them.</p><p>If he’s approached for aid or advice in tracking down the Soulmonger, Zitembe’s first reaction is to express disbelief that the death curse has anything to do with Chult. If characters give a compelling argument or make a donation to the church of at least 25 gp, Zitembe agrees to “consult the guides.” This ritual takes 24 hours, during which Zitembe sees visions of “a jungle city far to the south, enclosed by cliffs and crawling with snakes” and “a black obelisk draped in vines.” He dared not peer any deeper, but he urges the characters to seek out this city and the obelisk.</p>",

Charismatic but unstable, Groak can swing from friendly to homicidal in the span of a few seconds. Because of this, his people dare not even whisper a harsh word about him. Groak wants to be seen as a visionary and a romantic, and he loves to hear stories of the outside world. However, he threatens anyone who dares to question his inflated self-image. Groak tolerates adventurers as long as they entertain him, generally agree with everything he says, and are willing to aid him in his quest to realize his divine destiny to become Nangnang’s consort.</p><hr /><p>Grungs are aggressive froglike humanoids found in rain forests and tropical jungles. They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures.</p><p>Tree-Dwelling Amphibians. Grungs live in trees and prefer shade. A grung hatchery is maintained in well-guarded ground-level pools. About three months after hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult. It takes another six to nine months for a grung juvenile to reach maturity.</p><p><em><strong>Castes and Colors</strong></em>. Grung society is a caste system. Each caste lays eggs in a separate hatching pool, and juvenile grungs join their caste upon emergence from the hatchery. All grungs are a dull greenish gray when they are born, but each individual takes on the color of its caste as it grows to adulthood.</p><p>Green grungs are the tribe’s warriors, hunters, and laborers, and blue grungs work as artisans and in other domestic roles. Supervising and guiding both groups are the purple grungs, which serve as administrators and commanders. (Use the grung stat block to represent members of the green, blue, and purple castes.)</p><p>Red grungs are the tribe’s scholars and magic users. They are superior to purple, blue, and green grungs and given proper respect even by grungs of higher status. (Use the grung wildling stat block to represent members of the red caste.)</p><p>Higher castes include orange grungs, which are elite warriors that have authority over all lesser grungs, and gold grungs, which hold the highest leadership positions. A tribe’s sovereign is always a gold grung. (Use the grung elite warrior stat block to represent members of the orange and gold castes.)</p><p>A grung normally remains in its caste for life. On rare occasions, an individual that distinguishes itself with great deeds can earn an invitation to join a higher caste. Through a combination of herbal tonics and ritual magic, an elevated grung changes color and is inducted into its new caste in the same way that a juvenile of the caste would be. From then on, the grung and its progeny are members of the higher caste.</p><p><em><strong>Naturally Toxic</strong></em>. All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures. A grung also uses venom to poison its weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Slavers</strong></em>. Grungs are always on the lookout for creatures they can capture and enslave. Grungs use slaves for all manner of menial tasks, but mostly they just like bossing them around. Slaves are fed mildly poisoned food to keep them lethargic and compliant. A creature afflicted in this way over a long period of time becomes a shell of its former self and can be restored to normalcy only by magic.</p><p><em><strong>Water Dependency</strong></em>. A grung that fails to immerse itself in water for at least 1 hour during a day suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of that day. A grung can recover from this exhaustion only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h4>Variant: Grung Poison</h4><p>Grung poison loses its potency 1 minute after being removed from a grung. A similar breakdown occurs if the grung dies. A creature &amp;Reference[poisoned apply=false]{poisoned} by a grung can suffer an additional effect that varies depending on the grung’s skin color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer poisoned by the grung.</p><p><em><strong>Green</strong></em>. The poisoned creature can’t move except to climb or make standing jumps. If the creature is flying, it can’t take any actions or reactions unless it lands.</p><p><em><strong>Blue</strong></em>. The poisoned creature must shout loudly or otherwise make a loud noise at the start and end of its turn.</p><p><em><strong>Purple</strong></em>. The poisoned creature feels a desperate need to soak itself in liquid or mud. It can’t take actions or move except to do so or to reach a body of liquid or mud.</p><p><em><strong>Red</strong></em>. The poisoned creature must use its action to eat if food is within reach.</p><p><em><strong>Orange</strong></em>. The poisoned creature is frightened of its allies.</p><p><em><strong>Gold</strong></em>. The poisoned creature is charmed and can speak Grung.</p></aside>",

She whispers favorable signs and omens in the king’s ear to keep in his good graces. Secretly, Krr’ook suspects that the Great Ritual to summon Nangnang will fail. Consequently, she fears for her life. She approaches the adventurers to see if they can help her fool the king on the night of the ritual. If Krr’ook senses anything out of kilter, or if the ritual goes awry, she scapegoats the adventurers and delivers them straight into the king’s infantile wrath.</p><hr /><p>Grungs are aggressive froglike humanoids found in rain forests and tropical jungles. They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures.</p><p>Tree-Dwelling Amphibians. Grungs live in trees and prefer shade. A grung hatchery is maintained in well-guarded ground-level pools. About three months after hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult. It takes another six to nine months for a grung juvenile to reach maturity.</p><p><em><strong>Castes and Colors</strong></em>. Grung society is a caste system. Each caste lays eggs in a separate hatching pool, and juvenile grungs join their caste upon emergence from the hatchery. All grungs are a dull greenish gray when they are born, but each individual takes on the color of its caste as it grows to adulthood.</p><p>Green grungs are the tribe’s warriors, hunters, and laborers, and blue grungs work as artisans and in other domestic roles. Supervising and guiding both groups are the purple grungs, which serve as administrators and commanders. (Use the grung stat block to represent members of the green, blue, and purple castes.)</p><p>Red grungs are the tribe’s scholars and magic users. They are superior to purple, blue, and green grungs and given proper respect even by grungs of higher status. (Use the grung wildling stat block to represent members of the red caste.)</p><p>Higher castes include orange grungs, which are elite warriors that have authority over all lesser grungs, and gold grungs, which hold the highest leadership positions. A tribe’s sovereign is always a gold grung. (Use the grung elite warrior stat block to represent members of the orange and gold castes.)</p><p>A grung normally remains in its caste for life. On rare occasions, an individual that distinguishes itself with great deeds can earn an invitation to join a higher caste. Through a combination of herbal tonics and ritual magic, an elevated grung changes color and is inducted into its new caste in the same way that a juvenile of the caste would be. From then on, the grung and its progeny are members of the higher caste.</p><p><em><strong>Naturally Toxic</strong></em>. All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures. A grung also uses venom to poison its weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Slavers</strong></em>. Grungs are always on the lookout for creatures they can capture and enslave. Grungs use slaves for all manner of menial tasks, but mostly they just like bossing them around. Slaves are fed mildly poisoned food to keep them lethargic and compliant. A creature afflicted in this way over a long period of time becomes a shell of its former self and can be restored to normalcy only by magic.</p><p><em><strong>Water Dependency</strong></em>. A grung that fails to immerse itself in water for at least 1 hour during a day suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of that day. A grung can recover from this exhaustion only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h4>Variant: Grung Poison</h4><p>Grung poison loses its potency 1 minute after being removed from a grung. A similar breakdown occurs if the grung dies. A creature &amp;Reference[poisoned apply=false]{poisoned} by a grung can suffer an additional effect that varies depending on the grung’s skin color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer poisoned by the grung.</p><p><em><strong>Green</strong></em>. The poisoned creature can’t move except to climb or make standing jumps. If the creature is flying, it can’t take any actions or reactions unless it lands.</p><p><em><strong>Blue</strong></em>. The poisoned creature must shout loudly or otherwise make a loud noise at the start and end of its turn.</p><p><em><strong>Purple</strong></em>. The poisoned creature feels a desperate need to soak itself in liquid or mud. It can’t take actions or move except to do so or to reach a body of liquid or mud.</p><p><em><strong>Red</strong></em>. The poisoned creature must use its action to eat if food is within reach.</p><p><em><strong>Orange</strong></em>. The poisoned creature is frightened of its allies.</p><p><em><strong>Gold</strong></em>. The poisoned creature is charmed and can speak Grung.</p></aside>",

Rather than seek redemption, he sought revenge and was stripped of his god-given powers. The undead horde, no longer under his control, spread throughout the jungles of Chult.</p><p>Withdrawing to Omu, Nsi clung to his noble title, joined forces with the yuan-ti living there, and underwent a horrible ritual to become a powerful yuan-ti malison — retaining his human head and torso and gaining a serpentine lower body. With Ubtao gone from the world, Ras Nsi and his new yuan-ti followers began searching for a way to bring forth Dendar the Night Serpent. Acererak has promised to help this effort, in exchange for Ras Nsi’s pledge to defend the Tomb of the Nine Gods. In truth, Acererak has no intention of honoring his bargain, and Ras Nsi is beginning to suspect as much.</p><p><em><strong>Strange Collection</strong></em>. Ras Nsi has a sizable collection of apparel and accouterments from distant lands, most of which were taken from dead explorers. The collection includes a fine Cormyrean cloak, a Sembian wine flask, and a bejeweled Amnian doublet and matching money pouch. He also bears a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ducaFdrqwLZ0l3c7]{flame tongue longsword}</em>.</p><p><em><strong>Slow Death</strong></em>. Ras Nsi has died and been brought back from the dead more than once. Consequently, he is suffering from the effects of the Soulmonger’s death curse. His hit point maximum has been reduced, and leprous wounds cover his flesh. In a fitting irony, Ras Nsi is unaware that Acererak is the cause of the curse, for neither he nor the yuan-ti are aware of what lies within the Tomb of the Nine Gods, other than the dead gods for which it is named. If the characters can make him understand that their efforts will help him, Ras Nsi might be tempted not to stand in their way.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Roark (orange <strong>grung elite warrior</strong>) is a dutiful and dangerous grung warrior, dedicated to his king. Roark thinks all this goddess-summoning nonsense is distracting from the real issue at hand: defending Dungrunglung from the undead. Secretly, Roark’s loyalty is to the tribe first and Groak second, but Roark is dutifully abiding the king’s obsession for now. He is suspicious of adventurers yet open to help in defending his village from the undead.</p><hr /><p>Grungs are aggressive froglike humanoids found in rain forests and tropical jungles. They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures.</p><p>Tree-Dwelling Amphibians. Grungs live in trees and prefer shade. A grung hatchery is maintained in well-guarded ground-level pools. About three months after hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult. It takes another six to nine months for a grung juvenile to reach maturity.</p><p><em><strong>Castes and Colors</strong></em>. Grung society is a caste system. Each caste lays eggs in a separate hatching pool, and juvenile grungs join their caste upon emergence from the hatchery. All grungs are a dull greenish gray when they are born, but each individual takes on the color of its caste as it grows to adulthood.</p><p>Green grungs are the tribe’s warriors, hunters, and laborers, and blue grungs work as artisans and in other domestic roles. Supervising and guiding both groups are the purple grungs, which serve as administrators and commanders. (Use the grung stat block to represent members of the green, blue, and purple castes.)</p><p>Red grungs are the tribe’s scholars and magic users. They are superior to purple, blue, and green grungs and given proper respect even by grungs of higher status. (Use the grung wildling stat block to represent members of the red caste.)</p><p>Higher castes include orange grungs, which are elite warriors that have authority over all lesser grungs, and gold grungs, which hold the highest leadership positions. A tribe’s sovereign is always a gold grung. (Use the grung elite warrior stat block to represent members of the orange and gold castes.)</p><p>A grung normally remains in its caste for life. On rare occasions, an individual that distinguishes itself with great deeds can earn an invitation to join a higher caste. Through a combination of herbal tonics and ritual magic, an elevated grung changes color and is inducted into its new caste in the same way that a juvenile of the caste would be. From then on, the grung and its progeny are members of the higher caste.</p><p><em><strong>Naturally Toxic</strong></em>. All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures. A grung also uses venom to poison its weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Slavers</strong></em>. Grungs are always on the lookout for creatures they can capture and enslave. Grungs use slaves for all manner of menial tasks, but mostly they just like bossing them around. Slaves are fed mildly poisoned food to keep them lethargic and compliant. A creature afflicted in this way over a long period of time becomes a shell of its former self and can be restored to normalcy only by magic.</p><p><em><strong>Water Dependency</strong></em>. A grung that fails to immerse itself in water for at least 1 hour during a day suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of that day. A grung can recover from this exhaustion only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h4>Variant: Grung Poison</h4><p>Grung poison loses its potency 1 minute after being removed from a grung. A similar breakdown occurs if the grung dies. A creature &amp;Reference[poisoned apply=false]{poisoned} by a grung can suffer an additional effect that varies depending on the grung’s skin color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer poisoned by the grung.</p><p><em><strong>Green</strong></em>. The poisoned creature can’t move except to climb or make standing jumps. If the creature is flying, it can’t take any actions or reactions unless it lands.</p><p><em><strong>Blue</strong></em>. The poisoned creature must shout loudly or otherwise make a loud noise at the start and end of its turn.</p><p><em><strong>Purple</strong></em>. The poisoned creature feels a desperate need to soak itself in liquid or mud. It can’t take actions or move except to do so or to reach a body of liquid or mud.</p><p><em><strong>Red</strong></em>. The poisoned creature must use its action to eat if food is within reach.</p><p><em><strong>Orange</strong></em>. The poisoned creature is frightened of its allies.</p><p><em><strong>Gold</strong></em>. The poisoned creature is charmed and can speak Grung.</p></aside>",

They closely resemble humans, yet a pureblood can’t pass for human under close scrutiny because there’s always some hint of its true nature, such as scaly patches of skin, serpentine eyes, pointed teeth, or a forked tongue. Wearing cloaks and cowls, they masquerade as humans and infiltrate civilized lands to gather information, kidnap prisoners for interrogation and sacrifice, and trade with anyone who has something that can further their myriad plots.</p><p><em><strong>Forsaken Humanity</strong></em>. The yuan-ti were once humans who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the serpent’s sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Their advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear, focused thought.</p><p>Yuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legendary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.</p><p><em><strong>Serpent Kings of Fallen Empires</strong></em>. The yuan-ti view their physical transformation as a transcendent moment for their race, allowing them to shed their frail humanity like dead skin. Those that did not transform eventually became slaves or food for the blessed of the serpent gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were defeated by those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, and the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great capitals, far removed from other races.</p><p><em><strong>Cold of Heart</strong></em>. Humanoid emotions are foreign to most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as an exploitable weakness. A yuan-ti views the world and the events of its own life with such extreme pragmatism that it is nearly impossible to manipulate, influence, or control by nonmagical means, even as it seeks to control other creatures through terror, pleasure, and awe.</p><p>Yuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can’t be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a grander design.</p><p>Yuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthless tacticians who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory justifies such losses. They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first in decisive ambush if they can.</p><p><em><strong>False Worship</strong></em>. Yuan-ti life revolves around their temples, yet yuan-ti don’t love the gods they worship. Instead, they see worship as a means to attain power. A yuan-ti believes an individual who attains enough power can devour and replace one of the yuan-ti gods. The yuan-ti strive for ascension and are willing to commit the darkest atrocities to achieve it.</p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.

If the characters befriend Wakanga, he gives them the journal and shows them on Syndra’s map where it was found (he accurately indicates the hex containing the guardian; see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2Vorn000000]{Vorn} in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2TheLandOfC]{chapter 2} for more information). The journal contains a picture of Vorn’s control amulet but provides no clues to the amulet’s current whereabouts. As reward for finding and retrieving the construct and its control amulet, Wakanga offers a spellbook containing fifteen randomly determined spells (roll a [[/r d6]] to determine the level of each spell).</p>",

By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form — or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p><p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will.

The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.</p><p>The following information applies to specific lycanthropes.</p><p><strong>Werebear.</strong> The character gains a Strength of 19 if his or her score isn’t already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while in bear or hybrid form (from natural armor).

Only the goblin at the top of the stack can attack, and only the goblin at the bottom can move (all goblins stacked on its shoulders move with it).</p><p>The goblin at the top makes all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability checks and saving throws for the stack.</p><p>The goblin at the bottom makes all Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution ability checks and saving throws for the stack.</p><p>A battle stack can’t jump, but it can grapple or shove another creature, swing from vines, and use the &amp;Reference[Dash], &amp;Reference[Disengage], &amp;Reference[Dodge], and &amp;Reference[Hide] actions.</p><p>The stack has <strong>advantage on melee attacks because of its built-in “pack tactics” effect;</strong> all the goblins are waving spears at the enemy, even if only one can hit.</p><p>When a goblin in the stack drops to 0 hit points, it is thrown from the stack. If the stack succeeds on a [[/save dex 10 format=long]], it remains intact (albeit one goblin shorter). On a failed save, the stack collapses and all the goblins fall prone in a 5-foot-square space.</p><p>To form a new battle stack, a goblin must use its action to climb onto the shoulders of another willing goblin within 5 feet of it. Other goblins can join an existing battle stack in the same way. A goblin can use its action to remove itself from a battle stack, landing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bottom of the stack.</p><p>The Batiri invented battle stacks as a way to combat creatures much larger than themselves as well as a way to reach enemies in trees. The battle stack formation has the added effect of making the puny goblins appear taller and more fearsome to their larger enemies. Battle stacks are not effective against other ground-based threats, since all but the topmost goblin give up their attacks and mobility to be part of the stack.</p><p>@embed[JournalEntry.toaAppArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.QvokdeoOuT9nzX1A caption=false]</p><p>@embed[Actor.uPBjr5fHo9ZhXasa caption=false statblock classes=\"double-column\"]</p>"

No other city exists in Chult, along the coast or anywhere else, except in ruins or overrun by monstrous creatures. Until recently, Port Nyanzaru was under the firm control of Amn, a foreign nation. Nine years ago, Amn was forced to relinquish the city to a wealthy and powerful consortium of Chultan traders backed by the Ytepka Society (pronounced yeh-TEP-kah), or risk a bloody conflict that probably would have ended with the city winning its independence anyway. Seven Chultan traders have since grown into influential merchant princes, enticing folk from up and down the Sword Coast with their wares.</p><p>Port Nyanzaru is a bastion of civilization and commerce in a terrifying land. The amount of business that unfolds here and the cash that moves through its counting houses would make any merchant of Baldur’s Gate or Waterdeep jealous. It’s also a colorful, musical, aroma-filled, vibrant city in its own right. Other than trade, the biggest attractions are the weekly dinosaur races through the streets. Locals and visitors alike wager princely sums on the races’ outcomes. The city also boasts grand bazaars, glorious mansions and temples, circuses, and gladiatorial contests.</p><p>Enemies surround Port Nyanzaru on all sides. The jungle teems with ferocious reptiles and murderous undead, pirates prowl the surrounding sea, and the mouth of the bay is home to a greedy dragon turtle.</p><p>Characters who question locals can learn rumors that might help them survive the perils of Chult. The characters can secure gear and guides before leaving the city. Syndra Silvane is too weak to accompany them or provide any additional support.</p><p>If you are running this adventure in a homebrew D&amp;D setting, you can place Port Nyanzaru wherever you see fit and even change its name. If you’re using another published D&amp;D setting, you can dispense with Port Nyanzaru entirely and use a different coastal city as the launching point for the party’s jungle expedition. Examples from other settings include the city of Sasserine on the edge of the Oerth’s Amedio Jungle, the city of Slagovich near the Savage Coast of Mystara, and the city of Stormreach on Eberron’s continent of Xen’drik.</p>"

Read:</p><section class=\"fvtt narrative\"><p>You appear in a tropical city under the blazing sun. The familiar sounds of a harbor — creaking ropes, slapping waves, heavy barrels rolling across cobblestones — mingle with voices shouting and cursing in an unfamiliar language filled with clicks, inhalations, and singsongy words that make it sound almost musical. The aroma of unfamiliar spices and tropical fruit mixes with the wharfside smells of fish, tar, and canvas.</p><p>Beyond all that, Port Nyanzaru is an explosion of color. Buildings are painted in bright shades of blue, green, orange, and salmon pink, or their walls are adorned with murals portraying giant reptiles and mythical heroes. Every building sports baskets and clay urns of colorful flowers or is draped in leafy, flowering vines. Minstrels in bright clothing adorned with feathers and shells perform on street corners. Multicolored pennants and sun awnings flutter atop the city walls. A crowd of children dressed in feathered hats and capes races past you, squealing in delighted terror as a street performer costumed as a big-toothed lizard stomps and roars behind them. The whole city seems to be bustling, sweating, laughing, swearing, and singing.</p></section><p>Syndra recommends that the characters secure rooms for themselves at either the Thundering Lizard (if they’re looking for a raucous time) or Kaya’s House of Repose (if they want a good night’s sleep). Both inns are located near the Red Bazaar (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1LocPortNya.JournalEntryPage.B6oKFqXyXEiBQRe1]{area 18}). Meanwhile, Syndra heads to the villa of the merchant prince @UUID[Actor.tPP0kMKDW7E1Km5z]{Wakanga O’tamu}. There she intends to stay for the remainder of the adventure. If the characters express interest in accompanying her, she’s more than happy to introduce them to Wakanga (See @UUID[.iu6dlFfPBaUfBShR]{Merchant Princes}).</p><p>When describing the sights and sounds of Port Nyanzaru, emphasize the heat, the humidity, the exotic sounds and smells, and other unique aspects of Port Nyanzaru. Some of its notable features are described hereafter:</p><ul><li>Medium and Large dinosaurs are used as beasts of burden to haul two-wheeled carts, to hoist heavy loads on cranes, and to tow boats along the canals.</li><li>Dinosaurs compete in weekly races through the streets. These brightly painted racing dinosaurs are fast, vicious, and barely under their riders’ control.</li><li>Flowers, green plants, and vines grow everywhere, seeming to spring out of the building stones themselves. The profusion of greenery needs constant tending to prevent roots and shoots from damaging buildings or tile roofs.</li><li>The city’s defensive walls and towers are topped with colorful awnings to shield guards from the sun and rain.</li><li>All streets within the city walls are paved with cobblestones or flagstones, and they have deep rain gutters as much as 2 feet wide. Residents of Port Nyanzaru pay little attention to any but the heaviest deluge.</li><li>Tabaxi minstrels wander the streets, performing for anyone who tosses them a few coins.</li><li>Walls divide the city into districts, and the open archways above the streets are painted with murals of dinosaurs, mountains, and mythic heroes.</li><li>Crumbling ancient buildings covered with vines and lichens indicate the city’s great age.</li></ul><p>The ground floors of most buildings are made of stucco-covered stone and have tiny windows to keep out the heat at street level. The upper floors have bamboo or thatch walls with enormous windows to let in the breeze, under broad thatched or tiled eaves. All buildings are richly decorated with paint, ivy, and vivid flowers. Some are painted in symmetrical, geometric patterns of straight lines and sharp angles, while others portray animals, monsters, landscapes, and heroes in a stylized manner unique to Chult. Where space permits, buildings traditionally include a walled yard or garden.</p><p>All the city’s water comes from rain, so every building has a cistern or wooden barrels to catch water running off the roof. Every public square is built around a fountain or rain basin. With so much water running downhill, Chultans also make excellent use of water-driven mechanical gadgets. Many buildings have water wheels built into their cisterns. Rainwater running through spouts or channels turns the wheel, which pumps water into pools, turns millstones, powers bellows or lathes or saws, or accomplishes any other labor-saving or amusing task Chultan engineers can dream up.</p>"

The price depends on the prominence of the intended victim, the reason for the sanction, and the wealth of the purchaser. The minimum price possible is 150 gp; the maximum is limitless. The availability of sanctions doesn’t mean they’re common — it’s rare for more than six to be sold in a year.

Anything needed to survive in the jungle is considered a mundane item in Chult. The chief exception is heavy armor, which is rare in Chult and thus commands a high price: triple the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> prices for heavy armor, or double them if the character makes a successful [[/check persuasion 15 format=long]] to bargain down the price.</p><p>The only alternative to buying specialty items through the merchant princes is to deal with the black market, which is highly secretive in Port Nyanzaru; the merchant princes crack down harshly on competitors.

The salve is waterproof so it doesn’t wash off in rain.</p><h3>Rain Catcher</h3><p>A rain catcher is a simple contraption consisting of a 5-foot-square leather tarp and a wooden frame with legs. When the tarp is stretched across the wooden frame, it forms a basin that can catch 2 gallons of drinking water per inch of rainfall and hold up to 8 gallons.

Many of the dinosaurs involved are juveniles, since fully grown versions can be too large and too difficult for riders to manage. The dinosaurs are stoutly muzzled and have their claws and horns blunted in all but the unchained race.</p><p>The four-legged race is dominated by young ankylosauruses and triceratopses, but dimetrodons have also done well when paired with Small riders. Most competitors in the two-legged race are hadrosauruses and deinonychuses (again with Small riders).

The racers, the available odds, and the chance to win are listed in the Betting on Dinosaur Races table. Bets can range from 1 cp to 500 gp. Once bets are placed, roll a die for each bet. Losing bets cost the full amount of the wager. Winning bets pay out according to the table. Bets can be for a dinosaur to win, place, show, or do something specific during the race (like attack another racer or throw its rider), so many bets can win in the course of a single race.</p><p>Losers are expected to pay up in a timely fashion. Those who don’t are visited by a debt collector backed up by Chultan legbreakers ([[/r 1d4 + 1]] @UUID[Actor.ALGJkQ4Ts9YHRiHH]{thugs} or @UUID[Actor.rG9NdBVvCfnkqCY1]{gladiators}, depending on the level and reputation of the bettor). Port Nyanzaru bookies never forget a debt; even a year away on an expedition into the jungle isn’t long enough to erase an unpaid gambling loss.</p><h3>Racing</h3><p>Player characters might get involved in a dinosaur race, either through their own interest or because they’re approached by a racing team. In this case, you’ll need to play out the race. This can be quite a bit of fun, especially if you let players whose characters aren’t directly involved take over at least some of the NPC racers. Encourage everyone to race hard, even if it’s in the group’s best interest for a particular dinosaur to win.</p><p>A race runs a length of 300 feet; this is abstract, as a race actually covers a lot more ground. Every round, each rider makes a [[/check ani]] Wisdom (Animal Handling) check; the DCs for different types of dinosaurs are listed in the Racing Dinosaurs table. With each successful Animal Handling check, the first number listed as the dinosaur’s speed is added to its “running tally.” If the check fails, that dinosaur’s tally doesn’t increase that turn. When a racer’s tally equals or exceeds 300, that dinosaur crosses the finish line. A racer can try to move at the higher listed speed by lashing the animal furiously; in this case, the Animal Handling check is made with advantage, but the dinosaur must also make a successful [[/check con 10 format=long]] at the end of this round or its speed is halved for the rest of the race.</p><p>No initiative is involved. Riders can make their Animal Handling checks in any order, or all at the same time. If two or more dinosaurs cross the finish line on the same round, the one with the highest tally wins. If the tallies are the same, the racers tied. In the event of a tie, brawls are likely to break out in trackside betting pools.</p><p>In the unchained event, dinosaurs can attack other dinosaurs if their tallies are within 50 of each other at the end of a round. Each dinosaur’s pertinent combat statistics are listed on the Racing Dinosaurs table. If a dinosaur has half or fewer of its starting hit points, the rider makes Animal Handling checks with disadvantage.</p><p>For simplicity, riders can’t attack or be attacked, but DMs with a cruel streak might be tempted to relax that rule. Just be aware that if rider attacks are allowed, the event is more likely to become a straight-up dinosaur fight than anything resembling a race. Raising a dinosaur to be a racer is difficult and expensive. Most owners aren’t willing to lose one — especially a fast one — in a weekly bloodfest.</p>"

The walls are impressive barriers of massive, fitted stone. Like other structures in Port Nyanzaru, they’re decorated with colorful paintings of geometric designs, animals, and mythic figures.</p><p>The city is defined by four steep hills. The westernmost hill, called Temple Hill because it’s home to the temple of Savras, is completely walled off from lower ground. A wide stone bridge crosses on arched columns from Temple Hill to Throne Hill, site of Goldenthrone. A second bridge connects Throne Hill to the southern slopes, site of several merchant princes’ villas. East of the harbor, the Hall of Gold gleams atop the city’s tallest hill, Mount Sibasa, which is connected by bridge to the neighboring Yklwazi Hill (pronounced yick-ul-WAH-zee), site of the Grand Coliseum. Steep, stepped streets and terraces surround each hill.</p><p>Outside the main walls are three slums: the Old City to the southwest, where many buildings are remnants of older, pyramidal construction; Malar’s Throat to the south, where buildings cling to the walls of a lush canyon spanned by rope bridges; and Tiryki Anchorage to the southeast, where explorers and river folk gather.</p><p>About half the city’s population lives crowded together outside the walls, where they’re always exposed to sudden attacks by carnivores or undead. A volunteer citizens’ brigade keeps watch for approaching danger. When residents of the outer wards hear the long blast of warning horns, day or night, they scramble for the safety of the Market Ward and Merchants’ Ward until the all clear sounds.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h4>Troubleshooting</h4><p>There’s enough happening in Port Nyanzaru that you won’t need to rely on random encounters to keep things interesting.

Port Nyanzaru is the most obvious starting point. It offers easy access by canoe to two major rivers, the Soshenstar and the Tiryki. Journeys up these rivers make excellent shake-down expeditions for explorers just learning the ropes of this unforgiving land. Characters can also strike out from @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2FortBeluar]{Fort Beluarian} or travel by ship to coastal landing sites such as @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2JahakaBay0]{Jahaka Bay}, @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2KitchersIn]{Kitcher’s Inlet}, @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2RefugeBay0]{Refuge Bay}, @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2ShilkuBay0]{Shilku Bay}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2SnappingTu]{Snapping Turtle Bay}.</p><p>Chult is a land of adventure, and this chapter aims to make the characters’ wilderness journey a memorable one. By design, the adventure locations are not tailored to characters of a specific level. If the adventuring party is relatively weak, it’s up to the players to choose whether to flee instead of fight, negotiate instead of attack, or surrender instead of die. It’s up to you as the DM to be flexible and keep the story moving forward as best you can. If an encounter is going badly for the adventurers, you can have the monsters suddenly withdraw, demand the party’s surrender, or deal nonlethal damage. You can have an NPC show up to lend assistance. Mindless predators might be scared off by a sudden volcanic eruption or earth tremor. In short, there is always a way to turn the party’s misfortune into a fighting chance of survival.</p>"

Without canoes, the normal rate of travel along a river is the same as through the surrounding terrain. Canoes move 1 hex per day through swamp.</p><p>If characters move at a fast pace, the easiest way to deal with their progress is to roll a [[/gmr d4]]. On a roll of 3 or 4, they advance 1 additional hex that day. Characters moving at a fast pace take a –5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, making them more likely to miss clues and walk into ambushes.</p><p>If characters set a slow pace, roll a [[/r d4]]. On a roll of 1 or 2, they advance 1 fewer hex that day (in other words, 1 hex by canoe or none by foot). On any other result, their caution is rewarded, and they travel the same distance as a group moving at a normal pace. Characters moving at a slow pace can move stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.</p><h3>Tracking Miles</h3><p>Instead of tracking movement by hexes, you can keep track of the actual distances covered (10 miles per day at a normal pace, 15 miles per day at a fast pace, or 9 miles per day at a slow pace), but this is likely to be more bother than it’s worth if the group switches pace from day to day.</p><p>A character with a flying speed of 30 feet can travel 4 miles per hour.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h4>Where's Artus Cimber?</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.actors.Actor.hNq59kIhDGqZBGXl]{Artus Cimber} and his traveling companion @UUID[Actor.1Gp38SRQcEPAsgSG]{Dragonbait} are good-aligned NPCs who can help the characters accomplish their goals.

The arrival of adventurers is a great boon from Yokka’s point of view. If they defeat the shrine’s traps, he can simply take its treasure from them as they emerge. If they don’t, they might at least weaken the shrine’s defenses.</p><p>Yokka’s band bedevils the party without revealing its presence until the final moment. For example, if no guard is left to watch over the party’s boats, the goblins steal them or knock holes in their bottoms.

Carved into a stony hillside, its entrance lies between the feet of an 80-foot-high stone statue depicting a man carrying a crocodile on his back. Any Chultan can identify this as a figure from local mythology and can recall the story for the characters. If characters ask a Chultan what the statue signifies, read:</p><section class=\"fvtt narrative\"><p>In the early days of the world, Man stood by the banks of a river, frightened. Crocodile raised his head from the water and asked, “What troubles you, cousin Man?”</p><p>Man said, “I must cross this river, but I fear to enter the water alone, because it teems with your brethren.”</p><p>Crocodile replied, “It’s true, you would not be safe. But I will carry you across the river safely on my back, if you promise to return the favor.” Man agreed, and Crocodile bore him safely across the water</p><p>When they reached the far bank, Man asked, “How can I repay you?” Crocodile replied, “I wish to see the realm of Humans, but I fear to go there alone, because it teems with your brethren. You must carry me on your back across your realm.” Man had been tricked, but a promise is a promise, so he carried Crocodile safely on his back across the entire realm of humans, a journey that lasted many years. He also swore, in his anger, that never again would Men and Crocodiles be friends, and so it has remained to this day.</p></section><p>This tale is a hint that can get characters safely past the traps in the shrine.</p><p><em><strong>Man and Crocodile.</strong></em> None of the traps in the shrine will be triggered by two characters who are imitating Man and Crocodile, with one riding on the other’s shoulders. Those characters can still be injured by a trap that’s triggered by someone else; they just won’t trigger it themselves. Navigating the shrine is difficult, however, for a two-person piggyback team. There’s a recurring danger that they’ll lose their balance or the rider will fall off. Any moment when they’re not carrying or riding one another, they risk setting off traps like anyone else. If the rider is at least one size category smaller than the carrier, the carrier makes requisite Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws with advantage.</p><p><em><strong>Ledges.</strong></em> In a few places, the floor of the shrine rises 7 feet, forming a ledge. No check is needed to climb a ledge solo, but the ledge’s height makes it difficult to see what lies ahead. A rider/carrier team probably is tall enough to see over a ledge, but to climb it, the carrier must make a successful [[/check athletics 15 format=long]]; the rider can aid this check. If the check fails by 5 or more, both of them sprawl to the lower floor and, for 1 round at least, they’re just two individuals, not a rider and a carrier. If the check fails by less than 5, they tumble forward onto the upper terrace, sprawl apart, and probably set off whatever trap is on that level.</p><p><em><strong>Spotting Traps.</strong></em> Unless indicated otherwise, a trap can be spotted with a successful [[/check perception 13 format=long]]. It’s best if just one character makes this check, and only the first check counts, no matter how many times the search is attempted. If players insist on having everyone crowd in and search for traps, goblins might steal the party’s canoes or rig traps of their own.</p>"

Charismatic but unstable, Groak can swing from friendly to homicidal in the span of a few seconds. Because of this, his people dare not even whisper a harsh word about him. Groak wants to be seen as a visionary and a romantic, and he loves to hear stories of the outside world. However, he threatens anyone who dares to question his inflated self-image. Groak tolerates adventurers as long as they entertain him, generally agree with everything he says, and are willing to aid him in his quest to realize his divine destiny to become Nangnang’s consort.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.toaKrrook0000000]{Krr’ook} (red <strong>grung wildling</strong>) is a grung priest who fears the king’s instability. She whispers favorable signs and omens in the king’s ear to keep in his good graces. Secretly, Krr’ook suspects that the Great Ritual to summon Nangnang will fail. Consequently, she fears for her life. She approaches the adventurers to see if they can help her fool the king on the night of the ritual. If Krr’ook senses anything out of kilter, or if the ritual goes awry, she scapegoats the adventurers and delivers them straight into the king’s infantile wrath.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.toaRoark00000000]{Roark} (orange <strong>grung elite warrior</strong>) is a dutiful and dangerous grung warrior, dedicated to his king. Roark thinks all this goddess-summoning nonsense is distracting from the real issue at hand: defending Dungrunglung from the undead. Secretly, Roark’s loyalty is to the tribe first and Groak second, but Roark is dutifully abiding the king’s obsession for now. He is suspicious of adventurers yet open to help in defending his village from the undead.</p></aside><p>The grungs of Dungrunglung (@UUID[Scene.toaCh2Dungrunglu]{map 2.5}) toil under the tyranny of their despotic king, Groak, who is obsessed with summoning the goddess Nangnang. To please their king, the grungs have erected a 60-foot-tall mud shrine, where Groak plans to woo the goddess and where she, in turn, can bless him with generations of god-touched, royal Groaklings.</p><p>The grungs of Dungrunglung are experiencing desperate times. Ghouls and zombies threaten their existence, and grung poison is ineffective against the undead. Consequently, the grungs are strongly incentivized to use outsiders to solve their undead problem.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.toaKingGroak0000]{King Groak} holds absolute sway in Dungrunglung, and his subjects follow his orders without question. However, should the balance of power shift firmly to @UUID[Actor.toaKrrook0000000]{Krr’ook} or @UUID[Actor.toaRoark00000000]{Roark} (see the @UUID[.XljypGh88sK5Lq9q#grungs-of-dungrunglung]{Grungs of Dungrunglung} sidebar), the grungs do not hesitate to tear Groak limb from limb in a cathartic frenzy. At some point during the adventurers’ time in Dungrunglung, they will be approached in secrecy by Krr’ook.</p><p>At any given time, Dungrunglung is home to grungs representing all castes and colors. There is only one gold grung (Groak) and one red grung (Krr’ook). For grung stat blocks and more information on grung castes, see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA]{appendix D}.</p><p>The grungs speak no language other than their own, which complicates any dealings with them. How they treat adventurers depends on how strong they appear:</p><ul><li>If the party appears weak (few in number or needing assistance), @UUID[Actor.toaCh2GrungsDung]{1d6 + 6 grungs} with green skin (warriors) surround them as soon as they enter the thorn maze, and press them to attend an audience with the king. The grungs attack and subdue characters who resist. If the adventurers accept, they are taken through the maze to the shrine, where they are received by King Groak. He offers sanctuary and talks of the great ritual to summon Nangnang. Once the characters are rested, Groak commands them to help Krr’ook make final preparations.</li><li>If the party looks capable of putting up a good fight, they are greeted by @UUID[Actor.toaCh2GrungsDung]{1d6 + 6 grungs} with green skin (warriors) once they reach the settlement. The grungs welcome them to Dungrunglung and beg the characters to hear what King Groak has to say. Groak entreats the adventurers to be part of his divine destiny, and to aid Krr’ook in completing the preparations to summon Nangnang. He offers Dungrunglung’s hospitality as well as information about Chult in exchange for their help.</li></ul><p>Characters who offend King Groak are thrown in the prison pit (@UUID[.bQeLMFd8EmiarpDV]{area 7}). There, they are approached in secret by Krr’ook, who tries to explain her dilemma. If the party agrees to help her, Krr’ook will find a way to free the party members to aid in her task.

Fearing that the ritual will fail, Krr’ook has concocted a desperate plan to fool the king but needs the adventurers’ help to pull it off.</p><p><em><strong>Krr’ook’s Plan.</strong></em> A while ago, Krr’ook found a box of Nolzur’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.e3XQygrXkzNvkDGF]{marvelous pigments}, which she hid from the king. She plans to paint an image of Nangnang of such quality that Groak will be fooled into thinking it’s the real goddess. Krr’ook hopes that one of the adventurers will have the skill to illustrate Nangnang convincingly. She’s willing to give the magical pigments as a reward to the adventurers if all goes well. As a further reward, Krr’ook offers a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.x7LfMrLafLKfemGH]{ring of jumping}.</p><p><em><strong>Moment of Truth.</strong></em> The ritual happens at night. Fires are lit throughout the village, whereupon scores of common grungs enter the lake and watch the shrine. King Groak dons ceremonial garb made from reeds and wild orchids, and awaits his love on the steps of the shrine, wringing his rubbery hands with anticipation.</p><p>To fool Groak, the characters must paint an image of Nangnang on a surface or craft some other representation of her, then use magic (if they can) to give it a semblance of life. <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ATo0Eb63TDtnu6iA]{Animate objects}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.nslx2nT3p4lNkmdp]{major image}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.oIzA2MEHwxhtQneU]{minor illusion}</em>, and similar spells can help enhance the illusion.

Finally, the ritual must end with Nangnang’s departure, handled in such a way that King Groak won’t suspect he’s been fooled or abandoned forever. If Nangnang or her words ring false, King Groak orders the deaths of Krr’ook and anyone believed to have aided her.</p><p><em><strong>Making Nangnang.</strong></em> To fool Groak, the party must succeed at three or more of the following tasks. Have the characters make the requisite ability checks in the following order:</p><ul><li>Painting or crafting a representation of Nangnang requires a successful [[/check int 12 format=long]]. Using Nolzur’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.e3XQygrXkzNvkDGF]{marvelous pigments} grants advantage on the check.</li><li>Animating Nangnang convincingly requires a successful [[/check deception 12 format=long]].

If the words are delivered in a language King Groak doesn’t understand, the check is made with disadvantage. (Groak speaks Grung only.)</li><li data-content-chunk->Selling Nangnang’s blessed departure requires a successful [[/check deception intimidation persuasion 15 format=long]]. The check is made with disadvantage if her words are spoken in a language other than Grung.</li></ul><p><em><strong>End Result.</strong></em> If the characters succeed at three or more checks, King Groak is thoroughly duped and very happy for the foreseeable future. Characters who request his help will receive it, no questions asked. If the party’s trickery is discovered, King Groak orders his subjects to attack them. The attacking force consists of sixteen grung elite warriors (including Roark) and forty grungs. Groak retreats to his elevated pool in the shrine and makes his final stand there.</p></aside><p>The shallow pool at the front of the shrine is where @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.actors.Actor.toaKrrook0000000]{Krr’ook} (a red-skinned grung wildling; see the @UUID[.XljypGh88sK5Lq9q#grungs-of-dungrunglung]{Grungs of Dungrunglung} sidebar) and her assistants (six blue-skinned @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.actors.Actor.hhimFugOGTJyMZu4]{grungs}) prepare for the Great Ritual by tending the phosphorescent fungi and scenting the water with delicate perfumes.

The walls of the spire are sheer and dotted with small caves. Frail-looking ladders hang from narrow ledges at various heights.</p></section><p>The rocky pinnacle called Firefinger (@UUID[Scene.toaCh2Firefinger]{map 2.6}) is an ancient Chultan signal tower. Before the Spellplague toppled them, many such towers were used to send messages between cities via colored flames at night or colored smoke during the day. Firefinger is one of the few still standing, if not the only one.</p><p>Firefinger has been taken over by a flock of @UUID[Actor.a5ziGNVAeg4NEu0m]{pterafolk} that preys on hunters and explorers along the River Tiryki. The tower is a perfect lair for the pterafolk; in clear weather, from its 300-foot-high vantage point, they can spot anything moving on the river less than 10 miles away, and its sheer walls and crumbling ladders make it potentially lethal for anything without wings to attempt the ascent.</p><p>If @UUID[Actor.uG8agwRIUdI9X1QO]{Azaka Stormfang} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza]{chapter 1}) is with the characters, she insists they attack the spire. She suggests waiting until nightfall or rain, if none of the characters think of it. If characters refuse to attack the pterafolk, Azaka leaves their service in disgust.</p><p>The best way to approach Firefinger without being spotted by the pterafolk is to stay under heavy forest canopy and cross open areas only when rain or darkness limits visibility. If these precautions aren’t taken, have the party make a [[/check stealth 12 format=long]]{DC 12 group Dexterity (Stealth) check}. If the group check fails, the pterafolk mount an attack from above. The attack force numbers two @UUID[Actor.a5ziGNVAeg4NEu0m]{pterafolk} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.FDyn4HWR2JU4EFY6]{appendix D}) for each party member. If the pterafolk become outnumbered, the survivors flee back to the spire and warn the others (in which case, the characters have lost the element of surprise).</p><p>Near the base of the spire, characters find the body of an elf lying in the mud. Most of his limbs are broken, the ribcage is crushed, and broken twigs and torn leaves are stuck in it what’s left of his clothes. This unfortunate explorer was captured on the river, flown to Firefinger, stripped of valuables, then tossed off the top of the tower to his death. Not far away, the characters find another body, and a third, and so on as they scan around the base of the tower. This same fate awaits any character captured by the pterafolk.</p><p>The rope-and-wood ladders mounted to the spire are ancient and crumbling. Each character who ascends a ladder to the next higher level (from the ground to level 1, from level 1 to level 2, and so on) must make a [[/check athletics 8 format=long]]. If the check succeeds, the character reaches the next level safely without damaging the fragile ladder. If the check fails, a few rungs of the ladder are damaged and the DC increases by 2 for everyone following behind the climber. If the check fails by 5 or more, the ladder is damaged and the climber falls — quite possibly to his or her death, unless precautions were taken (roping characters together, for example).</p><p>Pterafolk glide around the spire constantly except when it’s raining. They don’t pay much attention to the spire itself, since they arrogantly believe they’re safe in their stronghold. Characters might take elaborate precautions to avoid being spotted, but they’re surprisingly safe as long as they reach the spire unseen. During rain or at night, there’s no chance they’ll be spotted climbing the tower.

Liara is 47 years old and has held her post for the past three years. To her, a posting in Chult feels like a test of mettle, but to many of her subordinates, it feels like banishment. The garrison consists of a castellan named @UUID[Actor.toaGrutaHalsdott]{Gruta Halsdottir} (LN female Illuskan human <strong>knight</strong>), three corporals (@UUID[Actor.MIbGBptGOW5OSlHY]{veterans}), and fifty-four privates (@UUID[Actor.mqt9J4A1jweBx6P1]{guards}). The garrison operates in three eight-hour shifts, with one @UUID[Actor.MIbGBptGOW5OSlHY]{corporal} (gauntlet) and eighteen @UUID[Actor.mqt9J4A1jweBx6P1]{privates} (fists} on duty during each shift.</p><aside class=\"float-right notable\"><h4>Agents of the Flaming Fist</h4><p>If the adventurers spend a day in Fort Beluarian, @UUID[Actor.3vTgQjRFbmBvbyZ9]{Liara Portyr} becomes aware of them and dispatches a guard to bring them to the great hall (@UUID[.Q1IsSKduoWa9SCKT]{area 10C}). Adventurers who refuse the summons are banished from the fort. Those who agree to meet with Liara are asked to serve the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza.JournalEntryPage.pb8xaiqlsBvcRCYv]{Flaming Fist}. For each service they perform, the characters receive a reward. Characters who decline to serve the Flaming Fist are welcome to continue about their business, but anything they wish to buy in Fort Beluarian costs five times the normal price from that point on.</p><p><em><strong>Ghoul Hunters.</strong></em> Portyr asks the characters to help rid the jungle of ghouls. If the characters are up to the task, Portyr gives the party a free charter of exploration. For every severed ghoul head the characters bring her, she’ll pay them [[/award 20gp]]. (She has enough money to cover the reward for up to eleven severed ghoul heads.)</p><p><em><strong>Shilku Reconnaissance.</strong></em> Portyr asks the characters to set sail for @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2ShilkuBay0]{Shilku Bay}, conduct a one-week reconnaissance of the destroyed village of Shilku, and return to Fort Beluarian to report what they’ve seen. If the characters accept the mission, Portyr pays for their food and passage and gives the party a free charter of exploration. If they complete the mission, the characters are given free meals and guest rooms (see @UUID[.wGfBTJzHTvul15mT]{area 10J)} whenever they visit Fort Beluarian, and each character receives one potion or scroll chosen from the ones available in the stores (see @UUID[.4PBIZUnVM9VjTfAR]{area 10G}).</p><p><em><strong>Strangers in a Strange Land.</strong></em> Flaming Fist scouts have spotted giant footprints south of Fort Beluarian. If the characters find out who or what is making the tracks, and discover where they’re coming from and what threat (if any) they pose to Fort Beluarian, Portyr will reward them with five magic arrows (see area 10G). If the characters accept the mission, Portyr gives the party a free charter of exploration. To complete the mission, the characters must locate at least one group of frost giants as well as their longship (See @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2Hvalspyd00]{Hvalspyd}). To complicate matters, Portyr doesn’t believe any report that claims frost giants have landed in Chult and won’t pay up unless the characters back up their claims with compelling evidence (such as a frost giant’s severed head or a giant-sized weapon).</p></aside><p>Unknown to her boss, Liara is in league with pirates based out of @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2JahakaAnch]{Jahaka Anchorage} and earns a tidy profit from their exploits. Liara’s spies in Port Nyanzaru furnish her with ship manifests and departure schedules, which she passes to the pirates via a <strong>sending stone </strong>(<em>Dungeon Master’s Guide 2014</em>); the pirate captain @UUID[Actor.toaZaroumAlSarya]{Zaroum Al-Saryak} holds the matching stone. Because of their arrangement, the pirates agreed to Portyr’s demand that they never attack ships flying the flag of Baldur’s Gate. Liara receives a cut of the pirate’s profits, some of which goes toward paying bonuses to her garrison to keep the soldiers happy.</p><p>Although she’s a villain of sorts, Liara Portyr has no reason to be an enemy to the characters. She spends most of her time managing the security of her stronghold, going over field reports, and sifting through reports from her spies in Port Nyanzaru. She admires adventurers, and as long as the characters do nothing to antagonize her, she can provide them with useful advice and material aid against the myriad threats lurking in the jungle.</p><p>Liara is puzzled by reports coming from her patrols to the south. They’ve crossed the trails of large creatures in the jungle that don’t match anything known to live in Chult. If the characters are planning to explore the region between the east coast and the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2RiverTiryk]{River Tiryki}, or they’ve already been there and seen anything unusual, she’d be grateful for any light they can shed on the mystery. (Her patrols are seeing signs of the frost giants searching for @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.9gGxLgtmRcNjXZ50]{Artus Cimber}.)</p><p>Given that Baldur’s Gate is a member of the Lords’ Alliance, it should surprise no one that a handful of alliance operatives are sprinkled through the garrison. The @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza.JournalEntryPage.UoymxpQPqonK98y0]{Emerald Enclave} has expert guides stationed here as well. One of them, a druid named @UUID[Actor.aWJ4HniwXv7bFWf1]{Qawasha} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza.JournalEntryPage.NZYDy3pamUtMsM5g]{Finding a Guide}), comes highly recommended.</p><p>The main reason adventurers have for visiting Fort Beluarian is to buy a “charter of exploration.” Baldur’s Gate lays claim to everything east of the Mistcliff and north of Kitcher’s Inlet, and now that @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2Mezro00000]{Mezro} is picked clean, it’s trying to extend its claim south to @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2RefugeBay0]{Refuge Bay}. No one (including the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru) has the force in Chult to dispute this claim. So within its territory, the Flaming Fist does as it pleases, including demanding that explorers buy charters. A charter grants permission to the holder to explore Chult and plunder its riches, but half of an expedition’s proceeds and discoveries must be turned over to the Flaming Fist. The charter costs 50 gp, which is treated as a down payment on the split of profits. In addition, those who buy a charter can hire up to six Flaming Fist mercenaries (@UUID[Actor.mqt9J4A1jweBx6P1]{guards}) to accompany them for the very reasonable rate of 1 gp per tenday each. It’s easy enough to launch an expedition from Port Nyanzaru without a charter. The only risk is that if a Flaming Fist patrol runs into an expedition without a charter, it will attack the expedition and confiscate its gear.</p><p>Everything being shipped in or out of the fort goes through Beluarian Landing, which is nothing more than a stretch of beach with a few log buildings above the tide line. Ships anchor a half-mile offshore, and people and supplies are ferried back and forth on rowboats. Six Flaming Fist @UUID[Actor.mqt9J4A1jweBx6P1]{guards} defend this station; their chief duty is rowing the boats back and forth. In case of danger, they can barricade themselves inside the stoutest log building or row out to sea until whatever threatens them loses interest and wanders away.</p><p>The trek from Beluarian Landing to the fort is 14 miles along a well-marked trail. This trail is not patrolled.</p><p>@Embed[JournalEntry.toaAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.tJo2EBVl28o8TE6F caption=false]</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h4>Activate the Fort Beluarian Scene</h4><p>The following locations are keyed to the @UUID[Scene.toaCh2FortBeluar]{Fort Beluarian} Scene.</p></article></section>"

It hovers 200 feet above the ground and rotates slowly counterclockwise, completing one revolution every hour. Chultans call it the Heart of Ubtao because the earthmote is vaguely heart-shaped, and the petrified tree adds the impression of veins and arteries. The dripping red liquid is rainwater that was stained by filtering through iron ore deposits in the rock.</p><p>Chultans who’ve seen the earthmote believe it’s actually the petrified heart of the god Ubtao, and they consider it sacred. Priests of Ubtao used to travel here on the backs of flying dinosaurs to seek visions inside the heart and to beseech Ubtao to return. Many Chultans would be incensed to learn that the Heart of Ubtao has become the lair of an undead monster.</p><p>@Embed[JournalEntry.toaAppArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.oeYGbabItquKAZPq caption=false classes=\"float-right size-three\"]</p><p>@UUID[Actor.toaValindraShado]{Valindra Shadowmantle} works for Szass Tam, the most powerful lich among the Red Wizards of Thay, though she is not a Red Wizard herself. She found the heart and converted it into a base to use while her minions search for the Soulmonger. Her orders from Szass Tam are to seize control of the Soulmonger, if possible, or destroy it otherwise. Valindra created a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{teleportation circle} inside the heart that she uses to travel instantly to and from Thay (where her phylactery is safely stored), to deliver reports to Szass Tam and pick up new instructions.</p><p>Characters who explore the Heart of Ubtao are certain to meet Valindra. She’s considered the possibility that adventurers might cross her path, and she won’t necessarily be hostile toward them. Her mission is to seize the Soulmonger by any means; if adventurers can help her achieve that, she’ll use them.</p><p>Valindra is an elven lich, with these changes:</p><ul><li>Valindra is neutral evil.</li><li>She speaks Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Infernal.</li><li>When preparing her spells, Valindra can swap out any spell on her list of prepared spells for another wizard spell of the same level.</li><li>As a bonus action, Valindra can mask her shriveled flesh and appear to be a living elf. This magical illusion lasts until she ends it as a bonus action or until she uses her Frightening Gaze legendary action. The effect also ends if Valindra drops to 30 hit points or fewer, or if @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic} is cast on her.</li><li>She can’t take lair actions in the Heart of Ubtao.</li></ul><p>With her ability to appear as a living elf, Valindra can easily conceal her lichdom and her association to Thay. She presents herself as a scholarly wizard who wants to “imprison” the Soulmonger; that way, its unique magic can be studied while it’s safely quarantined from the world. She argues that destroying it should be a last resort.</p><p>Valindra believes that the Soulmonger is hidden somewhere in the ruins of Omu. She shares this information with the characters even if she suspects they’ll betray her down the road, because in the meantime, they might weaken some of Omu’s defenses.</p><p>If the characters have no way to reach the earthmote when they first encounter it — or at least, no way for everyone to reach it — eventually they spot an elf woman looking down at them from the staircase. After a few moments, she hails them in Elvish, asking their names, why they’ve come, and so on. If this conversation goes well, she opens an <em>arcane gate</em> (cast from a @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.Jaqlc33GipcoKdC4]{scroll}; <em>Player’s Handbook 2014</em>) and invites the player characters to come up. If they have many porters or NPC warriors, she asks that only the “key figures” come up, explaining that her home doesn’t have room for their entire expedition. Valindra assures characters that their companions will be safe on the ground.</p><p>The lich has no interest in killing the characters as long as there’s any chance they could be useful. If a fight breaks out (and there’s little reason one should unless the characters start it), Valindra lets her undead servants deal with the adventurers, then slips through her @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{teleportation circle} back to Thay. The destination sigils aren’t recorded anywhere in the heart, so following her is impossible. She’ll return in a few days when things have quieted down.

Three frost giants remain aboard the ship — two stand guard while the third rests. Two more frost giants watch the sea from the beach.

They have no intention, however, of failing their jarl and letting the Ring of Winter slip through their grasp.</p><h3>Frost Giant Search Parties</h3><p>@UUID[Actor.toaDrufisSearchP]{Drufi’s search party} includes two male frost giants and a pair of winter wolves. Each of the other four @UUID[Actor.toaSearchPartyHv]{search parties }consists of three frost giants and [[/r 1d2]] winter wolves.

If characters encounter giants, they’re likely to see evidence hours or days before the actual meeting: trampled brush, broken or uprooted trees, gigantic boot prints, 3-foot-high runic trail markings carved into trees or etched onto boulders, and winter wolf droppings. Chult has many gigantic carnivores, so a successful [[/check Survival 10 format=long]] is needed to identify these indicators as foreign to the jungle; if the check succeeds by 5 or more, the source is recognized as frost giants. A Chultan guide has advantage on this check but won’t make the leap to frost giants. That idea is just too far-fetched.</p><p>So far, the giants’ searching has roamed from the coast to the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2RiverTiryk]{River Tiryki}, and from the ruins of @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2PortCastig]{Port Castigliar} to the northeastern mountains. Drufi has seen @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2FortBeluar]{Fort Beluarian} from a distance and @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza]{Port Nyanzaru} from across the mouth of the River Tiryki, but the giants avoid Flaming Fist patrols. For their part, the mercenaries and scouts from the fort have seen many puzzling signs in the jungle to the south, but they haven’t yet concluded they’re dealing with frost giants. The giants’ next step will be to push farther south. At some point (determined by you), they’ll return to the <em>Hvalspyd</em>, sail south to Refuge Bay, and start the search afresh from there. Obviously, this is a very inefficient way to search an area as large and as dense as Chult, but Drufi has no better idea.</p><p>Drufi has no reason to attack or kill the characters, should they meet, unless the characters attack her or if she suspects they know more than they’re admitting about the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toamgcRingofWint]{Ring of Winter}.

A second ship rides at anchor outside the harbor up to a mile away, ready to defend the anchorage. The third ship is always at sea, usually prowling for victims. You can randomly determine which ships are where. The captain of whichever ship is docked commands the anchorage from aboard his ship.</p><p>The anchorage is sheltered inside a sea cave. It’s damp and echoing, but at least the cave keeps out the daily rain. The pirates outfitted it with a pier and a ramshackle fort built from scavenged planking, old barrels, deck grates, spars, and whatever else they could scrounge.

Ships flying the ensign of Baldur’s Gate are usually left alone, as a condition of Portyr’s cooperation. The Flaming Fist commander is kept apprised of upcoming naval patrols originating from nations on the mainland, and she passes this information to the pirates via a sending stone (<em>Dungeon Master’s Guide 2014</em>).</p><p>@Embed[JournalEntry.toaAppArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.CtEgvCWcsz3mk6yS caption=false]</p><p>Even more than their deal with Liara Portyr, the pirates’ most important asset is this hidden base, and every pirate must swear a blood oath to protect its secret location. Any ship that sails within visual distance of the anchorage is attacked and chased, if necessary. The <em>Brazen Pegasus</em> (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1LocPortNya.JournalEntryPage.iPH8fsWqf5Wpr5fJ]{Harbor Ward}) has a good chance to escape because she’s so fast; other ships are unlikely to get away.</p><p>Anyone who wanders into the anchorage from the jungle or from the bay is unlikely to be allowed to leave. If characters stumble into Jahaka Anchorage, the pirates claim it’s a trading post or an exploratory base established by the Flaming Fist or a merchant consortium, and they’ll put up a convincing front to that effect. They’ll do whatever it takes to get strangers off their guard, then kill or capture them.</p><p>The roof of the cave looms 60 feet above the water, on average (this varies a bit with the tide). It’s 50 feet above ground level and 20 feet above the top of the watch tower and gantry. Two natural stone columns sit across the mouth of the inlet with only a 25-foot gap between them, so that ships must be carefully towed into the cave by small boats and maneuvered with ropes once they’re inside.</p><p>Thanks to its sheltered position and the perpetual mist in the bay, the cave is difficult to find unless a person knows where to look. An alert lookout spots the structures and docked ship inside the cave automatically if passing within a half-mile of shore. At a distance up to 2 miles, a successful [[/check perception 15 format=long]] is needed. Lookouts at the anchorage notice a ship within 2 miles automatically.</p><p>The pirates’ first line of defense is a ring of submerged rocks a quarter-mile from shore. The captain of a ship trying to sail though must make a [[/check int 10 format=long]]. If the check succeeds, the ship gets past the rocks safely. If it fails by 4 or less, the ship strikes a rock and springs a few leaks but suffers no serious damage and can continue seeking a passage through. If the check fails by 5 or more, a rock causes significant damage; the ship lists badly and its speed is halved until the hull is repaired. Striking a third rock causes the ship to sink. The pirates, of course, know where the rocks are and avoid them.</p><p>The watchtower (@UUID[.yLGNd8cCGwTovI9t]{area 6}) and the entire elevated walkway from the tower to the warehouse (@UUID[.aQPLFp3j6sGFIwMd]{area 4}) have crenelated parapets for defense.

The other captains see the disadvantages clearly, but Jaharwon is building a following among the rank-and-file pirates of all three crews.</p><p>The Dragonfang’s crew includes a first mate named @UUID[Actor.toaKalita0000000]{Kalita} (LE female Chultan human <strong>spy</strong>), fifteen Chultan @UUID[Actor.WeoWLPQclgLKAD4S]{bandits}, three Chultan @UUID[Actor.ALGJkQ4Ts9YHRiHH]{thugs}, and a “sea witch” named @UUID[Actor.HQJedCnkTg7qig36]{Eye of the Deep} (N female Calishite human <strong>druid</strong>}).</p><h5><em><strong>Emerald Eye</strong></em></h5><p>The calculating Captain @UUID[Actor.toaZaroumAlSarya]{Zaroum Al-Saryak} (LE male Calishite human <strong>bandit captain</strong>) has a special fondness for gemstones.

His ship, the <em>Emerald Eye</em>, has cabins decorated like rooms in a Calishite pasha’s palace. Al-Saryak is fond of chopping off the heads of those who displease him and dangling them from his ship’s mermaid figurehead. A long-ago injury cost him his left eye and incised a scar in the form of a large X across his face. The ruined eye socket now holds a magical gem that allows Al-Saryak to discern ghostly pathways leading to treasure. The gem works for no one else. Al-Saryak holds the sending stone (<em>Dungeon Master’s Guide 2014</em>) matched to @UUID[Actor.3vTgQjRFbmBvbyZ9]{Liara Portyr’s} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2FortBeluar]{Fort Beluarian}).</p><p>The crew of the Emerald Eye consists of a first mate named @UUID[Actor.vL92zpKRnwHkUGWd]{Voltan} (CE male Calishite human <strong>berserker</strong>), twelve Calishite bandits, two Calishite thugs, and five Chultan @UUID[Actor.ogAVSIzos9mQ3kqC]{tribal warriors}.</p><h5><em><strong>Stirge</strong></em></h5><p>Captain @UUID[Actor.toaLaskilar00000]{Laskilar} (NE male Tethyrian human <strong>bandit captain</strong> wearing a cape of the mountebank) is a flamboyant, rakish pirate who’s grown tired of chasing merchant ships and hearing their captains whine and plead over lost revenues and spilled blood.

His ship, the <em>Stirge</em>, is filled with scoundrels and cutthroats eager to do his dirty work. Laskilar also stays in contact with a host of wealthy patrons in Port Nyanzaru and more distant ports who are eager to pay a king’s ransom for the rarest of his ill-gotten gains.</p><p>The crew of the <em>Stirge</em> includes a first mate named @UUID[Actor.toaHeel000000000]{Heel} (NE male half-orc <strong>gladiator</strong>), twelve Chultan and Tethyrian @UUID[Actor.WeoWLPQclgLKAD4S]{bandits}, six Chultan @UUID[Actor.ALGJkQ4Ts9YHRiHH]{thugs}, and a vicious sea priest named @UUID[Actor.toaCaldosHelling]{Caldos Hellingskorn} (CE male Illuskan <strong>priest</strong> of Umberlee).</p></aside><p>@Embed[JournalEntry.toaAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.25FfMlR6XrnCOuGq caption=false]</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h4>Activate the Jahaka Anchorage Scene</h4><p>The following locations are keyed to the @UUID[Scene.toaCh2JahakaAnch]{Jahaka Anchorage} Scene.</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The Scene is configured with 1 square = 5 feet and not 10 feet as the DM image describes.</p><p>The entrances to the Watchtower and the staircases within are configured to allow teleporting to access their areas.</p></article></section>"

Escape is risky for three reasons. First, pirates on watch atop the tower (@UUID[.yLGNd8cCGwTovI9t]{area 6}) keep an eye on the cage. Second, @UUID[Actor.toaCh2ReefSharks]{1d4 + 1 reef sharks} inhabit the water below the cage. Third, the only place escapees can go is the jungle, which is more cruel than the pirates.</p><p>Whether any prisoners are in the cell when characters arrive at Jahaka Anchorage is up to you, but it’s seldom empty.

Stone steps and rickety walkways connect the various buildings, the lowest of which is 500 feet above the ground. The main building has a circular mazelike symbol carved into its crumbling facade.</p><p>Every few minutes, bird folk either land at the monastery or launch themselves from its balconies and take to the sky.</p></section><p>Kir Sabal (@UUID[Scene.toaCh2KirSabal00]{map 2.11}) is home to a flock of aarakocra and a peaceful sanctuary where heroes can find rest and safety — if they can reach it. The aarakocra are also sheltering the last human descendants of the royal line of Omu. If the characters eventually liberate Omu from the evil possessing it, the royal line can be restored.</p><p>Originally, the monastery structures could be reached by ascending a path that combined natural stone ramps, steps cut into the cliff face, and wooden walkways built onto the cliff. The ramps and steps are still mostly intact, but the wooden walkways are rotting or missing entirely in many places. The aarakocra don’t need them and have no reason to repair them.</p><p>To reach the monastery from the ground, a character must make three ability checks. Each time a check fails, the character must choose between either taking [[/damage 3d6 bludgeoning average]] damage from a fall or gaining 1 level of &amp;Reference[exhaustion apply=false]{exhaustion} (which means disadvantage on further ability checks). The three ability checks are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>A [[/check athletics 15 format=long]] to climb around gaps in the walkway.</p></li><li><p>A [[/check acrobatics 15 format=long]] to cross wide gaps in the wooden walkways by jumping along oddly spaced support beams.</p></li><li><p>A [[/check Perception 15 format=long]] to spot rotted planking that won’t support weight.</p></li></ul><p>The climb takes 1 hour, plus 10 minutes for every failed ability check. Unless characters make the climb invisibly, at night, or during a rainstorm, it’s impossible to reach the monastery without the aarakocra knowing they’re coming.</p><p>Fifty-six @UUID[Actor.toaAarakocra0000]{aarakocra} live in Kir Sabal, in twelve “nests” or extended family groups. About a third of the aarakocra population are juveniles; the rest are adults split evenly between males and females. They live primarily by hunting in the jungle, fishing along the River Olung, and gardening atop the plateau, where they’re safe from most of Chult’s predators.</p><p>The leader of the community is an incredibly old aarakocra named @UUID[Actor.toaAsharra000000]{Asharra}. The others refer to her as Teacher, and they revere her as a living saint. Asharra is intelligent, ambitious, and somewhat manipulative, but never cruel or insensitive. Asharra is an aarakocra, with these changes:</p><ul><li>Asharra is lawful neutral.</li><li>She has 31 (7d8) hit points.</li><li>She has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 17, and the following skills: History +4, Insight +5, Perception +7.</li><li>She has the Spellcasting trait described below.</li><li>She speaks Auran and Common.</li><li>She has a challenge rating of 2 (450 XP).</li><li>She has the spells included in here Spellcasting feature.</li></ul><p>The aarakocra of Kir Sabal lead ritualistic lives and follow strict rules of behavior laid down by tradition and the Teacher. To a large extent, the rules and rituals have taken on a life of their own irrespective of any religious observance.</p><p>If the characters approach peacefully, they’ll be welcome in Kir Sabal as long as they don’t harm anyone, disrupt traditions, steal, or lie. Even as guests, they’re expected to spend a few hours a day helping with chores (sweeping floors and cleaning dishes, mostly).</p><p>If the characters tell Asharra of their plan to visit Omu and destroy the Soulmonger, she offers to perform a ritual called the Dance of the Seven Winds, bestowing on the characters the magical ability to fly (see the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2KirSabal00.JournalEntryPage.vJo49Lc5cYHqCMzu#dance-of-the-seven-winds]{Dance of the Seven Winds} sidebar). To complete the ritual, she needs a black orchid, which can be found only in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2Nangalore0]{Nangalore}. Asharra can provide directions, but she doesn’t allow her people to go anywhere near the ruins because of the evil, intelligent cranes (@UUID[Actor.eAeqHt83xvl3X0Rb]{eblis}) known to live there.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h4>Dance of the Seven Winds</h4><p>Asharra knows a ritual called the Dance of the Seven Winds, which temporarily grants magical flight to as many as ten nonflying creatures. The ritual, which takes 10 minutes to complete, can only be performed by an aarakocra elder and requires a black orchid as a material component.</p><p>Asharra must grind the orchid to powder, inhale it, and dance in circles around the ritual’s beneficiaries uninterrupted while seven other aarakocra chant prayers to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. When the dance concludes, Asharra’s wings disappear and she loses the ability to fly. The ritual’s beneficiaries each gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet (allowing them to fly 4 miles per hour). This benefit lasts for 3 days, after which Asharra’s wings reappear and she regains the ability to fly.</p></aside><p>Seventeen-year-old @UUID[Actor.jbWDnhaTyb2Dpc6r]{Princess Mwaxanaré} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.FDyn4HWR2JU4EFY6]{appendix D}) is the oldest living descendant of the royal families of Omu and the primary heir to the fallen kingdom. She and her six-year-old brother Na (a noncombatant with AC 10 and 3 hit points) are guests of the aarakocra — although “wards” might be a more accurate description. Their great-grandmother, Napaka, was the last ruling queen of Omu; their father, Omek, died in a fall, and their mother, Razaan, was killed by @UUID[Actor.a5ziGNVAeg4NEu0m]{pterafolk}. The aarakocra aim to protect the young royals (and their progeny, if necessary) until the evil in Omu is banished. The aarakocra say that they’re doing this solely for the future of Chult, but Asharra secretly hopes that the aarakocra will be elevated to key roles in any renewed Chultan kingdom, if and when it comes about.</p><p>Mwaxanaré is vain, headstrong, and impatient to claim her throne. She doesn’t take kindly to backtalk and is unaccustomed to speaking to anyone except Asharra without condescension. In her view, she’s already Queen of Chult; the rest of the world is at fault for not acknowledging that.</p><p>Unfortunately, the princess’s whole life has been sheltered at Kir Sabal, so her understanding of the world beyond the monastery is woefully, almost comically, narrow and distorted. For example, she never refers to other kingdoms as anything but principalities or holdings (“the holding of Waterdeep,” “the principality of Amn”); she believes that the other rulers of Faerûn would send thousands of soldiers to her aid in a matter of days if they were aware of her need; and she’s certain the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru will welcome her return and gladly hand over rulership of the city to their rightful monarch. The world as she understands it is tiny and hungry for her leadership. Mwaxanaré isn’t a fool; for the most part, these are things she’s been taught by Asharra.</p><p>Mwaxanaré believes she can garner widespread support to repopulate and rebuild Omu by retrieving a symbolically significant yet long-lost treasure called the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toaSkullChaliceo]{Skull Chalice of Ch’gakare} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5TombOfTheN]{chapter 5}). If the characters claim to be headed to Omu, she urges them to find the chalice and return it to her “for the good of Chult.” If the characters request something more substantial as a reward, she offers them 250 gp worth of choice pieces from her private treasury (see @UUID[.J4yXE75GeVWQdwKD]{area 5}).</p><aside class=\"float-right notable\"><h4>When Gargoyles Attack</h4><p>The @UUID[Actor.toaGargoyle00000]{gargoyles} of Omu and the @UUID[Actor.toaEncAarakocra0]{aarakocra} of Kir Sabal are bitter enemies. Aarakocra scouts watch over the distant city, and their brazen intrusion annoys the gargoyles. Once in a while, gargoyles follow a patrol back to Kir Sabal and attack the monastery. If this happens while the characters are visiting Kir Sabal, the aarakocra appreciate whatever help the party can provide. The attacking force consists of ten gargoyles. If six or more are slain, the rest fly back to Omu.</p></aside><p>Although the aarakocra treat her well, Mwaxanaré is lonely; the only other human in Kir Sabal is her brother. Consequently, the princess is likely to fixate on one of the adventurers as a potential romantic partner. This attachment will be powerful, fiery, and jealous, and Mwaxanaré is accustomed to getting everything she wants.</p><p>Against Asharra’s wishes, the princess forged a pact with the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, ancient beings of the Outer Planes, to become a fledgling warlock. She detests physical labor and puts her @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hand} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ccduLIvutyNqvkgv]{unseen servant} spells to constant use. Through her pact, she has also gained telepathy, which she enjoys using.</p><p>If Asharra suspects that Mwaxanaré might learn disturbing or inconvenient truths about the world from the characters, or that her passion for one of them might lead to tragedy, they become a dangerous presence in Asharra’s eyes — and Kir Sabal is a precarious place for creatures without wings.</p><p>Na wears an aarakocra costume he made himself and pretends to be one of the bird folk. He is uncommonly studious and bookish for a six-year-old boy. He is polite, deferential, and speaks softly with a wisdom beyond his meager years. His only outdoor interests are walking among the gardens atop the plateau, where he studies plants and insects, and launching complex flying toys made of wood and folded paper out the window of his room and watching them glide lazily across the jungle. Na would laugh, and then be aghast, if anyone suggested he would make a better monarch than Mwaxanaré.</p><p>@Embed[JournalEntry.toaAtlas00000000.JournalEntryPage.UXVMbbWtM7MCGYfC caption=false]</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h4>Activate the Kir Sabal Scene</h4><p>The following locations are keyed to the @UUID[Scene.toaCh2KirSabal00]{Kir Sabal} Scene.</p></article></section>"

If someone asks why she wears a veil, Zalkoré replies that she no longer desires to show her face to anyone but her beloved Thiru-taya.</li></ul><p>As long as the meeting remains cordial, Zalkoré can reveal much about Omu. She can direct characters to its general location (“between the fire peaks and the great iron mine of the dwarves”) and warns them that yuan-ti covet the city. She knows nothing about the Soulmonger or the death curse. She’s heard that at least one of her descendants is in hiding with the bird folk of Kir Sabal, awaiting the restoration of the monarchy.

The black orchid in Zalkoré’s possession is the only one to be found in Nangalore.</p><p><em><strong>Poisonous Hospitality.</strong></em> If Zalkoré resolves to kill the characters over an offense but the situation is still more-or-less cordial, she offers food and drink.

The spirit of Thiru-Taya answers the call, appearing as a barely visible 10-foot-tall apparition of a Chultan warrior wielding a massive spear of force. The apparition is impervious to damage and spells, and it can’t be turned or controlled. It looms above Zalkoré until she dies or regains all her hit points. Once per turn, when a creature within 15 feet of Zalkoré damages her, Thiru-Taya’s apparition unerringly hits the attacker with its spear, dealing [[/damage 2d8 + 6 force average]] damage to it.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Most of what remains in Zalkoré’s lair has little value. Her @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toach2featheredd]{feathered dress} is worth 50 gp, if it wasn’t too damaged in the fight (the dress is ruined if more than half the damage done to Zalkoré was slashing, acid, or fire damage, or if she was hit by a <em>fireball</em> or similar effect). Her lair contains [[/r 2d6]] vials of her @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toach2dreamingti]{dreaming tincture}. Each vial contains a single dose and can be sold for 10 gp in Port Nyanzaru. Any character that drinks a dose of the tincture must succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]]. Characters who are immune to the poisoned condition succeed automatically. On a failed save, the character begins to experience illusory sights, sounds, smells, and sensations that seem real.

She saw the evil in the Omuans’ hearts and decided to lance it like a troublesome boil. The kamadan fashioned a holy spear, but she left it by the riverbank and a crafty grung stole it. In her rage, Shagambi the kamadan forgot all about the Omuans and chased Nangnang the grung forever across the sky.</p><p>When evening came, a wily eblis stepped from his reed hut. He didn’t like the Omuans, but without them he’d have no one to play his tricks on. The eblis sent a marsh frog to reason with Ubtao, but the frog was angry and decided to wrestle the god instead. This amused Ubtao, so he gave the frog tentacles to make it stronger. When Kubazan the froghemoth returned to Papazotl the eblis, he chased Papazotl into the swamp with his new tentacles.</p><p>That night, a su-monster broke into Ubtao’s palace and stole a pail of water for the Omuans. When the god came running to find it, the su-monster hid the pail in a jaculi’s burrow. Ubtao asked the jungle animals where his water was hidden, and Moa the jaculi was too honest to lie. When Wongo the su-monster found out how Moa had betrayed him, he vowed to catch the jaculi and eat him up.</p><p>All the while, Unkh the flail snail lived deep under the earth.

Their trails crisscross back and forth, making other creatures in the tomb difficult to track. The freshest tracks belong to the skeleton keys (see “Tomb Inhabitants” below).

To assemble that team, Acererak abducted dwarf miners and transformed them into wights to exploit their expertise at underground construction.

The archlich devised brutal trials for each burial chamber, and sprinkled riddles and illusions throughout to deceive intruders. When the building work was done, he fed the captured Omuans into the death trap to test its efficacy. The archlich turned some of his victims into undead and flesh golems, then locked them inside the tomb to serve as guardians. Acererak then resumed his wanderings.</p><p>In Acererak’s absence, the tomb snared adventurers from faraway lands and harvested their souls to feed the archlich’s phylactery, which remained hidden on another plane. Every few decades, Acererak returned to tinker with his dungeon’s traps, add treasure to its vaults, and reap a bounty of hoarded souls. His planar wanderings have influenced the tomb’s mishmash of architectural styles, and have populated it with strange and deadly monsters.</p><h2>Nourishing the Atropal</h2><p>On one of his journeys through the cosmos, Acererak stumbled upon an @UUID[Actor.dbM4sT1yZLbnZR2a]{atropal} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.FDyn4HWR2JU4EFY6]{appendix D}). He brought it to Toril, ensconced it in the cradle of his tomb, and began feeding it necromantic energy, hoping to transform it into a deity: one able to claim dominion over death. Unleashed on Toril, the newborn death god would glut itself on life until none but the dead walked the world.</p><p>To nurture the atropal, Acererak needed an untold number of souls. The archlich made a bargain with the @UUID[Actor.toaSewnSisters00]{Sewn Sisters}, a coven of night hags feared throughout the Lower Planes. Seduced by the prospect of a near-endless supply of souls, the hags joined Acererak in his tomb. With their assistance, the archlich crafted the Soulmonger — a necromantic device that could reap the souls of the dying from across Toril and feed them to the atropal.

When a creature of the humanoid type touches such an item, the trickster god bound within attempts to inhabit that creature. With a successful [[/save cha 16 format=long]], the creature resists the god’s power, and that god can’t attempt to inhabit the same creature for the remainder of the adventure. On a failed save — or if the creature chooses to forgo the save — the god’s spirit inhabits the creature’s body. The trickster gods can tell whether or not a creature is humanoid, and they have no interest in possessing other types of creatures.</p><p>While inhabiting a host body, a trickster god acts like an overbearing passenger. The host creature remains in control of its actions but inherits a flaw from the god, as well as a special power. When a trickster god inhabits a player character, give the player that god’s card (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.book.JournalEntry.toaAppFTrickster]{appendix F}). A character doesn’t know what power and flaw are gained from a specific trickster god until that god inhabits the character for the first time. Both the flaw and the power end when the spirit leaves the host.</p><h2>Leaving a Host</h2><p>A trickster god never willingly leaves a host, but its spirit is forced out if a host dies or leaves the tomb, or if a host is targeted by the break enchantment function of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.TkJ8Wtg1L7TZtspm]{dispel evil and good} spell. A trickster god can also be forced out by another trickster god (see “Fighting Over a Host” below).</p><p>When the spirit of a trickster god is forced out of a host, it returns to the magic item to which it is bound and cannot inhabit that host again for the remainder of the adventure. If the item is destroyed or taken from the tomb, the trickster god’s spirit finds another object within the tomb to inhabit. The spirits of the trickster gods can’t be destroyed and can never leave the tomb.</p><h2>Fighting Over a Host</h2><p>When the spirit of one trickster god inhabits a host that is already inhabited by a trickster god, the two gods battle for the right to remain in the host. Assign “even” to one god and “odd” to another, then roll any die. The result determines which god is victorious, with the losing god forced out of the host. The host has no influence over which god gets forced out.</p><h2>Roleplaying the Spirits</h2><p>A trickster god can use the host character’s senses and speak to the host’s mind. The character retains his or her alignment and can think independently. However, if the character has a flaw that runs counter to the trickster god’s flaw, the character’s flaw is suppressed until the trickster god’s spirit leaves the character’s body.</p><p>You can roleplay the voices of the trickster gods in the characters’ heads, but let the players roleplay their characters’ inherited flaws. If a player neglects to roleplay a trickster god’s flaw, have the inhabiting spirit attempt to goad the character into behaving more like it. You can award inspiration to a player who roleplays a trickster god’s flaw particularly well.</p><p>All the trickster gods are eager to get their revenge on Acererak. They can offer only limited guidance regarding the tomb and its denizens, but they encourage the characters to seek out other trickster god spirits and offer supernatural assistance in the final battle against the archlich.</p><p>Each trickster god (except Unkh) has its own rival in the tomb that it would prefer to avoid. The Omuans dreamed up colorful stories to explain these antipathies, but in truth, the spirits simply represent conflicting points on the alignment axes. When rival spirits occupy different characters in the same group, they try to make their hosts bicker and defy each other whenever possible.</p>"

              "text": "<p>Destroying the Soulmonger frees the souls trapped inside it and ends Acererak’s death curse. Characters who accomplish this goal will have saved many lives, and if word spreads of their heroism, wealthy and influential NPCs come forward bearing gifts of thanks. These gifts can take many forms, including parcels of land and special favors (see “Marks of Prestige” in chapter 7 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>). If the characters allow the atropal to survive in the depths of the tomb, it eventually attracts nihilistic devotees of @UUID[Actor.toaAcererak00000]{Acererak} who feed it their own dark souls as nourishment.</p><h2>Lost Treasures</h2><p>As they explore the tomb, characters are likely to find one or more fabled treasures as well as magic items inhabited by the spirits of Omu’s dead trickster gods. What happens to these items when the characters leave the tomb is discussed below.</p><h3>Relics of the Past</h3><p>Acererak placed four treasures in the tomb as lures: the Black Opal Crown, the Eye of Zaltec, the Navel of the Moon, and the Skull Chalice of Ch’gakare. These items can be kept, sold to interested buyers, or returned to their rightful owners.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toaBlackOpalCrow]{Black Opal Crown} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level4Cham.JournalEntryPage.gI8CWdbiI4duMmut]{Area 49}</strong></em>). The yuan-ti of Omu are after this treasure. If they can’t wrest it from the characters, they attempt to buy or steal the crown from the individual to whom the characters sell it. Whether the crown has the power to set loose Dendar the Night Serpent is up to you. Should the crown fall into the wrong hands, characters might need to venture into the caverns below the Peaks of Flame to retrieve it before the world ends.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toaCh5EyeofZalte]{Eye of Zaltec} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level5Gear.JournalEntryPage.rGvqugsWRerEEEjr]{Area 62})</strong></em>. The Company of the Yellow Banner was vanquished trying to obtain this lost jewel, which is rumored to have the power to resurrect the ancient dead. If the Eye of Zaltec indeed has such power, it requires a great many sacrifices to function. Tabaxi thieves might try to steal the jewel and bear it safely back to Maztica, perhaps trading it for the release of enslaved loved ones. Conversely, a villain might buy the jewel and use it to resurrect a dead tyrant, an evil archmage, or some even greater threat.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toaCh5Navelofthe]{Navel of the Moon} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level4Cham.JournalEntryPage.JJqUmlRXGSLpY5m4]{Area 56})</strong></em>. If the characters try to sell this stone in Baldur’s Gate, Port Nyanzaru, or some other city, word of the sale quickly reaches the spies of wealthy Calishite merchants. A bidding war might ensue, or assassins might be sent to retrieve the stone and quietly dispose of its new owner. Whether the stone has its purported power to reunite families separated by time and fate is entirely up to you.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toaSkullChaliceo]{Skull Chalice of Ch’gakare} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level5Gear.JournalEntryPage.PTO1WYAz3v5ZO4MO]{Area 67})</strong></em>. Princess Mwaxanaré can’t afford to pay characters what this treasure is worth, and she will despise them for selling it to someone else. Three of Port Nyanzaru’s merchant princes express interest in buying the chalice: Ifan Talro’a wants to add it to his private collection of Chultan relics, Kwayothé wants to melt it down, and Zhanthi wants it for sentimental reasons. Denying any one of them would be a grave mistake on the characters’ part and might result in them receiving an ominous Ytepka Society token.</p><h3>Magic Items of the Trickster Gods</h3><p>Certain magic items — specifically those in which the spirits of the nine trickster gods reside — turn to dust and are destroyed as soon as they exit the tomb. These items include Obo’laka’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.QtmVEreNIWEVOoLR]{ring of protection} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level1Rott.JournalEntryPage.eHJ1Y2M07sylhjku]{area 10}), Moa’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.MOeFq5MLAQzVQC7z]{staff of the python} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level1Rott.JournalEntryPage.DEfs9aq8xasdWxrs]{area 14}), Wongo’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.b46t42bMruQf9v3O]{mace of terror} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level1Rott.JournalEntryPage.utVARZSMisfgCcNs]{area 16}), Papazotl’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.iiQxTvDOhPGW5spF]{amulet of health} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level2Dung.JournalEntryPage.HR7uThc2AWoOZ760]{area 22}), Nangnang’s egg-shaped @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.44XNWmMGnwXn7bNW]{pearl of power} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level2Dung.JournalEntryPage.oUx8rnugfJEHuoiT]{area 24}), I’jin’s horn-shaped @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.lPsueMv4ZoXqCYf9]{wand of wonder} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level3Vaul.JournalEntryPage.kFaHifbbANasEFqN]{area 35}), Kubazan’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ZYEqOSY9BLZs2GPx]{bracers of archery} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level3Vaul.JournalEntryPage.lC1p3SMNdQlQxIGW]{area 42}), Shagambi’s instrument of the bards (<em>DMG 2014</em>, @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level4Cham.JournalEntryPage.0irMuLycb80eNEJr]{area 48}), and Unkh’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.JRJpKZyamkpa7awv]{robe of scintillating colors} (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5Level4Cham.JournalEntryPage.Bk2b33WKR4CkUc6t]{area 55}).</p><p>If, in your estimation, a player did an extraordinary job roleplaying a trickster god’s flaw, the god’s spirit might reward that player’s character by allowing its magic item to exist outside the tomb, provided that character is attuned to the item when it leaves the tomb.</p><h2>Syndra’s Fate</h2><p>Characters who survive the Tomb of the Nine Gods won’t know the fate of @UUID[Actor.toaSyndraSilvane]{Syndra Silvane} until they return to Port Nyanzaru, use a spell such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{scrying} to spy on her, or reach out to her with a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD]{sending} spell or similar magic. If the characters destroy the Soulmonger and Syndra is still alive, priests quickly restore her to full health, and the characters can collect their promised reward. If Syndra dies but her soul is saved before the atropal devours it, she is raised from the dead within a tenday of the Soulmonger’s destruction and honors her agreement with the party. In the event that Syndra dies and her soul is devoured, her body lies in state pending a funeral and proper burial.</p><h2>Artus and the Ring of Winter</h2><p>@UUID[Actor.toaEncArtusCimbe]{Artus Cimber} is unwilling to part with @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toamgcRingofWint]{Ring of Winter}. He is justifiably concerned that the ring would dominate and control any other owner. Furthermore, Artus would begin to age as a normal human without the ring, and he wants to live forever with his beloved Alisanda.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.VuDXEqP3oRgnyIIC]{Xandala}, the Harpers, the Zhentarim, and frost giants loyal to Jarl Storvald won’t stop searching for the Ring of Winter. If the characters make their way back to civilization with Artus in tow, they should encounter one or more of these groups along the way. @UUID[Actor.toaValindraShado]{Valindra Shadowmantle} and the Red Wizards of Thay also won’t pass up a chance to take the ring by force.</p><p>With or without the ring, Artus Cimber continues to await Mezro’s return while searching for the means to reach or summon the displaced city. Nothing matters to him more than reuniting with his wife. Characters interested in helping Artus can use divination spells or downtime to conduct research. They might also consult with the Harpers, who have access to lore that might assist Artus in his quest, but they demand the ring in exchange for their assistance. Forced to choose between the Harpers’ assistance and the ring, Artus chooses the latter. Alternatively, a portal to Mezro’s demiplane might be hidden somewhere in Chult, creating the seeds of a wonderful new adventure.</p><h2>Dragonbait</h2><p>If he’s with the characters when they escape from the Tomb of the Nine Gods, @UUID[Actor.1Gp38SRQcEPAsgSG]{Dragonbait} is eager to put Omu and this adventure behind him. As long as Artus Cimber is alive, Dragonbait remains committed to helping his friend find the displaced city of Mezro. If Artus is dead and there’s no hope of raising him, Dragonbait opts to return to Port Nyanzaru, where he drowns his sorrows in a few casks of tej before enjoying some downtime. The saurial gives off the scent of roses as he waves farewell to the party. He eventually crosses paths with @UUID[Actor.LGOEeAdUizQZYcEy]{Volothamp Geddarm}, and the two explorers embark on numerous adventures together.</p><h2>Omu</h2><p>Unless the characters cleared out the Fane of the Night Serpent, Omu remains in the clutches of the yuan-ti. If @UUID[Actor.zwk4UdGbwhWumFqp]{Ras Nsi} is still alive, he has no further use for the characters once the death curse is ended. Believing they know too much for their own good, he sends a party of yuan-ti to capture or kill them before they leave the city. If the party obtained the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toaBlackOpalCrow]{Black Opal Crown}, they can trade the item for their lives.</p><p>If @UUID[Actor.toaFenthaza00000]{Fenthaza} lives, Ras Nsi makes the mistake of putting her in charge of the team sent to kill the characters, and she offers the party a deal instead. If the characters agree to kill Ras Nsi, they can go free and keep whatever treasure they take from the fane except for the Black Opal Crown, which Fenthaza insists be given to her at once. If the characters defeat Ras Nsi handily, Fenthaza honors her end of the deal. If they emerge from the fane weakened, she tries to destroy them.</p><p>@UUID[Actor.jbWDnhaTyb2Dpc6r]{Princess Mwaxanaré} wants to restore Omu to its former glory and build a new kingdom there. With the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.toaSkullChaliceo]{Skull Chalice of Ch’gakare} in her possession, she can win the support of Chultans eager to return to the old ways. However, the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru aren’t willing to back her claim, and the yuan-ti won’t give up Omu without a fight. It could take years for Mwaxanaré’s dream to come true, if it ever does.</p><h2>Red Wizards of Thay</h2><p>News of the Soulmonger’s destruction annoys @UUID[Actor.toaValindraShado]{Valindra Shadowmantle}. Using her @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{teleportation circle}, she returns to Thay and informs Szass Tam that her mission in Chult has failed. Angered by the party’s interference, Szass Tam sends new operatives and powerful undead to spy on the characters, learn their weaknesses, and (eventually) dispose of them. If the characters have friendly ties to the Harpers or the Zhentarim, spies working for one faction or the other learn of the Red Wizard plot and can warn the characters.</p><h2>Acererak the Eternal</h2><p>@UUID[Actor.toaAcererak00000]{Acererak} keeps his phylactery hidden, and neither gods nor spells can divine its location. If his physical body is destroyed, Acererak reforms next to his phylactery in [[/r 1d10]] days. The archlich isn’t quick to avenge his defeat. He prefers to let time — his most powerful ally — slay the adventurers. Once they’re dead and gone, he sets out to make life miserable for their descendants.</p><h2>More Adventures</h2><p>This concludes <em>Tomb of Annihilation</em>. Space limitations preclude us from exploring Chult in its entirety, but you can create your own Chult-based adventures and publish them at the Dungeon Masters Guild (<a href=\"https://www.dmsguild.com/\">www.dmsguild.com</a>).</p>"

On the south wall, a bronze shield bears the embossed image of a Chultan warrior carrying a spear, below an inscription that reads, “Bow before no one.” Four bronze statues stand on pedestals to either side of the shield.

The hunter can’t see any creature behind the front-facing side of the shield. When it hurls a spear at a creature, the hunter makes a ranged spell attack ([[/attack +10]]{+10 to hit}) and deals [[/damage 4d8 force average]] damage on a hit. A target reduced to 0 hit points by this attack is disintegrated and turns to dust.</p><p>To stop the shield’s hunter from attacking, a character must blind it by draping something opaque over the shield (such as a sack or cloak) or turning the shield to face a wall.

Tactile exploration reveals that the liquid has no substance and the font is dry.</p><p>The dark figure is a magical, @UUID[Actor.toaShadowDuplica]{illusory duplicate} of whichever character opened the door to the room. It copies the character’s movements, allowing a shrewd player to use the duplicate to dispense with the liquid in the font. The shadow duplicate has the statistics of a commoner and is immune to poison damage. It perfectly matches the motions of the character who created it, always keeping its back to its creator as though it was a projected image 15 feet ahead.</p><p>If the character who created the shadow duplicate moves backward, the duplicate moves toward the font. If the character then mimes drinking from the font, the duplicate slurps up the “soup” at a rate of 5 pints per round, draining the font in 8 rounds. Once the font is drained of illusory soup, a treasure appears in the font that wasn’t there before (see “Treasure” below). Casting @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic} on the font causes the illusory soup to vanish, but the treasure does not appear. The illusory soup reappears 1 minute later.</p><p>The shadow duplicate can’t exert pressure on objects and glides through any obstacles it encounters. Casting dispel magic on the figure causes it to vanish. It doesn’t react to taking damage but disappears if it drops to 0 hit points or is made to leave the chamber. Closing the door to the room and reopening it creates a new duplicate of whoever opened the door. There can be only one shadow duplicate at a time.</p><p>The shadow duplicate has a terrible and deadly aspect. Any creature that looks upon its face sees a horrific visage locked in a silent scream and must succeed on a [[/save wis 15 format=long]] or drop to 0 hit points. A creature that cannot be frightened automatically succeeds on the saving throw.</p><h3>Treasure</h3><p>If a shadow duplicate drinks all the illusory soup in the font, a 1-inch-diameter eyeball made of incandescent @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.l9ziM32a9FdfpLFb]{orange crystal} appears at the bottom of the font and can easily be removed. If the eye is taken from the font and later put back, it disappears and the illusory soup effect is reset.</p><p><em><strong>Crystal Eye.</strong></em> The nonmagical crystal eye is one of the ten keys needed to open the vault of the beholder (@UUID[.1J3idPqu9VREsqr0]{area 44)}.</p><h3>Empty Closet</h3><p>East of the font is a dusty, empty room.</p>"

A silver key hangs from a cord around the figure’s neck.</p><p>Two nine-foot-tall stone statues stand atop plinths on either side of the pit. A third plinth against the south wall stands empty. One of the statues depicts a hooded and bearded male figure with his left hand held high, index finger pointed up. The other portrays an armored male knight with his gauntleted right hand extended, its palm facing inward toward the knight.</p></section><p>An invisible wall of force (as created by the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.o9ZCvuD2B1OTcubb]{wall of force} spell) covers the top of the pit, shielding the @UUID[Actor.toaClayGolem0000]{clay golem} and the chest below.

Even if nothing is there, a popping is heard as air rushes in to fill the empty space.

A character using thieves’ tools can pick the lock with a successful [[/tool ability=dexterity tool=thief 20]]{DC 20 Dexterity check}. However, opening the chest by any means other than the silver key releases a cloud of gas that fills a 15-foot cube centered above the chest (filling the entire pit).

A character who searches for traps can detect the holes hidden behind the dial with a [[/check Perception 25 format=long]]; once found, these holes can be plugged with wax before the dial is removed, preventing the gas from escaping.</p>"

Resting on the deck of the barge is a small golden sarcophagus decorated with horned rabbits. A dark shaft opens in the ceiling directly above the barge, while to the south, a corridor is visible through a set of fangs carved into the wall.</p><p>The skeleton of a dwarf sprawls on the floor east of the barge, clad in a tattered yellow turban and dusty chain mail, and clutching a bronze shield.</p></section><p>To unlock I’jin’s sarcophagus, eight floor tiles must be stepped on in the correct sequence (see “Hieroglyphic Floor” below and @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppEPlayerHan.JournalEntryPage.R5R56vs31tZmwbWt]{handout 23} in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppEPlayerHan]{appendix E}).

The locusts form a single cloud that fills a 15-foot cube centered above the offending floor tile. Each creature in the cloud when it forms, as well as any creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, takes [[/damage 8d10 piercing average]] damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this trap is killed and eaten to the bone by the devouring locusts.

The polished marble floor is so perfectly reflective that it creates the illusion of standing at the entrance to a sphere. Nine alcoves filled with glittering treasure open up along the walls. In the middle of the chamber, a large spherical object hovers under a black silk drape twenty feet above the floor.</p></section><p>The beholder, @UUID[Actor.toaBelchorzhtheU]{Belchorzh} (pronounced BEL-korj), floats at the top of the room. Acererak cast a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{wish} spell to render Belchorzh invisible. A successful@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{ dispel magic} (DC 19) cast on the beholder or contact with an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ]{antimagic field} ends its invisibility. Belchorzh reacts to intruders as described in the “Beholder Tactics” section below.</p><p>The hall contains one hundred lit candles. While the candles remain inside this vault, they burn indefinitely. If a candle is taken from the room, it burns down normally.</p><p>The floor beneath the dome is magically slick. Any creature that steps onto or starts its turn on the floor must succeed on a [[/save dex 10 format=long]] or fall &amp;Reference[prone]{prone}. When an untethered creature is shoved or otherwise moved across the floor, it travels in one direction and does not stop until it comes into contact with a wall or other barrier.</p><p>The alcoves contain treasure (see “Treasure” below).</p><h3>Advice from the Spirits</h3><p>Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Kubazan, Obo’laka, or Wongo receive the following advice:</p><ul><li>Impulsive Kubazan urges his host to attack whatever is hiding under the black drape, with no warning or negotiation.</li><li>Cautious Obo’laka thinks a beholder is hidden under the black drape and urges her host to flee at once.</li><li>When he becomes aware of the beholder, reckless Wongo suggests that his host attack another party member, to trick the beholder into thinking it has an ally.</li></ul><h3>Black Drape, Iron Sphere</h3><p>The black drape conceals a magical sphere of iron, 6 feet in diameter and floating 20 feet above the floor. A <em>Nystul’s magic aura</em> (Player’s Handbook 2014) spell placed on the sphere makes it seem like an evil aberration to features or magic that can sense such information.</p><p>The iron sphere is hollow and immobile, and it remains inert while the drape covers it. Belchorzh can use its telekinetic eye ray to remove the drape at any time, revealing the sphere and causing it to emit a magical magnetic field. Each creature in the room wearing metal armor is pulled to the sphere and becomes stuck to it, as does any metal weapon or object that isn’t secured or being held. Any creature stuck to the sphere is &amp;Reference[restrained] until the magnetic field deactivates.</p><p>Any ranged attack made in the chamber that uses ammunition made wholly or partly from metal has disadvantage on the attack roll; if the attack misses, the ammunition becomes stuck to the sphere.</p><p>Throwing the black drape over the sphere renders it temporarily inert, with creatures and objects stuck to it falling to the floor. A successful @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic} (DC 16) cast on the sphere dispels the Nystul’s magic aura spell, permanently deactivates the magnetic field, and causes the sphere to crash to the floor. This sends a web of cracks through the marble, negating the floor’s frictionless effect and allowing creatures to move across it normally. The sphere also deactivates and falls if it comes into contact with an antimagic field or is destroyed.</p><p>The sphere is a Large object with AC 20; 100 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It weighs 1,000 pounds. While the magnetic field is active, any attack made against the sphere with a metal weapon automatically hits, though the weapon becomes stuck to the sphere after impact.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Toggle the Black Drape's Visibility</h3><p>The @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.macros.Macro.toaToggleBlackDr]{Toggle Black Drape} Macro will toggle the visibility of the black drape and reveal the iron sphere underneath.</p></article></section><h3>Beholder Tactics</h3><p>The Tomb of the Nine Gods is not truly the beholder’s domain, so it can’t use lair actions.</p><p>The invisible beholder puts as much distance between itself and the adventurers as possible, while making sure to not catch the iron sphere in its Antimagic Cone.</p><p>Belchorzh doesn’t pursue intruders who flee its vault.

Destroying the panel disables the controls and causes arcs of lightning to momentarily erupt from the iron lectern.

The iron wall remains locked in place for 1 hour, after which it rises back into the ceiling on its own. It can't be lifted or pried open, though a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.1nhIxh0DsJsntCfj]{knock} spell causes it to retract into the ceiling.

When Acererak enslaved it, the aboleth lost its mind and developed a split personality. Its dominant aspect awaits the coming of the death god, which it believes heralds the fall of divinity. Until that day, the aboleth humbly obeys @UUID[Actor.toaWithers000000]{Withers} (whom the creature refers to by his original name of Gorra) and attacks anyone seeking to prevent the atropal’s ascension. The aboleth’s other personality is that of a humanoid child — harmless, gleeful, and insanely curious. In this state of mind, the aboleth poses no threat to anyone and flees if attacked. Roll any [[/gmroll 1d2]]{die} to determine which personality is dominant at any given time. On an even result, the aboleth’s childlike personality is dominant.</p><p>If the characters explore the lake using the rowboats in @UUID[.24DU8UPS7LQNnHKM]{area 66}, the aboleth ignores them regardless of its current demeanor, unless they draw undue attention to themselves. In the event of combat, the aboleth is not the master of the lake and has no lair actions as a result.</p><p>Ancient beyond reckoning, G’lyh’rul has accumulated tens of thousands of years of knowledge.

As punishment, the king’s sorcerers banished Ch’gakare and Ghom to the Nine Hells, but the two fought their way back home.

Under the stewardship of a corrupt pentadrone, the modrons rerouted one of their great chains into the tomb.

No one can expect to enter a vortex and survive.</p><p><strong>DC 15:</strong> The chain is called a Mechanus chain.

One part of the chain descends at a rate of 50 feet per round, wrapping around the giant gear that floats 100 feet below the east balcony, while the other part of the chain climbs to enter the upper vortex at the same rate.</p><p>The two balconies are separated by a 15-foot-wide gulf, through which jangling chain links rise and fall. Magic that allows characters to fly or to walk on walls makes it easy to cross from one balcony to the other. Any character who moves at least 10 feet beforehand can jump from the west balcony to the east balcony. Because the west balcony is 15 feet higher than its eastern counterpart, a character must either pole vault across the gap (using a 10-foot pole or similar item) or use magic. A character can also cross the expanse by leaping from one balcony to the nearest chain, from that chain to the other, and finally to the opposite balcony. Each of these jumps requires a successful [[/check Athletics 10 format=long]]. Any character who fails a check made to jump to a balcony or chain falls down the shaft and into the lower planar vortex unless somehow halted. A falling character can land on the floating gear 100 feet below with a successful [[/save dex 10 format=long]] but takes falling damage as normal.</p>"

The hags are a frightful lot:</p><p><strong>@UUID[Actor.toaWidowGroat000]{Widow Groat}</strong> has tarnished gold coins covering her eyes and ants nesting in her skull. The ants serve as her spies, and their presence often portends her arrival. She carries a <em>heartstone</em>, a <em>soul bag</em>, and an iron ring with eight keys. The keys unlock the shackles in @UUID[.UBJuaTLd0u3AzbvI]{area 78}.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Actor.toaPeggyDeadbell]{Peggy Deadbells}</strong> wears a string of chattering children’s teeth and thumps about on a heavy peg leg. When she laughs, yellow gas billows out of her nose and ears. Around her neck, she wears a pouch made from gnome skin, inside which is a heartstone and five lustrous black marbles (see @UUID[.CTopj3psKWc01KO2]{area 81}). Tied to Peggy’s rope belt is a soul bag.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Actor.toaBaggyNanna000]{Baggy Nanna}</strong> has a squirming leather sack sewn over her head. The bag also contains a cockerel, a viper, and a terrier. One animal can emerge from the bag in place of her own head to speak on her behalf, and the animals become smoke when Baggy Nanna dies. In her pockets, she carries a <em>heartstone</em>, a <em>soul bag</em>, and three goblin fingers.</p><p>The night hags have a shared pool of spells (see the “Hag Covens” sidebar in the <em>Monster Manual</em>). The <strong>scarecrow</strong> @UUID[Actor.iFXjzcyFi14cpnRs]{Mister Threadneedle} (see @UUID[.Hf49VaTDGA9k3jtl]{area 74}) carries the coven’s <em>hag eye</em>.</p><p>For more information on heartstones and soul bags, see the “Night Hag Items” sidebar in the <em>Monster Manual</em>.</p></aside><p></p><h3>Cage</h3><p>A heavy padlock secures the gate of the rusted cage, inside which a naked figure cowers under a bloodstained blanket.</p><p>Mister Threadneedle (see @UUID[.Hf49VaTDGA9k3jtl]{area 74}) carries the key to the padlock, which can otherwise be unlocked with a successful [[/tool ability=dexterity tool=thief 15]]{DC 15 Dexterity check} made using thieves’ tools. The lock can also be broken off easily enough.</p><p>The cage’s prisoner is a degenerate clone of one of the player characters and is instantly recognizable as such. It was created from blood or strands of hair obtained by one of the hags while the character slept. Characters had a slight chance of meeting the hag as a random @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppBRandomEnc.JournalEntryPage.DFIxvfX6onZK3Yb1]{wilderness encounter} (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppBRandomEnc]{appendix B}); however, when and where the theft occurred is up to you.</p><p>The clone is not a perfect copy. It is shorter and scrawnier than the character after whom it’s modeled, and it has deformities. Use the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{commoner} statistics to represent this creature, applying racial traits as appropriate.</p><p>The clone has no name and no memory of having been created. However, the hags have forged a magical link between the clone and the character from which it was made. The clone knows everything the character knows, up to and including all present knowledge. The hags have been interrogating the clone to learn everything about the adventurers. Now that they have no more use for such information, the Sewn Sisters plan to kill and eat the clone.</p><h3>Cauldron</h3><p>A tarry greenish-black brew fills the bronze cauldron. Any creature that drinks the brew is &amp;Reference[stunned]{stunned} for [[/gmr 1d10]] minutes. While stunned, the creature succumbs to seizures brought on by the dark dreams of the atropal.</p><p>The bronze lid of the cauldron lies on the floor nearby. If the lid is placed on the cauldron, the green smoke that fills the room dissipates after 1 minute.</p><h2>Skeleton Gate</h2><p>When the characters get close enough to make out the details of the green door, read:</p><section class=\"narrative\"><p>This twelve-foot-high, ten-foot-wide door is made of green stone, its surface carved with grinning goblin skeletons. A belt of smooth stone spans the door at a height of four feet, set with five gold symbols in a row: a triangle, a square, a pentagon, a hexagon, and an octagon. Each symbol is engraved on a recessed circular seal.</p></section><p>@embed[JournalEntry.toaAppArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.zbQk4YqfHBvBpBPH caption=false]</p><p>The geometric symbols are 6 inches across, 1 foot apart, and set into stone disks 8 inches in diameter. Hidden behind the seals are five keyholes that conform in size and shape to the heads of the skeleton keys found on the other tomb levels (see \"Skeleton Keys\").</p><p>Each time the characters complete a trial in areas 72 to area 76, one stone seal rolls aside, exposing the keyhole behind it. When a skeleton key is inserted into its corresponding keyhole and turned clockwise, a tumbler inside the door unlocks. When all five tumblers unlock, the skeleton gate can be pulled open like a normal (albeit heavy) door, revealing a wide staircase that descends 20 feet to @UUID[.PzFdAiKV7ySB1BOE]{area 77}. The door and its seals are impervious to damage and spells, and cannot be opened in a manner other than that which is prescribed above.</p><p><em><strong>Facing the Night Hags</strong></em>. If the characters manage to open all five keyholes and have the requisite skeleton keys in their possession, the @UUID[Actor.toaSewnSisters00]{Sewn Sisters} emerge from the Border Ethereal and attack them. The hags’ goal is to seize one or more of the @UUID[Actor.toaSkeletonKey00]{skeleton keys}, thus preventing the characters from reaching the Soulmonger. If a hag obtains a skeleton key, it cackles as it returns to the Border Ethereal with it.</p><p>If two hags die, the third tries to bargain with the characters, offering useful information in exchange for her life. The hag makes the characters swear on their mortal souls not to harm her once her information is divulged. Any character who reneges on the agreement contracts slimy doom, as though he or she had failed a saving throw against the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.CjIq8Ed7bu3vVwT1]{contagion} spell. The hag reveals the following information (and nothing more) once an agreement is reached:</p><ul><li>“Hidden on this level of the dungeon is a library of lost lore, guarded by an arcanaloth whose true name is Ygga Raxyg.” (See @UUID[.KKrTaHXeI9yVz9S5]{area 80} for details.)</li><li>“There is only one way to leave the dungeon: the ebon pool. Charred bones point the way.” (See @UUID[.CTopj3psKWc01KO2]{area 81} for details on the ebon pool. “Charred bones” refers to the charred skeleton on the floor in @UUID[.fQ2r1XhWax77esEb]{area 79}.)</li><li>“The Red Trail leads to death.” (See @UUID[.fQ2r1XhWax77esEb]{area 79}.)</li></ul>"

Here's a breakdown of its features:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Days Elapsed:</strong> This tracks the number of days since the Soulmonger activated. It defaults to 20 and also automatically reduces the maximum health of every creature impacted by the Death Curse as described in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaIntroduction0.JournalEntryPage.YmJBk6SpQqatzqxa#death-curse]{Death Curse} section of Running the Adventure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Current Weather:</strong> The weather in Chult can be challenging and you can use this tracker for recording the weather of the day. When there is a Tropical Storm an additional <strong>Handle Tropical Storm</strong> button will appear which applies a level of Exhaustion to the selected members and posts a request for them to roll the necessary save to avoid another level of exhaustion as described in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaWelcomeToChul.JournalEntryPage.dOnRz93xpiaseCfR]{Weather} page.</p></li><li><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Each hex in the Chult region map has a configured Terrain that controls which random encounters they might experience and the pace at which they can travel. When this is set to automatic it will be determined based on the hex that the Primary Party token is in but you can configure it to be a specific Terrain type if desired.</p></li><li><p><strong>Undead Threat:</strong> Each hex in the Chult region map has a configured Undead Threat level which impacts which random encounters might be rolled. You can override the threat level as desired. Learn More in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2TheLandOfC.JournalEntryPage.skuUJSFntbnSndyu]{Undead Territory} section of The Land of Chult.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encounter Target:</strong> The result on a D20 that is required to trigger a random encounter. Learn more in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppBRandomEnc.JournalEntryPage.L4dbALOgbZwPPsA1]{Port Nyanzaru Encounters} section of Appendix B.</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel Pace:</strong> The party's travel pace determines how far they can travel in a day, the difficulty of navigation checks, and their perception checks while traveling. Learn more in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2TheLandOfC.JournalEntryPage.VYkNsZkiym1vkwEu]{Travel Distances} section of The Land of Chult.</p></li><li><p><strong>Navigator:</strong> The party's navigator will make the check to prevent the party from being lost while exploring Chult.

Learn more in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2TheLandOfC.JournalEntryPage.vxvARMfdwVKHFWSi]{Navigation} section of The Land of Chult.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roll Navigation Check:</strong> This button will roll a navigation check for the configured Navigator. If the check fails the <strong>Currently Lost</strong> box will be checked and players will lose visibility of their location on the region map and be moved in a random direction. Learn more in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2TheLandOfC.JournalEntryPage.vxvARMfdwVKHFWSi]{Navigation} section of The Land of Chult.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handle Dehydration:</strong> This button will allow you to select the party members who have become dehydrated, apply a level of exhaustion to them, and post a request for them to roll a save to avoid gaining another level of exhaustion as described in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2TheLandOfC.JournalEntryPage.WaM6Q2TiCcepGulB]{Dehydration} section of The Land of Chult.</p></li></ul>"

As is true with many D&amp;D adventures, it's bound to be funny, not so much in the words and pictures, but in the experience of playing it. Every bad player decision, unfortunate die roll, plan gone awry, silly voice, dorky monster, and ill-timed character death has the potential to make us laugh. Like clowns in a rodeo, adventurers will often do hilarious things to survive and succeed.</p><p>This adventure is much more than a deadly dungeon. To make it fun, we turned to Pendleton Ward, creator of the D&amp;D-inspired animated series <em>Adventure Time</em>. Pen is a master storyteller who knows how to craft a meaningful narrative around humorous characters and trappings, and he understands that D&amp;D players can create their own hilarity when given fun toys to play with. With Pen's help, we've tried to craft a tale filled with classic D&amp;D tropes and odd twists that will make you and your players laugh, even as things are looking grim for the heroes. If the dancing monkey fruit doesn't do it for you, maybe the catapulting goblin village or the zombie-spewing undead tyrannosaurus will. There's also the tomb itself, which will hopefully illicit chuckles and screams of laughter with its murderous ingenuity.</p><p>To our playtesters, I offer my heartfelt gratitude. You helped make <em>Tomb of Annihilation</em> a more fun experience for everyone. Your feedback—as brutal as any trap found herein—was tremendously valuable. Rest assured, your characters didn't die for nothing.</p><p>Chris Perkins <br />May 2017</p></aside>"

Now, she’s withering away. When she consulted priests, Syndra learned that the affliction was widespread and that no spell could cure it. She spoke to her friends among the Harpers, who determined the source of the affliction: an ungodly necromantic device called the Soulmonger. The Harpers received their intelligence from a lich, but they don’t know much about the Soulmonger other than its name and general whereabouts. Adventurers willing to help Syndra must travel to Chult, a land of jungles and monsters, to find the Soulmonger and destroy it.</p><p>Unknown to Syndra and her allies, the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaIntroduction0.JournalEntryPage.YmJBk6SpQqatzqxa#death-curse]{Soulmonger} is trapping the souls of the dead and depriving liches of the means to trap souls in their phylacteries. (The Soulmonger snatches up the souls before they can be trapped elsewhere.) Szass Tam, the most powerful lich among the Red Wizards of Thay, has sent operatives to Chult to steal the Soulmonger or, failing that, destroy it. Leading the Thayan expedition is Szass Tam’s devoted lieutenant, Valindra Shadowmantle. Valindra has been warned that adventurers might cross her path, so she’s prepared for them.</p><p>Also lurking in the heart of Chult is @UUID[Actor.zwk4UdGbwhWumFqp]{Ras Nsi}, a mythic, villainous figure among Chultans. Ras Nsi was a human paladin and a sworn protector of the city of @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2Mezro00000]{Mezro}. He betrayed his oaths and was banished. Rather than redeem himself, he raised an undead army to conquer Mezro. The would-be tyrant was defeated and banished once more. Mezro was later destroyed by the Spellplague (or so it seemed), during which Ras Nsi lost his power to create and command undead. He withdrew to the city of Omu, leaving the vestiges of his undead army to roam unchecked throughout the jungle. That was not the end of Ras Nsi, however. Bitter over his loss of power, he forged an alliance with the yuan-ti lurking in the ruins of Omu and underwent a ritual of transformation, becoming a yuan-ti malison. As a yuan-ti, Ras Nsi imposed his terrible will on the evil snake people and became their leader.</p><p>Beneath the cracked and broken streets of Omu lies a secret yuan-ti temple called the Fane of the Night Serpent, where Ras Nsi holds sway and plots to bring about the end of the world. Omu is also home to the Tomb of the Nine Gods. As the characters explore this multilevel dungeon, they encounter the spirits of Omu’s trickster gods and are potentially inhabited by them. Each god embodies a different alignment, and any character inhabited by one gains a special power as well as a flaw. The nine trickster gods don’t get along, and they try to push one another out of the characters’ bodies. As the gods fight over their living hosts, the characters must deal with the deadly traps and monsters that guard the Soulmonger. Venturing deeper into the tomb, they uncover clues about the dungeon’s evil architect — the archlich Acererak — and learn that the Soulmonger is feeding souls to an undead horror called an atropal. Once it consumes enough souls, the atropal will transform into an evil god.</p><p>Destroying the Soulmonger ends the death curse affecting the world, while killing the atropal incurs the wrath of Acererak. Under normal circumstances, the enraged archlich would be far too great a foe for mortal adventurers to overcome, but with the trickster gods of Omu on their side, the heroes have a fighting chance.</p>"

After exploring the city (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza]{chapter 1}), they embark on an expedition into the wilds of Chult (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2TheLandOfC]{chapter 2}), eventually finding the ruined city of Omu (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh3DwellersOf]{chapter 3}). The characters don’t know that Omu is their ultimate destination from the outset; they must find clues or evidence pointing in that direction.</p><p>In this adventure, three creatures know that the cause of the death curse lies in Omu: @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.Mg4nvXN3xs7oZdJr]{Grandfather Zitembe} in Port Nyanzaru, @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.LXNZFHD84kV9QOyZ]{Valindra Shadowmantle} in the Heart of Ubtao, and @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.wQITPw29BIgO4KHG]{Saja N’baza} in Orolunga. Several creatures know Omu’s location: the guides @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.xk2HhBTKYj2Wd7DN]{Eku} and @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.r9eEg2fRwsYUyy9c]{Salida} in Port Nyanzaru, Valindra Shadowmantle in the Heart of Ubtao, the aarakocra of @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2KirSabal00.JournalEntryPage.vJo49Lc5cYHqCMzu]{Kir Sabal}, @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.84yrJBClOy6eiIg0]{Zalkoré} of @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2Nangalore0.JournalEntryPage.BvLJz9XItQ1GX0oE]{Nangalore}, Saja N’baza in Orolunga, and the red dragon Tzindelor in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaWyrmheartMine]{Wyrmheart Mine}. If the characters are unable to locate Omu or ascertain the source of the death curse, the following additional creatures might possess the knowledge they seek, at your discretion: @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.KyEJIvkWcatCtFK7]{Krr’ook} in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2Dungrunglu]{Dungrunglung}, Nephyr in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2Firefinger]{Firefinger}, @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.byhIbUH0WLkmOika]{Nanny Pu’pu} in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2Mbala00000]{Mbala}, Bwayes O’tamu in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2NarwhalWre]{wreck of the Narwhal}, the survivors of the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaStarGoddessWr]{Star Goddess} shipwreck, and Red Wizards under Valindra Shadowmantle’s command.</p><p>As the adventurers explore Omu, they are either captured by yuan-ti or forced to confront them in their underground temple (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh4FaneOfTheN]{chapter 4}). Not far from the yuan-ti temple is the entrance to the Tomb of the Nine Gods (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5TombOfTheN]{chapter 5}). The Soulmonger lies deep within the tomb, which is riddled with puzzles, traps, monsters, and magical wards. Best case scenario: the adventure concludes with the destruction of the Soulmonger and the heroes’ daring escape from the tomb. Worst case scenario: the characters succumb to the evil of Acererak, and their souls are devoured.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h4>Who is Acererak?</h4><p>@UUID[Actor.toaAcererak00000]{Acererak} is a powerful lich known and feared throughout the multiverse. Much of his past is forgotten, but ancient texts assert that he comes from a world called Oerth.</p><p>Acererak travels the planes in search of artifacts. When he finds something useful or interesting, he locks it away. Although he’s powerful enough to pursue godhood as other liches have done (Vecna being a prime example), Acererak has no interest in being a god or being worshiped. He prefers to create evil gods and unleash them on mortals and immortals who oppose him.</p><p>Despite passing up opportunities for godhood, Acererak attracts his fair share of followers and worshipers. He doesn’t grant spells, nor does he give his devotees much of his precious time. Mostly he likes to watch them suffer and die as a result of their magical pursuits and folly.</p><p>Although he has lived on many worlds and crafted countless demiplanes, Acererak spends most of his time building tombs. He fills each one with treasure to attract powerful adventurers. He then kills them off in terrible fashion, using deadly traps and monsters while baiting and ridiculing them. The terror he evokes scars their souls, which he traps in his phylactery, the location of which is one of the multiverse’s greatest secrets.</p><p>Not too long ago by human standards, Acererak found an atropal adrift at the edge of the Negative Plane and built the Soulmonger to nourish it to godhood. The lich chose one of his tombs — specifically the Tomb of the Nine Gods on Toril — to serve as the atropal’s nursery.</p><p>For more information on @UUID[Actor.toaAcererak00000]{Acererak}, including his statistics, see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppDMonstersA.JournalEntryPage.FDyn4HWR2JU4EFY6]{appendix D}.</p></aside><h2>Death Curse</h2><p>Understanding how Acererak’s death curse works is vital to running the adventure smoothly.</p><p>The Soulmonger was activated 20 days ago and remains active until it is destroyed. While the Soulmonger is active, the following effects are in play:</p><ul><li>Any humanoid on the planet that has been brought back from the dead begins to waste away. Its hit point maximum is reduced by 20 (1 for each day the Soulmonger has been active) and decreases by 1 every midnight until the Soulmonger is destroyed. If a humanoid’s hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. Traveling to another world or plane does nothing to halt the wasting effect once it has begun.</li><li>A humanoid whose hit point maximum is reduced can’t increase or restore it. This is true whether the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by the Soulmonger or by some other life-draining effect, such as the touch of a wight, wraith, or similar creature.</li><li>If a humanoid dies anywhere on the planet, its soul becomes trapped inside the Soulmonger. Only the destruction of the Soulmonger can free the trapped soul.</li><li>Any spell that breathes life into the dead (including <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz]{raise dead}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO]{resurrection}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY]{true resurrection}</em>) automatically fails if cast on a humanoid whose soul is either trapped in the Soulmonger or has been devoured by the @UUID[Actor.dbM4sT1yZLbnZR2a]{atropal} (see “Soul Devouring” below).</li><li>The Soulmonger does not affect the workings of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.I2LUSF5ogc7Bj62e]{speak with dead}</em> spells or similar magic. The death curse has no effect on preexisting ghosts or spirits.</li></ul><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>The Death Curse in Foundry VTT</h3><p>Learn about how we've automated the Death Curse in the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaFoundryAdvice.JournalEntryPage.J8ganXPxTJKqTzUt]{Death Curse Active Effect}.</p></article></section><h3>Meat Grinder</h3><p><em>Tomb of Annihilation</em> can be played as written, or you can make it even more difficult by running it as a meat grinder. This mode of play is suitable for experienced players who have highly optimized characters and who don’t mind putting those characters in jeopardy for the sake of a good challenge. It is less ideal for players who are inexperienced or get anxious at the thought of losing their characters.</p><p>You must choose to run the adventure as a meat grinder from the very beginning. In this mode of play, the Soulmonger gains the power to draw characters who are close to death, and the following rule applies:</p><ul><li>A death saving throw succeeds on a roll of 15 or higher (instead of 10 or higher). This effect ends when the Soulmonger is destroyed. Other rules concerning death saving throws remain unchanged.</li></ul><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Meat Grinder Mode in Foundry VTT</h3><p>Learn about how we've automated Meat Grinder mode @UUID[JournalEntry.toaFoundryAdvice.JournalEntryPage.ZPUhMOmxKRfpYI70]{here}.</p></article></section><h3>Soul Devouring</h3><p>The soul of any humanoid that dies while the death curse is active becomes trapped inside the Soulmonger. The soul remains there until it is consumed by the atropal or the Soulmonger is destroyed.</p><p>Once a soul becomes trapped in the Soulmonger, it’s only a matter of time before the atropal devours it. You can determine the status of a trapped soul at dawn on any given day by secretly rolling a d20. On a roll of 2 or higher, the soul remains trapped in the Soulmonger, at least until the next dawn. A roll of 1 indicates that the soul was devoured by the atropal. A creature whose soul is devoured in this horrific manner can’t be returned to life by any means, including divine intervention.</p><p>If the Soulmonger is destroyed and you haven’t been tracking the status of a particular soul trapped within, grab a handful of d20s — one die for each day the soul was trapped — and roll them together. If you roll a 1 on any of the dice, the soul was devoured before it could be set free.</p><p>Spells such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{commune}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9]{divination}</em> can be used to determine whether a soul has been devoured or whether it’s still trapped in the Soulmonger.</p><p>How many souls must the atropal devour to become a god? It could be thousands or millions. Ultimately it’s the DM’s call, but the default assumption is that this apotheosis could take months or years.</p><h3>Replacement Characters</h3><p>The death curse means that, for the most part, dead characters stay dead. If a character dies and there’s no reasonable way for the player to continue playing that character, you can have the player create a new character. A replacement character should be the same level as the rest of the party.</p><p>Chult attracts adventurers from all over the world, and the activation of the Soulmonger draws even more adventurers than usual to its untamed wilderness. The player characters are among the earliest to arrive, but adventurers from across the globe begin to converge in Chult as the crisis mounts. It should not be difficult to introduce new characters to replace those who have perished. A new character might be the last surviving member of a doomed expedition, a guide who has lived in Chult for years, a lone explorer seeking glory or treasure, or someone racing against time to save a loved one affected by the death curse. Work with the player to come up with a story that makes sense, given the circumstances.</p><h3>Ticking Clock</h3><p><em>Tomb of Annihilation</em> is a time-bomb adventure. In other words, time is of the essence. The characters are under pressure to find and destroy the Soulmonger quickly, since many lives depend on it.</p><p>Time pressure aside, Chult is a land ripe with adventure possibilities, and characters might be drawn by curiosity or circumstance to locations such as the garden ruin of Nangalore, the dwarven forge of Hrakhamar, or the pirate haven of Jahaka Anchorage. Such locations present dangers that, when overcome, prepare the characters for greater threats awaiting them in Omu. If the characters reach Omu too soon, they probably won’t be high enough level to survive there for long. When the characters make inquiries about Omu, paint the lost city as a terrifying place so that players feel the tension of wanting to get there quickly, but not too quickly.</p><h2>Character Advancement</h2><p>Characters begin the adventure at 1st level and gain XP by defeating monsters. After each game session, add up all the XP earned and distribute it evenly among the party members. If the characters gain enough XP to advance a level, encourage your players to level up their characters before the next session. Ideally, the characters should fall within the desired level range for each chapter of the adventure, as shown in the Suggested Character Levels table.</p><div><table><caption><h4>Suggested Character Levels</h4></caption><thead><tr><th>Chapter</th><th>Suggested Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza]{1. Port Nyanzaru}</td><td>1st and higher</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2TheLandOfC]{2. Land of Chult}</td><td>1st–6th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh3DwellersOf]{3. Dwellers of the Forbidden City}</td><td>5th–8th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh4FaneOfTheN]{4. Fane of the Night Serpent}</td><td>7th–9th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5TombOfTheN]{5. Tomb of the Nine Gods}</td><td>9th and higher</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>You can slow the rate of advancement by withholding XP, “banking” it until you’re ready for the party to level up. Conversely, you can hasten level advancement by awarding ad hoc XP for making discoveries, completing goals, roleplaying well, and surviving or avoiding deadly traps. Any such ad hoc award should be no more than what the characters would earn for defeating a monster with a challenge rating equal to their level. For example, a fair ad hoc award for a party of 2nd-level adventurers would be 450 XP, which is what the characters would earn for defeating a challenge rating 2 monster. As with other XP awards, the amount should be divided evenly among all party members.</p><p>As the DM, you can dispense with XP tracking and allow characters to gain levels at whatever pace suits your campaign, using the Suggested Character Levels table as your guide.</p><p>Chult is loaded with fun distractions, alluring locations, and opportunities for characters to explore. Consequently, it can be hard to gauge what level the characters will be when they arrive at adventure locations. Again, let the Suggested Character Levels table guide you. For example, if the characters are 4th level and about to stumble into Omu (@UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh3DwellersOf]{chapter 3}), you might want to steer them in a different direction, throw random encounters at them until they’ve reached 5th level, advance them to 5th level automatically, or adjust encounters in Omu to make the threats easier to overcome.</p><h2>Starting at Higher Levels</h2><p>Although the adventure assumes that the characters begin at 1st level, you can start them off at 5th level or 9th level instead.</p><h3>Starting at 5th Level</h3><p>Characters of 5th level will still find parts of chapters 1 and 2 challenging. If an encounter becomes too much of a cakewalk, you can introduce enemy reinforcements. Hold off on XP awards and level advancement until the characters reach Omu in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh3DwellersOf]{chapter 3}.</p><h3>Starting at 9th Level</h3><p>Characters of 9th level will steamroll through @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza]{chapters 1} and @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh2TheLandOfC]{2}, and that’s fine. Spend less time on encounters in the jungle, and steer the characters toward Omu as quickly as possible. Once they arrive, run the adventure as you normally would. Characters at this level will still be challenged by @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh3DwellersOf]{chapters 3} and @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh4FaneOfTheN]{4}, particularly if you play the yuan-ti as intelligent adversaries. Hold off on XP awards and level advancement until the characters enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh5TombOfTheN]{chapter 5}.</p>"

              "name": "Starting the Adventure",
              "text": "<p>The adventure’s default starting location is the city of Baldur’s Gate on the Sword Coast, in the Forgotten Realms setting. However, any large settlement will do. Possibilities from other D&amp;D worlds include the Free City of Greyhawk on Oerth, the city of Specularum on Mystara, and the city of Sharn on Eberron.</p><p>To get things rolling, read or paraphrase the following introductory text to the players:</p><section class=\"fvtt narrative\"><p>For the past several days, the talk of the streets and taverns has all been about the so-called death curse: a wasting disease afflicting everyone who’s ever been raised from the dead. Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied. When they finally succumb, they can’t be raised — and neither can anyone else, regardless of whether they’ve ever received that miracle in the past. Temples and scholars of divine magic are at a loss to explain a curse that has affected the entire region, and possibly the entire world.</p></section><p>At this point, invite the players to explain why their characters are together, how long they’ve been together, and what they’ve been doing. If the characters don’t know each other, you can have them meet at Syndra Silvane’s residence.</p><h2>Syndra Silvane’s Curse</h2><p>The party’s benefactor is a retired adventurer named @UUID[Actor.toaSyndraSilvane]{Syndra Silvane}. Being a wizard and merchant of no small repute, she has magic to expedite the party’s journey to Chult as well as treasure with which to reward characters for their assistance.</p><p>When you’re ready for the characters to meet with Syndra, read:</p><section class=\"fvtt narrative\"><p>You have been invited to the home of Syndra Silvane, a retired adventurer and merchant. A uniformed attendant leads you up a grand staircase to the third floor, then ushers you into a wood-paneled room with a fireplace, comfortable chairs, and a heavy table bearing goblets and bottles of wine. The darkly paneled walls are hung with maps and sea charts. Racks, shelves, and cabinets hold hundreds more rolled-up maps and charts.</p><p>A person is seated in an overstuffed chair near the fire. You can’t discern a gender, because only the person’s head emerges from under a heavy blanket draped over the chair, and an embroidered hood and silver mask conceal the wearer’s face. Even the person’s dry, raspy voice provides no clue. “Help yourselves to wine, and seat yourselves, friends — I hope I may call you that.”</p></section><p>The masked speaker is @UUID[Actor.toaSyndraSilvane]{Syndra Silvane}. She is a Tethyrian human @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]{archmage}, with these changes:</p><ul><li>Syndra is lawful neutral and speaks Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Halfling.</li><li>Syndra’s hit point maximum has been reduced to 79 by the Soulmonger’s death curse, and it decreases by 1 every midnight. If her hit point maximum drops to 0, Syndra dies and can’t be brought back from the dead until the death curse has ended (and if her soul hasn’t been devoured). Destroying the Soulmonger is the only way to halt the attrition and restore her hit point maximum to normal.</li></ul><h3>Roleplaying Syndra Silvane</h3><p>Syndra tells the characters her story and makes her request. Roleplay the encounter, paraphrasing the following information and responding in Silvane’s dry, cracking voice to the characters’ questions:</p><ul><li>“I was an adventurer years ago. I died once and was raised from the dead. I have since closed the door on that stage of my life.”</li><li>“The death curse you’ve heard about has struck me. I don’t know how much longer I’ll last before I perish. Clerics have no help to offer. They’re stymied by what is happening.”</li><li>“My contacts in the Harpers have learned that the cause of the death curse is a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger. According to their sources, the Soulmonger is somewhere in Chult.”</li><li>“Chult is a peninsula ringed with mountains and choked with rain forests. Enormous reptiles, hostile goblins, and an army of undead prowl its jungles and ruins. Mapping the place has always been nigh impossible, and nothing is known about the region’s current geography beyond a few miles from the coast.”</li><li>“Working from dozens of sea charts, log books, and explorers’ journals, I assembled everything known about the current state of Chult into one map. I’ll provide it to you if you undertake my mission.”</li><li>“When you’re ready to depart, I will teleport us all to Port Nyanzaru, the only major settlement in Chult. I’ve been there several times before, so there’s little chance of mishap. Once there, I’ll stay with a friend named Wakanga O’tamu. He’s one of seven merchant princes who rule the city.”</li></ul><p>Syndra has misgivings about sending inexperienced adventurers on so dangerous a quest, but she isn’t taking any chances. She fails to mention that other, more experienced parties of adventurers have been sent to Chult already. All have disappeared, and Syndra fears the worst. In truth, they fell victim to the perils of Chult or crossed paths with Valindra Shadowmantle, and were never seen or heard from again. If the characters urge Syndra to seek out a more experienced party of adventurers, she replies dryly, “I already have.”</p><h3>Treasure</h3><p>Syndra promises each character a rare or uncommon magic item, delivered upon successful completion of her quest. (At the end of the adventure, each player can choose an appropriate item, subject to your approval.) Syndra also expects that the characters will find enough treasure in Chult to make them as rich as kings.</p><p>If the characters press for coin up front, Syndra gives each character 50 gp to defray expenses in Port Nyanzaru.</p><h3>Players’ Map of Chult</h3><p>At this point, give the players a copy of Syndra Silvane’s incomplete map of Chult (see @UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppEPlayerHan.JournalEntryPage.4tCpwoj4A71rw6Rx]{handout 1}). Syndra gladly answers their questions to the best of her ability, but she doesn’t know much more about Chult than what’s on the map. She knows Port Nyanzaru well enough to assure characters that they can buy supplies there.</p><h3>Teleporting to Chult</h3><p>In the interest of time, Syndra is prepared to use a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV]{teleport}</em> spell to transport herself and the heroes to Port Nyanzaru. If the characters agree, don’t bother rolling to determine the spell’s accuracy. Syndra knows the city’s Harbor Ward well enough to arrive on target. She chooses an outdoor location near the docks as her destination. When the characters arrive in Port Nyanzaru, skip to the @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza.JournalEntryPage.Xu51HNwej7V329Sa]{Arrival} section in @UUID[JournalEntry.toaCh1PortNyanza]{chapter 1}.</p><h2>Character Hooks</h2><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.toaAppACharacter.JournalEntryPage.Fo2kAyJgJdFdin9v]{Appendix A} presents two new character backgrounds that players can select with your consent: the anthropologist and the archaeologist.

A Batiri tribe is ruled by a queen (use the <strong>@UUID[Actor.disJ6A1i5rvrGhXB]{goblin boss}</strong> statistics). When a queen dies, fighting ensues until a new queen emerges victorious and proclaims herself ruler of the tribe. While the Batiri have many cultural and mythical aspects that make them unique, they behave essentially like other goblins; they are superstitious, cruel, suspicious of outsiders, fractious among themselves, and just as likely to torture and eat other humanoids as they are to trade with them. They are not only sadistic but highly creative in their tortures. For example, they enjoy tying enemies to trees, dousing them in honey, and leaving them to be devoured by insects over the course of several days, if a larger predator doesn’t finish them off first.</p><p><em><strong>War Masks.</strong></em> Batiri warriors wear oversized wooden war masks into combat. Each goblin paints and decorates its own mask to make it look as fearsome as possible. Aside from intimidating enemies, these masks serve the same purpose among the Batiri as coats of arms among noble knights of Faerûn. Batiri of opposing tribes might not know an enemy’s given name, but they’ll know Snarling Crocodile or Fanged Ape.</p><p>@Embed[JournalEntry.toaAppArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.QvokdeoOuT9nzX1A caption=false classes=\"float-right size-three\"]</p><p><em><strong>Battle Stacks.</strong></em> Batiri warriors sometimes ride on each other’s shoulders in battle, in a formation known as a battle stack. These can be up to nine goblins tall. Each goblin tracks its hit points individually, but the stack moves and makes ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws as one creature. Only the goblin at the top of the stack can attack, and only the goblin at the bottom can move (all goblins stacked on its shoulders move with it). The goblin at the top makes all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability checks and saving throws for the stack. The goblin at the bottom makes all Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution ability checks and saving throws for the stack. A battle stack can’t jump, but it can &amp;Reference[grappled apply=false]{grapple} or shove another creature, swing from vines, and use the &amp;Reference[Dash], &amp;Reference[Disengage], &amp;Reference[Dodge], and &amp;Reference[Hide] actions. The stack has advantage on melee attacks because of its built-in “pack tactics” effect; all the goblins are waving spears at the enemy, even if only one can hit.</p><p>When a goblin in the stack drops to 0 hit points, it is thrown from the stack. If the stack succeeds on a [[/save dex 10 format=long]], it remains intact (albeit one goblin shorter). On a failed save, the stack collapses and all the goblins fall &amp;Reference[prone apply=false]{prone} in a 5-foot-square space.</p><p>To form a new battle stack, a goblin must use its action to climb onto the shoulders of another willing goblin within 5 feet of it. Other goblins can join an existing battle stack in the same way. A goblin can use its action to remove itself from a battle stack, landing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bottom of the stack.</p><p>The Batiri invented battle stacks as a way to combat creatures much larger than themselves as well as a way to reach enemies in trees. The battle stack formation has the added effect of making the puny goblins appear taller and more fearsome to their larger enemies. Battle stacks are not effective against other ground-based threats, since all but the topmost goblin give up their attacks and mobility to be part of the stack.</p>"
