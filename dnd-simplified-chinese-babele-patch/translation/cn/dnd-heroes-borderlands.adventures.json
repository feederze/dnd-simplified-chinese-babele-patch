      "description": "<p>The adventure in this module is for two to four characters of levels 1–3. The adventure has no overarching plot. While there are conflicts and secrets to uncover, the story that emerges is the one your group experiences.</p><p>The adventure is divided into three self-contained journals, each of which features a different area. You don’t need to read one journal to understand the others, and you can play and revisit them in any order. The adventure areas are as follows:</p><p><strong>The Caves of Chaos</strong> tempt adventurers with riches and glory, obtainable by any who dare brave these monster-filled caverns.</p><p><strong>The Keep on the Borderlands</strong> is a fortified settlement where the party can rest, purchase goods and services, and interact with locals.</p><p><strong>The Wilderness</strong> lies beyond the ken of law. Friends, foes, and surprises await explorers who traverse these untamed wilds.</p><p>Over the course of the adventure, the characters might visit these areas more than once. They don’t have to complete all the encounters in an adventure journal before exploring a different corner of the Borderlands.</p>",

You don’t need to memorize every rule in this book, but understanding how it is organized will help you find relevant information when needed.</p><p>For explanations of game terms, see the rules glossary at the end of this booklet.</p><h2>Harnessing Imagination</h2><p>In D&amp;D, the action takes place in the imaginations of the players, and it’s narrated by everyone together. Here’s a glimpse at what that looks like:</p><section class=\"social-example\"><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared (as Dungeon Master):</span> After your journey through the wilderness, the Caves of Chaos loom ahead. The caves dot towering cliffs. Eerie lights glimmer in some of the cavernous openings, and bestial howls echo around you. What do you do?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (as the Cleric):</span> I listen carefully to the howls. What do they sound like? And which cave are they coming from?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Sam (as the Fighter):</span> I stand guard by the closest cave’s opening. I don’t want anything to sneak up on us!</p><p><span class=\"PHB-Script-Styles_Script-DM-Entry\">Jared:</span> All right, one at a time. Phillip, make a Wisdom check.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Does my Perception skill apply?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Sure!</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (Rolling a D20):</span> Ugh. I rolled a 2 for a total of 7.</p><p><span class=\"PHB-Script-Styles_Script-DM-Entry\">Jared: </span>You can’t pinpoint the howls’ source, but you’re pretty sure you’re not hearing the sounds of regular animals.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Sam:</span> Now I’m even more on guard!</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> That’s good, because you’re pretty sure you hear something shuffling toward you in the cave’s darkness …</p></section><p>The adventure continues from there, relying on the DM’s descriptions to set the scenes. Later in this guide, an example shows how a battle might unfold. When you’re playing, your group determines how the adventure plays out!</p>"

For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the cube that many games use). The illustration on this page shows what each die looks like.</p><p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, along with any numbers to add or subtract.

It’s central to the core mechanic—called &amp;Reference[D20 Test]{D20 Tests}—the game uses to determine whether creatures succeed or fail at the things they attempt. You roll a d20 when your character tries to do something that the DM decides has a chance of both success and failure; the higher the roll, the more likely it is that the character succeeds.</p><p><strong>Damage.</strong> The most common use for dice other than the d20 is to determine damage. When you make a successful attack roll (one kind of D20 Test), you roll damage to see how effective the attack is. When you cast a spell, you might also roll damage. Different weapons and spells use different dice for damage. For example, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbwepDagger0000]{Dagger} uses 1d4 and the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplBurningHan]{Burning Hands} </em>spell uses 3d6.</p>"

Choose from four iconic options—the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classes24.Item.phbclcCleric0000]{Cleric}, the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classes24.Item.phbftrFighter000]{Fighter}, the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classes24.Item.phbrgeRogue00000]{Rogue}, or the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classes24.Item.phbwzdWizard0000]{Wizard}.</p><p><strong>Team Up.</strong> Your character joins the other players’ characters to form an adventuring party. These adventurers are allies who face challenges and fantastical situations together. Each character has distinctive capabilities that complement those of the other characters.</p><p><strong>Venture Forth.</strong> Your character’s group explores locations and events presented by the DM. You can respond to them however you can imagine, guided by the rules in this set. Although the DM controls all the monsters you encounter, the DM isn’t your adversary. The DM guides your party’s journey as your characters become more powerful.</p><h2>Being the Dungeon Master</h2><p>If you want to be the mastermind of the game, consider being the DM. Here’s what DMs do:</p><p><strong>Run the Adventure.</strong> You run the adventure in this module.</p><p><strong>Guide the Story.</strong> You narrate much of the action during play, describing locations and creatures that the adventurers face with read-aloud text. The players decide what their characters do as they navigate hazards and choose what to explore. Then you use a combination of imagination and the game’s rules to determine the results of the adventurers’ decisions.</p><p><strong>Adjudicate the Rules.</strong> You oversee how the group uses the game’s rules, making sure the rules serve the group’s fun. Tutorials in the adventure booklets teach you some of those rules, but you’ll want to read the @UUID[JournalEntry.hotbPlayGuide000]{Play Guide} to better understand them.</p><h2>Swapping Roles</h2><p>Playing a character and being the Dungeon Master aren’t permanent roles.

For groups of five, the previous DM always inherits the available character.</p>"

The adventure areas are as follows:</p><p><strong>The @UUID[JournalEntry.hotbCavesOfChaos]{Caves of Chaos}</strong> tempt adventurers with riches and glory, obtainable by any who dare brave these monster-filled caverns.</p><p><strong>The @UUID[JournalEntry.hotbSourceKeepOn]{Keep on the Borderlands}</strong> is a fortified settlement where the party can rest, purchase goods and services, and interact with locals.</p><p><strong>The @UUID[JournalEntry.hotbWilderness00]{Wilderness}</strong> lies beyond the ken of law. Friends, foes, and surprises await explorers who traverse these untamed wilds.</p><p>Over the course of the adventure, the characters might visit these areas more than once. They don’t have to complete all the encounters in an adventure journal before exploring a different corner of the Borderlands.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Keep It Secret</h3><p>Secrets and reveals are important DM tools. If you read any of the DM-only material and still want to experience the adventure as a player, you can—just don’t let this knowledge influence your character’s actions or behavior. More importantly, don’t spoil any surprises for your fellow players!</p></aside>"

Undeterred, you emerge from the tangled thicket into a stark ravine. Its rocky walls rise steeply one hundred feet or so above. Several dark cave mouths pockmark the walls at varying heights. The air is stale and quiet.</p><p>Among the rocks and dead wood that litter the ravine’s floor are the bones of animals and explorers, picked clean by scavengers. Vultures leer at you hungrily from barren branches.<br />Where do you want to go?</p></section><p>The Caves of Chaos table summarizes the caves in the order they appear within this adventure.

Focus on what they see, hear, or smell.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Manage Tokens.</strong> As the characters explore the Scene most creatures will be automatically revealed.
