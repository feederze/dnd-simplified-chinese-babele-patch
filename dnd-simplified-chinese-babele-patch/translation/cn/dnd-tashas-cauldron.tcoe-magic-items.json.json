Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-magic-items.Item.tcoeMortarbabaYa]{Mortar} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-magic-items.Item.tcoePestlebabaYa]{Pestle}. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn</p><p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “Artifacts” section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:</p><ul><li><p>2 minor beneficial properties</p></li><li><p>1 major beneficial property</p></li><li><p>1 minor detrimental property</p></li></ul><p><strong>Perfect Tools.</strong> While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>You can also use the artifact as [[/check ability=int tool=alchemist]]{alchemist’s supplies}, [[/check ability=int tool=brewer]]{brewer’s supplies}, [[/check ability=int tool=cook]]{cook’s utensils}, an [[/check ability=int tool=herb]]{herbalism kit}, and a [[/check ability=int tool=pois]]{poisoner’s kit}.</p><p>You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.</p><p><strong>Primal Parts.</strong> As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that’s equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes [[/damage 4d10 type=force]] damage. If this reduces the target’s hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents—like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs—into separate piles.</p><p><strong>Traverse the Night.</strong> If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don’t need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination—not just the nearest river or a red dragon’s lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.</p><p><strong>Bones Know Their Home.</strong> When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.</p><p><strong>Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.</strong> The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the <em>Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga</em> or by Baba Yaga herself.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-TlidxUVbY90PQioI\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>Two additional items are provided, @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-magic-items.Item.tcoeMortarbabaYa]{Baba Yaga's Mortar} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-magic-items.Item.tcoePestlebabaYa]{Baba Yaga's Pestle} for specific actions granted by those items.</p></section>",

    "original": "<p><em>Wondrous item, requires attunement</em></p><p>Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse—and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact’s bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao—potentially for the final time.</p><p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “Artifacts” section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:</p><ul><li><p>2 minor beneficial properties</p></li><li><p>1 major beneficial property</p></li><li><p>1 minor detrimental property</p></li></ul><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-magic-items.Item.tcoeRaoSpells000 classes=\"caption-top no-secrets\"]{See the following supplemental item:}</p><p>The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p><p><strong>Absolute Banishment.</strong> While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can’t return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-tables.RollTable.tcoeExtraplanarR classes=\"caption-top\"]</p><p><strong>Iggwilv’s Curse.</strong> When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend’s name in Iggwilv’s voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.</p><p><strong>Destroying or Repairing the Crook.</strong> The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god’s tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-dZ4wMvjSMLSUu6EI\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>The @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-magic-items.Item.tcoeRaoSpells000] container item and its contents are provided for optional use.

Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book’s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.</p><p><strong>Random Properties.</strong> The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “Artifacts” section of the Dungeon Master’s Guide:</p><ul><li><p>2 minor beneficial properties</p></li><li><p>1 minor detrimental property</p></li><li><p>1 major detrimental property</p></li></ul><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-magic-items.Item.tcoeDemonomiconS classes=\"caption-top no-secrets\"]{See the following supplemental item:}</p><p><strong>Abyssal Reference.</strong> You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a [[/check ability=wis skill=sur]] check related to the Abyss.

At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, <em>Fraz-Urb’luu’s Staff</em>. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the <em>Tome of Zyx</em>, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon.

There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.</p><p>Like all tarokka decks, the Tarokka of Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-magic-items.Item.tcoeLubasSpells0 classes=\"caption-top no-secrets\"]{See the following supplemental item:}</p><p><strong>Enduring Vision.</strong> While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.</p><p><strong>Twist of Fate.</strong> As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Weal.</strong> The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.</p></li><li><p><strong>Woe.</strong> The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.</p></li></ul><p>The deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-tables.RollTable.tcoeSoulsOfTheTa caption=true classes=\"caption-top no-tables no-secrets\"]</p><p><strong>Shuffling Fate.</strong> If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba’s Tarroka of Souls ends, and you can’t attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.</p><p><strong>Destroying the Deck.</strong> Luba’s Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.bfh29vIEoGzI240e]{lich}, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM’s design.</p><details><summary><strong>MOTHER LUBA AND THE VISTANI</strong></summary><p>The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell’s horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.</p><p>A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience—ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. “We may wander amid the shadows,” Mother Luba said. “But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.”</p><p>Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.</p></details>",

They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.</p><p><strong>Using the Teeth.</strong> While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-tables.RollTable.tcoeTeethOfDehlv]{Teeth of Dahlver-Nar} table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).</p><p>If you don’t sow or implant the tooth, roll a [[/r 1d20]]{die} at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).</p><p>Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth’s result is rolled after it’s been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.</p><section id=\"secret-8RXiA62mVjDSFg8v\" class=\"secret\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>Drag the corresponding tooth from this container onto your character's sheet when implanted or sown.</p></section><p><strong>Sowing Teeth.</strong> To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.</p><p><strong>Implanting Teeth.</strong> To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can’t be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to [[1 + max(1, @abilities.con.mod)]]{1 + your Constitution modifier} (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.</p><p><strong>Recovering Teeth.</strong> Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.</p><p><strong>Destroying the Teeth.</strong> Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth’s story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate.

You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.</p>",
