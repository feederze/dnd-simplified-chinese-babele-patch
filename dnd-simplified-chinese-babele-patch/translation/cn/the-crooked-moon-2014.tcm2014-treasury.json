When your Attunement ends, it separates from you, and your torso returns to its previous state. The birdcage has the following properties.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Sense Fiends.</strong></em> As a Bonus Action, you can sense the location of Fiends or magical effects created by Fiends within 60 feet of yourself.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Capture Fiend.</strong></em> As a Magic action, choose one Bloodied Fiend that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. It must succeed on a [[/save CHA DC 15]] saving throw or be transformed into an amber songbird and trapped in the birdcage. The songbird is an inert object until removed from the cage and released. You can remove one songbird from the cage as a Bonus Action. If you stop holding the bird, the Fiend reverts to its true form with all its Hit Points, and it is Hostile to you.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Consume Songbird.</strong></em> As a Magic action, you can consume one amber songbird you are holding. The Fiend dies, and you can either regain one expended spell slot with a level up to half the Fiend’s CR, or you can gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the Fiend’s CR.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><em><strong>Amber Curse.</strong></em> You have a −1 penalty to Wisdom saving throws. Each time you use the Capture Fiend or Consume Songbird properties, this penalty increases by 1.</span></p>",
