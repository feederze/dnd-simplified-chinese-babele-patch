Spurred by their desire for knowledge, rejected candidates sometimes start on a path to become self-taught masters of arcana. Notably in tune with the magic of the forest, hedges pursuing an individualistic path often leverage their connection to these natural forces to make pacts with powerful fey or elemental beings, learning secrets inaccessible to traditional students.</p>\n<h2>Susan of the Swamp</h2>\n<p>Susan is an eccentric hedge whose magical aptitude has always been outclassed by her hunger for knowledge. She studied at the Avium for a short time, but left of her own accord to experiment with magics the Avium found unsavory.</p>\n<p>Susan recently settled in the swamp in the hopes of pursuing her arcane curiosities in peace. She shares her modest home with her beetle familiar, Normal, and spends her time foraging for ingredients, testing spells, and reading mystery novels in addition to tomes of eldritch lore.</p>\n<p>Though she performs her rituals a safe distance away from the cities and towns, her presence in the region has made the Magistrate of Winnowing Reach uneasy, and he wants her gone.</p>\n<p>Susan uses the hedge witch stat block.

The promise of seeing lost loved ones again, or raising an army of powerful minions, can sometimes be difficult to resist. The birdfolk of Humblewood are not immune to that lure. To help curb this curiosity, professors at The Avium teach necromantic theory only. But some intrepid students have been known to pursue the practical applications in secret. Sure of their intellect, corvums in particular are often willing to challenge traditions for the sake of knowledge. As a result, more than one corvum has wandered down the path of the dark arts. </p>\n<h2>Odwald Ebonhart</h2>\n<p>Odwald is a haggard old kindled corvum, resembling a thick billed raven with coarse, hoary  feathers, ruffled from years of adventuring. Odwald has a sharp mind but a faint heart. A member of the illustrious Ebonhart family, a noble house that dates back to the founding of Alderheart, Odwald was an arcane prodigy who grew up in a world which expected him to be brilliant. </p>\n<p>While magic always came naturally to him, the pressure of his family’s expectations weighed heavily upon him, and filled him with a deep-seated fear of failure. Months ago, he was tricked by an unknown entity into weakening the seal that held the aspect of fire beneath the Scorched Grove. Ever since he has blamed himself for the worsening conditions in the Wood. He has no solution for stopping the aspect, and this terrifies him. </p>\n<p>Shortly after saving his friend Riffin, desperation drove him back to his alma mater, the Avium, where he has since worked with forbidden magics in secrecy. Using a secret door he discovered during his time as a student, Odwald converted several inaccessible and defunct classrooms into a makeshift laboratory where he toils tirelessly, experimenting with dark and dangerous magics in the hopes of discovering a way to stop the aspect. Odwald uses the corvum necromancer stat block. His alignment is chaotic neutral.</p>",

      "description": "<h2><br />The Tenders</h2>\n<p>Although the Tenders are most well known across the Wood for their involvement in healing and studying the Scorched Grove, their order is actually far more ancient. Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors.</p>\n<h2>Havel of the Autumn Moon</h2>\n<p>Havel is a frail but courageous huden gallus, with pheasant-like plumage. He is a dear friend of Tevor, and the two have fallen for each other during their time together in Alderheart.</p>\n<p>Havel is a Summerblossom, a rank given to experienced members of the Tenders. He has been working at the Tenders’ headquarters in the Trunk district, where he provides aid to the refugees.</p>\n<p>He is also skilled in the use of natural magic, and while normally too sickly to adventure, could still assist the party with his talents. </p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",

Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors. </p>\n<h2>Tevor of the Spring Path </h2>\n<p>Tevor is a timid sable luma, with ruddy gray feathers and a short beak. He is a good friend of Havel, and has begun to feel affection for the gallus since their time working together.</p>\n<p>Tevor is a Sapling, a low ranking member of the Tenders, who barely escaped from an ashsnake attack that killed his mentor. While he has agreed to give his report of events in the Scorched Grove, he is not prepared to do much beyond this. He possesses conviction in the beliefs of his order, but the traumatic event has left him feeling frightened and helpless.</p>\n<p>If only he could find the courage to match his ideals, he would be destined for greatness. Tevor is generally averse to combat now, but before joining the Tenders he trained as a perch guard recruit.</p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders.

The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",
