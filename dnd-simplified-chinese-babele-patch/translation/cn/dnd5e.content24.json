          "name": "Poison",
          "text": "<p>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures.</p><p>Poisons come in the following four types:</p><p><strong>Contact.</strong> Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p><p><strong>Ingested.</strong> A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half as much damage on a failed save.</p><p><strong>Inhaled.</strong> Poisonous powders and gases take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p><p><strong>Injury.</strong> Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or similar object. The poison remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p><h2>Purchasing Poison</h2><p>In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poison easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire the poison they seek.</p><h2>Harvesting Poison</h2><p>A character can attempt to harvest poison from a venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapacitated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after which the character makes a [[/check 20 nature]] check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose, and no additional poison can be harvested from that creature. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature’s poison.</p><h2>Sample Poisons</h2><p>Example poisons are detailed here in alphabetical order. Each poison's description includes the suggested price for a single dose of the poison, its type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury), and a description of the poison's debilitating effects.</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgAssassinsBloo]{Assassin's Blood} (150 GP)</h3><p><em>Ingested Poison</em></p><p>A creature subjected to Assassin's Blood makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6 (1d12) Poison damage and has the Poisoned condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgBurntOthurFum]{Burnt Othur Fumes} (500 GP)</h3><p><em>Inhaled Poison</em></p><p>A creature subjected to Burnt Othur Fumes must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) Poison damage, and it must repeat the save at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) Poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgCarrionCrawle]{Crawler Mucus} (200 GP)</h3><p><em>Contact Poison</em></p><p>A creature subjected to Carrion Crawler Mucus must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition for 1 minute.

A hidden pit can be a fun surprise, but too many traps in an adventure can lead players to become overly cautious, which slows down the game.</p><p>The best traps are fleeting distractions that skilled characters can overcome in a short amount of time or deadly puzzles that require quick thinking and teamwork to overcome. Traps that are undetectable and inescapable are rarely fun.</p><h2>Parts of a Trap</h2><p>The description of a trap includes the following parts after the trap’s name:</p><p><strong>Severity and Levels.</strong> A trap is designated as a nuisance or as deadly for characters of certain levels. A nuisance trap is unlikely to seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly trap can grievously damage characters of the indicated levels.</p><p><strong>Trigger.</strong> Traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Examples of triggers include stepping on a pressure plate, crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using the wrong key in a lock.</p><p><strong>Duration. </strong>Some traps have durations expressed in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that their effects last until the trap is destroyed or dispelled. If a trap’s duration is instantaneous, its effect is resolved instantly. If a trap resets after activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A trap is otherwise inert after activation.</p><p>Use caution when introducing a trap to characters of a level lower than the trap’s level range. A trap that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly to characters of a lower level range.</p><h2>Example Traps</h2><p>Traps are presented in alphabetical order.</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgCollapsingRoo]{Collapsing Roof}</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgCollapsingRoo caption=false cite=false]</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgFallingNet000]{Falling Net}</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgFallingNet000 caption=false cite=false]</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgFirecastingSt]{Fire-Casting Statue}</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgFirecastingSt caption=false cite=false]</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgHiddenPit0000]{Hidden Pit}</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgHiddenPit0000 caption=false cite=false]</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPoisonedDarts]{Poisoned Darts}</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPoisonedDarts caption=false cite=false]</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPoisonedNeedl]{Poisoned Needle}</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPoisonedNeedl caption=false cite=false]</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgRollingStone0]{Rolling Stone}</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgRollingStone0 caption=false cite=false]</p><hr /><h3>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgSpikedPit0000]{Spiked Pit}</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgSpikedPit0000 caption=false cite=false]</p>"

          "text": "<p>A curse is a magical burden that lasts for a specified time or until it is ended by some means. A magical contagion is an adverse effect of magical origin that is contagious by definition.</p><p>The following sections discuss curses and magical contagions in detail.</p><h2>Curses</h2><p>A curse typically takes one of the forms detailed below.</p><h3>Bestow Curse</h3><p>The simplest curses are created by the <em>Bestow Curse</em> spell. The effects of such curses are limited and can be ended by the <em>Remove Curse </em>spell.</p><p><em>Bestow Curse</em> provides useful benchmarks for gauging the potency of other curses. A curse that lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 spell, while one that lasts until dispelled equates to a level 9 spell.</p><h3>Cursed Creatures</h3><p>Some monsters are associated with curses, whether as part of their origins or due to their ability to spread curses—werewolves being a prime example.</p><p>You decide how a spell like <em>Remove Curse</em> affects a creature with accursed origins. For example, you might decide that a mummy was created through a curse and it can be destroyed permanently only by casting <em>Remove Curse</em> on its corpse.</p><h3>Cursed Magic Items</h3><p>Cursed magic items are created deliberately or originate as the result of supernatural events. Such items are detailed in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.dmgMagicItemList.JournalEntryPage.epDAUqo0kTTrTpYR]{Magic Items}.</p><h3>Narrative Curses</h3><p>A curse might manifest during an adventure when a creature’s violation of a taboo warrants supernatural punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a tomb, or murdering an innocent. Such a curse can have any effects you design, or it might be a customized version of another type of curse discussed in this section.</p><p>A creature affected by such a curse should know why they’re being punished and be able to learn how to end their curse, likely by symbolically righting the wrong they committed. How a spell like <em>Remove Curse</em> affects a curse that’s part of your adventure is up to you—the spell might merely suppress the effects of the curse for a time. Regardless, narrative curses should feel like rare, potent magic rooted in the lore of your campaign.</p><h3>Environmental Curses</h3><p>Some locations are so suffused with evil that anyone who lingers there is burdened with a curse. Demonic Possession is one example of an environmental curse.</p><p><em><strong>Demonic Possession.</strong></em> Demonic Possession arises from the chaos and evil of the Abyss and commonly besets creatures that interact with demonic objects or linger in desecrated locations, where demonic spirits await victims.</p><p>A creature that becomes the target of Demonic Possession must succeed on a [[/save cha 15]] saving throw or be possessed by a bodiless demonic entity. Whenever the possessed creature rolls a 1 on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of the creature and determines the creature’s behavior thereafter. At the end of each of the possessed creature’s later turns, the creature makes a [[/save cha 15]] saving throw, regaining control of itself on a success.</p><p class=\"_idGenParaOverride-1\">After finishing a Long Rest, a creature with Demonic Possession makes a [[/save cha 15]] saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on the creature. A <em>Dispel Evil and Good </em>spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect on it.</p><h2>Magical Contagions</h2><p>Alchemists, potion brewers, and areas of wild magic are credited with creating the first magical contagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form the basis of an adventure as characters search for a cure and try to stop the contagion’s spread.</p><h3>Rest and Recuperation</h3><p>If a creature infected with a magical contagion spends 3 days recuperating—engaging in no activities that would interrupt a Long Rest—the creature makes a [[/save con 15]] saving throw at the end of the recuperation period. On a successful save, the creature has Advantage on saving throws to fight off the magical contagion for the next 24 hours.</p><h3>Example Contagions</h3><p>The following examples show how magical contagions can work. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, effects, and other characteristics of these contagions to suit your campaign.</p><hr /><h4>Cackle Fever</h4><p><em>Magical Contagion</em></p><p>Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids only (gnomes are strangely immune). A creature suffers the following effects [[/r 1d4]] days after infection:</p><p><strong>Fever.</strong> The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level, which lasts until the contagion ends on the creature.</p><p><strong>Uncontrollable Laughter.</strong> While the creature has the &amp;Reference[Exhaustion] condition, the creature makes a[[/save con 13]] saving throw each time it takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/damage 1d10 psychic average]] damage and has the &amp;Reference[Incapacitated] condition as it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.</p><p><em><strong>Fighting the Contagion.</strong></em> At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature makes a [[/save con 13]] saving throw. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.</p><p><em><strong>Spreading the Contagion.</strong></em> Any Humanoid (other than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot Emanation originating from a creature infected with Cackle Fever must succeed on a [[/save con 10]] saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.</p><hr /><h4>Sewer Plague</h4><p><em>Magical Contagion</em></p><p>Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyughs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a creature that carries the contagion or that comes into contact with contaminated filth or offal must succeed on a [[/save con 11]] saving throw or become infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers the following effects [[/r 1d4]] days after infection:</p><p><strong>Fatigue.</strong> The creature gains 1 &amp;Reference[Exhaustion] level.</p><p><strong>Weakness.</strong> While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, it regains only half the normal number of Hit Points from spending Hit Point Dice.</p><p><strong>Restlessness.</strong> While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature’s Exhaustion level.</p><p><em><strong>Fighting the Contagion.</strong></em> Daily at dawn, an infected creature makes a [[/save con 11]] saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 Exhaustion level as its fatigue worsens. On a successful save, the creature’s Exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced to 0, the contagion ends on the creature.</p><hr /><h4>Sight Rot</h4><p><em>Magical Contagion</em></p><p>Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted by Sight Rot must succeed on a [[/save con 15]] saving throw or have the &amp;Reference[Blinded] condition until the contagion ends.</p><p><em><strong>Fighting the Contagion.</strong></em> Magic such as a <em>Heal</em> or <em>Lesser Restoration</em> spell ends the contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with an Herbalism Kit can use it to create one dose of nonmagical ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on the creature.</p><p><em><strong>Spreading the Contagion.</strong></em> Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a creature infected with Sight Rot must succeed on a [[/save con 15]] saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.</p><hr />"

A creature that moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a [[/save dex 10]] saving throw or have the &amp;Reference[Prone] condition.</p><h2>Strong Wind</h2><p>Strong wind imposes Disadvantage on ranged attack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.</p><p>A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p><h2>Thin Ice</h2><p>Thin ice has a weight tolerance of [[/r 3d10*10]]{3d10 × 10} pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through. Below the ice is frigid water (see @UUID[.xgLA30rErlkjIPAK#frigid-water]{Frigid Water} above).</p>"

          "text": "<p>Due to the nature of their vocation, adventurers tend to be less susceptible to fear and mental stress than common folk. Whereas a farmer might flee in terror from a bear or an apparition, adventurers are made of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures and game effects can terrify or fray the mind of even the most stalwart adventurer.</p><p>If you plan to use any of these rules, discuss them with your players at the start of the campaign.</p><h2>Fear Effects</h2><p>Whenever the characters encounter something that is supernaturally frightful, use the &amp;Reference[Frightened] condition as the baseline effect. Fear effects typically require a Wisdom saving throw, with a save DC based on how terrifying the situation is. The Sample Fear DCs table provides some examples.</p><table><caption>Sample Fear DCs</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Example</p></th><th><p>Save DC</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>When the characters open a sarcophagus, a harmless yet terrifying apparition appears.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 10]]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A character triggers a magical trap that creates an illusory manifestation of that character’s worst fears, visible only to that character.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 15]]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A portal to the Abyss opens, revealing a nightmarish realm of torment and slaughter.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 20]]</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Typically, a Frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>At your discretion, a Frightened creature might be subject to other effects as long as the Frightened condition lasts. Consider these examples:</p><ul><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">The Frightened creature must take the Dash action on each of its turns and uses its movement to get farther away from the source of its fear.</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have Advantage.</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">The Frightened creature can do only one of the following on each of its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.</li></ul><h2>Mental Stress Effects</h2><p>When a character is subjected to an effect that causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the best way to emulate that effect.</p><p>The Sample Mental Stress Effects table provides a few examples of such effects, with suggested saving throw DCs and damage. Mental stress can usually be resisted with a successful Wisdom save, but sometimes an Intelligence or Charisma save is more appropriate. On a successful save, a character might take half as much damage instead of no damage, at your discretion.</p><table><caption>Sample Mental Stress Effects</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Example</p></th><th><p>Save DC</p></th><th><p>Psychic Damage</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>A character ingests a hallucinogenic substance that distorts the character’s perception of reality.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 10]]</p></td><td><p>[[/damage 1d6 type=psychic]]{1d6}</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A character touches a <span>fiendish</span> idol that tears at the character’s mind, threatening to shatter it.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 15]]</p></td><td><p>[[/damage 3d6 type=psychic]]{3d6}</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A magical trap flings a character into the Far Realm until the end of that character’s next turn.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 20]]</p></td><td><p>[[/damage 9d6 type=psychic]]{9d6}</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Prolonged Effects</h3><p>Exposure to mental stress can cause prolonged effects. Consider the following possibilities.</p><p><em><strong>Short-Term Effects.</strong></em> The character has the &amp;Reference[Frightened], &amp;Reference[Incapacitated], or &amp;Reference[Stunned] condition for 1d10 minutes. This condition might be accompanied by alarming behavior or hallucinations. These effects can be suppressed with the <em>Calm Emotions</em> spell or removed by the <em>Lesser Restoration</em> spell.</p><p><em><strong>Long-Term Effects.</strong></em> The character has Disadvantage on some or all ability checks for [[/r 1d10*10]]{1d10 × 10} hours, stemming from an unwillingness or inability to exert a particular set of abilities. The character might feel enervated and unable to exert much Strength, for example, or become so suspicious of others that Charisma checks are more difficult. These effects can be suppressed with the <em>Calm Emotions</em> spell or removed by the <em>Lesser Restoration</em> spell.</p><p><em><strong>Indefinite Effects.</strong></em> An indefinite effect is a long-term effect (see above) that lasts until removed by a <em>Greater Restoration</em> spell.

          "text": "<p>The following features can make a combat encounter more interesting or challenging:</p><p><strong>Changes in Elevation.</strong> Terrain features that provide a change of elevation (such as stacks of empty crates, ledges, and balconies) reward clever positioning and encourage characters to jump, climb, fly, or teleport.</p><p><strong>Defensive Positions.</strong> Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive positions force characters who normally attack at range to move around.</p><p><strong>Mixed Monster Groups.</strong> When different types of monsters work together, they can combine their abilities—just like characters with different classes and origins. A diverse force is more powerful.</p><p><strong>Reasons to Move.</strong> Use features that encourage characters and their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and rolling stone traps.</p><h2 class=\"header\" data-anchor=\"combat-encounter-difficulty\">Combat Encounter Difficulty</h2><p>Use the following guidelines to create a combat encounter of a desired level of difficulty.</p><p><em><strong>Step 1: Choose a Difficulty.</strong></em> Three categories describe the range of encounter difficulty:</p><p><strong>Low Difficulty.</strong> An encounter of low difficulty is likely to have one or two scary moments for the players, but their characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing resources, however. As a rough guideline, a single monster generally presents a low-difficulty challenge for a party of four characters whose level equals the monster’s Challenge Rating.</p><p><strong>Moderate Difficulty.</strong> Absent healing and other resources, an encounter of moderate difficulty could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more characters might die.</p><p><strong>High Difficulty.</strong> A high-difficulty encounter could be lethal for one or more characters. To survive it, the characters will need smart tactics, quick thinking, and maybe even a little luck.</p><p><em><strong>Step 2: Determine Your XP Budget.</strong></em> Using the XP Budget per Character table, cross-reference the party’s level with the desired encounter difficulty. Multiply the number in the table by the number of characters in the party to get your XP budget for the encounter.</p><table><caption>XP Budget per Character</caption><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"3\"><p>——— Encounter Difficulty ———</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><span>Party’s Level</span></p></th><th><p><span>Low</span></p></th><th><p><span>Moderate</span></p></th><th><p><span>High</span></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>50</p></td><td><p>75</p></td><td><p>100</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>100</p></td><td><p>150</p></td><td><p>200</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>150</p></td><td><p>225</p></td><td><p>400</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>250</p></td><td><p>375</p></td><td><p>500</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>500</p></td><td><p>750</p></td><td><p>1,100</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>600</p></td><td><p>1,000</p></td><td><p>1,400</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>750</p></td><td><p>1,300</p></td><td><p>1,700</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>1,000</p></td><td><p>1,700</p></td><td><p>2,100</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>1,300</p></td><td><p>2,000</p></td><td><p>2,600</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>1,600</p></td><td><p>2,300</p></td><td><p>3,100</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>1,900</p></td><td><p>2,900</p></td><td><p>4,100</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>2,200</p></td><td><p>3,700</p></td><td><p>4,700</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>2,600</p></td><td><p>4,200</p></td><td><p>5,400</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>2,900</p></td><td><p>4,900</p></td><td><p>6,200</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>3,300</p></td><td><p>5,400</p></td><td><p>7,800</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>3,800</p></td><td><p>6,100</p></td><td><p>9,800</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>4,500</p></td><td><p>7,200</p></td><td><p>11,700</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>5,000</p></td><td><p>8,700</p></td><td><p>14,200</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>5,500</p></td><td><p>10,700</p></td><td><p>17,200</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>6,400</p></td><td><p>13,200</p></td><td><p>22,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Step 3: Spend Your Budget.</strong></em> Every creature has an XP value in its stat block. When you add a creature to your combat encounter, deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much of your XP budget as you can without going over. It’s OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples are given below:</p><p><strong>Example 1.</strong> A low-difficulty encounter for four level 1 characters has an XP budget of 50 × 4, for a total of 200 XP. With that, you could build any of the following encounters:</p><ul><li class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted\">1 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmBugbearWarrior]{Bugbear Warrior}</strong> (200 XP)</li><li class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted\">2 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmGiantWasp00000]{Giant Wasps}</strong> (100 XP each), for 200 XP total</li><li class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted\">6 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmGiantRat000000]{Giant Rats}</strong> (25 XP each), for 150 XP total</li></ul><p><strong>Example 2.</strong> A moderate-difficulty encounter for five level 3 characters has an XP budget of 225 × 5, for a total of 1,125 XP.

With that, you could build this encounter:</p><ul><li class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted\">2 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmAdultRedDragon]{Adult Red Dragons}</strong> (18,000 XP each) and 2 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmFireGiant00000]{Fire Giants} </strong>(5,000 XP each), for 46,000 XP total</li></ul><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>When creating and running combat encounters, keep the following in mind.</p><p><em><strong>Many Creatures.</strong></em> The more creatures in an encounter, the higher the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal more damage to the characters than you expect. If your encounter includes more than two creatures per character, include fragile creatures that can be defeated quickly. This guideline is especially important for characters of level 1 or 2.</p><p><em><strong>Adjustments.</strong></em> A player’s absence might warrant removing creatures from an encounter to keep it at the intended difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result in an encounter being easier or harder than intended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such as by having creatures flee (making the encounter easier) or adding reinforcements (making the encounter harder).</p><p><em><strong>CR 0 Creatures.</strong></em> Creatures that have a CR of 0, particularly ones that are worth 0 XP, should be used sparingly. If you want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter, use swarms<em> </em>instead.</p><p><em><strong>Number of Stat Blocks.</strong></em> The best combat encounters often pair one kind of creature with another, such as fire giants paired with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat blocks you need to run the encounter. Referencing more than two or three stat blocks for a single encounter can be daunting, particularly if the creatures are complex.</p><p><em><strong>Powerful Creatures.</strong></em> If your combat encounter includes a creature whose CR is higher than the party’s level, be aware that such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out one or more characters. For example, an <strong>Ogre</strong> (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard with a single blow.</p><p><em><strong>Unusual Features.</strong></em> If a monster has a feature that lower-level characters can’t easily overcome, consider not adding that monster to an encounter for characters whose level is lower than the monster’s Challenge Rating.</p>"

          "name": "Mutual Respect",
          "text": "<p>Whether you’re playing with long-time friends or strangers, it’s important to create a foundation of mutual trust. The best games happen when everyone at the table feels safe enough to be themselves, speak up, and get into character.</p><p>It’s up to everyone to uphold the principles of respect. Difficult conversations often fall on the DM to lead, but they don’t have to. If one player’s behavior is interfering with everyone else’s enjoyment, everyone has a stake in helping to resolve the issue.</p><h2>Setting Expectations</h2><p>Before you assemble a group around a game table, pitch the adventures you’re thinking about running to your prospective players. Note the in-world conflicts that might arise, the setting’s overall tone, and the themes you’d like to explore. (The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.dmgTheBasics0000.JournalEntryPage.di6PPvo499vRq1NT]{Every DM Is Unique} section earlier in this chapter can help you describe your game to others.)</p><p>Telling players what to expect prepares them as they imagine what sorts of characters they could create and launches conversations about content to be embraced and avoided. You don’t need to reveal the major plot points or twists in your story, but share the themes you’re interested in exploring, the kinds of stories you’re inspired by, and which flavors of fantasy interest you. Being transparent with your players allows them to decide if this is a game they want to play, which is best to know before play begins.</p><p>Being clear about your expectations and making sure you understand your players’ expectations in return can help ensure a smooth game. Take your players’ opinions and desires seriously, and make sure they take yours just as seriously. Ideally, you’ll find a style of play that suits everyone.</p><h2>Hard and Soft Limits</h2><aside class=\"notable right three\"><h3>Using the Game Expectations Sheet</h3><p>The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.dmgTrackingSheet]{Game Expectations} tracking sheet is a tool you can use to set expectations at the start of a game and ensure the game is fun for everyone. Drag copies of the sheet into a new Journal to share them with your players.</p><p>Before distributing the sheet to players, fill in the two topmost boxes:</p><p><strong>Game Theme and Flavor.</strong> In this box, broadly describe the direction you envision for your game. See the Setting Expectations section above for the kinds of information to include here.</p><p><strong>Potentially Sensitive Elements.</strong> If you know that some elements of the game might run up against some players’ limits, list those elements in this box. See the Hard and Soft Limits section below for examples.</p><p>Once the above information is added, give a copy of the sheet to each player. Players can fill out their sheets anonymously, but ask each of them to add the following information:</p><p><strong>Limits.</strong> Using an <em>X</em> for a hard limit or a question mark for a soft limit, indicate any potentially sensitive elements that are problematic. Add any other elements to avoid.</p><p><strong>Hopes, Expectations, and Concerns.</strong> In the last two boxes, share any hopes and expectations for the game, and list any concerns about behavior at the table.</p><p>Collect all the sheets, and gather your players’ limits into a separate, anonymous document the whole group can access.</p></aside><p>Beyond the general themes and flavors of fantasy you’re interested in exploring in your campaign, it’s important to have a conversation with your players about topics that can be sensitive or uncomfortable. It can be helpful to discuss these topics in terms of soft and hard limits:</p><ul><li>A soft limit applies to a topic that should be handled carefully, as it might create unwelcome anxiety, fear, or discomfort.</li><li>A hard limit applies to a topic that should not be mentioned or described.</li></ul><p>DMs and players can have phobias or triggers that others might not be aware of. Any in-game topic or theme that makes a member of the gaming group feel unsafe (a hard limit) must be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they consent to include it in-game (a soft limit), incorporate it with care, if at all, and be ready to quickly veer away from it if needed.</p><p>Common in-game limits apply to topics such as intraparty romance, sex, exploitation, racism, enslavement, and violence toward children and animals. Limits can also apply to certain creatures, such as spiders, snakes, rats, and demons. It’s also important to discuss limits around what harm might befall characters, including mind-control magic, helplessness, and death.</p><p>That said, D&amp;D is a game that has in-world conflicts and mayhem. Certain core elements of the game are difficult to ignore. For example, taking damage isn’t a limit you can work around easily. Similarly, character death is something that happens from time to time, though the game has ways to counteract or avoid it.</p><p><em><strong>Communicating Limits.</strong></em> Make sure everyone is comfortable with how the discussion of limits takes place. Players might not want to discuss limits aloud, especially if they’re new to roleplaying games or haven’t spent a lot of time with other members of the group. One way to alleviate such discomfort is to provide a way for players to share limits anonymously. Everyone can jot down their limits on an anonymous survey, such as the Game Expectations tracking sheet in this chapter.</p><p>Compile limits into a list that can be shared with the group. Limits aren’t negotiable, and everyone in the group needs to respect them.</p><p>The start of a campaign is a great time to have this discussion, but further discussion is warranted each time a new player joins the group or when the campaign has a shift in story or tone. Someone might cross a line and need to be reminded of a limit, or someone might not think to include some of their limits in the initial discussion. Players can also discover new limits as the campaign unfolds. Check in with the group every few sessions to make sure everyone’s comfortable with how the game is developing, updating the group’s limits as needed.</p><p><em><strong>Shifting Limits.</strong></em> Encourage players to bring any additional limits to you, privately or in the moment, so you can add them to the list. Trust that players know their needs best, and update the game accordingly.</p><p><em><strong>Limits in Play.</strong></em> Since D&amp;D is improvisational, the game can go in unexpected directions. It’s helpful to have an agreed-on signal that players can use to communicate that a limit has been violated, allowing you to adjust quickly. That signal might be a gesture (such as crossing the arms in an X or raising a palm in a “stop” gesture), a code word or phrase, touching or lifting a designated object, or anything else your group agrees on. Players should also feel safe to say “stop” and pause the game until the issue is resolved. The person who invokes the signals can comment on what they want adjusted but doesn’t have to explain why the content is objectionable. The signal shouldn’t trigger a debate or discussion: thank the player for being honest about their needs, set the scene right, and move on.</p><p>Make it clear to players that if a person isn’t comfortable using the signal, they can step away from the game or call for a break to talk to you privately. Players may also give a friend permission to use the signal on their behalf. As the DM, lead by example. Take your players’ needs seriously, and use every tool at your disposal to adjust how your shared story plays out.</p><h2>Intra-party Conflict</h2><p>When there’s conflict between characters in an adventuring party, it’s usually a sign that one of three things is going on:</p><p><strong>Disruptive Player.</strong> A player is exhibiting antisocial behavior in the game. How to deal with it is covered in the @UUID[.yBdkX7XGvlRVcyya#antisocial-behavior]{Antisocial Behavior} section.</p><p><strong>Player Conflict.</strong> Conflicts between characters sometimes surface conflicts between players. These conflicts are best handled away from the gaming table. Encourage the players to resolve their conflict outside the game. If that conflict keeps arising at the game table, you might need to ask them to step away from the campaign for a while or leave the game entirely.</p><p><strong>Roleplaying.</strong> Conflicts between characters aren’t always bad. It’s OK for characters (and players) to disagree about how to deal with a captured enemy or which side to back in a brewing war. If the disagreement gets too heated, take a break and perhaps discuss, out of character, how the players would like to proceed.</p><p>If you can’t tell which of these dynamics is in play, have a conversation with the players about it.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

        "Respect for the Players": {
          "name": "Respect for the Players",
          "text": "<p>Your players need to know from the start that you’ll run a game that is fun, fair, and tailored for them; that you’ll allow each of them to contribute to the story; and that you’ll pay attention to them when they take their turns. Your players also count on you to make sure an adventure’s threats don’t target them personally. Never make players feel uncomfortable or threatened.</p><h2>Sharing the Spotlight</h2><p>As the DM, don’t play favorites. Don’t let one player do all the talking, and make sure you check in about what every character is doing, especially during periods of exploration and social interaction, rather than focusing just on one player’s character.</p><p>Sometimes you’ll encounter players who tell other players what their characters should do, claim the best magic items for themselves, bully the other players, and refuse to share the spotlight. Away from the game, point out that the player’s behavior is spoiling the fun for others, and ask the player to tone it down. If the player refuses to change this behavior, ask the player to leave the group.</p><p>Some problems arise when a player assumes that their particular style of play is superior to others, and they lose patience with encounters tailored to other players’ preferences. Remind the impatient player (perhaps away from the table) that you have a group to please, not just one player.</p><aside class=\"notable right three\"><h3>Do You Really Do That?</h3><p>Can players retract what they just said their characters did? Some DMs take a hard-line position: “If you said it, your character did it.” Such a strict position tends to make players much more careful about what they say, which can dampen the atmosphere and discourage humor.</p><p>Other DMs let players change their minds freely. This creates a more relaxed mood at the table, which might slow the pace of the game.</p><p>A common compromise is to rule that players can retract or change anything their characters did up until the point they learn the consequences of their actions. Once you describe what happens as a result, it’s too late for the players to change their minds.</p></aside><h2>Tragic Limits</h2><p>Some players resist getting invested in the world of the game because they don’t want to endure the pain of seeing the people and places they care about threatened or destroyed. Other players gleefully detail a backstory full of beloved NPCs, fully expecting the DM to use those people as bait, tragic victims, and unexpected villains. It’s important to understand your players’ preferences so you neither alienate the players by callously destroying what they love nor bore them by leaving their backstory out of the campaign story.</p><p>When you have antagonists threaten the people and places the characters love, be sure the characters have a chance to stave off the worst outcome. During the game, characters should have the opportunity to avoid or mitigate losses in heroic ways, with tragedy being a consequence of the characters’ actions and decisions, not a foregone conclusion. Moments of helplessness in the face of devastating tragedy are better suited for character backstories.</p><h2>DM Die Rolling</h2><p>Should you hide your die rolls behind a DM screen, or should you roll your dice in the open for all the players to see? Choose either approach, and be consistent. Each approach has benefits:</p><p><strong>Hidden Die Rolls.</strong> Hiding your die rolls keeps them mysterious and allows you to alter results if you want to. For example, you could ignore a Critical Hit to save a character’s life. Don’t alter die rolls too often, though, and never let the players know when you fudge a die roll.</p><p><strong>Visible Die Rolls.</strong> Rolling dice in the open demonstrates impartiality—you’re not fudging rolls to the characters’ benefit or detriment.</p><p>Even if you usually roll behind a screen, it can be fun to make an especially dramatic roll where everyone can see it.</p><h2>Overly Cautious Players</h2><p>Overly cautious players can slow down the game by checking every flagstone, door, and wall in a dungeon for traps and hidden dangers. Sometimes this behavior is a learned response to too many unpleasant surprises in past adventures, and sometimes it’s just a manifestation of players’ personalities.</p><p>Here are some in-game techniques you can use to encourage your players to act boldly:</p><p><strong>Avoid Random Perils.</strong> Avoid traps and ambushes that feel random and have little importance to the rest of the adventure.</p><p><strong>Create Time Pressure.</strong> Set up a situation where the characters are racing toward a goal or destination. (Use this technique with caution, as time pressure can increase players’ anxiety.)</p><p><strong>Telegraph Encounters.</strong> Give players advance warning that an encounter is imminent. Maybe they hear the heavy footfalls of a giant or see a dragon flying overhead before they have to confront it. This can encourage your players to move toward or away from the encounters rather than anxiously anticipating an ambush.</p><p>If these in-game techniques don’t have the desired effect, have a conversation outside the game with your players about which game elements are causing them to play in an overly cautious way. Come to an agreement that those elements won’t appear in your game, as keeping the game moving will result in a better experience.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice hide-in-embed\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

And when you’re narrating the action of the game, the players should be paying attention.</p><h2>Player Die Rolling</h2><p>Players should roll their dice in full view of everyone. If a player scoops up their dice before anyone else can see what they rolled, encourage that player to be less secretive.</p><p>When a die falls on the floor, do you count it or reroll it? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the book away and see where it lands or reroll the die? Work with your players to answer these questions, and record the answers as house rules.</p><h2>The Social Contract of Adventures</h2><p>You must provide reasonably appealing reasons for characters to undertake the adventures you prepare. In exchange, the players should go along with those hooks. It’s OK for your players to give you some pushback on why their characters should want to do what you’re asking them to do, but it’s not OK for them to invalidate the hard work you’ve done preparing the adventure by willfully going in a different direction.</p><p>If you feel like you’re keeping up your end of the bargain but your players aren’t, have a conversation with them away from the gaming table. Try to understand what hooks would motivate their characters, and make sure the players understand the work you put into preparing adventures for them.</p><h2>Rules Discussions</h2><p>Work out a policy about rules discussions at the table. Some groups don’t mind putting the game on hold while they discuss different interpretations of a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and continue playing. If you gloss over a rules issue in play, make a note of it and return to the issue later.</p><p>Some players like to use the rules to argue against your decisions. While such players can be helpful when you’re stuck or make a rules mistake that’s easily corrected, players who argue the rules too often can disrupt the flow of the game.</p><p>If a player wants to pause play to find a specific rule or reference, you can invite the player to search for it while you and the rest of the players continue the game. That player’s character essentially steps out of the game for as long as it takes. Monsters don’t attack the character, and the character takes the Dodge action in combat until the player rejoins the group. This solution allows the other players to keep playing instead of letting one player stop the game.</p><h2>Character Knowledge</h2><p>Encourage players to play their characters within the limits of what the characters know and understand. It can be helpful to maintain the distinction between player and character knowledge by simply asking players, “What do your <em>characters</em> think?”</p><p>Anachronistic thinking is another potential pitfall. You might need to remind players that their characters don’t know how to make things that don’t exist in the game world, such as modern firearms or antibiotics, and they don’t have the players’ understanding of modern science (which might not apply in the game universe anyway).</p><p>Similarly, sometimes a player is familiar with the published adventure you’re running or knows the <em>Monster Manual</em> backward and forward. Encourage the player to keep that knowledge separate from their character’s knowledge and allow the other players to discover it through play.</p><h2>Antisocial Behavior</h2><p>People often play D&amp;D because it lets them, through their characters, do things they can’t do in real life—fight monsters, cast spells, and so on. However, for some players, this means wreaking havoc in towns or betraying their allies. What they want in the game has nothing to do with heroic adventure, but with using the game rules to act out antisocial fantasies.</p><p>If this behavior comes up in your game, it might be time to reopen the conversation about the kind of game you want to play. If it’s just one player causing the trouble, it’s perfectly appropriate to issue an ultimatum: an out-of-control player who wants to continue playing with the group must stop being disruptive and play as part of a team. Don’t let players get away with being jerks to the other players using the excuse, “that’s what my character would do.”</p><p><em><strong>Evil Characters.</strong></em> Players who want to play evil characters might be looking to carry out antisocial behavior in the game. If a player asks for permission to play an evil character or comes to the table with one already made, talk to that player about what they have in mind and make sure their plans square with the group’s expectations for your game. Sometimes a player wants to explore playing an evil character for perfectly good (and nondisruptive) reasons, and sometimes a whole group decides it might be fun to play evil characters together. These are valid options, as long as everyone’s on the same page about how the campaign will go.</p><aside class=\"notable right three\"><h3>Knowing the Rules</h3><p>You don’t have to be an expert on the rules to be a good DM. Of course it’s helpful to be familiar with the rules, especially the ones in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>, but facilitating fun is more important than implementing the rules perfectly. If you’re not sure how to apply the rules in a situation, you can always ask the opinion of the players as a group. It might take a few minutes, but it’s usually possible to reach an answer that feels fair to everyone, and that’s more important than a “correct” answer.</p><p>You don’t need to know every spell in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> or the features of every class. Set the expectation that players are responsible for telling you what their abilities and spells do.</p></aside><h2>Players Exploiting the Rules</h2><p>Some players enjoy poring over the D&amp;D rules and looking for optimal combinations. This kind of optimizing is part of the game, but it can cross a line into being exploitative, interfering with everyone else’s fun.</p><p>Setting clear expectations is essential when dealing with this kind of rules exploitation. Bear these principles in mind:</p><p><strong>Rules Aren’t Physics.</strong> The rules of the game are meant to provide a fun game experience, not to describe the laws of physics in the worlds of D&amp;D, let alone the real world. Don’t let players argue that a bucket brigade of ordinary people can accelerate a spear to light speed by all using the Ready action to pass the spear to the next person in line. The Ready action facilitates heroic action; it doesn’t define the physical limitations of what can happen in a 6-second combat round.</p><p><strong>The Game Is Not an Economy.</strong> The rules of the game aren’t intended to model a realistic economy, and players who look for loopholes that let them generate infinite wealth using combinations of spells are exploiting the rules.</p><p><strong>Combat Is for Enemies.</strong> Some rules apply only during combat or while a character is acting in Initiative order. Don’t let players attack each other or helpless creatures to activate those rules.</p><p><strong>Rules Rely on Good-Faith Interpretation.</strong> The rules assume that everyone reading and interpreting the rules has the interests of the group’s fun at heart and is reading the rules in that light.</p><p>Outlining these principles can help hold players’ exploits at bay. If a player persistently tries to twist the rules of the game, have a conversation with that player outside the game and ask them to stop.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

Unless an armor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must be worn for its magic to function.</p><p>Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If no type is specified, choose the type or determine it randomly.</p><h2>Potions</h2><p>An item in the Potion category might be a magical brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.</p><p><em><strong>Using a Potion.</strong></em> Potions are consumable items. Drinking a potion or administering it to another creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil might take longer as specified in its description.

A typical rod weighs 2 to 5 pounds.</p><p>Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can be used as an Arcane Focus.</p><h2>Scrolls</h2><p>An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is the <em>Spell Scroll</em>, a spell stored in written form. However, some scrolls, like the <em>Scroll of Protection</em>, bear an incantation that isn’t a spell.</p><p><em><strong>Using a Scroll.</strong></em> Scrolls are consumable items.

A staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.</p><p>Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane Focus.</p><h2>Wands</h2><p>An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.</p><p>Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand can be used as an Arcane Focus.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a weapon from @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000]{Equipment}. Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no weapon type is specified, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.</p><p><em><strong>Ammunition.</strong></em> If a magic weapon has the Ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares whether a weapon is magical or not.</p><h2>Wondrous Items</h2><p>Wondrous Items include wearable items such as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and more also fall into this category.</p>"

Artifacts, such as the <em>Dragon Orb</em>, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.</p><h2>Magic Item Values by Rarity</h2><p>Common magic items can often be bought in a town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as the City of Brass or Sigil.

The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated.

Spoken command words must be audible and fail to work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in the area of the <em>Silence</em> spell.</p><h2>Consumable Items</h2><p>Some items are consumed—used up, in other words—when they are activated. A <em>Potion of Healing</em> must be swallowed, for example, while the writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.</p><h2>Spells Cast from Items</h2><p>Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components unless the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.</p><p>A magic item may require the user to use their own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting ability, the user chooses which one to use with the item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability, their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies.</p><h2>Charges</h2><p>Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when the <em>Identify</em> spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to an item knows how many charges the item has and how many it regains.</p>"

If an item requires multiple days, those days needn’t be consecutive.</p><p><em><strong>Assistants.</strong></em> Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.</p><p><em><strong>Raw Materials.</strong></em> The cost in the table represents the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance that the materials are available, and in any other settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before checking on the availability again.</p><p>If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item using the rules in Equipment.

          "text": "<p>Some magic items have sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.</p><p>Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.</p><p>The GM controls sentient magic items and their activated properties. A bearer who maintains a good relationship with the item can access those properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict can ensue (see @UUID[.AMFpeeVHTKXvGbHA#conflict]{Conflict} below).</p><h2>Sentient Magic Item Traits</h2><p>When you make a sentient magic item, you create the item’s persona much as you would create an NPC, with these exceptions.</p><p><em><strong>Abilities.</strong></em> A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or determine them randomly as follows: roll [[/r 4d6kh3]] for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise, pick an alignment or roll on the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenAlignment0]{Sentient Item's Alignment} table.</p><p><em><strong>Communication.</strong></em> A sentient item communicates by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenCommunicat]{Sentient Item’s Communication} table.</p><p><em><strong>Senses.</strong></em> A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenSenses0000]{Sentient Item’s Senses} table.</p><p><em><strong>Special Purpose.</strong></em> You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item (see Conflict below). You can pick a special purpose or roll on the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenSpecialPur]{Sentient Item’s Special Purpose} table.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenAlignment0 rollable]</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenCommunicat rollable]</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenSpecialPur rollable]</p><h2>Conflict</h2><p>When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the item makes one or more of the following demands:</p><p><strong>Chase My Dreams.</strong> The item demands that its bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.</p><p><strong>Get Rid of It.</strong> The item demands that its bearer dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.</p><p><strong>It’s Time for a Change.</strong> The item demands to be given to someone else.</p><p><strong>Keep Me Close.</strong> The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.</p><p>If its bearer refuses to comply with the item’s demands, the item can do any of the following:</p><ul><li>Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.</li><li>Suppress one or more of its activated properties.</li><li>Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the bearer has the &amp;Reference[Charmed] condition for [[/r 1d12]] hours. While Charmed in this way, the bearer must try to follow the item’s commands. If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn.</li></ul>"

Some characters have abilities that trigger on an Initiative roll; you, not the players, decide if and when Initiative is rolled. A high-level Barbarian can’t just punch their Paladin friend and roll Initiative to regain expended uses of Rage.</p><p>In any situation where a character’s actions initiate combat, you can give the acting character Advantage on their Initiative roll. For example, if a conversation with an NPC is cut short because the Sorcerer is convinced that NPC is a doppelganger and targets it with a <em>Chromatic Orb </em>spell, everyone rolls Initiative, and the Sorcerer does so with Advantage. If the doppelganger rolls well, it might still act before the Sorcerer’s spell goes off, reflecting the monster’s ability to anticipate the spell.</p><h2>Using Initiative Scores</h2><p>You can get to the action of combat more quickly by using Initiative scores instead of rolling. You might use Initiative scores just for characters, just for monsters, or for both.</p><p><em><strong>Initiative Scores for Characters.</strong></em> A character’s Initiative score is typically 10 plus all modifiers to the character’s Initiative roll (including their Dexterity modifier and any special modifiers). If you want your players to use Initiative scores, have them record those scores on their character sheets, and keep your own list of those scores.</p><p><em><strong>Initiative Scores for Monsters.</strong></em> A monster’s stat block in the <em>Monster Manual</em> includes its Initiative score after its Initiative bonus.</p><p><em><strong>Advantage and Disadvantage.</strong></em> If a creature has Advantage on Initiative rolls, increase its Initiative score by 5. If it has Disadvantage on those rolls, decrease that score by 5.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice hide-in-embed\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

          "name": "Tracking Monsters' Hit Points",
          "text": "<p>During a combat encounter, you or a player should track how much damage each monster takes. Most DMs track damage in secret so their players don’t know how many Hit Points a monster has remaining.</p><p>It helps to have a system to track damage for groups of monsters. If you aren’t using miniatures or other visual aids, one way to track your monsters is to assign them unique features. For example, imagine that you’re running an encounter with three ogres. You might attach descriptions such as “the ogre with a big scar” and “the ogre with the helmet” to help you and your players track which monster is which. Once Initiative is rolled, jot down each ogre’s Hit Points and add notes (and even a name, if you like) to differentiate each one:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Krag (ogre w/ scar):</strong> 68</p></li><li><p><strong>Thod (ogre w/ helm):</strong> 71</p></li><li><p><strong>Mur (ogre smeared w/ dirt):</strong> 59</p></li></ul><p>If you use miniatures to represent monsters, one way to differentiate them is to give each one a unique miniature. If you use identical miniatures to represent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures with small stickers of different colors or stickers with different letters or numbers on them.</p><p>For example, in a combat encounter with three ogres, you could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged with stickers marked A, B, and C, respectively. To track the ogres’ Hit Points, you can sort them by letter, then subtract damage from their Hit Points as they take it. Your records might look something like this after a few rounds of combat:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ogre A:</strong> <span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>68</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>59</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>53</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>45</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>24</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>14</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>9</s></span> dead</p></li><li><p><strong>Ogre B:</strong> <span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>71</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>62</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>54</s></span> 33</p></li><li><p><strong>Ogre C:</strong> 59</p></li></ul><p>Some DMs prefer to track how much damage a monster has taken, adding to that number as characters deal damage (instead of subtracting from the monster’s Hit Points). Adding is generally easier than subtracting, and you can track damage on a visible list of Initiative (such as a whiteboard) without revealing to the players how many Hit Points the monsters have. The tracking might look like this:</p><p><strong>Ogre A:</strong> <span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>9</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>15</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>23</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>44</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>54</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>59</s></span> dead</p><p><strong>Ogre B:</strong> <span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>9</s></span><s> </s><span class=\"CharOverride-3\"><s>17</s></span> 38</p><p><strong>Ogre C:</strong></p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Tracking Hit Points</h3><p>It's easy to track Hit Points in a VTT.

The DM is also responsible for the pace of a play session and for creating situations that facilitate fun.</p><p><strong>Improviser.</strong> A big part of being the DM is deciding how to apply the rules as you go and imagining the consequences of the characters’ actions in a way that will make the game fun for everyone.</p><p><strong>Referee.</strong> When it’s not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules.</p><p><strong>Storyteller.</strong> The DM crafts adventures, setting situations in front of the characters that entice them to explore and interact with the game world.</p><p><strong>Teacher.</strong> It’s often the DM’s job to teach new players how to play the game.</p><p><strong>Worldbuilder.</strong> The DM creates the world where the game’s adventures take place. Even if you’re using a published setting, you get to make it yours.</p><h2>DM Tips</h2><p>The most important part of being a good DM is facilitating the fun of everyone at the table. Keep these tips in mind to help things go smoothly.</p><p><strong>Embrace the Shared Story.</strong> D&amp;D is about telling a story as a group, so let the other players contribute through the words and deeds of their characters. Encourage players to engage by asking them what their characters are doing.</p><p><strong>It’s Not a Competition.</strong> The DM isn’t competing against the other players. It’s your job to provide fun challenges and keep the story moving.</p><p><strong>Be Fair and Flexible.</strong> Treat your players in a fair, impartial manner. The rules help you do this, but when you need to act as referee, try to make decisions that ensure everyone is having fun.</p><p><strong>Communicate with Your Players.</strong> Open communication is essential to a successful D&amp;D game. Many problems can be solved or even prevented with honest conversation. Ask questions and solicit feedback after or between sessions.</p><p><strong>It’s OK to Make Mistakes.</strong> If you overlook or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. No one expects you to memorize every rule or detail. Even if you don’t realize your mistake until after a game session is over, it’s OK to acknowledge the mistake at the start of the next session and make adjustments moving forward.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice hide-in-embed\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

For example, it’s not appropriate for players to look up a monster in the <em>Monster Manual</em> (or the equivalent digital tool) while fighting that monster.

We have configured them to summon from the 2014 SRD where possible and they will be updated to use the Monster Manual versions of the creatures when it releases.</p><p>The <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> links to equipment and spells from the <em>2024 Player's Handbook</em> which is required for full functionality.</p></article></section><h2>A Dungeon Master</h2><p>One player has the special role of Dungeon Master.</p><p>Some people love being the DM all the time, while others can end up feeling trapped as the “forever DM” for their gaming group. Group Size section discusses possibilities for sharing the role of Dungeon Master among multiple players in a group.</p><h2>Players</h2><p>Players who aren’t the Dungeon Master take on the roles of the heroes, also known as the characters or the adventurers.</p><p>D&amp;D plays best with four to six players in addition to the DM, but it’s possible to run a game with fewer or more adventurers. See the Group Size section for advice on doing so.</p><h3>Finding Players</h3><p>Where do you find players? Here are a handful of suggestions:</p><ul><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Game or hobby stores (the Store Locator on the Wizards of the Coast website can help you find stores near you that host D&amp;D events)</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Friends, family, community members, and work colleagues who enjoy gaming or fantasy</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Gaming clubs at schools</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Social media and online messaging sites</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Gaming conventions</li></ul><h2>A Place to Play</h2><p>The bare minimum of space you need to play D&amp;D is room for everyone in your group to gather and participate.</p><p>When choosing the space you’ll be playing in, enlist your players’ help. Think about any accessibility needs you or they might have. Some players might have difficulty with low light, background music, strong odors, cramped spaces, or specific allergens. Accommodate what you can; communicate what you can’t as early as possible.</p><p>If possible, play in an area with minimal visual or auditory distractions. Favor surroundings that reinforce your desired atmosphere and have little non-player traffic. If space is shared, reserve the space in advance.</p><p>You can also play D&amp;D anywhere you might come together in an online space, from a group video call to a sophisticated virtual tabletop.</p><h2>Dice</h2><p>You need a full set of polyhedral dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. It’s helpful to have at least two of each kind. Ideally, each player should also have their own set of polyhedral dice.</p><p>Lots of digital dice rollers exist. Simple, browser ­based dice rollers are easily found on the internet. Specialized dice apps can be found in app stores, and virtual tabletops typically have dice-rolling functionality built in.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Rolling Dice in Foundry VTT</h3><p>Foundry includes an advanced dice rolling system. Most things will be rolled automatically from character sheets, items, or roll tables but journal entries may also contain inline rolls (e.g. [[/r 1d4]]) which can be clicked on to get a result.</p><p>Check out our <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice/\">Dice Rolling</a> article to learn the rolling syntax which can be used in Macros or in the chat log.</p></article></section><h2>Note-Taking Materials</h2><p>Everyone needs some way to take notes. During every round of combat, someone needs to keep track of Initiative, Hit Points, conditions, and other information. Players often like to take notes about what happens in the adventure, and at least one of them should record any clues and treasure the characters collect.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Solo or Shared Journal Entries</h3><p>You can create journals for each of your players to take notes in or create a shared journal which all of them can edit at the same time using Foundry's built-in collaborative editing feature.</p></article></section><h3>Character Sheets</h3><p>Players need some way to record important information about their characters. Plain paper works fine, but players might find official or fan-made character sheets more helpful in organizing the information. A variety of digital character sheets are also available if you’re playing online or using digital devices at the table.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Scheduling Games</h3><p>Sometimes the hardest thing about running a game is finding a time when everyone can play. Some groups play for a few hours every week, while others set aside a whole day once a month. Create a schedule that works best for your group.</p><p>For new groups, it often helps to schedule a single-session game (often called a “one-shot”) as a way for people to try it out. If everyone has a great time at that one session, it can be easier to get them to make a long-term commitment.</p><p>Scheduling conflicts are sometimes inescapable. The Group Size section in chapter 2 offers some advice on what to do when a player has to miss a session.</p></aside><h3>Campaign Journal</h3><p>Throughout this book you’ll find tracking sheets you can use to make your work as a DM easier. They range from sheets you can use to track NPCs or settlements in your game to trackers you can use to make sure you’re giving the adventurers a good number of magic items. These tracking sheets can form the basis of a campaign journal, and they’ll help you plan your adventures and build your world. You can scan or photocopy these sheets for your personal use, and you’ll find downloadable versions on DnDBeyond.com.</p><h2>Useful Additions</h2><p>Various resources can enrich your game and make it more fun. Many of these resources might have digital versions, making computers, tablets, and smartphones essential elements in some D&amp;D games and for some players.</p><h3>DM Screen</h3><p>A DM screen shields your books, notes, and die rolls from your players. (See the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.dmgEnsuringFunFo.JournalEntryPage.5NXvjb1HLEYfUSf0#dm-die-rolling]{Ensuring Fun for All} section later in this chapter for more about when and why you might want to hide die rolls.) Most DM screens have art on the outward-facing panels and handy rules information on the inside-facing panels. Others might be made of fancy wood or sculpted to help set the mood for your game.</p><p>You don’t need a physical screen to hide things if you’re playing online, but it can be helpful to have ready access to important information like condition definitions, common actions, and other key rules. Some DMs set up a physical DM screen near their computer screen. A virtual tabletop might have reference information like this built in.</p><h3>Adventures and Sourcebooks</h3><p>Beyond the three core rulebooks, a plethora of additional content is available from Wizards of the Coast and other publishers. Adventures provide hooks, plots, maps, and encounters you can use in your game. Sourcebooks include things like new character options, new monsters, and inspiration for building your own adventures and campaigns. You can play D&amp;D without any of these additional products, but many DMs (and players) find them to be exciting additions to the game.</p><h3>Battle Grid and Miniatures</h3><p>Some DMs use a battle grid and miniatures to run combat encounters, which helps players visualize scenes when playing in person. A vinyl wet-erase mat with a printed grid, a gridded whiteboard, a cutting mat, a large sheet of gridded paper, or a printed poster map—any of these can serve as a battle grid. The grid should be marked in 1-inch squares.</p><p>You also need plastic or metal miniatures to represent characters and monsters in the game, but you can use coins, extra dice, paper counters, or even pieces of candy if miniatures are unavailable.</p><p>Many software tools designed to facilitate online D&amp;D play provide a battle grid. Even without such tools, though, many online D&amp;D games use screen sharing in combination with drawing programs, shared whiteboards, or similar tools as simple battle grids. Some DMs are comfortable with software that allows them to control lighting and show the players exactly what they can see; others find that complex software gets in the way of the game. Use whatever works for you and your group.</p><h3>Card Accessories</h3><p>Some players and DMs find it helpful to have information available in the form of cards. You can buy (or make) cards with individual spells, magic items, monster stat blocks, rules reference, and similar information for easy reference.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice hide-in-embed\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

Create a bulleted list of key plot points to make sure a coherent story unfolds.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Identify the encounters you want to run, then figure out how likely it is each encounter will get played, categorizing each one as “definite,” “possible,” or “unlikely.”</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Gather any maps you’ll need for the definite and possible encounters, then focus the remainder of your prep time on the definite encounters, as outlined below.</p><p>For combat encounters, review the monsters’ tactics and stat blocks. Note any special rules that apply to the setting of the encounter.</p><p>For social interaction encounters, make notes about the nonplayer characters (NPCs) in the encounter—their personalities, goals, and tactics.</p><p>For exploration encounters, record any clues or other information the characters should learn, and review any special rules that might come into play in the encounter.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Consider how each definite encounter relates to the players’ motivations (see Know Your Players). Think about elements you can add to interest them. For example, a combat encounter could open with a tense negotiation designed to appeal to players who enjoy social interaction.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Skim the encounters you flagged as possible.</p><h3>Two-Hour Preparation</h3><p>With another hour to prepare, add these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Carefully review each “possible” encounter.</p><p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Devote any time you have left to creating improvisational aids (see Improvising Answers).</p><h3>Three-Hour Preparation</h3><p>If you have three hours to prepare, add these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 8.</strong> Skim each “unlikely” encounter.</p><p><strong>Step 9.</strong> Create a new encounter designed to appeal specifically to one player, or alter an existing encounter to relate to the goals and motivations of that player’s character. Over the course of several sessions, do this for all your players and their characters.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice hide-in-embed\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

        "How to Run a Session": {
          "name": "How to Run a Session",
          "text": "<p>This section explains how to run a game session; later on, chapters 4 and 5 detail how to combine sessions into adventures and adventures into campaigns.</p><h2>Recap</h2><p>Start each game session after the first with a recap of what happened in the previous session. A recap helps players get back into the story. It also provides important information to players who missed the previous session. You can provide this recap, or you can invite one or more players to deliver the recap instead. Each approach has benefits:</p><p><strong>DM Recap.</strong> Provide the recap yourself if you have specific information you need to impart or if you want the recap to be concise and focused on what’s relevant.</p><p><strong>Player Recap.</strong> Let the players provide the recap if you want to gauge what they think is important or learn more about what they’re getting out of the game. If the players miss any important details in their recap, you can interject a reminder.</p><h2>Encounters</h2><p>The bulk of a typical D&amp;D session consists of a series of encounters, similar to how a movie is a series of scenes. In each encounter, there are chances for the DM to describe creatures and places and for characters to make choices. Encounters can involve exploration (interacting with the environment, including puzzles), social interaction with creatures, or combat. The <em>Player’s Handbook</em> outlines the general rhythm of play in an encounter. The following sections offer more detailed information on how an encounter typically unfolds, in three steps.</p><h3>Step 1: Describe the Situation</h3><p>As the DM, you decide how much to tell the players and when. All the information the players need to make choices comes from you. Within the rules of the game and the limits of the characters’ knowledge and senses, tell players everything they need to know.</p><section class=\"fvtt narrative\"><p>Published adventures often include text in a box like this, which is meant to be read aloud to the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. It usually describes locations so the players know what's happening and have a sense of what their characters' options are.</p></section><p>Whether you’re running a published adventure or one of your own creation, your initial description of a room or situation should focus on what the characters can perceive. You don’t have to reveal every detail at once. Most players begin to lose focus after about three sentences of descriptive text. As characters search rooms, open drawers and chests, and examine things more closely, give players more details about what their characters find.</p><p>The Narration section in chapter 2 offers more extensive advice and examples of narration.</p><h3>Step 2: Let the Players Talk</h3><p>Once you’re done describing the situation, ask the players what their characters want to do. Note what the players say, and identify how to resolve their actions. Ask them for more information if you need it.</p><p>Sometimes the players might give you a group answer: “We go through the door.” Other times, individual players might want to do specific things—one might search a chest while another examines a bookshelf. Outside combat, the characters don’t need to take turns, but you need to give each player a chance to tell you what their character is doing so you can decide how to resolve everyone’s actions. In combat, everyone takes turns in Initiative order.</p><h3>Step 3: Describe What Happens</h3><p>After the players describe their characters’ actions, it’s the DM’s job to resolve those actions, guided by the rules and the adventure you’ve prepared. So how do you decide? Think through these possibilities:</p><p><strong>No Rules Required.</strong> Sometimes, resolving a situation is easy. If an adventurer wants to cross an empty room and open a door, you can just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond (perhaps referencing your map or notes).</p><p><strong>Obstacles to Success.</strong> A lock, a guard, or some other obstacle might hinder a character’s ability to complete a task. In those cases, you typically call for a &amp;Reference[D20 Test], usually an ability check. For example, a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check might be needed to pick the lock, while a successful Charisma (Persuasion) check and some coins might be needed to bribe the guard. The Resolving Outcomes section in chapter 2 gives more guidance on how to use D20 Tests and other tools to determine the results of characters’ actions.</p><p><strong>Roleplaying.</strong> When the players interact with other creatures, roleplay those creatures based on whether they are Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile. Improvise based on what you know about the creatures, their knowledge, and their motivations. Then bring these creatures to life as you describe what happens. (See Running Social Interaction in chapter 2 for more advice.)</p><p><strong>One Action at a Time.</strong> The rules about actions in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> limit how many things a character can do at once. Keeping those rules in mind can help you adjudicate situations.</p><p><strong>Combat.</strong> In combat, many situations involve attack rolls or saving throws. The rules of combat can help you determine the effectiveness of a character’s actions. The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.dmgRunningCombat]{Running Combat} section in chapter 2 offers advice on combat.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting.</strong> If a character casts a spell, you can usually let the player tell you what the spell does and how to resolve it. If questions arise, read the text of the spell yourself—how a spell is supposed to work is usually pretty clear. The general rules of spellcasting in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> are also essential for resolving a spell’s effects.</p><p><strong>Exceptions Supersede General Rules.</strong> General rules govern each part of the game, but the game also includes class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other elements that can contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, it’s a general rule that melee weapon attacks use the attacking character’s Strength modifier. But if a feature says that a character can make melee weapon attacks using Charisma, that exception supersedes the general rule.</p><p>When narrating results, try to give a flavorful description while clearly communicating what’s happening in the language of the game. See the Narration in Combat section in chapter 2 for more advice and examples.</p><p>Describing results often leads to another decision point, which returns the flow of the game to step 1.</p><h2>Passing Time</h2><p>The game has a rhythm and flow that includes periods of action and excitement interspersed with lulls. Think of how movies show time passing between scenes. When an encounter ends, you can move on to the next one. You can often gloss over hours of travel with a quick narrative summary (see the Travel section in chapter 2 for more advice). Similarly, if a rest period passes uneventfully, tell the players that and move on. Don’t make the players spend time discussing which character cooks what for dinner unless they enjoy such descriptions. It’s OK to gloss over mundane details and return to the action as quickly as possible.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Taking Breaks</h3><p>When you finish a lengthy combat encounter or a tension-filled scene, or if you need time to think, take a quick break. Give your brain a few moments to refocus, relax, or prepare for the next encounter. It’s OK to leave the players in suspense during a break while you figure out the consequences of their actions.</p></aside><p>Expect players to discuss the events of the game, spend time planning, and engage in long conversations in character. You don’t need to be involved in those discussions unless they have questions for you. Learn to recognize the times when you can take a break as the DM, and then resume the action as soon as everyone’s ready.</p><h2>Ending a Session</h2><p>Try not to end a game session in the middle of an encounter. It’s difficult to keep track of information such as Initiative order and other round-by-round details between sessions. An exception to this guideline is when you purposely end a session with a cliffhanger, where the story pauses just as something monumental happens or some surprising turn of events occurs. A cliffhanger can keep players intrigued and excited until the next session.</p><p>If a player missed a session and you had that player’s character leave the party for a while, make sure that there’s a way to bring the character back when the player returns. Sometimes a cliffhanger can serve this purpose: the character charges in to help their beleaguered companions.</p><p>Allow a few minutes at the end of play for everyone to discuss the events of the session. Ask your players what parts of the session they liked and what they would have liked to see more. Take notes on what happened and the situation at the end of the session so you can refer back to those notes as you prepare the next session.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice hide-in-embed\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

        "Every DM is Unique": {
          "name": "Every DM is Unique",
          "text": "<p>The preceding example of play shows how one Dungeon Master might run an encounter, but no two DMs run the game in exactly the same way—and that’s how it should be! You’ll be most successful as a DM if you choose a play style that works best for you and your players.</p><h2>Play Style</h2><p>Here are some questions that can help you define your unique style as a DM and the kind of game you want to run:</p><p><strong>Hack and Slash or Immersive Roleplaying?</strong> Does the game focus on combat and action or on a rich story with detailed NPCs?</p><p><strong>All Ages or Mature Themes? </strong>Is the game for all ages, or does it involve mature themes?</p><p><strong>Gritty or Cinematic?</strong> Do you prefer gritty realism, or are you more focused on making the game feel cinematic and superheroic?</p><p><strong>Serious or Silly? </strong>Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor your goal?</p><p><strong>Preplanned or Improvised? </strong>Do you like to plan thoroughly, or do you prefer to improvise?</p><p><strong>General or Thematic? </strong>Is the game a mixture of themes and genres, or does it center on a particular theme or a genre such as horror?</p><p><strong>Morally Ambiguous or Heroic? </strong>Are you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as allowing the characters to explore whether the end justifies the means? Or are you happier with straightforward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice, and helping the downtrodden?</p><h2>House Rules</h2><p>House rules are new or modified rules you add to your game to make it your own and to enhance the style you have in mind for your game. Before you establish a house rule, ask yourself two questions:</p><ul><li>Will the rule or change improve the game?</li><li>Will my players like it?</li></ul><p>If you’re confident that the answer to both questions is yes, give the new rule a try. Present house rules as experiments, and ask your players to provide feedback on them. If you introduce a house rule that isn’t fun, remove or revise the rule.</p><h4>Recording Rules Interpretations</h4><p>If a question about the interpretation of a rule comes up in your game, record how you decide to interpret it. Add that to your collection of house rules so you and the players can reference it when the rule comes up again later.</p><h2>Atmosphere</h2><p>Some DMs use music to create an appropriate atmosphere for their game sessions. They might use soundtracks from adventure movies or video games, although classical, ambient, or other music styles can also work well.</p><p>Some DMs adjust lighting or use sound effects. Miniatures and dioramas can contribute to the game’s atmosphere and help players visualize events. Check with your players, though: some might find music, lighting, or sound effects distracting; might prefer not to be startled by loud noises; or might need to avoid certain lighting effects.</p><h2>Delegation</h2><p>If there are parts of the game you prefer not to handle yourself, assign them to players who enjoy them. If you don’t want to break your narrative stride by looking up a rule, designate another player to be the rulebook reference expert. If you don’t like tracking Initiative, ask another player to do so.</p><h2>Learning by Observing</h2><p>One of the best ways to learn how to run a D&amp;D game is to observe other DMs in action. Another DM can give you a solid foundation for understanding the role—as well as inspire you with cool things you can do in your games.</p><p>You can use these questions to help you reflect on a game you observe:</p><p><strong>Beginning the Session.</strong> How did the DM start the session? Was there a recap?</p><p><strong>Body Language.</strong> What gestures did the DM use when describing a scene? How did the DM’s body language change when playing different NPCs?</p><p><strong>DM Voice.</strong> Did the DM use different voices or mannerisms for NPCs? Did the DM change the pitch or tempo of narration in different situations?</p><p><strong>Player Participation.</strong> Did the players participate in the world-building or make decisions that seemed to send the adventure in an unexpected direction? How did the DM handle it?</p><p><strong>Rules Adjudication.</strong> To what extent did the DM lean on the rules to adjudicate outcomes? Did the DM adjudicate situations wisely or in ways that made the game fun to watch?</p><p><strong>Three Pillars.</strong> How much of the session was taken up by combat, exploration, or social interaction?</p><p><strong>Tone and Mood.</strong> How would you describe the tone and mood of the game? Did it change over the course of the session?</p><p><strong>Turns of Phrase.</strong> Were there any words or bits of narration you really liked? (If so, jot them down.)</p><p><strong>World-Building.</strong> What elements of the DM’s world or the adventure grabbed your attention?</p><div class=\"fvtt advice hide-in-embed\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

          "text": "<p>The rules for a stat block are detailed in “Rules Glossary” and in this section.</p><h2>Size</h2><p>A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you choose the creature’s size from those options. See “Playing the Game” for information on size.</p><h2>Creature Type</h2><p>Each monster has a tag that identifies the type of creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type.</p><p>The game includes the following creature types, which have no rules of their own:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien beings, such as aboleths and cloakers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Beasts</strong> are non-Humanoid natural creatures, like horses and wolves, as well as most giant animals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Celestials</strong> are magical creatures, such as angels and pegasi, with ties to the Upper Planes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constructs</strong> are magically created creatures such as homunculi and shield guardians.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dragons</strong> are scaly beings of ancient origin, such as red dragons and wyverns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elementals</strong> are beings from the Elemental Planes, such as efreet and water elementals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fey</strong> are creatures tied to the Feywild or the forces of nature, such as dryads and goblins.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures tied to terrifying Lower Planes, such as balors and hell hounds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Giants</strong> are towering beings with humanlike shapes, like fire giants and trolls.</p></li><li><p><strong>Humanoids</strong> are people defined by their roles and professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors. They include members of varied species.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monstrosities</strong> are unnatural creatures with strange origins, such as mimics and owlbears.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous creatures, including black puddings and gelatinous cubes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plants</strong> are sentient vegetation and fungal monsters, such as shambling mounds and treants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Undead</strong> are spirits and the reanimated dead, such as ghosts, vampires, and zombies.</p></li></ul><h3>Descriptive Tags</h3><p>A monster might have one or more tags in parentheses following its type. Such tags provide additional categorization and have no rules of their own, but certain game effects might refer to them. Lists of monster groups related by descriptive tags appear in appendix B.</p><h2>Alignment</h2><p>The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster, inspired by its traditional role in the game or real-world folklore. Change a monster's alignment to suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment, in particular, is an invitation for you to consider whether an individual leans toward one of the other alignments.</p><p>Character Creation describes the nine alignments and unaligned creatures.</p><h2>Armor Class</h2><p>A monster's Armor Class (AC) includes its natural armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See the Playing the Game for information on Armor Class.</p><h2>Initiative</h2><p>The Initiative entry specifies the monster's Initiative modifier followed by the monster's Initiative score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you roll to determine a monster's Initiative. A monster's Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity modifier, but some monsters have additional modifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that number.</p><p>If you don't want to roll a monster's Initiative, use the Initiative score as the monster's Initiative in combat. Initiative is further detailed in Playing the Game<em>.</em></p><h2>Hit Points</h2><p>A monster's Hit Points are presented as a number followed by parentheses, where the monster's Hit Point Dice are provided, along with any contribution from its Constitution. Either use the number for the monster's Hit Points or roll the die expression in parentheses to determine the monster's Hit Points randomly; don't use both.</p><table><caption>Hit Dice by Size</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Monster Size</p></th><th><p>Hit Die</p></th><th><p>Average HP per Die</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Tiny</p></td><td><p>d4</p></td><td><p>2½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Small</p></td><td><p>d6</p></td><td><p>3½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium</p></td><td><p>d8</p></td><td><p>4½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Large</p></td><td><p>d10</p></td><td><p>5½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Huge</p></td><td><p>d12</p></td><td><p>6½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gargantuan</p></td><td><p>d20</p></td><td><p>10½</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A monster's size typically determines the die used to calculate its Hit Points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.</p><p>A monster's Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11).</p><p>For more on Hit Points, see Playing the Game<em>.</em></p><h2>Speed</h2><p>The Speed entry specifies a monster's Speed. Some monsters have one or more of the following speeds: Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these specials speeds appear in Rules Glossary.</p><h2>Ability Scores</h2><p>Every monster has six ability scores along with corresponding ability score modifiers and saving throw modifiers. For more information on ability scores and saving throws, see Playing the Game<em>.</em></p><h2>Skills</h2><p>The Skills entry specifies a monster's skill proficiencies, if any. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers might apply.</p><h2>Resistances and Vulnerabilities</h2><p>These entries list a monster's Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any. See Playing the Game for more information.</p><h2>Immunities</h2><p>This entry lists the monster's Immunities, if any. If the monster has damage and condition Immunities, the damage types are listed before the conditions. See Playing the Game for details.</p><h2>Gear</h2><p>Monsters have proficiency with their equipment. If a monster has equipment that can be given away or retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The monster's stat block might include special flourishes that happen when the monster uses an item, and the stat block might ignore the rules in Equipment for that item. When used by someone else, a retrievable item uses its Equipment rules, ignoring any special flourishes in the stat block.</p><p>The Gear entry doesn't necessarily list all of a monster's equipment. For example, a monster that wears clothes is assumed to be dressed appropriately, and those clothes aren't in this entry.</p><p>Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is considered to be supernatural or highly specialized, and it is unusable when the monster is defeated.</p><h3>Ammunition and Ranged Attacks</h3><p>A monster that requires ammunition to make ranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition.</p><h3>Equipping a Monster with Other Items</h3><p>You may equip monsters with additional gear however you like, using the equipment chapter of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000]{Equipment} for inspiration. You decide how much of a monster's equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable.</p><p>Beware of giving a monster combat-oriented magic items, since those might alter the monster's Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic item, the monster can have Attunement with magic items as noted in Equipment. A monster with a class tag after its creature type is considered a member of that class for Attunement purposes.</p><h2>Senses</h2><p>The Senses entry specifies a monster's Passive Perception score, as well as any special senses the monster possesses. Passive Perception and special senses are described in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbAppendixCRule]{Rules Glossary}<em>.</em></p><h2>Languages</h2><p>This entry lists languages that the monster can use to communicate. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can't communicate with it, which is noted in its entry. “None” indicates that a creature doesn't comprehend any language.</p><h3>Telepathy</h3><p>Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. See @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbAppendixCRule]{Rules Glossary} for more information.</p><h2>Challenge Rating</h2><p>Challenge Rating is defined in Rules Glossary, while guidance on using CR to plan potential combat encounters is in<em> </em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.dmgDmsToolbox000]{Gameplay Toolbox}.</p><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>The number of Experience Points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the Experience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is awarded for defeating the monster in combat or otherwise neutralizing it.</p><p>Unless a rule says otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or another magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.</p><table><caption>Experience Points by Challenge Rating</caption><thead><tr><th><p>CR</p></th><th><p>XP</p></th><td></td><th><p>CR</p></th><th><p>XP</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>0</p></td><td><p>0 or 10</p></td><td></td><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>11,500</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1/8</p></td><td><p>25</p></td><td></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>13,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1/4</p></td><td><p>50</p></td><td></td><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>15,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1/2</p></td><td><p>100</p></td><td></td><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>18,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>200</p></td><td></td><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>20,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>450</p></td><td></td><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>22,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>700</p></td><td></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>25,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>1,100</p></td><td></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>33,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>1,800</p></td><td></td><td><p>22</p></td><td><p>41,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>2,300</p></td><td></td><td><p>23</p></td><td><p>50,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>2,900</p></td><td></td><td><p>24</p></td><td><p>62,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>3,900</p></td><td></td><td><p>25</p></td><td><p>75,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>5,000</p></td><td></td><td><p>26</p></td><td><p>90,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>5,900</p></td><td></td><td><p>27</p></td><td><p>105,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>7,200</p></td><td></td><td><p>28</p></td><td><p>120,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>8,400</p></td><td></td><td><p>29</p></td><td><p>135,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>10,000</p></td><td></td><td><p>30</p></td><td><p>155,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Proficiency Bonus</h3><p>A monster's Proficiency Bonus (PB) is determined by its CR, as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table, and is reflected in saving throws, skills, and other statistics where the monster's exceptional aptitude is a factor.</p><table><caption>Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating</caption><thead><tr><th><p>CR</p></th><th><p>PB</p></th><td></td><th><p>CR</p></th><th><p>PB</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>0–4</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td></td><td><p>17–20</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5–8</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td><td></td><td><p>21–24</p></td><td><p>+7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9–12</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td></td><td><p>25–28</p></td><td><p>+8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13–16</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td><td></td><td><p>29–30</p></td><td><p>+9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Traits</h2><p>A monster's traits, if any, are features that are active at all times or in certain situations.</p><aside class=\"notable right four\"><h4>Running a Monster</h4><p>To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its Challenge Rating, follow these rules during combat:</p><p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> If the monster has a special ability that deals a lot of damage but has a limited number of uses, such as a recharging breath weapon or a spell it can cast only once per day, have it use that special ability as quickly and as often as possible.</p><p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> If the monster has Multiattack, have it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which it's not using one of its more powerful abilities.</p><p><strong>Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions.</strong> If the monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions, or Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it uses them as often as it can.</p></aside><h2>Actions</h2><p>A monster can take the actions in this section or take one of the actions available to all creatures, as described in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbPlayingTheGam]{Playing the Game}.</p><h3>Attack Notation</h3><p>The entry for a monster's attack identifies whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise. For details on different kinds of attacks, see Playing the Game and Spells.</p><p><em><strong>Hit.</strong></em> Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the “<em>Hit:</em>” notation.</p><p><em><strong>Miss.</strong></em> If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information follows the “<em>Miss:</em>” notation.</p><p><em><strong>Hit or Miss.</strong></em> If an attack has an effect that occurs regardless of whether it hits or misses its target, that information follows the “<em>Hit or Miss:</em>” notation.</p><h3>Saving Throw Effect Notation</h3><p>If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identifies the kind of save required and then provides the save's DC, a description of which creatures make the save, and an explanation of what happens on a failed or successful save.</p><p>“Half damage only” on a successful save means the target takes half as much damage (round down) as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all other parts of the effect.</p><h3>Damage Notation</h3><p>A stat block usually provides both a number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die expression in parentheses; don't use both.</p><h3>Multiattack</h3><p>Some creatures can make more than one attack when they take the Attack action. Such creatures have the Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a creature can make, as well as any additional abilities it can use, as part of the Attack action.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists the spells and provides the monster's spellcasting ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level.</p><p>A monster's spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a green slaad can cast the <em>Invisibility</em> spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means the spell affects only the slaad.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Components.</strong></em> The Spellcasting trait notes whether the monster's spellcasting ignores the need for certain spell components. If any spell components are required, describe the monster's use of Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that requires Material components has them.</p><p><em><strong>Casting Times of 1+ Minutes.</strong></em> If a spell has a casting time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spellcasting action, the monster doesn't cast the spell in just one action unless the action's description states otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to cast the spell, as described in Rules Glossary.</p><h2>Bonus Action</h2><p>If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are listed in this section. See Playing the Game for details on Bonus Actions.</p><h2>Reactions</h2><p>If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed in this section along with their triggers. See Playing the Game for details on Reactions.</p><h2>Legendary Actions</h2><p>If the monster has Legendary Action options, those are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an action that a monster can take immediately after another creature's turn. Only one of these actions can be taken at a time and only after another creature's turn ends. The monster can't take a Legendary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is otherwise unable to take actions.</p><p>The monster has a limited number of Legendary Action uses, and that number is specified in the stat block. The monster expends one use whenever it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.</p><h2>Limited Usage</h2><p>Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the number of times they can be used. Here are the most common ways that usage is limited:</p><ul><li><p><strong>X/Day.</strong> This notation means the stat block part can be used a certain number of times (represented by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be taken once and that the monster must finish a Long Rest to take it again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recharge X–Y.</strong> This notation means a monster can use the stat block part once. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll 1d6. If the roll is within the number range given in the notation (represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use of that part, which also recharges when the monster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example, “Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can take the action once. Then, at the start of each of the monster's turns, it regains the use of that action if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.</strong> This notation means the monster can use the stat block part once and must then finish a Short or Long Rest to use it again.</p></li></ul>"

This book is intended for Dungeon Masters (DMs) and provides game statistics for monsters: all sorts of creatures—whether friend or foe—controlled by the DM. Those statistics appear in stat blocks. The book presents the monsters' sections alphabetically, with animals gathered in appendix A.

Much of the book contains new or redesigned elements, and the monsters herein replace versions from older books. Here are highlights:</p><p><strong>More Monsters.</strong> The number of monsters has increased to more than 500 stat blocks.</p><p><strong>New Monsters.</strong> Dozens of new monsters, including more high-level threats, are ready to challenge characters of all levels.</p><p><strong>Refined Rules.</strong> Every stat block has been updated for ease of use and game balance.</p><p><strong>Enhanced Stat Blocks.</strong> New stat block design and language prioritize details vital during play.</p><p><strong>Versatile Groups.</strong> Nonplayer characters now appear alongside other monsters and can represent individuals of any Humanoid species.</p><p><strong>Improved Organization.</strong> Monsters are now organized alphabetically by their name. Variations on the same monster are grouped together.</p><p><strong>Expanded Lists.</strong> Appendix B collects and expands lists of monster details that appeared in the 2014 Dungeon Master’s Guide.</p><p>Every monster in the 2014 Monster Manual appears in this book or has a CR-appropriate replacement detailed in appendix B.</p></aside><div class=\"fvtt advice hide-in-embed\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

Any treasure the monster has is incidental.</p></li></ul><p>Any treasure a monster has is in addition to equipment listed in the Gear entry of its stat block.</p><p>The <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> provides more information on monster treasure.</p><h2>Narrative Description</h2><p>After a monster's introductory information come details that apply to the monster wherever it might be found in the multiverse. Customize these details however is appropriate to your adventures.</p><h2>Special Lairs</h2><p>Some monsters alter the regions around their lairs. For such a monster, regional effects are detailed in a lair section.

Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.</p><p>A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p><p>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <em>dispel magic</em>.</p><p>In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.</p><p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.</p><p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.</p><p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.</p>"

The combination of background, species, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination as you ponder your character’s earliest days.</p><h2>Choose a Background</h2><p>Choose your character’s background, and write it on your character sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbBackgroundDes]{Character Origins}, and your GM might offer additional backgrounds as options.</p><p>The background you choose influences step 3, when you determine your character’s ability scores.

Write the feat on your character sheet.</p><p><em><strong>Note Proficiencies.</strong></em> Your background gives proficiency in two skills and with one tool. Record this information on your character sheet.</p><p>Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your class description in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbCharacterClas]{Classes} and note the proficiencies on your character sheet.</p><p>On the sample character sheet, you can indicate proficiency in skills and saving throws by marking the circle next to them.</p><p>The features table in your class description shows your Proficiency Bonus (described in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbD20Tests00000.JournalEntryPage.zU9fgQbLaVbJvPRX]{Playing the Game}), which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this number on your character sheet. You’ll fill in other numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.</p><h2>Choose Starting Equipment</h2><p>Your background and class both provide starting equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can be immediately spent on equipment from @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000]{Equipment}. In addition, you can have one trinket at no cost (see the Trinkets table at the end of this chapter).</p><p>Record your chosen equipment on your character sheet. Equipment is described in \"Equipment\", but for now you can just write it all down and look up the specifics in that chapter later. There’s also space on the sample character sheet to note any coins you have left after purchasing your equipment, as well as treasure you acquire on your adventures.</p><h2>Choose a Species</h2><p>Choose a species for your character. The following species options are detailed in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri]{Character Origins}: @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri.JournalEntryPage.4zCNgk0JSKVzv9Y9]{Dwarf}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri.JournalEntryPage.h9oGyt2Wh9mp0xbg]{Elf}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri.JournalEntryPage.I5mX89tfojsyQmdA]{Halfling}, and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri.JournalEntryPage.8t4u8CWYbxubXflR]{Human}.

Then record your species’ traits.</p><p>Your character’s size and Speed are determined by the character’s species; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet as well (you may write just the first letter of your size).</p><h2>Imagine Your Past and Present</h2><p>Let your character’s background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the character’s present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character:</p><ul><li>Who raised you?</li><li>Who was your dearest childhood friend?</li><li>Did you grow up with a pet?</li><li>Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?</li><li>Did you join an organization, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?</li><li>What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?</li></ul><h2>Choose Languages</h2><p>Your character knows at least three languages: Common plus two languages you roll or choose from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features might also give you languages.</p><p>The Standard Languages table lists languages that are widespread on D&amp;D worlds. Every player character knows Common, which originated in the planar metropolis of Sigil, the hub of the multiverse.

Someone who’s bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.</p><p><em><strong>Chaotic Neutral (CN).</strong></em> Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.</p><p><em><strong>Lawful Evil (LE).</strong></em> Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil.</p><p><em><strong>Neutral Evil (NE).</strong></em> Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.</p><p><em><strong>Chaotic Evil (CE).</strong></em> Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust.

For example, if a character reaches level 8 and increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18, the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The character’s Hit Point maximum then increases by 8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reaching level 8.</li></ol><table id=\"fixed-hit-points-by-class\"><caption>Fixed Hit Points by Class</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Class</p></th><th><p>Hit Points per Level</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Barbarian</p></td><td><p>7 + Con. modifier</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger</p></td><td><p>6 + Con. modifier</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock</p></td><td><p>5 + Con. modifier</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sorcerer or Wizard</p></td><td><p>4 + Con. modifier</p></td></tr></tbody></table><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Bonus Feats at Level 20</h3><p>A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after characters reach level 20 to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain.

          "text": "<p>With each new level, characters acquire new capabilities that equip them to handle greater challenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of the game also changes, and the stakes of the campaign get higher. It’s helpful to think of a character’s (and a campaign’s) arc in terms of four tiers of play, describing the journey from a level 1 character just beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights of level 20. These tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they point to the fact that the play experience evolves as characters gain levels.</p><h3>Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)</h3><p>In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers, though they are already set apart from the broader populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities. They learn their starting class features and choose a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a danger to local farmsteads or villages.</p><h3>Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)</h3><p>In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers. Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplFireball00]{Fireball}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplLightningB]{Lightning Bolt}, and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplRaiseDead0]{Raise Dead}. Most weapon-focused classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in a round. The characters now face dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.</p><h3>Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)</h3><p>In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power that makes them special among adventurers. At level 11, many spell­casters learn reality-altering spells. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or to do more impressive things with those attacks. These adventurers often confront threats to whole regions.</p><h3>Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)</h3><p>At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.</p>"

        "Multiclassing": {
          "name": "Multiclassing",
          "text": "<p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level instead of gaining a level in your current class. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in a single class.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher, since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.</p><h2>Experience Points</h2><p>The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table in this chapter. For example, if you are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a Cleric.</p><h2>Hit Points and Hit Point Dice</h2><p>You gain the Hit Points from your new class as described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit Points for a class only when your total character level is 1.</p><p>Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice are the same die type, you can pool them together. For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5 Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, track them separately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin, for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10 Hit Dice.</p><h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2><p>Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table. For example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue, you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 character, which is +3.</p><h2>Proficiencies</h2><p>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of the new class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each class’s description in Classes.</p><h2>Class Features</h2><p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the information about multiclassing included in each of your classes’ descriptions.</p><p>Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.</p><h3>Armor Class</h3><p>If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor Class, you can benefit from only one at a time. For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Draconic Resilience feature must choose only one of those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless you have a feature that says you can (such as the Fighter’s Two Extra Attacks feature).</p><p>Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invocation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Prepared.</strong></em> You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips).</p><p>Each spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, unless the spell says otherwise.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots. </strong></em>You determine your available spell slots by adding together the following:</p><ul><li>All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes</li><li>Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and Ranger classes</li></ul><p>Then look up this total level in the Level column of the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.</p><p>This table might give you spell slots of a higher level than the spells you prepare. You can use those slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplBurningHan]{Burning Hands}, has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level, you can use the enhanced effect as normal.</p><p>For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when determining your spell slots, counting all your levels as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3 slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells, nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance their effects.</p><p><em><strong>Pact Magic.</strong></em> If you have the Pact Magic feature from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic to cast spells you have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast Warlock spells you have prepared.</p><table><caption><p>Multiclass Spellcaster: <br />Spell Slots per Spell Level</p></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Level</p></th><th><p>1</p></th><th><p>2</p></th><th><p>3</p></th><th><p>4</p></th><th><p>5</p></th><th><p>6</p></th><th><p>7</p></th><th><p>8</p></th><th><p>9</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"

Use the higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For example, if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a 3, use the 3.

Some are better at understanding people’s motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature’s capabilities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels (described in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbCreatingAChar.JournalEntryPage.iHbj5aJvc1T7i5YI]{chapter 2}). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based on its &amp;Reference[challengerating]. The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined.</p><p>This bonus is applied to a &amp;Reference[d20test] when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.</p><table><caption>Proficiency Bonus</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Level or CR</p></th><th><p>Bonus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Up to 4</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5–8</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9–12</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13–16</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17–20</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>21–24</p></td><td><p>+7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>25–28</p></td><td><p>+8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>29–30</p></td><td><p>+9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>The Bonus Doesn’t Stack</h2><p>Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t add it twice if you’re proficient in both skills.</p><p>Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the &amp;Reference[expertise] feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.</p><h2>Skill Proficiencies</h2><p>Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbActions000000]{Actions} later in this chapter) specify which skill applies if you make an ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The GM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.</p><p>If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks involving that skill but doesn’t add its Proficiency Bonus. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the character adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.</p><table><caption>Skills</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Skill</p></th><th><p>Ability</p></th><th><p>Example Uses</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Acrobatics</p></td><td><p>Dexterity</p></td><td><p>Stay on your feet in a tricky situation, or perform an acrobatic stunt.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Animal Handling</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Calm or train an animal, or get an animal to behave in a certain way.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Arcana</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Recall lore about spells, magic items, and the planes of existence.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Athletics</p></td><td><p>Strength</p></td><td><p>Jump farther than normal, stay afloat in rough water, or break something.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Deception</p></td><td><p>Charisma</p></td><td><p>Tell a convincing lie, or wear a disguise convincingly.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>History</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Recall lore about historical events, people, nations, and cultures.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Insight</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Discern a person’s mood and intentions.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intimidation</p></td><td><p>Charisma</p></td><td><p>Awe or threaten someone into doing what you want.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Investigation</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Find obscure information in books, or deduce how something works.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medicine</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Diagnose an illness, or determine what killed the recently slain.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nature</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, and weather.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Perception</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Using a combination of senses, notice something that’s easy to miss.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Performance</p></td><td><p>Charisma</p></td><td><p>Act, tell a story, perform music, or dance.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Persuasion</p></td><td><p>Charisma</p></td><td><p>Honestly and graciously convince someone of something.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Religion</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Recall lore about gods, religious rituals, and holy symbols.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sleight of Hand</p></td><td><p>Dexterity</p></td><td><p>Pick a pocket, conceal a handheld object, or perform legerdemain.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stealth</p></td><td><p>Dexterity</p></td><td><p>Escape notice by moving quietly and hiding behind things.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Survival</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Follow tracks, forage, find a trail, or avoid natural hazards.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Skill List</h3><p>The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes example uses for each skill proficiency as well as the ability check the skill most often applies to.</p><h3>Determining Skills</h3><p>A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in its stat block.</p><h2>Saving Throw Proficiencies</h2><p>Proficiency in a &amp;Reference[savingthrow] lets a character add their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a particular ability.

Wizards, for example, are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves; they train to resist mental assault.</p><h2>Equipment Proficiencies</h2><p>A character gains proficiency with various weapons and tools from their class and background. There are two categories of equipment proficiency:</p><p><strong>Weapons.</strong> Anyone can wield a weapon, but proficiency makes you better at wielding it. If you have proficiency with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.</p><p><strong>Tools.</strong> If you have proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have Proficiency in the skill that’s also used with that check, you have &amp;Reference[advantage] on the check too.

For example, 100 Copper Pieces are worth 1 Gold Piece.</p><p>A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</p><table><caption>Coin Values</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Coin</p></th><th><p>Value in GP</p></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Copper Piece (CP)</p></td><td><p>1/100</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Silver Piece (SP)</p></td><td><p>1/10</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Electrum Piece (EP)</p></td><td><p>1/2</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gold Piece (GP)</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Platinum Piece (PP)</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>"

          "text": "<p>Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.</p><h3>Ammunition</h3><p>You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.</p><h3>Finesse</h3><p>When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><h3>Heavy</h3><p>You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.</p><h3>Light</h3><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.</p><h3>Loading</h3><p>You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><h3>Range</h3><p>A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the long range.</p><h3>Reach</h3><p>A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.</p><h3>Thrown</h3><p>If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.</p><h3>Two-Handed</h3><p>A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p><h3>Versatile</h3><p>A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Improvised Weapons</h3><p>If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised Weapons” in the rules glossary. Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.</p></aside>"

On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both.</p><p>If you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.</p><h2>Carrying Objects</h2><p>You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the GM might require you to abide by the rules for &amp;Reference[carrying capacity].</p><h2>Breaking Objects</h2><p>As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper.

In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, such as an underground dungeon, a wondrous wilderness, or a magic-filled city. It includes a cast of nonplayer characters controlled by the DM.

A short adventure might present only a few challenges and take only one session to complete. A long adventure might involve many combats, interactions, and other challenges and take dozens of sessions.</p><h2>Campaigns</h2><p>A campaign is a series of adventures with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative.</p><p>Some campaigns are episodic, where each adventure is its own tale and not much besides the player characters links it to the next one. Other campaigns involve long-running plots, a cast of recurring NPCs, and themes that span multiple adventures, leading toward a climactic conclusion.</p><p>As with adventures, a DM might create a campaign from scratch, assemble a campaign from published adventures, or mix homemade material with published material.

          "text": "<p>Dice add randomness to the game. They help determine whether characters and monsters are successful at the things they attempt.</p><h2>Dice Notation</h2><p>The dice used in D&amp;D are referred to by the letter <em>d</em> followed by the die’s number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the cube that many games use). The illustration on this page shows what each die looks like.</p><p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, along with any numbers to add or subtract. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p><h3>Percentile Dice</h3><p>The rules sometimes refer to a d100. While such dice exist, the common way to roll 1d100 uses a pair of ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9, known as percentile dice. One die—that you designate before rolling—gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 for the tens digit and a 1 for the ones digit, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.</p><p>Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p><h3>D3</h3><p>The same <em>d</em> notation appears in the expression “1d3,” even though it’s rare to find dice with only three sides. To simulate rolling 1d3, roll 1d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up).</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Rolling Dice in Foundry Virtual Tabletop</h3><p>You can use the dice notation described above to create inline rolls which can be clicked to roll right away no matter how many sides it has. For example, 1d3 can be represented as an inline roll like so [[/r 1d3]] that can be clicked and rolled automatically. You can learn more about how dice work in Foundry in our <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice/\">Dice article</a>.</p></article></section><h2>What Are Dice For?</h2><aside class=\"notable three right\"><h3>Interpreting Die Rolls in the Story</h3><p>Part of the fun of D&amp;D is interpreting what die rolls mean in the story. The randomness that dice bring often introduces the unexpected: an expert fails, a novice succeeds, or any number of other twists. When a D20 Test or another roll produces a surprise, the Dungeon Master often gives a fun description of what happened. If you’re a player, look for opportunities to interpret your character’s die rolls and describe why things unfolded unexpectedly or even humorously.</p></aside><p>Here are the most common uses of dice in D&amp;D.</p><h3>D20 Test</h3><p>The 20-sided die (d20) is the most important die you’ll use in the game. It’s central to the core mechanic—called &amp;Reference[d20test]{D20 Tests}—the game uses to determine whether creatures succeed or fail at the things they attempt during the game (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbD20Tests00000]{D20 Tests}). You roll a d20 whenever your character tries to do something that the DM decides has a chance of both success and failure. The higher your roll, the more likely it is that you succeed.</p><h3>Damage</h3><p>The most common use for dice other than the d20 is to determine damage. When you make a successful attack roll (one kind of D20 Test), you roll damage to see how effective the attack is. When you cast a spell, you might also roll damage. Different weapons and spells use different dice for damage. For example, a Dagger uses 1d4, a Greataxe uses 1d12, and a <em>Fireball</em> spell uses 8d6.</p><h3>Random Tables</h3><p>Occasionally, you’ll see a table that uses a die roll to generate a random result. On these tables, you’ll see a die expression, such as d10 or d100, in the header of the leftmost column. Roll that die, and find the number you rolled (or a range containing that number) in that column. Read across that row for the result. For example, the Trinkets table in chapter 2 uses a d100.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Roll Tables</h3><p>Random tables in Foundry are implemented as <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/roll-tables/\">Roll Tables</a> which can be rolled directly and the result will be sent to the chat. You can check out the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.phbStartingTrink]{Trinkets} roll table as an example.</p><p>When a roll table is embedded directly in a journal entry you can click on the die icon in the top-left to roll it.</p></article></section><h3>Percentage Chances</h3><p>Sometimes you might see a rule describing a percentage chance of something happening. For example, a rule might say there is a 5 percent chance of something happening. You can determine whether that thing happens by rolling percentile dice; if the roll is equal to or less than the percentage chance (a 01 to 05, in this example), it happens.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice hide-in-embed\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/svg/door-locked-outline.svg\" class=\"round\" /></figure><p>This is Free Rules content that isn't covered under the Creative Commons license and may not be re-distributed outside of the game system.</p></div>"

In the specific case of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster what a potion does. Other items might require more experimentation.

For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.</p><h2>Attune during a Short Rest</h2><p>Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short Rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can access its full magical capabilities.</p><h2>No More Than Three Items</h2><p>You can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, you can’t attune to more than one <em>Ring of Protection</em> at a time.</p><h2>Ending Attunement</h2><p>Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement by spending another Short Rest focused on the item unless the item is cursed.</p>"

The DM might make exceptions.</p><h2>Paired Items</h2><p>Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn.

Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle.

Cantrips—simple spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.</p><h3>Spell Slots</h3><p>Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster’s magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.</p><p>When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that’s at least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplMagicMissi]{Magic Missile}, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining.</p><p>Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell slots.</p><h3>Casting without Slots</h3><p>There are several ways to cast a spell without a spell slot:</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.</p><p><strong>Rituals.</strong> Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.</p><p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.</p><p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbagSpellScroll]{Spell Scrolls} and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.</p><h3>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</h3><p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplMagicMissi]{Magic Missile} using a level 2 slot, that Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p><p>Some spells, such as Magic Missile and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplCureWounds]{Cure Wounds}, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.</p>"

An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell’s says otherwise.</p><p><em><strong>Invalid Targets.</strong></em> If you cast a spell on someone or something that can’t be affected by it, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended.</p><p>If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn’t attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>Many spells specify that a target makes a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. Here’s how to calculate the DC for your spells:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell save DC </strong>=<strong> </strong>8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus</p><h3>Attack Rolls</h3><p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell hits a target. Here’s how to calculate the attack modifier for your spells:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your spellcasting ability + your Proficiency Bonus</p><h3>Combining Spell Effects</h3><p>The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplBless00000]{Bless} on the same target, that target gains the spell’s benefit only once; the target doesn’t receive two bonus dice. But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect continues until the duration of the second <em>Bless</em> ends.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Identifying an Ongoing Spell</h3><p>You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To identify it, you must take the Study action and succeed on a [[/check 15 arc]] check.</p></aside>"
