Each player brings a unique perspective to their character through their choices, performance, terrible running jokes, and so on, so it’s fitting that 5th Edition offers a sandbox of options to make each and every character truly unique.</p><p>This chapter expands on the essential character-building choices with purely optional customizations, like Feats and Multiclassing rules. These are fine-toothed tools, capable of rendering both engrossing characters and thinly-veiled engines of powergaming. As such, the GM decides whether the options in this chapter are available in a campaign, and should be given fair leeway to remove options that later become problematic.</p>"

        "Auxiliary Levels": {
          "name": "Auxiliary Levels",
          "text": "<p>Auxiliary levels (or aux levels) are one-level classes that represent a character’s skills and choices, and may be tied to events within the narrative. For example, if a fighter spends his downtime in a large city acting as an enforcer for a thieves’ guild, they might take the Scoundrel auxiliary level when they next level up. Or, if a character’s mind is invaded by an aboleth or they glimpse the hideous Great Old Ones, they might take the Cultist auxiliary level.</p><h2>Using Auxiliary Levels</h2><p>With the GM’s approval, you have the option of gaining an auxiliary level whenever you advance in level after 1st, instead of gaining a level in your current class. An auxiliary level follows the general rules for multiclassing and might require that you meet a prerequisite before taking it. Sometimes these prerequisites are class features which you must gain from a base class, and some are narrative prerequisites that you must work with the GM to accomplish before taking the class.</p><h3>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h3><p>Like any base class, auxiliary levels grant you additional hit points and Hit Dice. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your auxiliary classes to determine your pool of Hit Dice.</p><h3>Proficiencies and Languages</h3><p>An auxiliary level specifies if it grants additional proficiencies or languages when you take it. Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.</p><h2>Animal Master</h2><p>With patience or a bit of magic, you have trained an animal companion to accompany you on your adventures. Few people can become fast friends with a wolf, but it’s hard to undervalue their teeth in a brawl.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong></em> 3rd level</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice</strong></em>: 1d10</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d10 (6) + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Animal Handling</p><h3>Beast Companion</h3><p>Choose a Beast that is no larger than Medium and has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the Beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.</p><p>The Beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the Beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don’t issue a command, the Beast takes the Dodge action. If you gain the Extra Attack feature or another feature that allows you to attack twice when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to command the Beast to take the Attack action.</p><p>If you are incapacitated or absent, the Beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The Beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</p><p>If the Beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours training and bonding with a Beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.</p><h2>Buffoon</h2><p>People assume you’re not very bright. Sure, you stumble sometimes and you forget words, but you’re not dumb! No matter what all those eggheads say. When all else fails, you’ve always got a cutting observation or a really mean name in your back pocket, so they never get the last laugh.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> None</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d8</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Tools:</strong></em> One musical instrument of your choice</p><h3>Bonus Cantrips</h3><p>You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.cdrYKaFi98YWaBMw]{vicious mockery}</em> cantrip and one additional cantrip of your choice from the bard spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><h3>Taunt</h3><p>You can use your bonus action to mock a creature within 15 feet of you. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against a creature other than you before the end of its next turn.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>I Meant to Do That</h3><p>When you roll a 10 or lower on the d20 roll for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Clandestine Caster</h2><p>Discretion is the better part of both valor and incredible arcane might. With some canny trickery, you’ve learned to hide your magic in plain sight, where you might pass as a mighty but otherwise unremarkable warrior, until the moment when you have the upper hand.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d6</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d6 (4) + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Arcana or Deception</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>This auxiliary level counts as a level in your Spellcasting or Pact Magic (if you have a level in such a class) class for the purpose of determining your available spell slots. However, it doesn’t advance your spells known and prepared. For example, if you are a Wizard 2/Clandestine Caster, you have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots, but you only know 1st-level spells.</p><h3>Invisible Cantrips</h3><p>When you cast a cantrip that requires one or more spell attack rolls, you can disguise its casting (including its spell components) and effects as if it were a melee weapon attack. To do this, you must be holding a melee weapon, and must target a creature within 5 feet of you. You don’t have disadvantage on ranged spell attack rolls using this feature as a result of being within 5 feet of a hostile creature. The effects of the spell are completely invisible, appearing as if you instead delivered a mighty blow with the weapon.</p><h3>Subtle Spell</h3><p>You can cast a spell without any somatic or verbal components.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Courier</h2><p>A trader, a smuggler, or merely a messenger, you have been tasked with traveling to and fro delivering parcels, and have become quite adept at it. You’re quick on your feet and have a second sense for navigation matched only by sailors and compass salesmen, and you carry those advantages with you in adventuring.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> Have been employed as a courier, messenger, navigator, smuggler, or trader</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d8</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Languages:</strong></em> One of your choice</p><p><em><strong>Tools:</strong></em> Cartographer’s tools, navigator’s tools, one musical instrument of your choice</p><h3>Able Navigator</h3><p>You can’t become lost except by magical means.</p><h3>Beeline</h3><p>You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Hustle</h3><p>When you take the Dash action, your speed increases by an additional 30 feet.</p><h2>Cultist</h2><p>A dark pact, a black, leather-bound tome, and your fellow hooded acolytes: these are your clearest memories of your indoctrination to the cult, before your mind started to unravel. No matter which terrible, extradimensional being your secret society is dedicated to, its teachings have revealed enigmas of the universe to you and laced your every thought with paranoia.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> Have joined a cult or gained one or more Indefinite Madness traits</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d8</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Languages:</strong></em> One chosen randomly by the GM</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Arcana</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>This auxiliary level counts as a level in your Spellcasting or Pact Magic class (if you have a level in such a class) for the purpose of determining your available spell slots. However, it doesn’t advance your spells known and prepared. For example, if you are a Wizard 2/Cultist, you have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots, but you only know 1st-level spells.</p><h3>Bonus Cantrips</h3><p>You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.VaNECrAvZnLtgWv6]{eldritch orb}</em> cantrip and one additional cantrip of your choice from the warlock spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><h3>Conspiratorial</h3><p>You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition or madness effects on yourself.</p><h3>Lunatic Insight</h3><p>Whenever you make an ability check that doesn’t include your proficiency bonus, your unique insight allows you to make connections which may or may not exist. If the d20 roll for the ability check is even, you add your proficiency bonus to the check.</p><h2>Dragon Acolyte</h2><p>Dragons strike awe and fear into mere mortals who gaze upon them. Many flee in terror, but a few fall to their hands and knees, pledging themselves to their new draconic masters. Such dragon acolytes learn to emulate the great beasts, and eventually to capture a semblance of draconic that might.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> Allied with a dragon or an aspect of the dragon god</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d10</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d10 (6) + your Constitution modifier</p><h3>Draconic Alliance</h3><p>When you gain this level, you become allied with an ancient wyrm or an aspect of the dragon god, who grants you a fraction of their power. You gain resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon, as shown on the Draconic Alliance table below.</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p><table style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;width:618px;border-collapse:collapse;background:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);margin:0.5em 0px\"><thead style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;background:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);color:var(--color-text-light-highlight);text-shadow:1px 1px var(--color-shadow-dark);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\"><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\" colspan=\"2\">Draconic Alliance</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Dragon</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Damage Type</td></tr></thead><tbody style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Black</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Acid</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Blue</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Lightning</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Brass</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Fire</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Bronze</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Lightning</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Copper</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Acid</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Gold</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Fire</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Green</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Poison</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Red</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Fire</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">Silver</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Cold</td></tr><tr style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\"><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px 0.25em 2px\">White</td><td style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;padding:0.25em 0px\">Cold</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:1rem\"></p><h3>Breath Weapon</h3><p>When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). A creature takes [[/r 2d8]] damage of the type associated with your Draconic Alliance on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (3d8), 11th level (4d8), and 17th level (5d8).</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until it recharges. Roll [[/r 1d6]] at the start of each of your turns; the ability recharges when you roll a 6.</p><p>[Should I turn this into a feature?]</p><h3>Claws and Bite</h3><p>You can manifest claws and teeth of crackling draconic magic, which are natural weapons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. On a hit with them, you deal [[/r 1d6]] damage of the type associated with your Draconic Alliance. You can choose to deal slashing damage with the claws or piercing damage with your bite. If you already have natural weapons, you can choose to deal the type associated with your Draconic Alliance instead of its normal damage type.</p><h2>Expert</h2><p>Diligent research and practice has paid dividends. Through months of effort, you’ve mastered new crafts, honed your skills, trained in combat, or even improved your book smarts.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> None</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d8</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Tools:</strong></em> One type of artisan’s tools</p><p><em><strong>Languages:</strong></em> One of your choice</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Choose any two</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>This auxiliary level counts as a level in your Spellcasting or Pact Magic class (if you have a level in such a class) for the purpose of determining your available spell slots. However, it doesn’t advance your spells known and prepared. For example, if you are a Wizard 2/Expert, you have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots, but you only know 1st-level spells.</p><h3>Expertise</h3><p>Choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>You gain proficiency with any three simple or martial weapons of your choice. Additionally, you gain proficiency with light armor. If you already have proficiency with light armor, you gain proficiency with medium armor instead.</p><h2>Hedge Wizard</h2><p>Unlike ordinary wizards who learn their craft through extensive research and formal training, you discovered arcana on your own, reading what you could find and uncovering deeper magic through experimentation. Self-education is not without its merits, however, for you have become exceptionally well versed in the most fundamental spells: cantrips.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d6</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d6 (4) + your Constitution modifier</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>This auxiliary level counts as a level in your Spellcasting or Pact Magic class (if you have a level in such a class) for the purpose of determining your available spell slots. However, it doesn’t advance your spells known and prepared. For example, if you are a Sorcerer 2/Hedge Wizard, you have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots, but you only know 1st-level spells.</p><h3>Cantrip Savant</h3><p>You learn three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. Use your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><h3>Potent Cantrips</h3><p>You can add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage you deal with any wizard cantrip.</p><h2>Priest</h2><p>Though you have not been granted the divine purpose of an adventuring cleric, you have nevertheless been ordained as a priest to one of the many gods. Your lot is that of a quieter life with the church: conducting services, looking after your congregation, performing community rituals, and other administrative duties. Even when whisked off into adventuring, your posture is that of an unassuming reverend, not an evangelizing cleric or crusading paladin.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> Must be ordained by some faith</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d8</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Religion</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>This auxiliary level counts as a level in your Spellcasting or Pact Magic class (if you have a level in such a class) for the purpose of determining your available spell slots. However, it doesn’t advance your spells known and prepared. For example, if you are a Wizard 2/Priest, you have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots, but you only know 1st-level spells.</p><h3>Bonus Cantrips</h3><p>You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8zT7njvqbpXs4Cel]{spare the dying}</em> cantrip and one additional cantrip of your choice from the cleric spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Faith Healing and Turn Undead.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Faith Healing.</strong></em> As an action, you can present your holy symbol and touch a willing Humanoid creature to mend its wounds. The creature rolls a number of d8s equal to half your level (rounded down) and regains that many hit points + your Wisdom modifier. This feature has no effect on Undead or Constructs.</p><p><em><strong>Turn Undead.</strong></em> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p><h2>Pugilist</h2><p>Where other warriors equip themselves with swords and axes, you use your bare knuckles and a poor disposition to bring down your foes. You’ve mastered this unarmed killer edge through hand-to-hand bouts for prize money, pride, or freedom.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> None</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d8</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Choose one from Athletics or Acrobatics</p><h3>Hand-to-Hand</h3><p>Your body is a single deadly weapon, more dangerous and versatile than any sword or arrow. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This damage increases to 1d8 when you reach 5th level, 1d10 when you reach 11th level, and 1d12 when you reach 17th level.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can use your bonus action to add an extra unarmed strike damage die to the damage roll.</span></li></ul><h3>Thick-Skulled</h3><p>When you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage while you have half your hit points or fewer, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled. The damage reduction increases to 1d8 when you reach 5th level, 1d10 when you reach 11th level, and 1d12 when you reach 17th level.</p><h3>Tough Reputation</h3><p>You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks you make against Humanoids that have watched you engage in combat.</p><h2>Relic Keeper</h2><p>Be it a family heirloom or a recovered artifact, you have come into possession of a mysterious weapon. Though its iron is rusted and its wood is stained with blood, an unseen power weights its swing, and you can feel an intelligence echoing within it. Once you bind with it, the weapon is linked with your soul, and it grows in power as you do.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> None</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d10</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d10 (6) + your Constitution modifier</p><h3>Sentient Weapon</h3><p>When you gain this level, you acquire a sentient magic weapon that bonds to your very soul and grows in might as you do. Your weapon is your choice of any martial weapon that lacks the Two Handed property. Once made, this decision can’t be changed.</p><p>You can use your action to summon your sentient weapon to your open hand. You are proficient with it while you wield it.</p><p><em><strong>Magic Weapon.</strong></em> The weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you reach 5th level, your bond with the weapon strengthens, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. At 11th level, your bond strengthens further, and you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Relic Magic.</strong></em> Your relic weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you use the Attack action to make an attack with your relic weapon, you can spend 1 of its charges to make an attack using it as a bonus action.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can siphon some of the energy into the weapon. The next time you hit a creature with the weapon during the next minute, you deal extra force damage equal to twice the spell’s level.</p><p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The weapon is a sentient magic item with an alignment and personality determined by the GM. It has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. The weapon has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can speak, read, and understand Common, as well as communicate with you telepathically.</p><h2>Sellsword</h2><p>Blades-for-hire, mercenaries, sellswords; they go by many names. As a somewhat veteran sellsword, you’ve learned that mercenary work is a volatile business from which only the cautious and cunning can hope to profit. You might have established a set of personal rules or superstitions, or simply gathered a raft of tricks to give you the edge when life and death (and profit) are on the line.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> Have completed at least one contract for mercenary work</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d10</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d10 (6) + your Constitution modifier</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>You gain proficiency with the battleaxe, longsword, trident, and warhammer.</p><h3>Battle Tactics</h3><p>You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called battle dice.</p><p><em><strong>Battle Dice.</strong></em> You have two battle dice, which are d6s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative. Once per turn, you can expend a battle die to perform a maneuver of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Maneuvers.</strong></em> You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Captain class or those available to the Grey Watchman subclass of the warden class.</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em> Some maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><em><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p><h3>Breather</h3><p>You can take a breather, 1 minute of downtime during which you compose yourself and mend your wounds. When you do so, you can spend one Hit Die to regain hit points as if you finished a short rest.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Scoundrel</h2><p>Whether you made some dastardly friends, discovered a love for illicit substances, or merely decided that the law shouldn’t stand in the way of making some coin, you’re in deep with the criminal underworld. You can probably keep your criminal ties under wraps, but you can’t stop looking over your shoulder for fear that the authorities, or worse, your friends might come calling.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></em> Have joined a criminal organization</p><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d8</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points:</strong></em> 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Tools:</strong></em> Thieves’ tools</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Deception, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth</p><h3>Thieves' Cant</h3><p>During your training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p><p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p><h3>Quick Dodge</h3><p>As a bonus action, you can evade the attacks of a creature you can see within 5 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against that creature’s attacks. You must be unarmored or wearing light armor to use this ability.</p><h3>Craven</h3><p>When a creature you can see misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>"

        "Starter Feats": {
          "name": "Starter Feats",
          "text": "<p>As an optional variant rule, the GM can allow players to take one of the following starter feats for free at 1st level. These feats present dramatic background elements and wild variants on the game’s core mechanics, many of which come with equal positives and negatives. Use these feats sparingly, and only for character concepts which can be achieved no other way. The GM says which feats from this list are available in a campaign.</p><h2>Arcane Preparation</h2><p><em>Prerequisite: Spellcasting feature from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard class</em></p><p>Instead of preparing spells normally, you fix each spell slot precisely in your mind, in the manner of wizards long past. When you would prepare spells when you finish a long rest, you record which spell you will use with each of your spell slots, picking from among the spells you could cast using it. These spell slots can’t be expended for any purpose other than casting their assigned spells, but can be recovered and used to cast any spell. Additionally, you gain a bonus spell slot of each level for which you have spell slots, to which you don’t assign a particular spell and can cast normally.</p><p>For example, a 3rd level wizard has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots. Using this feat, the wizard must assign each spell slot to a spell; for example, three 1st-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{magic missiles}</em>, one 1st-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{sleep}</em>, one 2nd-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7u2obDvuvtZBkTfq]{scorching ray}</em>, and one 2nd-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X4c8xCkmF8U9HUMz]{mirror image}</em>. The wizard also has one bonus 1st-level spell slot and one bonus 2nd-level spell slot, through which they can cast any spell they have recorded in their spellbook.</p><h2>Child</h2><p>You are an adolescent, someone who has absolutely no place in the dangerous adventuring life. Perhaps you are destined to change the world and your destiny will not wait for maturity, or perhaps you have thrown your lot in with an adventuring party who has promised to keep you safe from harm. Somehow, you are at the precipice of adventure, and have the following traits:</p><ul><li>Your size is Small, even if your race is normally Medium.</li><li>You have two fewer skill proficiencies than other characters of the same class.</li><li>Your Strength and Constitution scores have a maximum of 16, instead of 20.</li><li>You gain proficiency in two saving throws of your choice.</li></ul><p>@UUID[.WJk1NdaomWdu5dJe]{Sidebar: No Kids Were Harmed in the Making of this Book}</p><h2>Diminutive</h2><p><em>Prerequisite: Medium size</em></p><p>You were born much smaller than others of your race, or simply never grew to full stature. You are Small instead of Medium. Additionally, suffer no penalty for squeezing into a space that is only large enough for a Tiny creature.</p><h2>Dual-Soul</h2><p>Two souls occupy your body, vying for influence and time in control. You maintain two different sets of personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Your souls have different names. Your souls communicate telepathically with one another, but only one soul can be in control of your body at a time. The soul that is not in control of your body can see through your eyes and hear through your ears.</p><p>When you finish a long rest, roll [[/r 1d20]]. On an odd roll, the soul in control of your body switches.</p><p>The two souls within you have different backgrounds, which include different skill and tool proficiencies, as well as different languages. You only have proficiency in these skills and tools, and can only speak languages acquired from a soul’s background while it is in control of your body.</p><h2>Elderly</h2><p>Old age catches us all in the end, and you feel this most keenly in your aching joints as you enter your twilight years. However, you’re not done with a life of adventure. Perhaps dungeon delving has been on your bucket list for decades, and you never got around to it, or perhaps you’re an mercenary that has been taking contracts for longer than your contemporaries have been alive and you have no plans to stop now. Choose or roll for any number of benefits from the following table (even none) and an equal number of drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>[[/r 1d3]]</p><table><thead><tr><td>d3</td><td>Benefit</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>It’s hard to understate your experience. You gain proficiency in the History skill or the Insight skill.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You’ve learned several trades in your life. You gain proficiency in two sets of artisan’s tools of your choice.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Your priorities have become crystal clear. You can always add your proficiency bonus to saving throws against being charmed.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>[[/r 1d3]]</p><table><thead><tr><td>d3</td><td>Drawback</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>You have a bad back. Your lifting and carrying capacity is halved.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You have become forgetful. When you roll a 13 on the d20 for an Intelligence check, treat the d20 roll as a 1.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>You have poor eyesight, which gives you disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Hunted</h2><p>You are pursued by those who would kill you on sight or drag you to an ill-fated end. Perhaps you are fleeing the consequences of a terrible crime, or your name is on the lips of an underworld kingpin. The constant paranoia grants you a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and allows you to instantly awaken whenever a creature moves within 30 feet of you. However, you rarely sleep soundly. Roll [[/r 1d20]] whenever you take a long rest; on a 1, you instead only gain the benefits of a short rest.</p><p>If you are confident that you are permanently freed of your pursuers, such as if you escape to another plane of existence or watch your hunter die, you lose this feat.</p><h2>Impaired Vision</h2><p>Due to injury, illness, or incident of birth, you are unable to see as others can. Instead, you rely on a highly trained sense of hearing, and on aids like white canes to navigate. Your actual condition might range from total blindness to varying types of low vision, which grants you the following traits:</p><ul><li>You have the blinded condition. However, attack rolls don’t have advantage against you due to this condition.</li><li>You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</li><li>You can cast spells that require you to see a target or area, provided that the target or part of the area is within 30 feet, you have a direct line of sight to the target or area, and you can hear the target if it is a creature. If the target or area is further than 30 feet from you, you can make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, you cast the spell normally. On a failure, the spell fails and its spell slot is wasted.</li><li>You are immune to spells and effects, such as a medusa’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsterfeatures.wkIN7WTeX8ebbjtv]{Petrifying Gaze}, that require you to see.</li></ul><p>If your visual impairment is ever remedied, such as through the use of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9kGrFXnLiRg3Xnbo]{regenerate}</em> spell, you lose the benefits of this feat. The GM should discuss with you whether or not removing your impairment is appropriate for your character—it is always a possibility, but never a requirement.</p><h2>Jinxed</h2><p>You were born under an unfortunate star, or were afflicted with a hex that has permanently damaged your luck. Choose a number from 2 to 19. Whenever you roll that number on an ability check or attack roll, the d20 roll becomes a 1. Additionally, when a creature rolls that number on an attack or a contested ability check against you, the d20 roll becomes a 1.</p><h2>Lower Limb Disability</h2><p>Due to injury, illness, or incident of birth, you are unable to walk as others do and must rely on some sort of aid for mobility. The cause might include paralysis, amputation of the leg or foot (congenital or acquired), chronic pain, muscular dystrophy, conditions which affect your respiration or balance, or a host of other factors. Because of this, you possess the following traits:</p><ul><li>You rely on some sort of aid to stand and move. This can include, but is not limited to, crutches, a wheelchair or similar wheeled contraption, or a mechanical or magical apparatus that helps support your weight. Work with the GM to decide which sort of aid works best in the campaign world.</li><li>You can’t take the Dash action on difficult terrain.</li><li>You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to knock you prone or move you against your will.</li></ul><p>If your mobility disability is ever remedied, such as through the use of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9kGrFXnLiRg3Xnbo]{regenerate}</em> spell, you lose the benefits of this feat. The GM should discuss with you whether or not removing your disability is appropriate for your character—it is always a possibility, but never a requirement.</p><h2>Prophesied</h2><p>Your future—or at least a moment of it—has been precisely foretold. Perhaps a fortune-teller saw into your future and told you the exact moment of your death, or maybe you were born in accordance with a great prophecy that will unveil itself throughout your life. Choose the prophecy that has been made of your future and share it with the GM. If or when this prophecy comes true, you do not roll attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws for the duration of the prophesied events, as they have already been fixed; the GM decides the results of your rolls instead.</p><h2>Secret</h2><p>When you gain this feat, choose one falsehood about yourself that you practice until you can recite it perfectly. This falsehood can be a single lie or an entire false history. You never need to make a Deception check for this falsehood.</p><h2>Soul Twin</h2><p>You were born as a pair of soul twins, identical twins that share a single soul and act as an extension of one another. These twins function as a single character with two bodies, which you control.</p><p><em><strong>Actions.</strong></em> Your twins share a single action, bonus action, and reaction between them, each of which can be taken only once by one of the twins on your turn. If you take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, or Search actions, both twins perform the action and gain its benefits.</p><p><em><strong>Attacks.</strong></em> If you take the attack Action to attack with one twin, the other twin can attack as a bonus action. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you’re able to make multiple attacks, you can divide these attacks between the twins.</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points.</strong></em> Soul twins have separate hit points, which are divided between them. At 1st level, each twin has the hit points of a character of the same class. At higher levels, each soul twin’s hit point maximum increases by your Constitution modifier + half a roll of the class’s Hit Die (rounded up). If you use the average value instead of rolling the Hit Die, each twin gains 2 for a d6 class, 3 for a d8 class, 3 for a d10 class, 4 for a d12 class.</p><p>When you spend Hit Dice following a short rest, you must spend the dice separately on each twin.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting.</strong></em> A pair of soul twins can only concentrate on one spell at a time. However, only one of the twins needs to concentrate on a spell to maintain it. When you cast a spell which requires concentration, you choose which twin is concentrating on it.</p><p>When casting a spell, either twin can provide the spell components, and the spell can originate from the twin of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Magical Effects.</strong></em> If a spell or magical ability affects one soul twin, it affects them both, unless that spell or ability affects hit points, or if the two twins are further than 100 feet apart. In either case, it affects each twin separately.</p><p><em><strong>Conditions.</strong></em> A condition, such as being poisoned or grappled, affects only one twin, even if imposed by a spell.</p><p><em><strong>Death.</strong></em> When a soul twin is reduced to 0 hit points and begins to make death saving throws, the other twin becomes incapacitated and its speed is halved. If a soul twin dies, the other twin quickly begins to deteriorate, and perishes 24 hours later if their partner doesn’t return to life.</p><p><em><strong>Empathic Link.</strong></em> As long as both twins are on the same plane, they can empathetically sense the other’s emotional state. Each twin knows when the other takes damage.</p><p>@UUID[.aIzbtVkurmaVmQQJ]{Sidebar: Soul Twins}</p><h2>Survivor</h2><p>In ways few can compare, you have seen the ferocity of battle, the wickedness of people, or the cruel coldness of the world. Your experiences have marked you with aching traumas and invaluable lessons of survival, granting the following traits:</p><ul><li>You lose proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.</li><li>When you fall to 0 hit points and begin to make death saving throws, you must fail 5 saving throws to die.</li></ul><h2>Traveler</h2><p>You hail from a place so far distant that you may never see home again. Perhaps you are lost in the planes of existence, displaced in time, or shunted to a strange new reality. Perhaps your true home merely lies on the other side of the vast ocean. Regardless, you know very little of this land, its history, or its people, and they also know very little of you. This results in the following traits:</p><ul><li>You have disadvantage on Intelligence (History) checks pertaining to this new land’s history or customs.</li><li>You can communicate simple ideas to any creature that understands at least one language using universal gestures and some creativity.</li></ul><h2>Undead</h2><p>You are caught in the limbo of undeath, being neither dead nor truly alive. You may be a conventional type of Undead creature, like a revenant returned to life for vengeance or a lich that has bound their soul to a phylactery, or you might be something unique, the result of a curse or a freak magical accident. Regardless, you now walk the mortal realm with the following traits:</p><ul><li>You do not need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You must still spend 8 hours doing light activity, such as keeping watch in order to gain the benefits of a long rest.</li><li>You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the poisoned condition on yourself, and you have resistance against poison damage.</li><li>Though your type is Humanoid, spells and effects which specifically affect Undead affect you as well.</li></ul><h2>Upper Limb Disability</h2><p>Due to injury, illness, or incident of birth, you are unable to use your arms as others can. The cause might include partial paralysis, amputation of the arm or hand (congenital or acquired), lack of manual dexterity, arthritis, chronic pain, or a host of other factors.</p><p>Even if you are missing an arm or hand, you can still engage in two-weapon fighting or wield a sword and shield at the same time through the use of prosthetics or a mechanical or magical apparatus that helps you grasp and hold objects.</p><p>The nature of your limb disability might vary, so you gain one of the following traits of your choice, as appropriate to your disability:</p><ul><li>You have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons and Strength checks that require use of your hands.</li><li>You have disadvantage on attack rolls with finesse and ranged weapons, and Dexterity checks that require use of your hands.</li></ul><p>However, your learned resourcefulness knows no bounds. You have advantage on weapon attacks you prepare with the Ready action.</p><p>If your limb disability is ever remedied, such as through the use of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9kGrFXnLiRg3Xnbo]{regenerate}</em> spell, you lose the benefits of this feat. The GM should discuss with you whether or not removing your disability is appropriate for your character—it is always a possibility, but never a requirement.</p>"

You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.</p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p><h3>Unarmored Defense</h3><p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Known and Prepared.</strong></em> You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.</p><p>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, necromancer, sorcerer, witch, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. If your subclass offers a spellcasting table identical to that of the House of Bishops warmage or the Soulblood Shaman warden, add one third of that class’s level (rounded down) to the total. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the @UUID[.81XTwJ9ppcvQKgSe]{Multiclass Spellcaster table}.</p><p>If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.5SuJewoa1CRWaj1F]{burning hands}</em>, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level.</p><p>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots.

There is no indoctrination to the fighters, no test, and no badge of honor. When you have proven yourself to be worthy of your steel and unshakable in the face of any danger, your comrades-in-arms will welcome you as an equal. Your battle scars mark you out as a true fighter.</p><p>No two fighters are the same. Some strike with shields and spears, others with bare fists, others still with lightning and flames dancing on their blades. At best, fighters are categorized in broad archetypes, representing their tactics and mettle, if not their unique brand of warfare. Such distinctions are flimsy in the eyes of fighters, however. To them, there are only two true types of warriors: the victorious and the dead.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Fighter Subclasses</td></tr><tr><td>Martial Archetype</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.Ec4z1lTdShvjpFlw#bone-knight]{Bone Knight}</td><td>Manipulates their skeleton to sprout weapons and armor of bone</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Ec4z1lTdShvjpFlw#brawler]{Brawler}</td><td>A bare-knuckle fighter that wrestles and delivers staggering punches</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Ec4z1lTdShvjpFlw#celestial-lancer]{Celestial Lancer}</td><td>Leaps dozens of feet into the sky and comes crashing down, lance first</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Ec4z1lTdShvjpFlw#corsair]{Corsair}</td><td>A dexterous swashbuckler, as dangerous as they are charming</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Ec4z1lTdShvjpFlw#dungeoneer]{Dungeoneer}</td><td>A veteran of dungeon survival that knows every trick in the book</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Ec4z1lTdShvjpFlw#mage-hand-magus]{Mage Hand Magus}</td><td>Manipulates a pair of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hands}</em> to fight at range with levitating weapons</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Bone Knight</h2><p>A bone knight, or an <em>osteoth</em>, is a warrior that has undergone an agonizing transmutation ritual, granting them the ability to fully control their bones. While this power is plainly disfiguring, it allows them to grow bone protrusions for weapons and armor, changing their skeleton’s size and shape at will. Mastering this ability is a feat of endurance and creativity, resulting in a fighter whose most powerful weapon is not sheathed at their side, but sheathed within their flesh.</p><p>Many fighters believe the osteoth ritual is a mere myth, a flight of fancy traded around campfires. And yet, the process is indeed real, preserved among moldering tomes and in the minds of deranged wizards. With some resourcefulness, the procedure can be replicated with the contents of any alchemist’s lab, with a generous fatality rate of nearly half.</p><h3>Adamant Ivory</h3><p>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can sprout boney plates from your skin. While you aren’t wearing armor, this natural armor provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p><p>Additionally, when you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to shield yourself from harm. Expend a Hit Die, roll it, and decrease the damage taken by the number rolled.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Adamant Ivory</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter Level</td><td>Armor Class</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Bone Blades</h3><p>Also 3rd level, you can sprout blades of jagged bone from each of your palms or wrists as you would draw a weapon. These bone weapons have your choice of the statistics of a longsword, shortsword, or scimitar. You can’t be disarmed of these weapons. You can retract these weapons as you would sheathe a weapon.</p><p>Starting at 7th level, your blades are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Additionally, once per turn when you hit a creature with a bone weapon, you can expend a Hit Die to extend the bone into the target. Add the Hit Die and your Constitution modifier to the weapon’s damage roll.</p><h3>Hardy Constitution</h3><p>By 7th level, your bones and their marrow have grown more robust, granting you a formidable healing factor. You regain all of your expended Hit Dice, rather than half of them, when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Restructure</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can shift your skeletal structure as an action to transform your appearance. When you do so, you determine the specifics of the changes, including adjusting your height and weight, the shape of your face, the presence or absence of your teeth, your posture, and so on. You can even change your size from Medium to Small or vice versa. The extent of these changes only extends to your bone structure: you can’t change your skin color, hair length, or clothing using this ability.</p><h3>Improved Ivory</h3><p>By 15th level, your bones are as hard as steel and as pliant as copper. When you expend a Hit Die to use your Adamant Ivory feature to reduce damage or use your Bone Blades feature to deal additional damage, you can expend two Hit Dice at once. You subtract the total from the bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage you take, or add the total and your Constitution modifier to the weapon’s damage roll, respectively.</p><h3>Master Osteoth</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, when you roll initiative and have fewer than half your Hit Dice, you regain 1d6 Hit Dice. Additionally, on your turn, you can expend 3 Hit Dice to regain a use of your Second Wind feature, or expend 8 Hit Dice to regain a use of your Action Surge feature (no action required).</p><h2>Brawler</h2><p>Brawlers use their bare fists and raw force as their first and best weapons in combat. Such warriors come from tough stock—prize fighters, outlanders, bouncers, and veterans—and have learned to hone their bodies into implements of war. Wherever a brawler goes, bruised and broken bodies follow. It doesn’t matter whether they’re tossing thugs around a tavern or going toe-to-toe with a red dragon, brute force always comes out on top.</p><h3>Brawling</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you’ve mastered a brutal, bloody-knuckle style of combat. You are proficient with improvised weapons and treat one-handed improvised weapons as if they had the Thrown (range 20/60) property.</p><p>Additionally, while you are unarmed or wielding an improvised weapon and you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armor, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You can use your Strength instead of your Dexterity when determining your AC.</li><li>Your unarmed strikes and improvised weapons deal improved damage and improve as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the following table.</li></ul><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Fighter Level</td><td>Damage</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>1d8</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>1d10</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>1d12</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Starting at 7th level, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h3>Brute Force</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can maneuver your opponents to gain a ruthless edge in combat. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or a melee attack using an improvised weapon, you can use your bonus action to attempt to grapple the target or deal an extra 1d6 damage.</p><p>This damage increases as you gain higher levels in this class. At 5th level, the extra damage you deal increases to 1d8 damage, at 11th level it increases to 1d10 damage, and at 17th level, it increases to 1d12 damage.</p><h3>Imposing Physique</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you learn to speak more with your prodigious muscles instead of your words. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill, and you can use your Strength bonus instead of your Charisma bonus for Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Additionally, your capacities for carrying, lifting, pushing, and pulling are doubled.</p><h3>Haymaker</h3><p>At 10th level, you can put all your force into one blow. When you use the Attack action on your turn to make an unarmed strike, you can choose to forgo any additional attacks you could make with your action to make a single, devastating blow. For each attack you would give up in this way, you can add two extra damage dice to the attack’s damage roll.</p><h3>Owlbear Wrestler</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, you’ve learned how to pin down even the most towering foes. You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to grapple creatures of Large size and smaller, and you can attempt to grapple creatures of any size category.</p><h3>Skullbreaker</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, your blows are able to rattle even the greatest of foes. Once on each of your turns when you deal damage to a creature with an unarmed strike or an improvised weapon, you can choose to shatter their resolve. You gain resistance to any damage that creature deals to you until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Celestial Lancer</h2><p>Feared frontline warriors bearing lances and unique, streamlined armor, Celestial Lancers are famous for their Meteor Jump, a supernatural technique taught only to the rare few. The lancers trace their origins back to an order of dragon hunters who learned to leap above diving dragons and pin their wings with a swift, downward lance strike. This technique, combined with a suite of mystical powers drawn from the yawning sky, makes the lancers decisive warriors in the arena of vertical combat. Though Celestial Lancers may be hampered in claustrophobic dungeons, they excel underneath the open sky, where they can leap high and come crashing down for devastating impacts.</p><h3>Lance Specialty</h3><p>Beginning when you select this archetype at 3rd level, when you wield a lance, you do not suffer disadvantage when attacking creatures within 5 feet of you. However, you must still wield a lance two handed when not mounted.</p><h3>Meteor Jump</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can perform a supernaturally high leap. Once on each of your turns, you can use 20 feet of your movement to perform a high jump reaching 10 feet in height. You don’t need to move 10 feet immediately before making this jump, and don’t provoke opportunity attacks while jumping or falling. You can land within 10 feet of where you began. At the end of a fall, subtract 10 feet from the distance you fell when calculating your falling damage.</p><p>The height you can jump and the distance you subtract when you fall increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Meteor Jump table below.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Meteor Jump</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter Level</td><td>Jump Height</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>10 feet</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>20 feet</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>30 feet</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>40 feet</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Plunging Attack</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can direct the momentum of gravity into your strike. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack while falling, you can add 1d6 to the damage roll for every 10 feet you fell, up to a maximum of 5d6.</p><h3>Apex Moment</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you gain the mystical ability to hang at the peak of your jump before you come plunging back down. When you use your Meteor Jump ability, you can choose to hover until the start of your next turn instead of falling immediately. When you do so, you can’t use your Meteor Jump on your next turn.</p><h3>Earthshaker</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, at the end of a fall of 20 feet or higher, you can use a bonus action to strike the earth like a meteor. Each creature in contact with the ground within 10 feet of where you land must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Celestial Aura</h3><p>By 15th level, you can draw mystical power from your connection to the open sky. When you use your Second Wind feature, you and each friendly creature you choose within 10 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your fighter level.</p><h3>Comet Strike</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you plummet wreathed in flames like a devastating meteor. When you use your Earthshaker ability, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 4d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success. Additionally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Earthshaker feature left, you regain one use of that feature.</p><h2>Corsair</h2><p>The wide-open ocean, the salty breeze, and the freedom of a ship—these are the things a corsair values more than anything else. Though an archetypal corsair is no less trained than their military counterparts, they prefer a more swashbuckling, charismatic approach to life, and take well to privateering, smuggling, exploring, and other self-directed work.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Sleight of Hand skill, if you did not already have proficiency.</p><h3>Surprise Attack</h3><p>At 3rd level, you’ve learned to strike foes when they least expect it. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p><p>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p><p>The amount of extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class. At 7th level, this damage increases to 2d6, at 11th level, this damage increases to 3d6, and at 15th level, this damage increases to 4d6.</p><h3>Commandeer</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can replace one of your attacks with an attempt to steal an item being carried by another creature. You can’t attempt to steal an object that is being worn as clothing or armor, nor can you steal an object that is being held in one of the target’s hands. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, opposed by the target’s AC. On a success, you successfully steal that object. You must have a free hand to use this ability.</p><h3>Three Sheets</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, whenever you use your Second Wind ability, you can also take the Dash or Disengage action as part of the same bonus action.</p><h3>Charmed Life</h3><p>By 10th level, you can saunter into trouble and make it out unscathed thanks to your considerable luck. You can gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that uses Dexterity or Charisma.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Slippery Positioning</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, whenever a hostile creature that you can see within 60 feet moves, you can move 5 feet without using your reaction or provoking opportunity attacks. On each round, you can use this ability a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p><h3>Untouchable Swordsman</h3><p>By 18th level, you are legendary with a cutlass. Whenever you hit a creature with your Surprise Attack, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Dungeoneer</h2><p>Only fools would dive headfirst into an abandoned crypt filled with monsters and deathtraps, but it seems only fools emerge from such crypts laden with as much loot as they can carry. The archetypal dungeon delver is a veteran of such suicidal dungeon delves, and has become intimately familiar with the hazards therein. In the course of their adventures, such a dungeoneer will have adopted countless best practices, along with a litany of unproven superstitions which they believe keeps them alive. Principles from “always be the first one to hit the monster” to “never be the first one to touch a treasure chest” line a dungeoneer’s journal. However, it’s probably better to be paranoid and superstitious than lying at the bottom of a pit trap, incinerated by a <em>fireball</em>, or digested by a mimic.</p><h3>Danger Sense</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p><h3>Kick in the Door</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you know how to charge through each chamber of a dungeon and come out alive. You have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, when you are not surprised and you initiate combat by kicking down a door, diving in from overhead, crashing through a window, or any other suitably reckless tactic (as adjudicated by the GM), you have advantage on attacks against creatures you can see during the first round of combat.</p><h3>Dungeoneer's Intuition</h3><p>By 7th level, you have a sixth sense for the unique hazards present in a dungeon. You have advantage on ability checks you make to detect shapechangers, traps, and unseen magical effects, and can make a check to detect such hazards even if you would not normally make such a check.</p><h3>Monster Kill</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, when you hit an Aberration, Fey, Fiend, Monstrosity, Ooze, or Undead with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra die of damage to the target. You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Lethality Prevention</h3><p>By 15th level, you are a foremost expert in avoiding death. Whenever you would take more than 50 damage in a single turn, but the damage wouldn’t kill you outright, you instead take only 50 damage.</p><h3>Avoidance</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h2>Mage Hand Magus</h2><p>Blades sweeping around in dramatic arcs, propelled by ghostly, disembodied hands—the Mage Hand Magi are truly a force to be reckoned with. While wizards are content to use <em>mage hand</em> to retrieve their wands and open doors from across the room, the cantrip’s potential has always been clear for warriors: a deft <em>mage hand</em> can afford dozens of feet between a soldier and their foe, letting them deal a killing blow without raising a fingertip. Mage Hand Magi have mastered this cantrip through practice and discipline, elaborating a trick pioneered by warmages into a deadly fighting style of twin hovering blades. The most skilled can even manifest a warhand, a grand fist of magical wrath with which to crush their enemies.</p><h3>Mage Hand Master</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, when you choose this archetype, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hand}</em> cantrip if you did not know it before. You can cast it with the following improvements:</p><ul><li>You can cast and control <em>mage hand</em> as a bonus action.</li><li>You summon two separate hands when you cast it, and you can control one or both of them when you use the spell.</li><li>The spell’s duration is indefinite, ending only when you are knocked unconscious or you choose to end it.</li><li>Your <em>mage hands</em> are stronger than normal, capable of lifting a combined weight in pounds equal to 5 × your fighter level, and they are dexterous enough to perform any ability check you could normally perform with your hands.</li></ul><h3>Combat Hands</h3><p>At 3rd level, you have learned to use your mage hands in combat. While you are holding nothing in your hands, your <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hands}</em> can wield weapons: each can wield a single one-handed weapon, or together they can wield a two-handed weapon.</p><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one or more of your attacks through your <em>mage hands</em> against targets you can see within their reach. You can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls. A <em>mage hand</em> not wielding a weapon can be used to punch a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 1d6 force damage on a hit.</p><h3>Handy Maneuvers</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hands}</em> to perform a number of combat maneuvers or tricks. While they aren’t wielding weapons, you can use both of your hands together to grapple or shove a creature. When you do so, you add your Intelligence modifier to the Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack with one of your hands when a creature leaves its reach.</p><h3>Warhand</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, when you cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hand}</em>, you can form one of them into a much more powerful construct called a warhand. Your warhand is identical to the hand summoned by the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.a2KJHCIbY5Mi4Dmn]{arcane hand}</em>, except that you must use its abilities as an action instead of a bonus action. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell. When you use any of the warhand’s abilities, you can use a bonus action to make a single attack with your other <em>mage hand</em>.</p><h3>Handglide</h3><p>By 15th level, while two summoned <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hands}</em> or a warhand are within 5 feet of you, the hands can hold you aloft and carry you to your destination. You have a flight speed equal to your walking speed while the hands carry you.</p><h3>Heavy Handed</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can summon two warhands instead of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hands}</em> when you cast the <em>mage hand</em> spell. You can use the abilities of both warhands as part of the same action on your turn.</p>"

Their music is directed toward the heavens, with their instruments usually relating in some way to the god that they worship. Cantors are well loved within their respective communities, and it is hard to find a talented cantor who will stay in one place for long, as the demand for their soothing hymns is widespread.</p><h3>Heavenly Voice</h3><p>When you choose this college at 3rd level, you gain the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MUO1uYN7JR1hm4dR]{thaumaturgy}</em> cantrip, which counts as a bard spell for you and doesn’t count against the number of cantrips you can learn.</p><h3>Healing Hymn</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher which restores hit points to one or more creatures, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to bolster that healing. Each creature that regains hit points adds a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus half your bard level to the number of hit points regained.</p><h3>Angelic Chorus</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, your heavenly music empowers those who join in its chorus. You can create the following additional effects when using the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MUO1uYN7JR1hm4dR]{thaumaturgy}</em> cantrip:</p><ul><li>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you can use the Help action to aid two allies. If you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.</li><li>You ward a willing creature you can see within 30 feet with a shimmering golden radiance for up to 1 minute. Only one creature can be warded using this ability at a time. When an attacker within 5 feet of the warded creature hits it with an attack, the creature can use its reaction to deal radiant damage equal to half your bard level to the attacker.</li></ul><h3>Song of the Divines</h3><div><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your Healing Hymn ability without expending uses of your Bardic Inspiration.</p><h2>College of Graffiti</h2><p>To many, the College of Graffiti is a nuisance, a band of hooligans that vandalize the city with no regard for the law. But bards who learn to tag know that graffiti is the single greatest art form. Graffiti artists use the entire city as their canvas, placing murals of inspiration where everyone can see them and personal tags where few will notice. Theirs is a bold, creative endeavor that, while illegal, breathes vibrancy into the city and emboldens those within it.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>Starting when you choose this college at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with painter’s supplies and in your choice of the Stealth or Sleight of Hand skill.</p><h3>Street Art</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.7EeDzlvDp3ZS3gwi]{tag}</em> cantrip, which counts as a bard cantrip for you, but doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p>When you cast the <em>tag</em> cantrip, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to spray out a mural. For the next minute, you and all friendly creatures within 30 feet of the mural that can see it gain a +1 bonus to ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. You can use this ability again and expend more uses of Bardic Inspiration to expand this mural further, increasing the bonus by 1 each time, up to a maximum of +3.</p><h3>Signature Mark</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can paint a target on a creature’s back. As a bonus action, you attempt to magically spray a signature mark directly onto a creature you can see within 5 feet of you. Make a melee spell attack roll against that creature. On a hit, the creature is marked. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature you have marked with a melee weapon attack, you can add 1d8 to the damage roll. Additionally, when a friendly creature makes an attack against a creature you have marked, you can use your reaction to grant advantage on the attack roll.</p><p>As an action, a creature can wash itself with soap or remove its armor or outermost clothing to remove its tag.</p><h3>Kaleidoscopic Spray</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, as an action, you can let loose a flurry of magical paint, coating every surface. Each creature you choose in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Each creature in the area is marked by you, whether or not it succeeds its saving throw.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>College of Jesters</h2><p>Consummate humorists, acrobats, and orators, bards of the College of Jesters can often be found in royal courts and livening up the local tavern. These bards specialize in truth through biting humor, rather than stories or sonnets, and compliment their razor wits with acrobatic stunts and other feats of showmanship. When among nobility, jesters offer off-kilter wisdom and fierce satire in equal measures. Among their peers, jesters make fine companions, as long as you can take a joke.</p><h3>Raconteur</h3><p>When you join this college at 3rd level, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.cdrYKaFi98YWaBMw]{vicious mockery}</em> cantrip if you don’t already know it. You can spend a use of your Bardic Inspiration when a creature fails a saving throw against your <em>vicious mockery</em> to add a roll of the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier to the damage roll. If a creature fails its saving throw against your <em>vicious mockery</em> by 5 or more, it also has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes before the start of its next turn.</p><h3>Advanced Tumbling</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can move through the space of any creature by performing acrobatic bounds and flips. Once you have moved through a creature’s space, that creature has disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you until the end of your turn.</p><h3>Juggling</h3><p>By 6th level, you are a renowned and daring juggler. You can use your bonus action to start juggling a number of thrown weapons up to twice your proficiency bonus. Once on each of your turns, when you take the Attack action to throw a weapon, move out of a creature’s reach, or cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.cdrYKaFi98YWaBMw]{vicious mockery}</em> cantrip, you can make one ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see using one of your juggled weapons.</p><h3>Grand Finale</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can perform a climactic stunt, conclude a stirring oration, or bring a song to a close with pizzazz. When you use this feature, you can take one additional action. You can’t use this feature on the first round of combat. Once you use this feature, you can’t take actions or bonus actions on your following turn.</p><h2>College of the Mad God</h2><p>In the middle of the night, you hear the music. It begins the same way every time, rising from a low drone into a deafening cacophony. The noise is maddening. In your waking hours, your fingers learn to imitate this melody and bring others to your level of psychosis.</p><p>Some attribute the dreadful nightmares to a curse or stress, but you know better. You and others like you are called nightly by the beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes, the sounds of a mad god who echoes the pandemonium of the universe, and summons you to do something. You know not what.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you join this college at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one skill, which is selected for you by the GM. Whenever you finish a long rest, your GM can change this selection.</p><h3>Cacophony</h3><p>By 3rd level, the discordant sounds of your instrument can drive others to tears and utter madness. Once on each of your turns, when a creature fails an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against one of your bard spells or features while you are holding an instrument, you can expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to play a cacophonous noise. A deafened creature is immune to this effect. Choose one of the following effects:</p><ul><li>The creature takes psychic damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.</li><li>The creature is deafened and can’t speak until the end of its next turn.</li><li>The creature moves up to 10 feet in a direction you choose. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</li></ul><h3>Frenzied Strings</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, as an action, you can play a mind-infecting tune for a creature within 60 feet that can hear you. This creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frenzied for up to 1 minute. The creature can repeat this saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>A frenzied creature loses the ability to distinguish between friend and foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. While frenzied, the creature chooses the targets for its attacks, spells, and abilities randomly from among the creatures it can see within range, and it must make an opportunity attack if any creature provokes one.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Mad Melody</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to begin playing the accursed melody which haunts your dreams. On each of your subsequent turns, you can use your action to continue the melody. Only creatures you choose within 60 feet of you can hear the melody; all other creatures hear it as discordant noise. Even deafened creatures can hear the haunting melody.</p><p>When you use your action to play the melody, a creature that can hear the melody must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes psychic damage and suffers an additional effect based on the number of consecutive turns you have been playing the melody, as shown on the Mad Melody table. After four consecutive rounds, or if no creature hears the melody for one round, the melody begins again at the first round.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Mad Melody</td></tr><tr><td>Round</td><td>Psychic Damage</td><td>Effect</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>4d8</td><td>The target is deafened.</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>7d8</td><td>The target can’t speak and has disadvantage on ability checks.</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>4d8</td><td>The target is charmed by you until the end of its turn.</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>9d8</td><td>—</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>College of Masks</h2><p>Bards in the College of Masks (the masters of masks, as they have come to be called) are virtuoso performers who practice becoming the figure they portray, rather than merely imitating them. Bards who join in this college come to believe that all life is performed, rather than lived, and that to become an actor in this Great Play requires that one merely put on the metaphorical mask of another. To engage in this great stage drama, a master of masks carries with them a number of masks, each a potent magical artifact of a specific archetypal character or creature to allow them to better enter those roles.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3><p>When you join the College of Masks at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill.</p><h3>Persona Masks</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to craft potent magical masks, each of which allows you to take on a different persona and gain some aspect of that archetypal character. You gain two Persona Masks of your choice. You gain an additional mask at 6th level (3 masks) and another one at 14th level (4 masks). You can exchange a mask you have for another mask whenever you gain a level in this class. If one of your masks is lost or stolen, you can remake the mask with 8 hours of work and 100 gp in materials.</p><p>You can put on a mask or switch masks as a bonus action. Only you can gain the effects of your Persona Masks.</p><p>Beginning at 6th level, some of your persona masks improve and gain additional abilities.</p><h3>Hidden Persona</h3><p>By 6th level, you wear the masks of others wherever you go, even when others can’t see it. You can use your bonus action to cause a mask you are wearing to become invisible or return to visibility.</p><h3>Master of Many Faces</h3><p>At 14th level, you have become a master of assuming the archetypes contained within the masks. You can wear two masks simultaneously, gaining the benefits of each.</p><h2>Persona Masks</h2><p>The following masks are listed alphabetically.</p><h3>Angel</h3><p>An alluring, serene face gazes out of this mask of flawless alabaster. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal additional radiant damage to the target equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Archmage</h3><p>This clay mask bears exaggerated wrinkles and the scowl of a cantankerous old man. You know the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.EOmsUcFQJTfG2oio]{fire bolt}</em> cantrip, as well as the spells shown on the table below.

As a reaction, when you take damage from a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal fire damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die to the creature.</p><h3>Dragon</h3><p>Painted cloth forms the scales, horns, eyes, flowing whiskers, and teeth of a multihued dragon’s head. While you wear this mask, you can use your action and expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to exhale destructive energy. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes fire damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><h3>Faceless</h3><p>Two perfectly round eyeholes stare out of this otherwise featureless porcelain mask. While you wear this mask, you can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.A3q2gTNqG6fvNGrv]{disguise self}</em> without expending a spell slot or material components.</p><h3>Fool</h3><p>This porcelain mask of a grinning jester is adorned with bells, ribbons, and vibrant checkerboard paints. While you wear this mask, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you can take the Disengage action as a bonus action.</p><p><em><strong>Improvement.</strong></em> Beginning at 6th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action.</p><h3>Gladiator</h3><p>This grim metal helm, pockmarked and scratched, conceals the entire face. While you wear this mask, you have proficiency with martial weapons and shields.</p><p><em><strong>Improvement.</strong></em> Beginning at 6th level, you can add your Charisma modifier to your melee weapon damage rolls.</p><h3>High Priest</h3><p>In lieu of a face, this bronze mask bears the image of a holy symbol, with the barest of slits to see out of. You know the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.n9pJzTDsAwQxJVRl]{sacred flame}</em> cantrip, as well as the spells shown on the table below.

When a creature rolls one of your Bardic Inspiration dice and rolls a 1 while you wear this mask, it can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p><p><em><strong>Improvement.</strong></em> Starting at 6th level, the creature can reroll the Bardic Inspiration die when it rolls a 1 or 2, and must use the new roll.</p><h3>Spirit</h3><p>This white fabric mask conceals the face as a funeral shroud, with two gold coins sewn over the eyes. You become invisible if you do not speak, move, or take any actions for 1 minute. You remain invisible for up to 10 minutes or until you remove this mask, take damage, make an attack, or cast a spell. While invisible, you can become half visible as a ghostly image or return to invisibility as a bonus action.</p><p><em><strong>Improvement.</strong></em> Starting at 6th level, while invisible, you levitate an inch above the ground, allowing you to ignore difficult terrain and make no noise while moving.</p><h2>College of Romance</h2><p>Love is a powerful thing, and none know this better than the bards of the College of Romance. Paramours, seductors, and silver-tongued devils, these bards have turned the art of wooing someone into a science, which they ply to their advantage with mechanical efficiency. Given the option, these bards would rather make love than war, knowing full well that an enemy turned ally is twice as effective as an enemy slain.</p><p>@UUID[.5FKIOU80onXm1FWh]{Sidebar: Enchantment Isn't Love}</p><h3>Likeable</h3><p>Starting when you choose this college at 3rd level, you have a magnetic personality. You can use your bonus action to distract any hostile creature you have charmed. On its turn, the charmed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and can’t move further away from you unless it first takes the Disengage action.</p><p>If you charm a creature that isn’t hostile to you, it regards you and your allies as friendly acquaintances.</p><h3>Cupid's Arrow</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can sway other creatures through your personality. As an action, expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 30 feet which can see or hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you for a number of rounds equal to the die roll.</p><p>This effect ends early if you move more than 30 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, if the creature takes damage from you or your allies, or if you use this ability again.</p><h3>Enemy of my Enemy</h3><p>At 6th level, when you take the Attack action, you can use your bonus action to direct a creature you have charmed that can see or hear you to attack. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack against a target you choose.</p><h3>Infatuate</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can make yourself the object of another creature’s affections. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated Humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div>"

Their second set of eyes and willing set of claws makes them indispensable for any good spellcaster. While many spellcasters opt to summon inconspicuous familiars, like cats, frogs, and owls, even more gather their focus while conjuring to bring forth creatures from the farthest reaches of the multiverse or to bestow sentience on an inanimate object.</p><h2>Death Snail</h2><p>A <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.lZ7QFs3yAMoYIOzx]{death snail}</strong> is formed from a vile concoction of forest troll bone meal, giant eagle blood, and goblin bone meal, enclosed in a hollowed-out efreet horn, and sealed shut with an ettercap tongue. The resulting monstrosity possesses a dull intelligence, but its only impulse is to slay all creatures other than its master.</p><h2>Flying Book</h2><div><p>Little can be said about the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.XcA2sI4sYPxeegtR]{flying book}</strong> that is not readily apparent. Though it is indistinguishable from an arcanist’s spellbook while motionless, this animated arcane tome can flutter through the air at a moment’s notice, using its cover as rudimentary wings. Flying books are playful and enjoy the sensation of being written in.</p><h2>Fright</h2><p>Hauntings can often be attributed to the usual spectral suspects: ghosts, specters, shadows, and poltergeists. But benign hauntings, where a restless spirit merely plays tricks on the living, are usually caused by a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.iOwrzpmgsXswW0qh]{fright}</strong>. These spirits tend to be the artifacts of children or entertainers, clinging to the afterlife for company and a semblance of affection, and are as such preoccupied with fun. They never willingly harm others when they haunt a house, and they will serve any master that conjures them, if only for the sake of inclusion.</p><div><h2>Grep</h2><p>A <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.tuhUIaPaPjTnCTo5]{grep}</strong> is an underground scavenger, known for using its keen vision, acute hearing, and silent flight to trick and steal from travelers, hoarding its possessions in well-hidden troves. Arcanists use greps as messengers and scouts, but they excel as retrievers; a grep can be given the name of an important object and sent to find it, returning a short time later with its prize.</p><h2>Mock</h2><p>The diminutive relative of the mimic, the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.i75c3LyDI1Blx3Op]{mock}</strong> is a tiny shapechanger that replicates small, valuable objects to lure in its victims. In the desert, a mock might take the form of a canteen of precious water, and in a dungeon, it may replicate a sizable jewel or a spare gold piece. If an adventurer is caught by surprise, a mock is just as dangerous as its larger relatives, for it can hide in far less conspicuous places.</p><h2>Moon Jelly</h2><p>Though incapable of surviving on land, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.0dWauzK3hYtbIvkj]{moon jellies}</strong> are favored for their bioluminescence by witches that intend to explore deep underwater.</p><h2>Pet Rock</h2><p>Widely considered to be the perfect familiar, requiring no food or water and possessing extremely high natural defenses, a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.hbdjS7EffkjVwQ0M]{pet rock}</strong> can be conjured by most spellcasters. Though it doesn’t act with any agility (indeed, it doesn’t move at all), it can make a formidable weapon when thrown.</p><h2>Rag Doll</h2><p>Crudely constructed but oddly endearing, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.eYgFQPk8t3ccppYs]{rag dolls}</strong> are constructs formed from children’s toys, stuffed with soft material and adorned with smiling faces. Besides being generally comforting to have around, spellcasters favor rag dolls as familiars for their soft construction and inconspicuous nature; nobody questions a discarded doll, after all.</p><h2>Tin Soldier</h2><p>Full of ticking clockwork, sprockets, and other gizmos, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.ApNuKggeSV6pCwKu]{tin soldiers}</strong> are mechanical creations fashioned by arcanists as servants and messengers. With some patience and skill, almost anyone can build a tin soldier, but spellcasters have long devised methods to conjure them wholesale from the Plane of Law’s excess energies.</p><h2>Winter Wolf Pup</h2><p>When fully grown, a winter wolf is an apex predator of the snow, a terror of teeth and fur, stalking the tundra in packs. But before they develop their fearsome freezing breath, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.JQLdChOxpuDNiUIF]{winter wolf pups}</strong> are far more amicable (perhaps because they have yet to realize the scope of their own might), and will dutifully follow a master that feeds them well and treats them with respect.</p><h2>Yarn Golem</h2><p>The greatest of golems are formed of clay, stone, and iron, but the least of them are constructed of yarn. Balled and sewn into a vaguely humanoid shape, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.qFiqrkjjGfc6LbZn]{yarn golems}</strong> are among the first animated objects that arcanists learn to create, practicing with them obsessively until they master the basics and move onto more rigid materials.

Of the three choices that define your character at first level—Background, Race, and Class—your class carries the most significance, influencing every aspect of how you play the game, from your outlook on the world to the way you survive life-or-death combat. Your class is your calling, the truest embodiment of how your character lives, and provides a platform for feats and subclasses which further refine your vision.</p><p><em>Spire of Secrets</em> builds on this core pillar with ten brand new classes, many of which are radically different from the twelve offered in the core rules. For example, the captain class lets you control two characters at once, while the warmage lets you play a powerful spellcaster using only cantrips. Each new class also includes at least seven subclasses, as well as all supplemental rules necessary for play.</p><h1>New Classes</h1><p>This book presents ten new classes to complement the existing twelve in the core rules. Each of these new classes embodies a new way to play and represents common types of adventurers which will be present in most, if not all, settings.</p><p>You can choose from among the these new classes in any campaign, unless the GM decides that some of the classes, such as the gunslinger, aren’t appropriate for the campaign.</p><p>You could assemble a sensible party entirely out of classes from this book—an alchemist, martyr, warden, and witch, for example—or pick only one or two of these classes alongside a party of core class adventurers. Using the multiclassing rules in Chapter 4, you can even mix-and-match any number of these classes together to achieve new combinations. Perhaps you can try an alchemist rogue to use explosive Sneak Attacks, or maybe you could play a craftsman monk that specializes in exotic gauntlet weapons.</p><p>You can find options for further customizing these classes in Chapter 4. With a combination of new feats, auxiliary levels, and multiclassing, the potential for new characters is endless.</p><p>The following summaries highlight each new class’s core features and why you might enjoy playing them. Additionally, each Mage Hand Press class can generally be described by a single word, which is listed before the class’s summary.</p><p>@UUID[.hGz6yiLqp45IAaCQ]{Sidebar: Note for the GM}</p><h2>Alchemist</h2><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.journals.JournalEntry.O0w4HRdkbIfK6qQE]{Alchemy, the class}</em></p><p>Using half-science, half-magic concoctions, alchemists brew up explosives and transmutative potions on the fly.

Its practitioners, therefore, are a unique breed, possessing a well of dark energy and an edge for scoring critical hits with spells, to say nothing of their armies of undead thralls.

These gods of destruction, critical counterparts to the gods of creation and mercy, need not be evil, but have a strong tendency toward chaos and enforcing the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. Clerics who follow such deities often have a deep personal connection with their chosen god. In some cases, they were spared from destruction in order to wreak it upon the world; in others, they have pleaded with the god for priesthood to destroy a single foe; others still simply worship their god out of reverent fear.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Destruction Domain Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.5SuJewoa1CRWaj1F]{burning hands}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WTbOQBsarsL1LuXJ]{thunderwave}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7u2obDvuvtZBkTfq]{scorching ray}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.wJKpSvSTbSkTjqyb]{shatter}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{fireball}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.j8NtLXOOJ3GAKF8I]{protection from energy}</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pybg5MNc3lkerH4Y]{blight}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X3DrXgxjwI2dvkD6]{wall of fire}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LkvI11Uue774QBKZ]{cloudkill}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.RpKjTlYASrfqUPVA]{cone of cold}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Devastation Initiate</h3><p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. These cantrips count as cleric spells for you and do not count against the number of cantrips you can learn.</p><h3>Channel Divinity: Calamity</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can funnel the entropic energies of the universe into your spells as a bonus action. For the next minute, whenever you deal damage with a cleric spell, it is empowered with ruinous potential. If you roll the highest number possible on any of the spell’s damage dice, you can roll that die again and add its damage to the total, rolling again if this number is also the highest, and so on. You can roll a total number of damage dice for this spell equal to twice the number of damage dice you initially rolled.</p><h3>Shockwave</h3><p>By 6th level, your devastating magic leaves only ruins behind. Once on each of your turns, when you cast a 1st level or higher cleric spell that deals fire, force, lightning, radiant, or thunder damage, you can emit a shockwave that crumbles the environment around one creature that takes damage from the spell. The shockwave is a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on the creature that only damages objects that aren’t being worn or carried. Each object in the area takes damage equal to twice the damage dealt to the creature, ignoring the object’s damage threshold.</p><h3>Potent Spellcasting</h3><p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p><h3>Havoc Spell</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, when you deal damage to a creature with a cleric spell, you can expend a spell slot as a bonus action to deal bonus radiant damage to one creature that took damage from the spell. The extra damage is 2d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d6.</p><h2>Madness Domain</h2><p>Your divine powers originate with the Madgod, a being of paranoia, mayhem, and psychosis. Every deranged thought or uncontrolled flight of fancy empowers the Madgod, who cares little for the logic of other godly domains. That is, of course, because the Madgod is a squirrel living outside the kingdom who once told you the secret of divine power is actually to collect enough fresh boysenberries, but never to eat them, and that it helps to have a good horse at your side. And lo, the rules of reality slipped away and you realized the wisdom of the Madgod’s words.

Whenever you finish a long rest, your GM can change this cantrip.</p><h3>Lunatic Insight</h3><p>At 1st level, whenever you make an ability check that doesn’t include your proficiency bonus, your unique insight allows you to make connections which may or may not exist. If the d20 roll for the ability check is even, you add your proficiency bonus to the check.</p><h3>Channel Divinity: Temporary Insanity</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to force a creature within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw or fall prey to a random madness for up to 1 minute. Roll on the following table to determine the madness which afflicts the creature. A creature that is frenzied can repeat this saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p></p><p>[[/r 1d20]]</p><table><thead><tr><td>d20</td><td>Effect</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1–5</td><td><em><strong>Aphasia.</strong></em> The creature can’t speak and is incapable of spellcasting or understanding others.</td></tr><tr><td>6–10</td><td><em><strong>Delusion.</strong></em> The creature experiences vivid hallucinations. Whenever the creature makes an attack or targets a creature with a spell or effect, roll a d20. On an odd roll, the attack misses, or the spell or effect fails.</td></tr><tr><td>11–15</td><td><em><strong>Frenzy.</strong></em> The creature becomes frenzied. A frenzied creature loses the ability to distinguish between friend and foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. While frenzied, the creature chooses the targets for its attacks, spells, and abilities randomly from among the creatures it can see within range, and it must make an opportunity attack if any creature provokes one.</td></tr><tr><td>16–20</td><td><em><strong>Vertigo.</strong></em> The creature falls prone at the end of each of its turns if it’s not leaning against something.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Fragmented Mind</h3><p>By 6th level, your damaged mind is difficult to influence. You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed or frightened conditions on yourself, and on saving throws against any effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts. If you spend 10 minutes conversing with another creature, you can bestow this benefit on them as well for up to 1 hour, as they succumb to your twisted thought patterns.</p><h3>Potent Spellcasting</h3><p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p><h3>Embrace Unreality</h3><p>By 17th level, you can drag your distorted view of the world into reality, forcing others to play by your mad rules. As an action, you can change the rules of reality in a 120-foot radius centered on a point you choose within 60 feet for 1 minute. Choose one of the following rules:</p><p><em><strong>No Up, No Down.</strong></em> Each creature and object within the area is weightless, as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MRxldJd6C4bsBo3O]{levitate}</em> spell.</p><p><em><strong>Opposite Day.</strong></em> If a creature in the area would have advantage, it instead has disadvantage, and vice versa.</p><p><em><strong>Red Light, Green Light.</strong></em> No creature can move on its turn. At the start of each round of combat, each creature simultaneously chooses where to move and moves to that space. If two or more creatures move into the same space, they collide and are knocked prone.</p><p><em><strong>Through the Looking Glass.</strong></em> At the beginning of each creature’s turn, roll any die. On an even roll, the creature doubles in size, as per the Enlarge effect of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WahI41a3goVUg0x1]{enlarge/reduce}</em> spell; on an odd roll, the creature halves in size, as per the Reduce effect of the <em>enlarge/reduce</em> spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Pestilence Domain</h2><p>You worship gods who favor corruption and plague, the Domain of Pestilence, for, though you are ravaged by disease, it doesn’t harm you.

When a creature within 5 feet hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to try to poison the creature with the tumor. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can reattempt this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>After using this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.</p><h3>Channel Divinity: Infection</h3><p>At 2nd level, your divinity carries disease. You can use your action to touch a creature within your reach, which must make a Constitution saving throw, suffering one of the following diseases of your choice for 1 minute on a failed save. Since this ability induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects applies to it.</p><p><em><strong>Bloodmore.</strong></em> Whenever the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it loses an additional 1d6 hit points.</p><p><em><strong>Joint Lock.</strong></em> The creature’s legs stiffen and its movement slows. The creature can move a maximum of 15 feet or half its speed, whichever is lower, on its turn.</p><p><em><strong>Ruby-Eye.</strong></em> The creature can see normally out to 5 feet, but is blind beyond this radius.</p><h3>Fester</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, your infectious power festers and grows. You gain the following special abilities:</p><ul><li>Whenever you deal necrotic or radiant damage, you can change the damage type to poison.</li><li>You ignore damage resistance to poison damage.</li><li>Your cleric spells and abilities ignore immunity to the poisoned condition and being diseased. A creature that is immune to being poisoned or diseased instead has advantage on its saving throws to avoid or end being poisoned or diseased by your cleric spells and abilities.</li></ul><h3>Divine Strike</h3><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with toxicity. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h3>Viral Infection</h3><p>At 17th level, when you use Infection, the target also has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws using one ability score of your choice while it is diseased.</p><p>Additionally, whenever a target of Infection is within 5 feet of another creature, you can use your reaction to cause the infection to spread to it as well. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be infected by the same disease as the target for 1 minute.</p><h2>Rum Domain</h2><p>Where rum flows easily, the gods of merriment abound. Clerics of the Rum Domain feel the fuzzy warmth of strong drink not as sinful excess, but as praise to the gods of good times, which they worship often and with abandon. They look to spread their merry religion and the good times with it, bringing all to peace and happiness, a few nights of drunken revelry at a time.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Rum Domain Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eS7XnnApoxRxYXPs]{charm person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{sleep}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3MYDjS6k9IYL0aTj]{calm emotions}, @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.agnAHTuOZvIq1SAr]{hangover}*</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.6g3WLOZ2u0EbaLAd]{hypnotic pattern}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.yqUDoxk4x0NWG5Bz]{slow}</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9hQXdMSmerkTsHDe]{confusion}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{death ward}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.r3243JU4AyQJyfX4]{modify memory}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Drunken Sway</h3><p>Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you always seem off balance, making you surprisingly difficult to hit. While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p><p>Additionally, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.</p><h3>Cup Floweth Over</h3><p>At 1st level, you can use your action to fill your mug with beer or rum, a gift of good tidings from the gods. Only you can drink this liquor, but you suffer no ill effect from drinking any amount of alcohol; though rosy-cheeked and slurred of speech, you are always steadfast on your feet and clear of thought.</p><p>Additionally, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.M1TGsl6GLRjzEWqc]{legendary libation}</em> cantrip, which counts as a cleric spell for you and doesn’t count against the number of cantrips you know.</p><h3>Channel Divinity: Intoxicate</h3><p>At 2nd level, you can call upon the gods of merrymaking to inebriate an aggressor. When a creature you can see makes an attack, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned and has disadvantage on saving throws for up to 1 minute. The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p><h3>Rumrunner</h3><p>By 6th level, you’ve learned the fine art of moving when nobody’s paying attention. Whenever a hostile creature moves, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks from the moving creature.</p><h3>Divine Strike</h3><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><h3>Next Round's on Me</h3><p>At 17th level, you can call upon the gods of good times to bring your allies a round of shots. As an action, choose up to 6 friendly creatures you can see within 60 feet of you to gain a pleasant buzz. For the next minute, you and each of these creatures have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, and can subtract your Wisdom modifier from bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage they take.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Travel Domain</h2><p>The realm of vagabonds, merchants, and adventurers, the gods of the travel domain are popular among any who frequent the roads or sail the seas.

If you make an attack while 30 feet or further away from where you began your turn, the extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 4d8.</p><h2>Wealth Domain</h2><p>Being one of the most popular pursuits of humanoids the world over, it should not come as a surprise that the accumulation of material wealth is governed by its own deities. Sitting at the confluence of industry and fertility, gods of wealth are assiduous in demanding tribute, but pay back their most loyal followers generously, showering them with gold.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Wealth Domain Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{identify}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ccduLIvutyNqvkgv]{unseen servant}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{arcane lock}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.SleYkHovQ8NagmeV]{locate object}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{glyph of warding}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gopnZvS0c2jD5FP8]{tongues}</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7Fw7Bf1k3xxDVr5L]{fabricate}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8sgwRh8NUNkn9Vi0]{secret chest}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.lnaGnxMzpYnbw1uU]{creation}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JQyigMNPiDnGI18b]{geas}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Appraisal</h3><p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you are blessed with insights into the price of everything. As an action, you can accurately determine the market price of any object, as well as what it would be worth second-hand.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your Wisdom instead of Charisma for any Charisma check you make to buy, sell, or haggle.</p><h3>Leverage</h3><p>Also at 1st level, when you cast a spell that requires material components with a specific cost, you require materials of only half of that value to cast the spell.</p><h3>Channel Divinity: Riches</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you can use your Channel Divinity to conjure an explosion of coins around the creature. The total number of gold pieces created is equal to the monster’s XP value divided by 10, rounded down.</p><p>You can use this Channel Divinity option once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Bribe</h3><p>When you reach 6th level, you can use your divine understanding to determine how to bribe almost any creature. As an action, you can choose a hostile creature you can see to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails its save, you can bribe it with rare or luxurious goods, or simply a bag of gold, which teleports into the creature’s possession. The bribe costs an amount in gp equal to half the creature’s XP value and, once completed, that creature can’t be hostile toward you or your allies for 24 hours. The effect ends early if the creature takes damage from you or your allies. You can’t bribe any creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower, or any creature the GM deems inappropriate.</p><h3>Potent Spellcasting</h3><p>At 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p><h3>Tycoon</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, your deity grants you a holy subsidy on your spellcasting. You don't need to provide material components for any cleric spell, even if it requires costly material components that are used or consumed by the spell.</p><p>Additionally, you can grant the benefit of your Leverage feature to friendly creatures within 60 feet of you.</p>"

You must be able to see the creature, it must be within 30 feet of you, and it must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher. You learn the creature’s emotional state and, at the GM’s discretion, one of the creature’s Bonds.</p><h3>Mood Swing</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can channel great swings of emotional energy at a whim. You can use the following abilities, regardless of your emotional state:</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.o9mvfSTZFzVOdbAI]{Burning Rage.}</strong></em> As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 sorcery point to ignite in arcane fury. Until the start of your next turn, when a creature comes within 5 feet of you or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 fire damage.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.jDzAX9Ucy35kXA0N]{Crestfallen.}</strong></em> Beset by sorrow, you can spend 2 sorcery points as a bonus action on your turn to fade out the world. Until the start of your next turn, you are visibly transparent, and attack rolls against you have disadvantage. This effect ends early if you are hit by an attack.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.BwVEv3B13YCxXYC4]{Flight of Terror.}</strong></em> You can spend 1 sorcery point to take the Disengage action as a bonus action on your turn.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.SAViwzOFjvjz782q]{Heartsick.}</strong></em> Overcome by lovesickness, you can use your bonus action and spend 1 sorcery point to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.vEAABawuFRVjGND6]{Moment of Bliss.}</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn. If you end your turn in the air without anything holding you aloft, and you are within 30 feet of the ground, you float gently to the ground. Otherwise, you fall.</p><h3>Shift Temperament</h3><p>At 14th level, you can use your action to bend the emotions of a creature you can see within 60 feet, which must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails its saving throw, you can use one of the following abilities on it:</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.h8j0Mo2sRpovj5Gm]{Charmed.}</strong></em> You spend 1 sorcery point, and the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you or your companions do anything harmful to the creature.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.tSXfSpPJxjFg7EY4]{Frenzied.}</strong></em> You spend 3 sorcery points to cause the creature to become frenzied for up to 1 minute. The creature can repeat this saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>A frenzied creature loses the ability to distinguish between friend and foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. While frenzied, the creature chooses the targets for its attacks, spells, and abilities randomly from among the creatures it can see within range, and it must make an opportunity attack if any creature provokes one.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.F1isNrAcRwTkEO0w]{Frightened.}</strong></em> You spend 1 sorcery point, and the creature is frightened by you for up to 1 minute. The creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.egDVqvgw8glVrRwV]{Indifferent.}</strong></em> If the creature is hostile toward you, you can spend 2 sorcery points to render it indifferent toward you for up to a minute. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed.</p><h3>Vibrant Soul</h3><p>By 18th level, you have mastery over your mercurial feelings. You know all of the spells on your Emotional Spells list at all times. Additionally, you learn the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.GJ2WYm3SQFR0winH]{antipathy/sympathy}</em>, which counts as a sorcerer spell for you and doesn’t count against your number of spells known. You can cast this spell by spending 10 sorcery points, instead of using a spell slot.</p><h2>Mirrorkin</h2><p>One of your ancestors came from beyond the looking glass; a strange world where everything is a twisted reflection of the true reality. As such, you have inherited amazing powers of mimicry and illusion that allow you to copy other people’s abilities. To fight against you is almost akin to fighting one’s own mirror image, something few warriors would relish.</p><h3>Mirror Magic</h3><p>When you choose this origin at 1st level, you can duplicate the magic that affects you. When a spell is cast targeting you or you are in the area of a spell’s effect, you can use your reaction to learn that spell. You can’t use this ability to learn a spell that had no effect on you, even if it forced you to make a saving throw against it.</p><p>You can only learn a spell if it is of a level for which you have spell slots. You can learn two 1st-level spells using this ability, which don’t count against the total number of sorcerer spells you know. When you gain 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th-level spells, you can learn 2 spells for each of those levels, for a total of 10 additional spells known. The spells learned need not be from the sorcerer spell list, but count as sorcerer spells for you. You can use your action to forget a spell you have learned using this ability.</p><h3>Mimic Trait</h3><p>Also at 1st level, you gain an uncanny ability to mimic other people. As an action, you can choose a Humanoid you can see within 60 feet and gain one trait of your choice that they possess from the following list (even if they only possess it temporarily):</p><ul><li>One special sense, such as darkvision or tremorsense.</li><li>One movement speed, such as a swim or climb speed.</li><li>One skill, tool, or instrument proficiency.</li><li>One damage resistance.</li><li>Their accent, verbal tics, and mannerisms.</li></ul><p>You can keep this trait as long as you are within 60 feet of the target, or until the target dies or loses this trait or you use this ability again.</p><h3>Reflect Magic</h3><p>At 6th level, you can turn your skin into a shimmering mirror that reflects magic. When a creature casts a spell that calls for a saving throw to resist its effects and targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can attempt to reflect the spell’s energy back against its caster. Spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level (1 sorcery point for cantrips). If you succeed on your saving throw against the spell, the caster must also make a saving throw against the spell, using their own spell save DC. On a failed save, the caster suffers the effects of the spell as if you had cast it and they had been the original target or been within the area of the spell.</p><h3>Copycat</h3><p>By 14th level, you have developed your mimicry to the point where you can mirror the unique and powerful abilities of those around you. As an action on your turn, you can perform any action that has been performed within the last minute by a Humanoid (other than yourself) that you can see within 60 feet. Any prerequisites that would normally be required for the action (such as brandishing of holy symbols, spending of ki points, or consumption of items) are waived when you use this feature, unless it is a spell or required the use of a spell slot, in which case you must still expend the relevant spell slot and any required expensive material components. If the ability forces targets to make a saving throw, you can use your sorcerer spell save DC.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>Perfect Duplicate</h3><p>At 18th level, you can duplicate yourself and others with ease. You learn the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.HFkcFvqQKOmWVejV]{disguise self}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.4Nh3bIZL15NkFmh9]{mirror image}</em> if you do not know them already, and you can cast them at will without expending a spell slot.</p><h2>Oozemaster</h2><p>Your innate magic stems from a long family line of ooze-infused blood. For generations, the strange traits of oozes have run in your family line, afflicting some at birth and sparing others, stemming from a well-documented but shadowy ancestor. It’s unclear what horrific experiment infused a monstrous ooze or slime into their body so long ago, but some of their scattered descendants are born to this day with innate magic and bizarre physical characteristics.</p><h3>Slime Magic</h3><p>You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Slime Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.</p><p>Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a conjuration or a transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.</p><p>New spells are marked with an asterisk.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Slime Spells</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">New spells are marked with an asterisk.</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.A3q2gTNqG6fvNGrv]{disguise self}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.etgcR9wqmrhyZ0tx]{grease}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.mIR9uXI8n460Y9kS]{aberrate},* @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.4H6YgYdKgnX6ZQ8M]{acid arrow}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.TKd31y5x2mhCmsHp]{benign dismemberment},* @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.69ICtcmmztSUtHdv]{rusting grasp}*</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ReMbjfeOKoSj3O79]{stoneskin}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.9FUDndISAUSBPXwC]{evasiveness},* @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.mbFw57uyfLkyiw5k]{seeming}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Reform</h3><p>Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your vaguely gelatinous flesh can mend itself when wounded. Whenever you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a nonmagical attack and don’t drop to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to immediately regain 1d4 hit points, up to a maximum of the amount of damage taken.</p><p>The healing increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p><h3>Goopy Clone</h3><p>By 6th level, you can expend 2 sorcery points as an action to create a duplicate of yourself made from a translucent ooze. If you spend an additional 3 sorcery points, you imbue this ooze duplicate with illusory magic, causing it to be indistinguishable from any Humanoid you choose. The duplicate has the statistics of a commoner, but is an ooze instead of a Humanoid. Additionally, it is formed with simulated clothing and equipment; this equipment is nonfunctional and melts into slime if it is not worn or carried by the duplicate.</p><p>The duplicate is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes, acting on your turn in combat.</p><p>The duplicate lasts for 24 hours or until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it collapses into a large puddle of ooze.</p><h3>Bouncy Body</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, when a creature you can see misses you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to bounce the attack back at the attacker with your goopy body. The attacker repeats its attack against its own AC, dealing damage to itself as normal on a hit.</p><h3>Gelatinous Ally</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can expend 6 sorcery points as an action to summon a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.3fzQVYQhXxCXRa2o]{gelatinous cube} to envelop your enemies. Choose a space you can see within 120 feet for the cube to appear. If you summon the cube into a creature’s space, the creature is immediately subject to the cube’s Engulf.</p><p>The cube uses your spell attack modifier and spell save DC in place of its own attack bonus and save DCs. You are immune to the cube’s acid damage, and you aren’t subject to the cube’s Engulf.</p><p>The cube is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. The cube obeys any verbal commands you issue to it (no action required). If you don’t issue any commands to it, the cube defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The GM has the gelatinous cube’s statistics.</p><p>The cube dissolves into a sticky liquid when it drops to 0 hit points, or when you dismiss it as an action on your turn. You can only have one summoned gelatinous cube at a time.</p><h2>Reincarnated Hero</h2><p>Sorcerers gain their powers in mysterious ways that they seldom have control over. You are the reincarnation of a legendary hero, known to have slain many terrible foes. Being called back to life, be it by the gods, a very powerful mage, or a persistent curse on your soul, has left the indelible mark of sorcery upon you and awakened your ancient instincts for battle.</p><h3>Heroic Magic</h3><p>The power of your previous life grants you the ability to learn spells that other sorcerers might never manifest. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the following, which don’t count against your number of spells known: <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.IjsUVc0MZC3WX9U2]{arc blade}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.Nruet5FJIw4W0Azj]{burning blade}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.pSdWjjTzBmq6ewn6]{caustic blade}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.zfwEl9lWgU2SGM8q]{force weapon}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.dCEdyhcO05oNPEZu]{frigid blade}</em>.</p><p>You also learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Heroic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.</p><p>Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level.

Once on each of your turns, you can spend 1 sorcery point as a bonus action to use one of the following maneuvers:</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.oVCB02WzNdoAPiUh]{Aegis Stance.}</strong></em> Make one melee weapon attack against a creature you can see.

You don’t provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.</p><h3>Sorcerous Kindling</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, the ebb and flow of battle hones your sorcery and fuels your magic. Once per turn, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack against a hostile creature or reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a weapon attack, you regain 2 sorcery points.</p><h3>Heroic Legacy</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can shrug off death in ways few of your previous lives could equal. Whenever you take more than 20 damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage taken to 20. When you do so, you have advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p><h2>Spiritborn</h2><p>Your magic comes not from your blood, but from the conditions of your birth. Born during a specific time, or in accordance with a specific prophecy, your birth was heralded by the birth of an albino animal closely tied to your family. This animal, a powerful spirit in physical form, is bound to your very soul, allowing you to work powerful magic. Much like your bonded spirit, your skin and hair took on a color unusual for your race, with both usually becoming stark white, but sometimes a deep amber or golden hue.</p><h3>Natural Magic</h3><p>The bond with your spirit animal grants you access to the magic of nature. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.QvPDSUsAiEn3hD8s.JournalEntryPage.MWiN7ILEO0Vd3zAZ]{druid spell list} or the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.QvPDSUsAiEn3hD8s.JournalEntryPage.PVgly1xB2S2I8GLQ]{sorcerer spell list}. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p><p>Additionally, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Natural Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. If you later replace one of these spells, you must replace it with a spell from the druid spell list.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Natural Spells</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">New spells are marked with an asterisk.</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gMrWeG8fMDPRFiVe]{entangle}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.aL1F8fvYLtNzUbKu]{speak with animals}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pRMvmknwLf2tdMTj]{pass without trace}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9gYGkrL6qFTsE6fw]{spike growth}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.YWtwzp6ZnQJMEmVW]{plant growth}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.2VXGS206tuChoeXy]{speak with plants}</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LrPvWHBPmiMQQsKB]{dominate beast}, @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.bcdv8wznx3Kanahl]{Mandy’s feral follower}*</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MCEpGpvovcXagwQS]{awaken}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.dp6xny4v8PDoIGjh]{commune with nature}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Spirit Animal</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.Q5TJwYLcAYDli3M5]{find familiar}</em> spell and can cast it as a ritual without material components to summon a spirit animal.

Additionally, your melee weapon attacks have the Reach property and you can ignore the Heavy property of weapons.</p><h3>Comic Timing</h3><p>By 6th level, your wacky antics ensure your safety. When a hostile creature you can see within 5 feet of you makes an attack, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to use one of the following abilities:</p><ul><li>You prank the attacker an instant before it attacks, such as by throwing a pie in its face, imposing disadvantage on the attack.</li><li>If the attacker hits, the target is magically squashed flat, deflated like a balloon, momentarily chopped in half, or burned to a crisp. As a result, the target has resistance to this damage, and is knocked prone.</li><li>If the attacker misses, they slip on a well-placed banana peel and fall prone.</li></ul><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use this ability when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you attacks. You teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target as a part of your reaction.</p><h3>Off-Screen Teleportation</h3><p>By 14th level, you can exploit a well-known law of toons which states that anyone you can’t see basically teleports to where they need to be. When you are in a location no other creature can see you, or when you take the Hide action on your turn, you can teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see as a bonus action. Your destination must be a location no other creature can see, but can include obvious and easy to access locations, such as behind another creature’s back, inside a barrel, or just around a corner.</p><h3>Two-Dimensional</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, as a bonus action, you can fully embrace your cartoonish influences and become perfectly flat. You can revert to three dimensions as a bonus action. In your two-dimensional form, the laws of reality are even looser for you, granting you the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage.</li><li>You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.</li><li>You can increase or decrease your size (as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WahI41a3goVUg0x1]{enlarge/reduce}</em> spell) as a bonus action.</li><li>When you fall, you descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling, as you instead glide like a sheet of paper.</li><li>You can fit through passageways as narrow as 1/2-inch across.</li></ul>"

Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin aren’t manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent.</p><h2>Living Toys</h2><p>As a race, the geppettin are an oddity. Though rare, they are numerous enough and share enough similarities that they may be counted as an actual race of people, and not merely freak mishaps of magic. While there might be dedicated creators of geppettin, as there are with golems, many geppettin come to life on their own.</p><p>Physically, geppettin are often shorter than halflings. Their physical features vary greatly from type to type, but they are almost always humanoid in shape. For simplicity, geppettin are classified by their materials: bisque are porcelain, marionettes are wood, and plushies are made of fabric.</p><p>Despite being made of somewhat flimsy materials, sentience grants them an odd hardiness. Additionally, due to their non-living nature, they never hunger, rarely tire, and are adept at being innocuous. Most find some form of work or profession in entertainment, but a few find fantastic success as spies and assassins.</p><p>As living constructs, geppettin don’t age, and are mature as soon as they become sentient.</p><h2>Bisque Traits</h2><p>Bisque geppettin are a form of porcelain doll, crafted with exacting specification and luxurious clothing materials. Though they are designed to look as realistic as possible, they are often thought to be the most terrifying of geppettin due to their lifeless visage. Though their faces are often very fragile, their construction is generally much hardier than their brethren’s.</p><p>As a bisque, you have the following racial traits:</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p><p><em>Typical:</em> Dexterity +1, Constitution +1, Charisma +1</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are a Humanoid. However, spells and effects that specifically affect Constructs affect you as well.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> You are Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light, and darkness as if it was dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Construct Anatomy.</strong></em> You are immune to nonmagical diseases. You don’t need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish.</p><p>You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest by spending 4 hours in a motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.</p><p><em><strong>False Appearance.</strong></em> While you are motionless, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary porcelain doll.</p><p><em><strong>Sudden Strike.</strong></em> Whenever you deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack roll on your first turn in combat, the creature takes extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><p><em><strong>Unnerving.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill, and have advantage on any Charisma (Intimidation) rolls in you make against a creature that hasn’t previously seen you move.</p><h2>Marionette Traits</h2><div><p>Marionette geppettin are made mostly out of wood, with painted faces and carved clothing. Due to their construction, their jointed limbs are quite flexible, and they are known to be fantastic dancers.

Though they often look humanoid, they may also look like animals, monsters, or any other form of anthropomorphic creature.</p><p>As a plushie, you have the following racial traits:</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p><p><em>Typical:</em> Dexterity +1, Charisma +2</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are a Humanoid.

However, such mandrakes are those which are harvested too early; literally children still in infancy. If allowed to grow for a year and a day before being harvested, mandrakes can mature into great and powerful tree people.</p><p>Mandrakes mature in a decade and live for centuries, growing wider and more gnarled with bark as they age.</p><h2>Flesh from Wood</h2><p>With a skin of thick bark and leaves growing at their extremities, you could be forgiven for believing that mandrakes are simply bizarre plants, treants, or animated trees. This might even be partially true: it seems that while mandrakes originated from some plant ancestor, they have become something midway between animal and plant through strange magic or stranger evolution.</p><p>Mandrake anatomies are filled with paradoxes. They bleed a ruby ichor, reminiscent of both blood and sap. Their hearts, which look like a knot of roots, pump this around their body, enriching it with oxygen borne by leaves and special pores on their extremities. By preference, mandrakes can bask in the sunlight or consume living things for nourishment, and can even absorb nutrients through their feet, though they rarely subsist by sunlight and water alone.</p><h2>Forest Envoys</h2><p>Alchemists and arcanists alike scratch their heads at mandrakes, but druids know them as the green emissaries who stand between the realms of animals and plants, making peace for all parties. To druidic tradition, mandrakes are unique, ancient constructions of Mother Nature herself, intended to act as delegates of her will. Mandrakes are credited by old druids for aligning elves with the forests and dwarves with the mountains; only with the rising tide of humanoids and their preponderance of gods did most creatures forget about Mother Nature and her half-plant ambassadors.</p><p>Today, mandrakes are rare, and make their homes in the forests near where villages and cities meet the true wilds. Humans tell tales of mandrakes savaging those who enter their domain, but druids and those who respect the old traditions of the forest know that such ire is seldom undeserved.</p><h2>Mandrake Traits</h2><div><p>Because you are neither beast nor plant, you have the following characteristics:</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p><p><em>Typical:</em> Constitution +1, Wisdom +2</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are a Humanoid.

It happens that few mousefolk aspire to heroism, but a certain moral compass often compels mousefolk to a higher cause.</p><p>As a rule, mousefolk are good to their neighbors and rarely pick fights; after all, most people can be reasoned with. Those who can’t be reasoned with, however, should rightly fear mousefolk striking at their knees. Mousefolk don’t suffer bullies lightly.</p><p>Despite their valorous legacies, no histories are written about the mousefolk culture itself. This is because the mousefolk language, Rodentia, has no written form, and mousefolk preserve thier history in stories and songs passed from elders to children throughout the generations.</p><h2>Hooded or Disgraced</h2><p>Though ratlings have long abandoned the old ways, a mouseling is never to be seen without a hood. Following ancient tradition, mouselings wear hoods they have sewn themselves at all times, except in the most dire of circumstances. A hood is a symbol of wealth and social standing, and is sometimes replaced with hats or other headwear when appropriate. If a mouseling is seen without a hood, it is a sure sign of disgrace and exile, the most personal punishment a village of mouselings can inflict.</p><h2>Mousefolk Traits</h2><div><p>Slight and swift, you possess the following traits:</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Increase one ability score of your choice by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p><p><em>Typical:</em> Dexterity +2, Charisma +1</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are a Humanoid.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> You are Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light, and darkness as if it was dim light.

Choose one of the following lineage options:</p><p><em><strong>Mouseling’s Sidestep.</strong></em> When a creature you can see makes an opportunity attack against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t use this trait when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p><p><em><strong>Ratling’s Gnaw.</strong></em> You can use your action to chew through and break a small nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried, like a rope, a wooden rod or handle, or a length of fabric. If you chew on a wooden wall or floor for 1 minute, you can gnaw a hole large enough for a Tiny creature. You can’t chew through materials that are harder than your teeth, such as metal, stone, or crystal.</p></div>"

Far from it: they are born, grow old, die, and can even raise children. Yet the stigma of undeath lingers over them.

To avoid such conflict, spirithosts often avoid large, unfamiliar towns, or disguise their ethereality from others.</p><p>Spirithosts do not experience time in the same way as most mortal creatures.

The secret to immortality, including the elixirs and rituals needed to achieve it, is protected by a small, clandestine sect of immortal mystics, each of whom only know one component of the process. There are perhaps only a dozen true immortals in the world, but as many as hundreds if every tale can be believed.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p><p><em><strong>Ageless.</strong></em> You don’t age, can’t be aged magically, and suffer none of the frailty of old age.

This is a special ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. On a hit, the target takes [[/r 1d10]] acid damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p><p>You can use your Acid Spit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Roguean</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 1st level only, near-human variant</em></p><p>You hail from an icy, desolate land, prone to dramatic swings in temperature.

You have the following racial traits:</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p><p><em><strong>Horns.</strong></em> You have horns that you can use to make unarmed strikes.

You can’t use this trait if you have 0 hit points.</p><h3>Two-Headed</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 1st level only, near-human variant</em></p><p>Like ettins, you have two heads with differing personalities that jointly control your body.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p><p><em><strong>Two-Heads.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the following conditions on yourself: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened.</p><p><em><strong>Wakeful.</strong></em> Because one of your heads is always awake, you retain consciousness when you take a long rest.</p><h3>Windswept</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 1st level only, near-human variant</em></p><p>Carefree and constantly possessed of wanderlust, the extraordinarily pale windswept embody their connection to Elemental Air. Windswept humans are never likely to sleep in the same bed for two nights in a row; they are always moving, always exploring, and always following the wind. You are lighter than a normal human, capable of floating gently on the breeze, and have faint inborn power over the winds, which grant you the following racial traits:</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance to lightning damage.</p><p><em><strong>Zephyr Magic.</strong></em> You know the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.icZokbgV1jIMpNCv]{message}</em> cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pub0OWVEB71XQx1n]{feather fall}</em> spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{gust of wind}</em> spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pub0OWVEB71XQx1n]{feather fall}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{gust of wind}</em> with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.</p><p>Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).</p><h3>Winged</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 1st level only, near-human variant</em></p><p>Winged humans, sometimes called Icarusians, are the offspring of aarakocra, harpies, or birdfolk. Depending on their parentage, these humans might possess feathers, talons, or beaks.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p><p><em><strong>Flight.</strong></em> Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can’t use this flying speed if you’re wearing medium or heavy armor.</p></div></div></div>"

          "name": "调查员",
          "text": "<p>A collage of diagrams, maps, and small items litters the wall, pinned with nails and connected by a spiderweb of colorful strings. An elf stands nearby, contemplating the mystery splayed out in front of her and readying her crossbow for work.</p><p>A half-orc wearing a wide-brimmed hat leafs through a thick tome, double-checking the supplies: a sturdy net trap, holy symbols on the doors, cloves of garlic, and several dozen wooden stakes. The preparations made, the half-orc slinks into the shadows and readies himself for the bloodshed.</p><p>Blood dripping from its fangs and claws, a monstrously fat demon bears down on a human, who busies herself marking a tavern’s door frame with a few chalkmark runes. She takes a long step back and waits. As the demon lunges for its next meal, an invisible force lashes forth from the doorway, lopping off its hand and raking its stomach. The fiend howls with rage, and the inquisitor breathes a sigh of relief.</p><p>Supernatural detectives and monster slayers, investigators are always on the hunt for malevolent outsiders. Whenever evil seeps into the world—be it fiends, undead, or strange abominations from beyond the stars—investigators will be the first to locate them and banish their foul corruption from the mortal plane.</p><h2>Paranormal Investigators</h2><p>There are forces more ancient than time, foes more sinister than the foulest men, and beings more titanic than gods. The world stands on a precipice of woe and terror, being threatened nightly by dark agents and hordes of monsters. At risk to their own lives and sanities, investigators penetrate the evil that creeps in the shadows and banish it from the world. Their battles are never-ending, for victory only delays doomsday another night.</p><p>Investigators track supernatural threats ranging from incorporeal spirits, to nefarious vampires and lycanthropes, to incursions of demons and devils. Often in their investigations, they uncover secret cults and maligned individuals who bring these supernatural threats to bear. It is always their goal to impede these evildoers by any means necessary, resorting to trickery, guile, magic, and bloodshed when necessary. To an investigator, no tactic is unthinkable when the world is at stake.</p><h2>Exorcists and Occultists</h2><p>Even as they strive to contain its influence from the world at large, investigators dabble in forbidden magic to give themselves an edge against supernatural threats. Prepared investigators keep a well-stocked grimoire of magical secrets, containing rituals, incantations, notes on monsters’ powers and weaknesses, recipes for poisons, and arcane diagrams—everything needed to confront their foes on an even footing. Even so, an investigator’s occupation is perilous. A grimoire might spell out a vampire’s fear of sunlight and aversion to silver, but it does little to hinder their fangs.</p><h2>Creating an Investigator</h2><p>As you build your investigator, consider what sort of supernatural threat first drove you to investigating and combating the occult. Did one of your family members strike a bargain with a fiend? Were you kidnapped by a cabal of vampires or a pack of lycanthropes? Did you stumble across evidence of an eldritch abomination, such as a Great Old One? The type of creature you first did battle with likely shaped your tools and methods later on.</p><p>Did you apprentice under a seasoned monster hunter, learning the ropes of tracking a threat, uncovering its weaknesses, and setting a trap for it? Or did you strike out on your own, compiling your own grimoire from hard-earned research? Perhaps you learned everything about monster hunting from someone else’s grimoire, a masterwork containing an abridged library of occult knowledge and a lifetime of experience. It’s even possible that you signed a contract with a minor fiend and turned to supernatural investigation in a last-ditch effort to save your soul.</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>Follow these suggestions to build an investigator quickly: Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Strength. Then, select the rituals <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.Pj4xWqizCYVDK1fb]{clue}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.4dSvfvTy2ZIJ3K4k]{comprehend languages}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{detect magic}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.LnYZNKo6l3meaWLe]{transient bulwark}</em> to add to your grimoire. Finally, pick any background, preferably one that relates to your experience with supernatural monsters and the occult.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[.UDy7fq0C4D0Vyt2U]{Investigator Class Table}</p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"4\">The Investigator</td></tr><tr><td>Level</td><td>Proficiency Bonus</td><td>Features</td><td>Ritual Level</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>Expertise, Ritualist</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>Myths and Legends, Rushed Incantation</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>Occult Specialization</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>Exploit Weakness</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>Expertise, Occult Specialization feature</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>Opportunistic Piety</td><td>4th</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>4th</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>Supernatural Resolve</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>Occult Specialization feature</td><td>5th</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>Finisher</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>Enigma Arcane</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>Occult Specialization feature</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>Enigma Arcane improvement</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>Enigma Arcane improvement</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>Exorcist</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>6th</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>Spellbinder</td><td>6th</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h1>Class Features</h1><p>As an investigator, you have the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d8 per investigator level</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong></em> 8 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong></em> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per investigator level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><em><strong>Armor:</strong></em> Light armor</p><p><em><strong>Weapons:</strong></em> Simple weapons, hand crossbows, heavy crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords</p><p><em><strong>Tools:</strong></em> One gaming set of your choice</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws:</strong></em> Dexterity, Intelligence</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Choose three from Arcana, Athletics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Persuasion, Religion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>Leather armor</li><li>A dagger and (<em>a</em>) a longsword or (<em>b</em>) a rapier</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a heavy crossbow and 20 bolts or (<em>b</em>) a hand crossbow and 20 bolts</li><li>(<em>a</em>) dungeoneer’s pack or (<em>b</em>) a priest’s pack</li><li>A grimoire and a component pouch</li></ul><h2>Expertise</h2><p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies; your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 6th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p><h2>Ritualist</h2><p>You maintain a grimoire brimming with magical rituals: your most potent tools to defeat supernatural threats.</p><h3>Grimoire</h3><p>At 1st level, you have a grimoire containing four 1st-level spells of your choice that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the spells needn’t be from the same list). You can’t cast spells that are in your grimoire except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can add an additional ritual spell from the Investigator Spells list (see Chapter 6) to your grimoire at no cost. The Ritual Level column on the Investigator table shows the maximum spell level you can add to your grimoire.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you find a ritual spell on your adventures, you can add it to your grimoire if it is on the investigator spell list and is of a level you can add to your grimoire. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p><h3>Bonus Rituals</h3><p>As an investigator, you can treat specific spells as if they had the ritual tag, allowing you to add them to your grimoire and cast them as rituals. These spells are marked in the investigator spell list.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your ritual spells, since you master your spells through deduction and cunning. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, when you cast an investigator ritual or a spell offered to you by a feature in this class, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC and making an attack roll.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h2>Myths and Legends</h2><p>At 2nd level, you are extremely adept at uncovering knowledge that pertains to eldritch threats and forgotten legends. You have advantage on Intelligence checks related to researching creatures, spells, and other ancient or secret lore.</p><h2>Rushed Incantation</h2><p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can hastily perform any ritual spell in your grimoire that has a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action, completing the ritual as a bonus action. If the spell requires material components worth 100 gp or less, you can cast it without providing those components. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>As you gain higher levels in this class, you can use this feature additional times. You can use it once more at 5th level (Intelligence modifier + 1), 9th level (Intelligence modifier + 2), 13th level (Intelligence modifier + 3), and 17th level (Intelligence modifier + 4).</p><h2>Occult Specialization</h2><p>At 3rd level, you choose a specialization, an area of expertise in handling eldritch threats. Specializations are detailed at the end of the class description. Your specialization choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h3>Trinkets</h3><p>Investigators also collect a number of supernatural trinkets. You must be holding a trinket to activate it. Once you use one of your trinkets, you can’t use any of them again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>As you gain higher levels in this class, you can use your trinkets additional times between rests: You can use them once more at 5th level (2 uses), 11th level (3 uses), and 17th level (4 uses).</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2>Exploit Weakness</h2><p>Most supernatural creatures have some form of weakness, a gap in their armor that allows them to be defeated. Starting at 5th level, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the target is treated as if it has vulnerability to the weapon’s damage. Vulnerability from this feature only doubles your weapon’s damage roll and your ability modifier; you don’t double extra damage from sources like spells (such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.0xmXiPiuYws1OGcX]{hunter’s mark}</em>), magic items (such as the extra fire damage of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.ducaFdrqwLZ0l3c7]{flame tongue}</em>), feats, or class features (such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack}).</p><p>Additionally, the attack, as well as all other attacks made against the target until the start of your next turn, count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h2>Opportunistic Piety</h2><p>By 7th level, you always keep a wide array of holy symbols and blessed items on your person, even if you aren’t particularly pious. When you use your Opportunistic Piety, you choose which effect to create from the list below. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Opportunistic Piety again.</p><p><em><strong>Banish.</strong></em> You cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pxpb2eOB6bv4phAf]{banishment}</em> spell without expending a spell slot. If the target is a Fey, Fiend, or Undead and fails its saving throw against this spell, it also takes radiant damage equal to your level.</p><p><em><strong>Miracle Healing.</strong></em> As an action, divine light from your hands knit the wounds of a willing creature you touch. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to twice your investigator level. This ability has no effect on Undead or Constructs.</p><p><em><strong>Warding.</strong></em> As an action, you trace a holy symbol on a creature within 5 feet of you, warding it against harm. For the next minute, Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead that touch the warded creature or hit it with a melee attack take 1d12 radiant damage.</p><h2>Supernatural Resolve</h2><p>At 9th level, you gain resilience to the attacks and effects of the creatures you regularly investigate. You can’t be possessed or charmed, and you have resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.</p><h2>Finisher</h2><p>Beginning at 11th level, you know exactly how to bring a monster down. Once on each of your turns when you take the Attack action and hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra 2d8 damage to the creature. If the creature has less than half its hit points remaining, you can instead deal an extra 4d8 damage to the creature.</p><h2>Enigma Arcane</h2><p>At 13th level, you uncover a magical secret connected to a wellspring of potent magic. You can cast one of the following spells once without expending a spell slot: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.f38w5rd9SgdmWc6F]{mirage arcane}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]{plane shift}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ERCv7yuRkQ0YjGx6]{reverse gravity}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.wvLbtemkH8gyBpdc]{sequester}</em>, or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV]{teleport}</em>. Once you do so, you can’t cast any of these spells in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>At 15th level, you can also cast one of the following spells once without expending a spell slot: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ]{antimagic field}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1RzxKZzkQOoioxPj]{glibness}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.clwv2PWOcT822hlr]{maze}</em>, or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.bllEWfm9xfEKynhv]{mind blank}</em>. Once you do so, you can’t cast any of these spells in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>At 17th level, you can also cast one of the following spells once without expending a spell slot: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.TIoadMIsUKD4edXi]{astral projection}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV]{gate}</em>, or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Wl2vtJ4hCt2tpWfR]{weird}</em>. Once you do so, you can’t cast any of these spells in this way again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Exorcist</h2><p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{protection from evil and good}</em> spell without expending a spell slot or material components.</p><h2>Spellbinder</h2><p>By 20th level, many rituals you perform have become second nature to you. Select five ritual spells in your grimoire with a casting time of 1 action. You can cast these spells as a bonus action without expending a use of Rushed Incantation, and you can do so without your grimoire on hand. If the spell requires material components worth 100 gp or less, you can cast it without providing those components.</p><h1>Occult Specializations</h1><p>Investigators of all stripes share the broad goal of combating the occult, but their methods vary wildly. Some emphasize cutting down monsters and banishing demons, while others believe that uncovering secrets and compiling critical information is the surest method for eliminating supernatural threats. When an investigator gains enough experience, they can steer their approach, including the specific techniques they employ and the trinkets they carry, into an occult specialization, a school of thought for handling eldritch threats.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Occult Specializations</td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.KRjaKleAcsLWzwKx#antiquarian]{Antiquarian}</td><td>Festooned with powerful magical trinkets of all shapes and sizes</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.KRjaKleAcsLWzwKx#archivist]{Archivist}</td><td>A scholar who collects scraps of ancient lore</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.KRjaKleAcsLWzwKx#detective]{Detective}</td><td>Chases down clues and unravels crimes with their impressive intellect</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.KRjaKleAcsLWzwKx#exterminator]{Exterminator}</td><td>Hunts down vampires, lycanthropes, and beasts that stalk the night</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.KRjaKleAcsLWzwKx#inquisitor]{Inquisitor}</td><td>An agent of the church that performs exorcisms and roots out heresy</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.KRjaKleAcsLWzwKx#medium]{Medium}</td><td>Foretells events of the future using a magical connection to the dead</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.KRjaKleAcsLWzwKx#occultist]{Occultist}</td><td>A magician borrowing spells from wizards and warlocks</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.KRjaKleAcsLWzwKx#spy]{Spy}</td><td>Infiltrates with perfect disguises and unmatched charm</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Antiquarian</h2><p>Festooned with magical trinkets from every corner of the globe, antiquarians have a tool for every occasion: silver arrowheads for lycanthropes, heartwood stakes for vampires, blessed relics for fiends, and so on. As they expand their collections from piles of trinkets to veritable museums, they become adept historians and arcanists, familiar with the story of every magic item in their care, as well how to use them in dire situations.</p><h3>Artifact Historian</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you add the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{identify}</em> spell to your grimoire. It doesn’t require material components when you cast it.</p><h3>Trinkets</h3><p>By 3rd level, you’ve collected a number of magical trinkets to help you collect and unravel profound arcane secrets. You can use the following trinkets:</p><p><em><strong>Hateful Arrowhead.</strong></em> You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ODhLKBxLnvvLOnw1]{ray of enfeeblement}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7u2obDvuvtZBkTfq]{scorching ray}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Mirrored Prism.</strong></em> You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.UDUnlfPsOAbq2RSE]{blur}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X4c8xCkmF8U9HUMz]{mirror image}</em> spell once, targeting yourself only, without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Razortooth Bandages.</strong></em> You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{cure wounds}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ksaaTxIbKx2sJfia]{inflict wounds}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components. This spell is cast as if using a spell slot of the level shown in the Ritual Level column of the Investigator table.</p><h3>Relics</h3><p>By 6th level, you’ve secured a handful of priceless relics with rare and delicate enchantments. You can use one of the following relics once, and regain the ability to use this feature when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Antediluvian Dynamo.</strong></em> You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{fireball}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.IyikgTEOTv701jgQ]{lightning bolt}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Lich’s Deathmask.</strong></em> You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Mortal Coil.</strong></em> You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.oyE5nVppa5mde5gT]{animate dead}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components. Casting <em>animate dead</em> using this trinket causes all Undead servants created by previous castings of the spell to revert to lifeless corpses.</p><h3>Magic Item Collection</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you maintain a vault of magic items, secured in an extradimensional space with an elaborate locking mechanism. When you finish a long rest, you can produce one of the items listed below, which remains in your possession until you use this feature to select a different item.</p><p>The item is your choice of the following: a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.XwqNHyox5OQQio8q]{carpet of flying}</em>, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Aq1rhgcgFnwu2T4I]{cloak of the bat}</em>, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.ducaFdrqwLZ0l3c7]{flame tongue}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.3TWT5bv3z5zGUZCe]{gauntlets of ogre power}</em>, an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.9stfX2i2I1YPo8vx]{instant fortress}</em>, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.AweD4kpKGM7Ilu3n]{ring of regeneration}</em>, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.hxfOtvFrY1PXHQN1]{ring of telekinesis}</em>, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.yiYCqmD5n08NftYk]{sun blade}</em>, or a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.lPsueMv4ZoXqCYf9]{wand of wonder}</em>.</p><h3>Phylactery</h3><p>By 14th level, you’ve secured the crown jewel of your collection: a lich’s phylactery. Though the original owner’s soul has been expelled from this accursed artifact, it retains many of its unique properties.</p><p>This magic item is always attuned to you and doesn’t count against your total number of attuned magic items. It has 5 charges, and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend one or more of these charges to use the following abilities:</p><p><em>1 Charge:</em> You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7e3QXF10hLNDEdr6]{false life}</em> spell as a 2nd-level spell without expending a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em>1 Charge:</em> You can use your bonus action to regain one expended use of your Trinkets feature.</p><p><em>2 Charges:</em> As a reaction when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.</p><p><em>3 Charges:</em> Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 5d6 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.</p><h2>Archivist</h2><p>Though most investigators fill their grimoires with hard-won knowledge borne from encounters with supernatural threats, some prefer to do bookkeeping instead. Such archivists seek to accumulate knowledge, moreso than trinkets, by spending untold hours digging through disparate tomes of occult secrets and compiling them into encyclopedic texts on the supernatural. Through their research, archivists become academic masters of the arcane and priceless reservoirs of obscure knowledge.</p><h3>Trinket</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you’ve collected a powerful trinket to enhance your ritual magic:</p><p><em><strong>Archaic Scroll.</strong></em> You can perform a ritual spell with your Rushed Incantation feature without expending one of the feature’s uses.</p><h3>Thesis</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you gain access to certain spells associated with your thesis. Pick one of the following subject areas for your thesis: Corpus, Ignis, Mortis, or Regis. You gain a list of associated thesis spells. Once you gain access to a thesis spell, it is added to your grimoire. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the investigator spell list, the spell is nonetheless an investigator spell for you. You can use your action and expend a use of your Rushed Incantation feature to cast one of your thesis spells.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Corpus</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ZrTc23tToJ0JpH2h]{jump}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.B0pnIcc52O6G8hi8]{longstrider}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8RTDOt80u8aBv9qx]{alter self}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.2yHXEcrRbadZDr5M]{heat metal}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.2IWiZAJtOGDoKjiz]{gaseous form}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.64uo4fHriHLjRUrX]{meld into stone}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Ignis</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.5SuJewoa1CRWaj1F]{burning hands}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WTbOQBsarsL1LuXJ]{thunderwave}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{gust of wind}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7u2obDvuvtZBkTfq]{scorching ray}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ehvmg9U9fcMEhE4z]{call lightning}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ew6GA8dJy2spQmFW]{wind wall}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Mortis</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.95K2aUhAGV9qXjnf]{bane}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7e3QXF10hLNDEdr6]{false life}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.zwGsAv6kmwzYGhh3]{blindness/deafness}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.S7VbUetIfVT7B6Eq]{darkness}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.UfHQhA54M4323gVO]{vampiric touch}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Regis</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eS7XnnApoxRxYXPs]{charm person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BQk5Row4NymMnUQl]{hideous laughter}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.30ZgXtijJVCxQk5N]{enthrall}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4]{suggestion}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.6g3WLOZ2u0EbaLAd]{hypnotic pattern}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Erudite Spell</h3><p>By 6th level, you’ve mastered the intricate theory of arcane propagation. When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Encyclopedic Expertise</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can identify any arcane effect from memory. Whenever you witness a spell being cast or investigate a magical effect, you can always identify the spell that was cast, the magic item responsible, or the monster which produced the effect. However, this ability fails to identify spells, magic items, and monsters that are utterly unique or are otherwise not recorded in arcane texts.</p><h3>Eidetic Memory</h3><p>At 14th level, you can effortlessly duplicate spells you see in the world. You can copy any ritual spell you see being cast into your grimoire.</p><p>Moreover, you can precisely copy the exact motions of a spell’s casting to duplicate its effect. When you see a spell of 5th level or lower being cast, you can use your action and spend 1 use of your Rushed Incantation feature to cast the spell yourself without expending a spell slot. To use this ability, the spell must have a casting time of 1 action, must have been cast within the last minute, and must not have expensive material components.</p><p>Once you duplicate a spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Detective</h2><p>Prowling at the edge of darkness, detectives chase down clues and pull on threads to unravel conspiracies that bring darkness into the world. Sometimes, this requires that you infiltrate a cult’s secret meetings, other times it calls on you to reconstruct a person’s last moments at a murder scene. No matter what the mystery, however, you know that there is always an explanation.</p><h3>Investigator's Hunch</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you can unravel even the toughest of mysteries. If you spend at least 10 minutes combing through documents and arranging clues, you can make an Intelligence check related to those documents and clues with advantage.</p><h3>Trinkets</h3><p>By 3rd level, you’ve collected a number of magical trinkets to aid you in tracking supernatural creatures and unraveling mysteries. You can use the following trinkets:</p><p><em><strong>Fogstone Periapt.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.wqfAVANuQonNBgnL]{misty step}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Glass Medallion.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]{invisibility}</em> spell once, targeting yourself only, without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Skeleton’s Key.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1nhIxh0DsJsntCfj]{knock}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><h3>Predictive Intuition</h3><p>By 6th level, you can turn your skills with reconstructing events toward anticipating the next moment of a fight. As a bonus action, you can examine the movements of a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, you can choose to add 1d6 to your next attack roll targeting that creature before the start of your next turn, or you can choose to subtract 1d6 from the creature’s next attack roll against you before the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Interrogator's Instinct</h3><p>At 10th level, you are so accustomed to uncovering the truth that you can sense the intents behind someone’s voice. You can tell if a creature that you can hear speaking is charmed, possessed, or otherwise enchanted to speak against its will, and you have advantage on any ability check you make to determine if you hear a lie.</p><h3>Power of Deduction</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to examine a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, noting innumerable details and making a lengthy string of logical deductions. For the next minute, you have advantage on Intelligence and Charisma checks you make to interact with that creature, and you have advantage on attack rolls against it.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Exterminator</h2><p>An exterminator suffers no monster to live. Trained in the art of slaying aberrations, fiends, and undead, you stand against evil where others falter, and draw your blade before others recognize a threat. Grand schemes and plots are less important than retribution against those monsters which stalk the night, and your thirst for such retribution is unquenchable. There is always another werewolf to be slain, another vampire to be staked, another demon to be banished. People rarely thank you, but you find satisfaction enough in your work.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and medium armor.</p><h3>Trinkets</h3><p>By 3rd level, you’ve collected a number of magical trinkets to aid you in the elimination of monsters and other threats. You can use the following trinkets:</p><p><em><strong>Consecrated Whetstone.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Sgjrf8qqv97CCWM4]{magic weapon}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Gilded Dragon Scale.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you gain resistance to one damage type of your choice for 1 minute.</p><p><em><strong>Wyverntooth Necklace.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can use your bonus action to activate this trinket, dealing an extra 2d8 poison damage to the creature.</p><h3>Monster Slayer</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, when you take the Attack action, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Silvered Edge</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, whenever you deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack, it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Additionally, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, it can’t be raised as an Undead creature nor be returned to life by any means short of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{wish}</em> spell for 7 days.</p><h3>Killer Instinct</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your Exploit Weakness feature twice on your turn, but can’t use it against the same target more than once.</p><h2>Inquisitor</h2><p>The church has long been the first line of defense against the tide of impending darkness. Yet, the clergy’s stubborn devotion to righteousness impedes them where it counts: you must sometimes be willing to do evil to counter evil. That’s where the inquisition comes in.</p><p>As a righteous inquisitor of the faith, you are tasked with rooting out heresy, exorcising demons, and stamping out any sign of the occult, and you are offered clemency for any action you take in the defense of the greater good. You may investigate anyone or anything you deem to be in line with the forces of evil, for you alone are a holy blade in the dark, the arbiter of your church.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor.</p><h3>Exorcist's Doctrines</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Religion skill, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this skill.</p><h3>Trinkets</h3><p>By 3rd level, you’ve collected a number of magical trinkets to help you banish restless spirits and foul demonic forces. You can use the following trinkets:</p><p><em><strong>Alabaster Balm.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Hallowed Chalice.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can utter a prayer and produce a volume of holy water from this cup sufficient to fill five flasks. After 24 hours, this holy water becomes ordinary water.</p><p><em><strong>Reliquary of Doubt.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ppWAAEul0QHtm4er]{detect thoughts}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components. When you cast the spell in this way, you can only detect thoughts that are associated with negative emotions, such as guilt, apprehension, regret, and melancholy.</p><h3>Divine Strike</h3><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage to the target.</p><h3>Rote Piety</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you command a mastery of divine magic seldom seen among the clergy. You can use your Opportunistic Piety feature three times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Excommunication</h3><p>By 14th level, as an action, you can emblazon a mark of religious condemnation upon a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on your choice of a Constitution or Wisdom saving throw or be marked for 1 minute. While marked, the creature can’t regain hit points or have advantage on any attack roll or ability check. Additionally, whenever the creature takes an action, it takes 2d6 radiant damage as the mark burns with radiant light.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Medium</h2><p>As conduits between the living and dead, mediums offer an essential glimpse past the veil of mortality. Using their auguries, seances, and divinations, mediums can retrieve morsels of information from the afterlife to settle debts between the living or dead, and to assist ongoing investigations. This information, however cryptic, can point an interested party toward clues or evidence that only the deceased are able to provide.</p><h3>Fortelling</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you can receive glimpses of the future. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretold rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.</p><p>As an action, you can expend a use of your Rushed Incantation feature to make an additional foretold roll. You can have up to three foretold rolls at one time. Each foretold roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretold rolls.</p><h3>Trinkets</h3><p>By 3rd level, you’ve collected a number of objects that help you attune to the afterlife. You can use the following trinkets:</p><p><em><strong>Dead Ringer.</strong></em> As an action, you can ring this bell to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.I2LUSF5ogc7Bj62e]{speak with dead} spell</em> once without using a spell slot or spell components. When you cast the spell using this trinket, you can ask the corpse only one question.</p><p><em><strong>Heptagonal Spectacles.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.DQzlB5Y3k791W5bH]{see invisibility}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Lucent Mirror.</strong></em> You can use your bonus action to activate this trinket, causing you to phase partially into the Ethereal Plane for up to 1 minute. For the duration, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or object. Additionally, you have resistance to all damage. This effect ends early after you take any damage.</p><h3>Forewarning Presence</h3><p>By 6th level, the spirits of the dead guide your hand when you would falter. You can reroll an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make, and you must use the new roll. You can choose to use this feature after you make the roll, but before the GM determines whether it succeeds or fails.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Whispers from Beyond</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, as an action you can open your perceptions to receive a hint from beyond the pale. The GM answers with a one-word hint pertaining to your best course of action, a fruitful line of inquiry, or some other useful direction.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Third Eye</h3><p>By 14th level, your connection to the afterlife allows you to see all. You can use your bonus action to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XzkJpE6XpZfKjODD]{true seeing}</em> spell without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Occultist</h2><p>Vampires, demons, lycanthropes, and aberrations all have one thing in common: they are all magical threats, best combated through magical means. To meet these foes on a level playing field, occultists indulge in arcana, filling their grimoires with magical secrets and mastering a handful of spells. Occultists are the most likely investigators to cavort with warlocks, borrow tricks from wizards and magicians, and dabble in dark magic to defeat their foes.</p><h3>Trinket</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you’ve acquired a trinket to assist in your collection of eldritch lore:</p><p><em><strong>Rune Keeper’s Eyeglass.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can activate this trinket to gain the ability to read all writing for 1 hour.</p><h3>Pact Magic</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you augment your investigative skills with complex magics.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.QvPDSUsAiEn3hD8s.JournalEntryPage.mx4TsSbBIAaAkhQ7]{warlock spell list}. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> The Occultist Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level.</p><p>To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</strong></em> At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Occultist Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace is with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Use your investigator spell save DC and spell attack modifier for your warlock spells.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Occultist Spellcasting</td></tr><tr><td>Investigator Level</td><td>Cantrips Known</td><td>Spells Known</td><td>Spell Slots</td><td>Slot Level</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Eldritch Ruin</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your magical cunning to rip your foes asunder. When you use your Exploit Weakness feature, you can forgo dealing additional damage to instead cast a cantrip as a bonus action.</p><h3>Eyes of Another World</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, supernatural creatures can no longer escape your detection. You can see creatures and objects that are invisible or on the Ethereal Plane, and you can see the original form of shapechangers or creatures whose form has been altered by magic. Additionally, you can immediately detect if a creature you can see is possessed.</p><h3>Maleficium</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, when you use your Exploit Weakness feature against a creature, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pO4zGe5LmFIYqJiL]{bestow curse}</em> spell on that creature as a bonus action, without using a spell slot or spell components; the targeted creature has disadvantage on its saving throw against this spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Spy</h2><p>Infiltration, disguise, and lying through their teeth: these are the principal skills of a spy. A talented spy rarely ever needs to draw a dagger to silence someone, for their honeyed words and agreeable disposition are all that is needed to draw out someone’s secrets. Of course, when they do strike, it is decisively and without warning. Such skills are invaluable for governments and organizations of all varieties, for stealing confidential information, sabotage, monitoring persons of interest, and everything in between.</p><h3>Bravado</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, your knowing smile and infectious confidence inspires trust in most people you meet, even when you’re not telling the truth. You gain proficiency in the Deception skill, and you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Charisma, for Charisma (Deception) checks.</p><h3>Trinkets</h3><p>By 3rd level, you have a collection of trinkets that aid your espionage. You can use the following trinkets:</p><p><em><strong>Glass Dust.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can throw this dust in the air, becoming invisible until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if you take any damage.</p><p><em><strong>Horn-Rimmed Glasses.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.A3q2gTNqG6fvNGrv]{disguise self}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Martini Glass.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4]{suggestion}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><h3>Cloak and Dagger</h3><p>By 6th level, you always endeavor to kill your target in one strike. When you make an attack roll against a creature that is surprised or hasn’t taken a turn in combat yet, you can treat your weapon’s damage dice as having rolled their maximum value.</p><h3>Shaken Not Stirred</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, your roguish smile grants you incredible leeway. Whenever you fail a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can reroll the check, and you must use the new roll.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Body Double</h3><p>By 14th level, you can rapidly exchange identities with a corpse. When you reduce a Humanoid to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to assume the creature’s appearance, as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.A3q2gTNqG6fvNGrv]{disguise self}</em> spell. When you do so, the creature’s body, as well as its blood, clothing, and other physical evidence of its death, magically become invisible for 8 hours. You can also use this ability as an action to touch the corpse of a Humanoid that has been dead no longer than 24 hours, assuming its appearance and causing it to become invisible, as above.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>"

Indeed, warlocks are like ants too, stealing motes of power from beings too vast, too ancient to fully grasp. Their bargains are humble and transactional—a patron and their loyal servant—but not all otherworldly patrons recognize their warlocks. Some are too distant or too ambivalent to focus their attentions on a lowly mortal.</p><p>Warlocks do not usually form communities around their patrons, for each pact struck is a personal, and often desperate, bargain. Congregations that do form around otherworldly patrons are aptly labeled cults, and range from benign fraternities to esoteric apocalypse-bringers.

An inky smoke that curls and drifts about the plane, they are infamous for claiming every incautious traveler that wanders into their misty embrace. Yet the Dead Mists aren’t a mere astral hazard: they possess a grim intelligence, an intent, and a bottomless well of necromantic power.</p><p>Warlocks that embrace the Dead Mists unlock a terrible type of necromancy: the ability to trade pure life essence for arcana.

As a bonus action, you can choose to lose hit points equal to 1d8 for each level of your Pact Magic spell slots. At the start of your next turn, you regain an expended Pact Magic spell slot. If this ability reduces you to 0 hit points, you are knocked unconscious, even if you have temporary hit points.</p><p>Because of the soul-draining nature of the Dead Mists, you can’t regain hit points from any spell you cast.</p><h3>Feed The Soul</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, your body begins to merge with the Dead Mists, allowing you to heal your mortal form by burning eldritch energy. As an action on your turn, you can consume one of your available Pact Magic spell slots to regain 1d8 hit points for each level of the spell slot consumed. This amount of healing can’t be increased or maximized.</p><h3>Fog Form</h3><p>At 10th level, you learn to fully immerse yourself in the Dead Mists, transforming into a hazy, misty reflection of your true self. As an action, you can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.JW1Sg3udEcvV15IR]{gaseous form}</em>, targeting yourself only, without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><h3>Master of the Mists</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, once on each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a hostile creature with a warlock spell, you drain some of the target’s life essence with the Dead Mists. You regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Charisma modifier, up to a maximum of the damage dealt.</p><h2>The Future You</h2><p>Your patron is you in a decades-distant future. Perhaps your future self found an artifact of great power connecting them to the past, which they must now lead you to discover, or perhaps they were taught the mystic arts by their future self long ago, a cycle you will have to continue by teaching yourself someday. Your future self has forgotten the fine details of some things, and outright refuses to tell you about things you “can’t know yet,” but offers compelling insight and guidance nonetheless. You’re not quite sure what your future self is planning for your future (and for their past), but one thing is certain—they need you alive.</p><h3>Future You Quirks</h3><p>Strange effects linger after communicating with your future self. You gain one of the following traits:</p><p></p><p>[[/r 1d6]]</p><table><thead><tr><td>d6</td><td>Personality Traits</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>You often speak in the wrong tense or refer to yourself in a plural.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You sometimes refer to a person you just met by name, before they’ve introduced themselves.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Even in dire circumstances, you are unreasonably calm.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>In certain lighting, you look much older than you are.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Seeing certain people alive can instantly reduce you to tears.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Your future fashion sense clashes completely with that of today.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>Your future self lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

When you take a short or long rest, your GM rolls a d20 and a d4 in secret and records the number rolled on the d20. The GM tells you the number recorded, unless they rolled a 4 on the d4; in that case, they give you false information: a random number from 1 to 20.</p><p>You can replace any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make with this recorded value. You must choose to do so before the roll and can only use this recorded value once. If the GM gave you false information, they inform you after you replace the roll.</p><h3>I Could Do With Fewer Scars</h3><p>At 6th level, your future self often warns you of particular attacks to watch out for. When a creature you can see makes an attack against you, you can use your reaction to gain a +10 bonus to your AC against that attack.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Expect An Ambush</h3><p>At 10th level, your future self always warns you about potential ambushes. As a result, you can’t be surprised while you are conscious, and you have advantage on initiative rolls.</p><h3>Grandfather Paradox</h3><p>At 14th level, your knowledge of the future allows you to exploit some of the rules of spacetime. As an action, you can goad a creature that can hear you into causing a paradox. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is stunned for up to 1 minute, locked between two opposing timelines while the paradox sorts itself out. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>The GM</h2><p>None of this is real, not a lick of it. You, me, the whole damn world: we’re nothing but pencil scratches on some pieces of paper. It doesn’t matter if you believe me, because there’s nothing you or I can do about it. The world is the way it is, and it only exists so long as the GM wants to tell a story. After that, the whole thing goes poof.</p><p>The GM isn’t one creature. It might be male, female, or neither. Maybe it’s old, young, smart, dumb, or any one of a million different things. The GM may be no more powerful than a commoner in its own world, but to our world, its will is absolute. The GM grants us our powers, and its laws and decisions dictate the way everything in our world works. In fact, it can change the very fabric of reality on a whim. Those that fight the will of the GM find that its ire is easy to rouse and hard to be rid of, but if you cater to its wishes and play along with the story that it wants to tell, you might find that things go very well for you.</p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>The enigmatic GM lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">The GM Expanded Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{detect magic}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{identify}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.4v2H3hHb3Ph9XLNd]{augury}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.SleYkHovQ8NagmeV]{locate object}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.cg50KpBkBdPK6vPL]{clairvoyance}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9]{divination}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gXtzz9t1DTzJeLr4]{locate creature}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{commune}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.W4Qx5z0id6da0vqg]{legend lore}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Player Character</h3><p>Beginning at 1st level, you have grasped the profound secret that you are merely under the control of a far-distant player, making you a player character, one of the GM’s favorite playthings. You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks that you make to interact with friendly Humanoids. However, you only gain this benefit when doing so would advance the plot in a way that the GM feels is appropriate.</p><h3>Fudge The Roll</h3><p>By 6th level, your player has gotten a taste of success and wants to look as impressive as possible while achieving it. Consequently, they might occasionally fudge a cosmic die roll in your favor. When you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can nudge the d20 slightly, changing the number to one of the three sides adjacent to the topmost side. Alternatively, you can reroll the die. You must use the new result.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. However, you can push your luck and attempt to use it additional times between rests; doing so might evoke the GM’s wrath, however, and cause unpredictable negative side effects, decided by the GM.</p><h3>Plot Armor</h3><p>By 10th level, you’ve learned that the universe follows an overarching plot, and your role in the plot is critical. As such, the GM conspires to keep you and your allies alive. When you finish a short or long rest, you and each of your allies that rested with you gains temporary hit points equal to your warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>OP Class Feature</h3><p>At 14th level, you have stored up enough cache with the GM to use abilities other player characters would be punished for employing. You can use your bonus action to break the balance of the game. For the next minute, you roll advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. For this duration, you roll three d20s and take the highest number rolled for advantage, instead of two as normal.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>The Legacy</h2><p>Rather than forging a pact inked by blood or bound to your soul, you have inherited a Legacy, a patron embodied by a line of inheritors sworn to a sacred cause. In so doing, you have acquired a relic of this ancient legacy, an object of unimaginable power passed down through the generations or recently uncovered from a long-lost civilization. With it, you can transform into the most powerful version of yourself to continue your Legacy’s fight.</p><p>Countless Legacies have imbued warlocks with ancient powers, and only a few remain today, but each possesses a unique type of relic and bestows a unique type of transformation. How you use this transformation is ultimately up to you, but the Legacy conspires to see you achieve greatness and advance its unknowable ancient goals.</p><p>@UUID[.BVtehGmYhy25yppE]{Sidebar: Magical Girls and Superheroes}</p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>Your ancient Legacy lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

The exact nature of the transformation varies from Legacy to Legacy, but it always changes your appearance and confers dramatic power. While transformed, you have the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.</li><li>Unless a creature has truesight or watches you transform, you can’t be recognized as your true identity.</li><li>You have a pool of battle dice, which are d6s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative. Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Battle Dice table below.</li><li>Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can roll a battle die and add it to the attack’s damage roll.</li></ul><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Battle Dice</td></tr><tr><td>Warlock Level</td><td>Battle Dice</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>3d8</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3d10</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>4d10</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Relic Force</h3><p>Relics of Legacy are always tied to the fundamental forces of magic, nature, and the elements. At 1st level, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or radiant. While transformed, whenever you deal damage with a warlock spell, warlock ability, or Pact Weapon, you can deal the chosen type of damage instead of the spell, ability, or weapon’s normal damage type.</p><h3>Resolute Legacy</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, while transformed, you can emanate an aura of courage as an action. For the next minute, you and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on death saving throws and saving throws against being frightened. Additionally, for the duration, you can expend a battle die as a bonus action to heal a willing creature within the aura, which regains hit points equal to the die roll + your Charisma modifier.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Aura of Legend</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, while transformed, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you gain resistance to your Relic Force damage type.</p><h3>Final Legacy</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, while you are transformed, you can use your action to begin charging the power of your allies into an ultimate attack. Until the start of your next turn, each friendly creature within 10 feet of you can use their action to aid your charge. At the start of your next turn, you fire a massive beam of force in a 120-foot long, 5-foot wide line in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 10d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The beam’s damage increases by 4d10 for each creature that aided your charge, up to a maximum of 30d10 force damage.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>The Magician</h2><p>While all warlocks are skilled in the art of magic, very few are what most people would consider “magicians,” skilled in the arts of physical illusion, sleight of hand, and showmanship. Those with such talents might find themselves drawn to the mysterious Magician, believed to be a minor trickster deity (who most often takes the form of a white rabbit), long forgotten and bereft of worshipers. Under the Magician’s patronage, warlocks command an amalgamation of real and fake magic, such that it’s never clear if they’re casting spells, performing a ruse, or putting on a show.</p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>The Magician lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Magician Expanded Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{find familiar}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.IBJmWjzbQGu7M4UX]{fog cloud}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1nhIxh0DsJsntCfj]{knock}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ap4dmtshjEbwU3Ts]{rope trick}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.GSvLWcdCZLQkilXT]{blink}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.I2LUSF5ogc7Bj62e]{speak with dead}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8sgwRh8NUNkn9Vi0]{secret chest}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.lnaGnxMzpYnbw1uU]{creation}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MBMaQLwoy05qzMJ3]{mislead}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Abracadabra</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Sleight of Hand skill, and you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.kO58RzJzUhspsGVb]{card trick}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.udsLtG0BugXHR2JQ]{prestidigitation}</em> cantrips, which do not count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p>Additionally, you can attempt to cast any cantrip that you do not know from the wizard spell list by succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma check. While being cast, the cantrip counts as a warlock spell for you. On a failure, the spell fails.</p><h3>Impressive Escape</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your Charisma modifier instead of the normal modifier for Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks, and you can add your Charisma modifier to all skill checks involving picking locks, escaping ropes or manacles, or other similar feats of escape artistry.</p><p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can vanish in a puff of smoke, a shower of confetti, or a number of released doves, teleporting to any unoccupied location you choose within 120 feet. You can only choose a destination from which no conscious creature can see you appear.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Alakazam</h3><p>When you reach 10th level, you learn to alter your spellcasting in a number of ways, both to hide it from your audience and to expand your magical repertoire. Whenever you cast a warlock spell of 1st level or higher using a warlock spell slot, you can manipulate it in one of two ways:</p><p><em><strong>Conceal.</strong></em> You can cast the spell without using spell components by succeeding on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DC for this check equals 8 + the spell’s level. On a failure, the spell fails and its spell slot is wasted. You can’t use this ability on a spell with material components that have a cost.</p><p><em><strong>Transmute.</strong></em> You can attempt to cast any other spell from the wizard spell list of the same level or lower instead of the spell you initially cast. When you do so, you must succeed on a Charisma check with a DC equal to 12 + the spell’s level. Otherwise, the spell fails and its spell slot is wasted.</p><h3>Master of Illusions</h3><p>Upon reaching 14th level, you gain a mastery over illusion magic. You can cast the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.K2tem6K7bmu3fgCj]{silent image}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.Whdlp3QOGWWUpSkC]{major image}</em> at will without using a spell slot or spell components, and you can concentrate on one of these spells in addition to another spell.</p><h2>The Symbiont</h2><p>Though most warlocks forge pacts with distant, intangible entities, your patron is a physical being of incomprehensible power—a being that dwells inside your very body. This arrangement was struck in the spirit of symbiosis: your patron, which resembles a muscular, living ichor, requires a mortal dwelling, and you in turn may profit from its magic. You can even draw your patron out from where it resides in your blood, causing it to seep forth onto your skin until you are a monstrous hybrid of ichor, replete with claws and teeth to rend your foes asunder.</p><h3>Expanded Spell List</h3><p>The Symbiont lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

You can undergo this transformation or reverse it as a bonus action on your turn. While transformed, you can’t cast spells, but transforming doesn’t break your concentration or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you’ve already cast. While transformed, you gain the following benefits:</p><p><em><strong>The Flesh.</strong></em> When you aren't wearing armor, your base AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can use The Flesh to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use The Flesh.</p><p><em><strong>The Claws.</strong></em> You sprout a set of wicked claws, which you can use as natural melee weapons to make claw attacks. You are proficient with your claw attacks and can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength, for their attack and damage rolls. On a hit, your claws deal 1d8 slashing damage, which counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, your claws count as pact weapons for warlock class features.</p><p><em><strong>Extra Attack.</strong></em> Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice with your claws, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h3>Traumatic Rend</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can rake your foe’s eyes with your claws to discourage its attacks. When you hit the same creature with your claws twice on your turn, you can make an additional attack using your claws against the target (no action required). On a hit, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your turn.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Lifedrain</h3><p>By 10th level, your parasitic patron can draw life from those around you. While you are conscious, whenever you deal damage to a hostile creature using your claws, you regain 1d4 hit points.</p><h3>Violence After Death</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, if you should fall in combat, your Symbiont shall keep fighting. If you drop to 0 hit points while transformed with your @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.WytY59DFKoYPFmcc]{Symbiotic Transformation}, you don't fall prone or begin making death saving throws until the end of your next turn. Instead, your Symbiont controls your actions, acting as if you weren't unconscious, attacking any hostile creatures it sees. If you take any damage while at 0 hit points, you instantly fall unconscious and suffer one death saving throw failure. At the end of your next turn, you collapse and begin to make death saving throws as normal.</p><h2>New Pact Boons</h2><p>At 3rd level, you gain a Pact Boon, a unique gift from your patron embodied in an occult symbol. In addition to the three options provided in the core rules—the Pact of the Blade, Pact of the Chain, and Pact of the Tome—the following three options are available to you.</p><h3>Pact of the Cloak</h3><p>As a bonus action, you can summon a cloak, coat, or robe which aids your movement and mobility. This pact cloak appears on your body, fitting over any other clothes or armor, and it doesn’t impede your movement, vision, or your ability to wear other equipment. While wearing your pact cloak, you constantly float a few inches off the ground. You ignore the effects of difficult terrain, your speed increases by 10 feet, and you can walk across fluid surfaces such as water and quicksand.</p><p>You can dismiss your pact cloak as a bonus action.</p><h3>Pact of the Flame</h3><p>Your patron grants you a mote of chaotic, otherworldly power. Your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p><h3>Pact of the Skin</h3><p>You give yourself over completely to your patron, taking on greater aspects of your benefactor in exchange for more power. Your skin changes to reflect this, changing form and becoming more resistant to damage. When you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a nonmagical attack that isn’t silvered, you can subtract 3 from the damage taken.</p><h2>New Invocations</h2><p>When you choose Eldritch Invocations starting at 2nd level, the following options are available to you.</p><h3>Abyssal Concord</h3><p>You can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.URfqlyn3WBra96bM]{might of the abyss}</em> once using a warlock spell slot.

You have been trained in archery on horseback, to fire a bow while blindfolded, and to pinpoint the wings of an insect in flight. As you attain peace and oneness with your arrow, no feat of archery will prove to be beyond your grasp.</p><h3>Archery Fighting Style</h3><p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h3>Bow Arts</h3><p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the longbow and shortbow, which are considered monk weapons for you. Any ranged weapon attacks you make while within 5 feet of a hostile creature do not have disadvantage. Also, you can spend ki points to use the Flurry of Arrows and Soul Arrow features.</p><p>At 6th level, you can make a ranged weapon attack to deliver a Stunning Strike.</p><p><em><strong>Flurry of Arrows.</strong></em> Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn to make a ranged weapon attack or an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to make an additional ranged weapon attack as a bonus action.</p><p><em><strong>Soul Arrow.</strong></em> When you take the Attack action on your turn to make a ranged weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to fire a soul arrow for the first attack. A soul arrow is a normal arrow of its type which ignores half and three-quarters cover and deals extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier on a hit. Firing a soul arrow doesn’t consume ammunition.</p><h3>Intercepting Shot</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, when an attacker you can see makes an attack against you, you can make a ranged attack roll as a reaction to interrupt the attack. If the result of your roll is greater than the result of the attacker, you can reduce the attack roll targeting you by 5, to a minimum of 1.</p><h3>Serenity of the Wind</h3><p>By 11th level, you can listen to the wind to see the otherwise invisible. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to gain blindsight with a range of 120 feet until the end of your next turn.</p><p>At 17th level, you always have blindsight out to 30 feet.</p><h3>Zen Archery</h3><p>At 17th level, if you make a ranged weapon attack on your turn and miss, you can immediately make another ranged weapon attack against the same target. You can only gain one additional attack during your turn with this ability.</p><h2>Way of the Flagellant</h2><p>The Way of the Flagellant teaches an extreme, sometimes heretical, view of asceticism: peace comes through suffering, purity through pain. Its practitioners shun all indulgences and embrace pain to harness their ki, isolating themselves further from the material world. As such, these monks often carry their eponymous flails and whips to use on both themselves and their foes. Their pain is a mortal penitence and an act of focusing, letting them block out all else and manipulate their ki with expert intent.</p><h3>Ascetic Implements</h3><p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn the techniques of the Way of the Flagellant, including their signature weapons. You gain proficiency with flails and whips, which count as monk weapons for you.</p><p>Additionally, you can choose to deal slashing instead of bludgeoning damage with your unarmed strikes.</p><h3>Penitent Lash</h3><p>At 3rd level, when you start your turn, you can sharpen your focus by spending 1 ki point and striking yourself with a ritualistic flail. You can choose to take one or more d4s of slashing damage. For each d4 of slashing damage you choose to take, you gain advantage on one attack you make before the end of your turn. Each attack must use a monk weapon or unarmed strike. This ability has no effect if you reduce or avoid taking the slashing damage.</p><h3>Art of Punishment</h3><p>By 6th level, your expertise in the purifying discipline of pain has granted you new ways to share agony. You gain the following abilities:</p><p><em><strong>Branding Palm.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action to brand the creature. The next attack that hits a branded creature within the next minute deals an extra 2d8 fire damage. At 11th level, this damage increases to 3d8, and at 17th level, this damage increases to 4d8.</p><p><em><strong>Electroshock Strike.</strong></em> Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XvbiNhNqXXIFisIy]{shocking grasp}</em> cantrip as a bonus action. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p><p><em><strong>Scissorhand Technique.</strong></em> If you deal slashing damage to a creature with a monk weapon or unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to give the target a bleeding wound. Constructs, Oozes, and Undead can’t get bleeding wounds. A creature loses 1d6 hit points at the start of each of its turns for each of its bleeding wounds unless it uses an action to staunch the bleeding of all of its wounds. While a target is bleeding, it can’t regain lost hit points. A creature can have a number of bleeding wounds up to your proficiency bonus.</p><h3>Purity Through Pain</h3><p>Beginning at 11th level, you enter a rapturous frenzy when wounded. Whenever you take damage in excess of your character level, you can use your reaction to regain 1d4 ki points. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Exsanguinate</h3><p>Beginning at 17th level, when you use your Penitent Lash feature and take 6d4 or more slashing damage, your unarmed strikes deal an extra 1d4 slashing damage on a hit until the end of your turn.</p><h2>Way of the Four Fists</h2><p>Through the careful manipulation of their ki, monks of the Way of the Four Fists strive to emulate the unusual fighting style of the legendary Monkey King. As they progress in their training, these monks undergo a magical transformation, slowly gaining more simian features. In combat, a master of this monastic tradition is a whirling, leaping blur of elbows, fur, and fists.</p><h3>Grasp of the Monkey</h3><p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you undergo a permanent magical transformation, lengthening your fingers and toes, strengthening your arms and legs, and sprouting a tail. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, your jumping distance is doubled, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to climb, maintain your balance, and grip objects such as ledges or ropes. You can hold and manipulate objects and weapons with your hands, feet, and tail, but you can’t make attacks with weapons held by your tail.</p><h3>Simian Swift</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, whenever you roll initiative and aren’t surprised, you can spend 1 ki point to move up to half your speed or jump into the air, and then make one unarmed strike.</p><h3>Nimbus</h3><p>At 6th level, you can use your bonus action to summon a cloud to ride upon. Until the start of your next turn, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. When you begin your turn, you can maintain this effect by spending 1 ki point. Otherwise, if you begin your turn and have nothing holding you aloft, you fall.</p><h3>Uncanny Dodge</h3><p>Starting at 11th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p><h3>Flurry of Limbs</h3><p>At 17th level, by walking on your hands and twirling erratically, you can fight with your feet as nimbly as you do with your fists. You make three unarmed strikes, rather than two, when you use Flurry of Blows on your turn.</p><h2>Way of the Mask</h2><p>When you put on your mask, you’re not an ordinary (albeit impossibly handsome) commoner anymore; you’re the greatest wrestler the world has ever known. You’ll wrestle anyone—or anything—that comes within arm’s reach. Sometimes you wrestle inanimate objects just to prove that you can. That one time you wrestled an owlbear? Totally happened. For real.</p><p>People come from all around to get a shot against you, to unmask you and take your championship belt. Everyone wants to beat the champ; too bad no one ever will.</p><p>@UUID[.t2wYpsNyrZn6SYdc#mask-and-wrestling-gimmick]{Sidebar: Mask and Wrestling Gimmick}</p><h3>Crowd Favorite</h3><p>The roar of the crowd lives inside you. Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can choose to add your Charisma modifier, instead of your Wisdom modifier, to your ki save DC. Additionally, your Unarmored Defense is calculated as follows: while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Strength modifier + your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Heavyweight Champion</h3><p>When presented with an obstacle, your first instinct is to wrestle it, even if the obstacle in question is not conventionally wrestle-able, like a dragon, an ooze, or an awkward conversation. At 3rd level, you gain the following features:</p><ul><li>You can attempt to grapple any creature, regardless of its size.</li><li>You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.</li><li>If you have the Grappler feat, you can choose whether a target grappled by you must make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to escape.</li></ul><h3>Signature Move</h3><p>At 6th level, you master a signature move, which soon becomes synonymous with your exploits. Choose one of the following features of your choice. Each of these features has a suggested name, but you can choose any name for your signature move, preferably one that sounds good being chanted by a crowd and yelled by you while you perform it.</p><p><em><strong>Foreign Object.</strong></em> You are proficient with improvised weapons, which count as monk weapons for you. Once on each of your turns, you can spend 1 ki point to add half your monk level to the damage of an improvised weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Headbutt of Justice.</strong></em> Once on each of your turns when you miss with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to follow it up with a quick headbutt. Make a second unarmed strike against the same target. The damage die of this unarmed strike is 1d8.</p><p><em><strong>Infinity Suplex.</strong></em> While you are grappling another creature, you can use your bonus action and spend 1 ki point to end the grapple early by hurling your opponent over your shoulder and slamming them into the ground. Make an attack roll against the creature you are grappling. On a hit, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d10 + your Strength modifier and is knocked prone. The grapple then ends.</p><h3>Off the Top Rope</h3><p>At 11th level, once per turn whenever you fall 5 feet or more immediately before making an unarmed strike, you can choose to either make a stunning strike without expending ki or to knock the target prone and automatically grapple the target on a hit.</p><h3>Choked Out</h3><p>By 17th level, your chokeholds can knock out dragons. When you pin a creature grappled by you, you can spend 2 ki points to attempt to choke the creature out. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your ki save DC. On a failure, the creature is knocked unconscious, rather than restrained, until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Way of the Rose</h2><p>One of several flower-themed monastic traditions practiced in the Feywild, the Way of the Rose emphasizes the importance of love and compassion in all things. Although the monastery is closely associated with the Rose Court, all are welcome to join, including human visitors from the Material Plane.</p><h3>Sweet Aroma</h3><p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your spirit has taken on a floral aspect, causing you to smell of roses at all times. You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks relating to love or romance. Furthermore, creatures with the Keen Smell trait (or similar abilities) have disadvantage on ability checks made to track you.</p><h3>Blossom Burst</h3><p>At 3rd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to produce a vibrant eruption of flower petals which obscures the target’s vision. Until the end of the target’s next turn, it can see out to 5 feet but is blind beyond this radius. The flower petals follow the creature when it moves unless the creature takes the Dash action or moves more than 40 feet on its turn.</p><h3>Falling Petal Flurry</h3><p>At 6th level, you can perform a special technique that allows you to disappear in a blizzard of rose petals. Whenever you use your Flurry of Blows, you can teleport up to 10 feet in any direction. This movement can take place before, during, or after the attacks, but can’t be split into two moves.</p><h3>Colors of Love</h3><p>By 11th level, you can manifest the love represented by the rose in a faintly glowing aura. When you finish a long rest, choose one of the following auras, which lasts until you use this feature to choose a different one. The aura radiates 5 feet from you.</p><p><em><strong>Pink.</strong></em> The color of gratitude, attuning to the pink rose turns a good deed into its own reward. You can use the Help action as a bonus action to assist an ally within your aura.</p><p><em><strong>Red.</strong></em> The color of desire, attuning to the red rose fills you with burning passion. A friendly creature other than you within the aura can use its bonus action when it hits with an attack to deal an extra 1d6 damage.</p><p><em><strong>White.</strong></em> The color of purity, attuning to the white rose aligns your ki with the heavens. When a friendly creature other than you ends its turn within your aura, it gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p><h3>Wreathed in Thorns</h3><p>Once you reach 17th level, you distract your foes with your stunning beauty and bouquets of flowers, opening them up to lightning-quick counterattacks. When you take damage from a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, you can spend 1 ki point as a reaction to make an unarmed strike against that creature.</p><h2>Way of Street Fighting</h2><p>The Way of Street Fighting is an urban discipline founded on necessity, whose blindingly fast, unique brand of martial arts has been honed and perfected in back-alley brawls and tournaments alike. Monks who adopt this relatively new technique place comparatively little value on spiritual enlightenment and karmic balance; the thrill of split-second timing, rapid combos, and decisive knock-outs drive them to become the best combatants in the world.</p><h3>Combo</h3><p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain bonuses for successful consecutive hits on a single target. On your turn, you gain a +2 bonus to the attack rolls of your unarmed strikes for each hit that you have made on that target on your turn, to a maximum of +6. This bonus resets to 0 if you take damage on your turn.</p><h3>Iron Fist</h3><p>By 6th level, your unarmed strikes and monk weapons ignore the damage threshold of objects and deal maximum damage to them.</p><h3>Special Moves</h3><p>At 11th level, you have memorized and mastered patterns of discrete movements that unlock your ki, allowing you to use the following special moves:</p><p><em><strong>Ki Blast.</strong></em> You can channel your ki into a blast of energy. As an action, you can expend 2 ki points to make a ranged spell attack (using your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus) against a creature you can see within 120 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 6d8 + half your monk level.</p><p><em><strong>Uppercut.</strong></em> Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to perform an uppercut. Make an unarmed strike as a bonus action. On a hit, if the target is Large or smaller and doesn’t have all of its hit points, it takes damage as normal and is then knocked off its feet and falls prone.</p><p><em><strong>Whirlwind Strike.</strong></em> Whenever you make a melee attack on your turn against a creature you can see, you can spend 1 ki point to lunge up to 15 feet toward your target before making the attack. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. You can perform this movement even if it causes you to travel through the air, though you fall after making the attack if you have nothing holding you aloft.</p><h3>K.O.</h3><p>Beginning at 17th level, you can spend 3 ki points to channel your ki into a single strike, knocking a foe unconscious. As an action, make an unarmed strike against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes damage as normal. If the creature has 100 or fewer hit points after you deal damage, it is reduced to 0 hit points, is knocked unconscious, and becomes stable.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>"

          "text": "<h2>Monks and Stereotypes</h2><p>The monk class is inexcusably descended from a long lineage of cultural stereotypes and martial arts movie tropes. This book, therefore, attempts to reframe the class as a celebration of unarmed fighters from various perspectives, eastern and western, fictional and historical. It is the author’s hope that a broad cast of subclasses might provide palatable shades of this class for prospective players. Failing that, this book also presents unarmed subclasses for the druid, fighter, and ranger, as well as the pugilist auxiliary level, for use as alternatives to the monk class as a whole.</p><h2>Mask and Wrestling Gimmick</h2><p>People know you far and wide by the mask that you wear. Whenever you are in combat (and in much of your time outside combat) you wear a tight mask, made of leather or cloth, ornately decorated in a theme of your choice. Your mask’s theme must tie into your wrestling persona, which you adopt to stir crowds and build your legend. For example, your mask might include furs to look like a werewolf, a fin to resemble a shark, or dark colors to evoke an executioner’s garb.</p>"

          "text": "<p>A grinning gnome cackles with glee as he hurls a bomb into a group of charging goblins, blasting them into scorched chunks. He produces another, throws it at his feet, and disappears, still laughing, into the ensuing cloud of smoke.</p><p>A slender elf quickly mixes liquids and herbs in a small bowl. She applies the mixture to an arrow wound on an injured dwarf’s side, which immediately stops bleeding.</p><p>Whether their methods are explosive, transformative, or restorative, alchemists live to transmute the world around them to their liking.</p><h2>Chemical Reactions</h2><p>One of the first things an alchemist learns is how to mix chemicals that react explosively with each other. Ostensibly, this is taught to students to prevent deadly accidents, but adventuring alchemists regularly apply this knowledge to create bombs.</p><p>An alchemical bomb is a 1-pound, apple-sized, spherical glass or clay flask filled with a reactive chemical. A smaller vial of thin glass containing a reagent is suspended in the liquid, and the whole thing is sealed with a cork or wax seal. The chemicals violently explode when mixed. This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles.</p><h2>Serums and Tinctures</h2><p>More experienced alchemists learn to mix less volatile substances into potions, alchemical concoctions that replicate magical effects. These potions range from the medicinal, such as <em>potions of healing</em>, to the transformative, such as <em>potions of gaseous form</em>, to the downright deadly, such as <em>potions of poison</em>. Undisputed masters of potions, alchemists constantly innovate with new formulations and preparations, improving their potions into magic items in their own right.</p><h2>Elemental Sciences</h2><p>The primary source of alchemy’s power comes from the elemental planes. It is no surprise, then, that alchemists strive to tap deeper into that power, researching and discovering new compounds composed of the elements. The pinnacle of alchemy is the philosopher’s stone, which is rumored to grant its bearer supreme elemental power. Few alchemists have succeeded in creating a philosopher’s stone, and fewer still remain alive to divulge its secrets.</p><h2>Creating an Alchemist</h2><p>When you create an alchemist, consider why you study alchemy. Are you attracted to its dangerous power or its ability to help others? Do you desire to use magic, but lack the aptitude or inborn ability?</p><p>Why do you adventure? Are you searching for new alchemical formulae or rare ingredients? Do you, like so many, seek the philosopher’s stone?</p><p>Be sure to understand alchemy’s place in your campaign world. You might have learned your trade from a master or studied alongside artificers and wizards in a university. Your trade might be commonplace or an oddity. Depending on the setting, you might be respected for your knowledge or feared for your destructive potential.</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Choose any background of your choice, preferably one that lends insight into your history with alchemy.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[.CSUPPVVFNBB5wB8n]{Alchemist Class Table}</p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"6\">The Alchemist</td></tr><tr><td>Level</td><td>Proficiency Bonus</td><td>Formulae Known</td><td>Reagent Dice</td><td>Discoveries Known</td><td>Features</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>Bombs, Natural Philosopher</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>Bomb Formulae, Field of Study</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>3</td><td>3d10</td><td>—</td><td>Reagent</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>3</td><td>4d10</td><td>2</td><td>Ability Score Improvement, Discoveries</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>4</td><td>5d10</td><td>2</td><td>Flashbang</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>4</td><td>6d10</td><td>3</td><td>Field of Study feature</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>5</td><td>7d10</td><td>3</td><td>Potions improvement</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>5</td><td>8d10</td><td>3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>6</td><td>9d10</td><td>4</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>6</td><td>10d10</td><td>4</td><td>Field of Study feature</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>7</td><td>11d10</td><td>4</td><td>Evasion</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>7</td><td>12d10</td><td>4</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>8</td><td>13d10</td><td>5</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>8</td><td>14d10</td><td>5</td><td>Potions improvement</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>9</td><td>15d10</td><td>5</td><td>Blast Coating</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>9</td><td>16d10</td><td>5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>10</td><td>17d10</td><td>6</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>10</td><td>18d10</td><td>6</td><td>Field of Study feature</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>11</td><td>19d10</td><td>6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>11</td><td>20d10</td><td>6</td><td>Philosopher’s Stone</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h1>Class Features</h1><p>As an alchemist, you gain the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d6 per alchemist level</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong></em> 6 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong></em> 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per alchemist level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><em><strong>Armor:</strong></em> Light armor</p><p><em><strong>Weapons:</strong></em> Simple weapons, bombs</p><p><em><strong>Tools:</strong></em> Alchemist’s supplies, herbalism kit</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws:</strong></em> Dexterity, Intelligence</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Choose three from Arcana, History, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Survival</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(<em>a</em>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<em>b</em>) any simple weapon</li><li>(<em>a</em>) an explorer’s pack or (<em>b</em>) a scholar’s pack</li><li>Alchemist’s supplies and (<em>a</em>) a vial of acid, (<em>b</em>) a flask of alchemist’s fire, or (<em>c</em>) a vial of basic poison</li><li>Leather armor and a dagger</li></ul><h2>Natural Philosopher</h2><div><p>You have learned much about alchemy during your studies. Starting at 1st level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded up, to any ability check you make to identify herbs, potions, poisons, or other alchemical substances. If the ability check already includes your proficiency bonus, you can add this bonus in addition to your normal proficiency bonus.</p><h2>Bombs</h2><p>At 1st level, you can create volatile alchemical bombs using your alchemist’s supplies. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can create a number of bombs equal to 10 + twice your alchemist level. For you the cost of materials necessary to create these bombs is negligible. After 24 hours, an unused bomb becomes inert. The statistics of a bomb are shown in the Bomb sidebar below.</p><p><em><strong>Priming Bombs.</strong></em> Once per turn you can take the Use an Object action to prime a bomb with explosive reagents and make an attack with it, increasing the bomb’s explosive potential. When you do so, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, to the bomb’s damage roll.</p><p>Additionally, when you throw a bomb in this way, its damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em> When you throw a bomb, the save DC for its blast radius is calculated as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Bomb save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p>@UUID[.kbQn41zsn4DObUia]{Sidebar: Bomb}</p><h2>Bomb Formulae</h2><p>By 2nd level, your research has granted you insight into new alchemical formulations for your bombs. Select three bomb formulae from the Bomb Formulae section. Once per turn when you prime a bomb, you can apply a formula to it. Applying a formula sometimes changes all of the damage dice rolled for a bomb, but also grants it special effects.</p><p>When you gain certain levels in this class, you learn additional formulae of your choice, as shown in the Bomb Formulae Known column of the Alchemist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the formulae you know and replace it with another formula.</p><h2>Field of Study</h2><p>While all alchemists share a common knowledge base, most alchemists specialize into a particular field of study. When you reach 2nd level, you select your field of study, which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 18th level.</p><p>A formula granted by your field of study doesn’t count against the total number of formulae you know.</p><h2>Reagent</h2><p>Starting at 3rd level, you have a collection of powerful alchemical reagents, represented by a pool of reagent dice, that you can spend to brew potions or magnify the power of your explosives.</p><h3>Reagent Dice</h3><p>You start with three reagent dice, which are d10s, and you gain additional reagent dice as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Reagent Dice column of the Alchemist table. You regain all expended reagent dice when you finish a long rest.</p><p>When you prime a bomb, you can expend a number of reagent dice up to your proficiency bonus and add the dice to the bomb’s damage roll.</p><h3>Brewing Potions</h3><p>You can spend 10 minutes and expend any number of reagent dice to brew potions. These potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they become inert. If a potion calls for a saving throw, it uses your bomb save DC.</p><p>The number of reagent dice and the alchemist level required to brew a potion are given on the Potions table.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Potions</td></tr><tr><td>Potion</td><td>Cost</td><td>Alchemist Level</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.aMnWi1WXWpxRHq4r]{Potion of Climbing}</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.gTRFQLdVD1gsKtPi]{Potion of Growth}</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of Healing}</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.CAZMwFBWp9VC0ZCg]{Potion of Water Breathing}</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.MAwoj2suj6cvb9Ti]{Universal Solvent}</td><td>1 reagent die</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.QyZJj34gB0pWYXx7]{Cure-All}</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.L887NdWEP5NqHCrQ]{Potion of Greater Healing}</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.wNKYbKYwOHbA7SH8]{Potion of Heroism}</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Resistance</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.zJ5LhDvTxYKzPIx4]{Sovereign Glue} (1 ounce)</td><td>2 reagent dice</td><td>7th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.HY8duCwmvlXOruTG]{Potion of Diminution}</td><td>3 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.eTNc8XPtvZNe3yQs]{Potion of Flying}</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.mhFBTY0egW8AeCHe]{Potion of Hill Giant Strength}</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.rTn4p9nJr4Aq2GPB]{Potion of Invisibility}</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.5m9ErO9In8Uc5yyf]{Potion of Superior Healing}</td><td>4 reagent dice</td><td>14th</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Reagent Synthesis</h3><p>When you finish a short rest, you can choose to regain all of your expended reagent dice that weren’t used to brew potions. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Discoveries</h2><p>In the course of your research, you have made a number of discoveries regarding the nature of alchemy. At 4th level, you gain two discoveries of your choice. When you gain certain alchemist levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries Known column of the Alchemist table.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><p>Alternatively, as an alchemist, when you gain an ability score improvement, you can instead choose to learn a new discovery for which you meet the prerequisites.</p><h2>Flashbang</h2><p>Beginning at 5th level, you carry a supply of concussive explosives to help you escape from perilous situations. As a bonus action, you can throw one of these explosives at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p><h2>Evasion</h2><p>Beginning at 11th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h2>Blast Coating</h2><p>Starting at 15th level, you automatically succeed on saving throws against your own bombs and never take damage from them.</p><h2>Philosopher's Stone</h2><p>At 20th level, you unlock the crowning achievement of all alchemy: a philosopher’s stone, a dynamo of alchemical energy in a fist-sized, glowing jewel. You can construct your philosopher’s stone using your alchemist’s supplies, 1,000 gp worth of materials, and 7 days of work. You can only have one philosopher’s stone at a time. As long as you possess the stone, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Whenever you finish a short rest, you regain all expended reagent dice.</li><li>You can brew potions as an action, instead of over the course of 10 minutes.</li><li>You age 10 times slower than normal, and you can’t be aged magically.</li></ul><p>Additionally, you learn the following formula, which doesn’t count against the total number of formulae you know:</p><h3>Formula: Nuclear Bomb</h3><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with your philosopher’s stone, you can change it into a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb deals 10d10 + 100 force damage instead of its normal fire damage, has a blast radius of 1 mile, and completely destroys the philosopher’s stone. Additionally, each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw takes the full bomb damage rolled, or half as much damage on a successful save. Creatures within 60 feet of the bomb gain no benefit from Evasion or similar features.</p><h1>Bomb Formulae</h1><p>Bomb formulae are summarized on the following table.

An acid bomb deals acid damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d4s. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, takes the same amount of damage again at the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Bramble Bomb</h2><p>By adding a potent fertilizer to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a bramble bomb. A bramble bomb deals no damage, but instead causes tough, thorny brambles to sprout from any area of natural ground within the bomb’s blast radius, which becomes difficult terrain. Additionally, if a creature in the blast radius is prone when the bomb detonates, it is enveloped by the brambles and must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check against your bomb save DC before it can move or stand. The brambles shrivel and die after 1 minute.</p><h2>Cryo Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a piece of ice-nine, you can change it into a cryo bomb. A cryo bomb deals cold damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d8s, and it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Holy Bomb</h2><p>By adding a few drops of holy water to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a holy bomb. A holy bomb deals radiant damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d8s, unless the target is a Celestial, Fiend, or Undead. The bomb’s damage dice are d6s against Celestials and d12s against Fiends and Undead.</p><h2>Impact Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with more reactive ones, you can change it into an impact bomb. An impact bomb deals force damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d8s. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, is pushed 5 feet away from the center of the blast.</p><h2>Incendiary Bomb</h2><p>By adding a thickening agent to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into an incendiary bomb. An incendiary bomb’s damage dice are d6s. Additionally, the area of the blast radius is engulfed in flames, which persist until the start of your next turn. Flammable objects in this area that aren’t being worn or carried ignite. Any creature that ends its turn in this area takes half the bomb’s damage.</p><h2>Laughing Gas Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a drop of jesterate, a highly euphoric chemical, you can change it into a laughing gas bomb. A laughing gas bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d6s, and it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, falls prone in a fit of laughter. Once a creature falls prone due to this bomb’s effects, it is immune to this effect (but not the bomb’s poison damage) for the next 24 hours.</p><h2>Lightning Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a charged arcane capacitor, you can change it into a lightning bomb. A lightning bomb deals lightning damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d8s. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Nonlethal Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a pouch of rubber pellets, you can change it into a nonlethal bomb. A nonlethal bomb deals bludgeoning damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d8s. If damage from this bomb drops a creature to 0 hit points, it knocks the creature out, rather than dealing a killing blow, rendering the creature unconscious and stable. Additionally, this bomb’s rubber pellets bounce around corners, ignoring half and three-quarters cover for targets within the blast radius.</p><h2>Oil Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of a super-surfactant, you can change it into an oil bomb. An oil bomb deals no damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a sticky, flammable oil. The next time a creature coated in oil takes fire damage, it takes an extra d6 fire damage for each die of fire damage rolled, up to a maximum of half your alchemist level, rounded up. This oil can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water.</p><h2>Prismatic Bomb</h2><p>By adding an ounce of polyjuice, an unpredictable, multicolored chemical, to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a prismatic bomb. A prismatic bomb deals damage of a randomly determined type instead of fire damage, and it requires a randomly determined type of saving throw. Its damage dice are d8s. Roll on each of the following tables.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>d6</td><td>Damage Type</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Acid</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Cold</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Lightning</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Poison</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Radiant</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>d6</td><td>Saving Throw</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-2</td><td>Dexterity</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>Wisdom</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Psionic Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with dust from a psionic crystal, you can change it into a psionic bomb. A psionic bomb deals psychic damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d6s, and it requires a Wisdom saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws it makes to maintain concentration on spells until the end of its next turn, including against this bomb’s damage.</p><h2>Quiet Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a wad of thermal cotton, you can change it into a quiet bomb. A quiet bomb’s damage dice are d8s. When this bomb detonates, it makes only a low thud, audible out to 10 feet, and releases a puff of smoke to mask the light given off by its blast. Creatures have disadvantage on ability checks to detect that this bomb was detonated nearby.</p><h2>Seeking Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a powerful lodestone, you can change it into a seeking bomb. A seeking bomb’s damage dice are d6s. You don’t have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls you make using this bomb as a result of being within 5 feet of a hostile creature.</p><h2>Smoke Bomb</h2><p>By removing your bomb’s explosive contents entirely, you can change it into a smoke bomb. A smoke bomb deals no damage but fills a 10-foot-radius sphere with smoke. This smoke spreads around corners and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 round) or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Once you throw one of these bombs, you can’t throw another one for 1 minute.</p><h2>Sonic Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of air elemental essence, you can change it into a sonic bomb. A sonic bomb deals thunder damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d6s, and it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, is deafened until the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Stink Bomb</h2><p>By adding a single drop of skunkanide, a chemical too unholy to expound upon, you can change it into a stink bomb. A stink bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d8, and it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has disadvantage on ability checks it makes until the end of its next turn.</p><h2>Teleportation Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a glowing etherite crystal, you can change it into a teleportation bomb. A teleportation bomb deals no damage and instead opens a rift in space, instantly teleporting you to its point of detonation. This effect fails if the bomb explodes more than 30 feet away from you.</p><h2>Thermobaric Bomb</h2><p>By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a lower speed explosive, you can change it into a thermobaric bomb. A thermobaric bomb’s damage dice are d6s, and it explodes in a 10-foot radius.</p><h2>Withering Bomb</h2><p>By mixing your bomb’s explosive components with a powerful desiccating agent, you can change it into a withering bomb. A withering bomb deals necrotic damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d8s, it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, can’t regain hit points until the end of its next turn.</p><h1>Discoveries</h1><p>If a discovery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells.</p><h3>Ballistics Research</h3><p>You learn two additional bomb formulae.</p><h3>Battle Training</h3><p>You gain proficiency with martial weapons and shields.</p><h3>Beguiling Haze</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 13th level, Amorist Field of Study</em></p><p>When you charm a creature, you can choose to place it in a dreamy state, from which it regards everyone it sees as close friends. While the creature is charmed, it is nonhostile and acts as though it is charmed equally by each creature it sees.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Buffered Metabolism</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 13th level, Xenoalchemist Field of Study</em></p><p>As a reaction when you take damage, you can expend any number of reagent dice up to your proficiency bonus to reduce the amount of damage taken by the total rolled on the dice.</p><h3>Clotting Agent</h3><p>You have developed a serum that thickens your blood. Your hit point maximum increases by your alchemist level + your Constitution modifier, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</p><h3>Craft Homunculus</h3><p>Using a special alchemical process requiring 8 hours of work, which can be performed over the course of a long rest, you can create a homunculus. A homunculus functions as a familiar summoned by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{find familiar}</em> spell, with several differences:</p><ul><li>The telepathic link between you and your homunculus functions at any distance, provided you and your homunculus are on the same plane of existence.</li><li>You can’t dismiss your homunculus as you would a familiar.</li><li>Your homunculus is a Construct and can’t assume a different form.</li><li>Your homunculus can take the Attack action on its turn.</li></ul><p>When your homunculus dies, its body remains, and can be reanimated in a procedure requiring 1 hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short or long rest.</p><h3>Demolition Spree</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 13th level, Mad Bomber Field of Study</em></p><p>When you prime and throw a bomb, you can choose to throw a number of bombs equal to the number of damage dice for the bomb instead of only one. Each bomb you throw deals 1d10 damage plus your Intelligence modifier and can’t target the same creature or space. You must spend reagent dice separately on these bombs and can apply a bomb formula to only one of them.</p><h3>Explosive Missile</h3><p>As a bonus action, you can load one of your bombs onto the head of a crossbow bolt. Instead of its normal damage, this bolt deals damage as if the bomb had been primed and thrown, but it doesn’t have a blast radius. Only one of your bombs can be loaded onto a bolt at a time, and you can’t fire an explosive bolt on the same turn you throw a bomb.</p><h3>Fire Brand</h3><p>As a bonus action you can mix your bomb’s contents together and apply the fiery concoction to a melee weapon you are holding. Until the end of your turn, this melee weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. This extra damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p><h3>Fire Eater</h3><p>Instead of priming and throwing a bomb, you use an action to drink its contents and spit them out in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your bomb save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage as if the bomb had been primed and thrown, or half as much on a successful save. When you use this ability, you take 1d4 points of fire damage for each of your bomb’s damage dice.</p><h3>Fire in the Hole</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 9th level</em></p><p>You have tweaked your bomb’s formula to increase its explosive yield. Your bomb save DC increases by half your proficiency bonus, rounded down.</p><h3>Fortified Serum</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 13th level, Apothecary Field of Study</em></p><p>Whenever a creature regains hit points by drinking one of your potions, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks until the end of its next turn.</p><h3>Grenadier</h3><p>When you prime and throw a bomb, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with a weapon that isn’t two-handed.</p><h3>Dynamo Charger</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 13th level, Dynamo Engineer Field of Study</em></p><p>You’ve invented a device that rapidly recharges your spell dynamos. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain 2 expended spell slots stored in dynamos. You can configure these dynamos immediately.</p><h3>Hemoreagent</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p><p>When you prime and throw a bomb, you can convert a measure of your own blood into reagents. You can add five or fewer reagent dice to the bomb’s damage roll without expending them, and you lose 1d6 hit points for each reagent die added. This loss of hit points can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.</p><h3>Lazarus Bolt</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 9th level</em></p><p>You’ve discovered a radical necromantic workaround: restoring life with direct electricity to the heart. As an action, you can drive a bolt into the torso of a creature within 5 feet of you that has died within the last minute and shock it back to life. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This feature can’t return to life a creature that lacks a heart, a creature that has died of old age, or a creature that is missing vital organs.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Magnified Blast</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p><p>Thanks to a new internal design for your bombs, you have expanded their blast radius and magnitude. Whenever you add reagent dice to your bomb’s damage, you can also choose to expand the bomb’s blast radius by a distance of up to 5 feet per two reagent dice spent.</p><h3>Ooze Cowboy</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 13th level, Ooze Rancher Field of Study</em></p><p>Tired of waiting for your Oozes to catch up with you, you’ve modified your formula to make extra fast slimes! All slimes you make have a speed of 30 feet, unless it was already higher. Additionally, you can ride any Ooze you make of Medium size or larger as a mount. You and your equipment suffer no ill effect from touching your Oozes directly. Lastly, your Oozes add your proficiency bonus to their damage rolls and initiative rolls.</p><h3>Poisoner</h3><p>Your research into poisonous compounds has taught you how to concoct lethal toxins. You gain proficiency with the poisoner’s kit. Additionally, you can craft the following poisons when you brew potions, which use your bomb save DC instead of their normal save DCs:</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Potion</td><td>Cost</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2 x @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Fc6UfFNOnW80XMzi]{Antitoxin}</td><td>1 reagent die</td></tr><tr><td>2 x @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.eVbPkYjpl29RE2uW]{Basic Poison}</td><td>1 reagent die</td></tr><tr><td>Oil of Taggit</td><td>2 reagent dice</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.qBSEGJyHxdKIlBfj]{Potion of Poison}</td><td>2 reagent dice</td></tr><tr><td>Serpent Venom</td><td>2 reagent dice</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.a86F565Pjdzym1jH]{Truth Serum}</td><td>2 reagent dice</td></tr></tbody></table></div><blockquote><p>Foundry Note: Oil of Taggit and Serpent Venom can be found @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.t6scHTmpmHBTZGTX.JournalEntryPage.B8rYvLQ4jMY9GeJA#sample-poisons]{here}!</p></blockquote><p></p><div><h3>Precision Explosives</h3><p>You have modified your bombs to have narrow gaps in their explosions, perfect for keeping some creatures safe from the blast. You can choose one creature in the blast radius of a bomb, other than the target, to automatically succeed on its saving throw against the bomb and take no damage from it.</p><h3>Reactionary Gulp</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 17th level</em></p><p>By keeping your potions organized on a bandolier or in a series of pouches, you can quickly draw them at a moment’s notice. Immediately after you take damage, you can use your reaction to drink a potion.</p><h3>Recycled Potions</h3><p>When you brew potions, you can distill potions you have already brewed, destroying them and regaining the reagent dice expended to brew them. You can choose to expend these reagent dice to create new potions. You can’t gain more than your maximum number of reagent dice using this ability.</p><h3>Syringe</h3><p>Using a sophisticated hypodermic needle, you can more quickly administer potions and poisons. As a bonus action, you can inject a potion into yourself or a willing creature within 5 feet of you, granting the benefits of the potion as if it were consumed normally. You can inject a potion into an unwilling creature with a successful melee attack, treating the syringe as a finesse weapon.</p><h3>Tri-Mutation</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 13th level, Mutagenist Field of Study</em></p><p>You’ve developed a powerful, but fleeting way to blend your mutagens. When you inject yourself with a mutagen, you can choose to inject a tri-mutagen, which grants you the benefit of all your mutagens at once. This benefit lasts for 1 minute, or until you inject yourself with a different mutagen. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h1>Fields of Study</h1><p>All alchemists learn the basics of their science: the elements, chemical reactions, and alchemical formulae. Beyond that, alchemists pick up a specialty that they practice and research in depth. Some focus on the healing arts and some focus on destruction, while others focus on research or potion-brewing. Fields of study are as varied as the alchemists who research them and have applications equally as diverse.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Fields of Study</td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.9uLBSdoHMlJLgKpF#amorist]{Armorist}</td><td>Brewers of love potions and practitioners of mind-affecting alchemy</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.9uLBSdoHMlJLgKpF#apothecary]{Apothecary}</td><td>Alchemical healers and herbalists</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.9uLBSdoHMlJLgKpF#dynamo-engineer]{Dynamo Engineer}</td><td>Casts spells by preparing them in devices known as spell dynamos</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.9uLBSdoHMlJLgKpF#mad-bomber]{Mad Bomber}</td><td>Pyromaniacs who fashion particularly devastating bombs</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.9uLBSdoHMlJLgKpF#mutagenist]{Mutagenist}</td><td>Transmutes their body with experimental, injected mutagens</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.9uLBSdoHMlJLgKpF#ooze-rancher]{Ooze Ranger}</td><td>Breeds and commands all manner of oozes and slimes</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.9uLBSdoHMlJLgKpF#venomsmith]{Venomsmith}</td><td>Poison expert and assassin</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.9uLBSdoHMlJLgKpF#xenoalchemist]{Xenoalchemist}</td><td>Modifies their body and the bodies of others with monster surgery</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Amorist</h2><p>The study of mind-affecting alchemy is a delicate one, practiced only by a small number of alchemists known as amorists. Often called “love doctors” by their clientele, amorists specialize in brewing of potions that produce strong emotional responses in their drinkers. While love potions are by far their most popular product, amorists can also craft pungent pheromone bombs that can even soften the hearts of terrible monsters.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.</p><h3>Formula: Pheromone Bomb</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can replace your bomb’s explosive contents with a potent pheromone, changing it into a pheromone bomb. A pheromone bomb requires a Wisdom saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. The bomb deals no damage, and instead causes the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, to be charmed by you until the end of its turn or until it takes damage.</p><h3>Magnetic Personality</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to Charisma checks that you make.</p><h3>Alchemical Perfume</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, you wear an aromatic, mind-altering perfume that endears others to you. When a hostile creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your bomb save DC or have disadvantage on the attack roll. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it can’t be charmed.</p><h3>Alchemical Romance</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, during a long rest, you can spend 4 reagent dice to make an extremely potent <em>potion of true love</em>. This potion acts much like a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.63nb14yQRJMc4bIn]{philter of love}</em>, except that when you make the potion, you choose the creature the target regards as its true love, provided the target knows the creature or meets it within 24 hours of consuming the potion. Additionally, this effect lasts indefinitely, ended only when you make a new <em>potion of true love</em>, or the effect is removed with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. When this potion’s effects are ended on a target, it regards the creature it once loved with total disgust, and can never love that creature again.</p><h2>Apothecary</h2><p>Many practically minded alchemists assume the role of the apothecary, for adventuring parties always need a healer, and clerics might be in short supply. During their downtime, such alchemists have a marketable skill to depend upon for income and can do an indisputable amount of good with their knowledge. Apothecaries are constantly at work studying potions and herbology, preferring to learn how to mend the body, rather than destroy it.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3><p>When you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill.</p><h3>Formula: Painkiller Bomb</h3><p>At 2nd level, you can mix your bomb’s contents with analgesic oil, changing it into a painkiller bomb. A painkiller bomb deals no damage and doesn't have a blast radius. On a hit, roll damage as normal; the target instead gains temporary hit points which last for 1 minute equal to the total damage roll. You can target a willing creature with this bomb without making an attack roll. Once you throw one of these bombs, you can’t throw another one for 1 minute.</p><h3>Potion Toss</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you’ve developed a chemical mechanism to deliver potions more effectively to distant allies. You can use your action to hurl a potion at a willing or unconscious creature within 20 feet of you. The target gains the potion’s benefit as if it had consumed the potion normally.</p><h3>Self-Medication</h3><p>By 10th level, you’ve tested out your own tolerances to painkillers such that you can take a small measure regularly without ill effect. Whenever you drink a potion that has the effect of restoring your hit points (even if you already have all of your hit points), you gain advantage on saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Alchemical Resurrection</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, your medicines are potent enough to rouse the dead. By using your action to mix 500 gp worth of diamond dust into a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.5m9ErO9In8Uc5yyf]{potion of superior healing}</em> or a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.JFiSlgcm3uSSBM5t]{potion of supreme healing}</em>, you create a <em>potion of raise dead</em>. If you use your action to pour this concoction on a Humanoid corpse that has been dead no longer than 10 days, the target gains the effect of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz]{raise dead}</em> spell.</p><h2>Dynamo Engineer</h2><p>As an early alchemical thesis states: if the fundamental energy of magic could be captured within physical substance, there would be no need for magic-users. Some alchemists have founded their careers on this notion, inventing and iterating upon small devices known as spell dynamos which store and manipulate arcane energy. These dynamos can be configured to store their energy at a specific resonance, such that, when it is released, it perfectly replicates the effect of a spell. Indeed, these few alchemists have begun to brave the frontier of spellcasting without an ounce of arcane talent; just a knack for tinkering and endless inventiveness.</p><h3>Spectrum Analyzer</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you have invented a small device shaped like a monocle capable of rendering magical auras visible to the naked eye. You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{detect magic}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p>Once you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting</td></tr><tr><td>Alchemist Level</td><td>Spells Known</td><td>Spell Dynamos</td><td>Slot Level</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>11</td><td>6</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>11</td><td>6</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>11</td><td>6</td><td>3rd</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>12</td><td>7</td><td>4th</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>13</td><td>7</td><td>4th</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, you can cast spells by storing and releasing energy in spell dynamos. See the core rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the wizard spell list.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Dynamos.</strong></em> You power your spells through handheld arcane devices called spell dynamos, which each hold a single spell slot. The [Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table] shows how many spell dynamos you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots held in each of your dynamos is; all of these spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your wizard spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell dynamo. You regain all expended spell dynamos when you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Preparing Spells.</strong></em> Unlike other spells, you must prepare the spells held in each of your spell dynamos in advance. When you finish a long rest, you configure each of your dynamos to cast a particular wizard spell you know. You can only use a spell dynamo to cast a spell to which it is configured. When you finish a short or long rest, you can reconfigure your unexpended dynamos to hold different spells.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</strong></em> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation and transmutation spells on the wizard spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you cast them using cutting-edge arcane technology. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Use your bomb save DC as the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast, and use your Intelligence modifier when making an attack roll with one.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h3>Formula: Arcano Bomb</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can craft arcano bombs. By adding an unexpended dynamo to your bomb (and thus expending the dynamo’s spell slot), you can change it into an arcano bomb. An arcano bomb deals force damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d12s, and it deals one extra die of damage, as if a reagent die were added to it.</p><h3>Counter-Discharge</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, when a creature you can see casts a spell that affects you, you can use your reaction to expend a spell dynamo to release a wave of disruptive magical energy. If the spell requires you to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you have advantage on the saving throw. If the spell deals damage, you have resistance against it.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Arcane Recycler</h3><p>By 18th level, you can convert otherwise wasted magical energy into a usable form. When you miss with an arcano bomb, you can recycle the spell slot stored in the dynamo and transfer it to one of the empty dynamos on your person.</p><h2>Mad Bomber</h2><p>While many “mad bombers” aren’t actually mad, it takes a special kind of crazy to devote one’s life to studying explosives. Most alchemists who specialize in this field are incorrigible pyromaniacs who take great pleasure in burning, blasting, and blowing things up. Mad bombers are always working to improve their bombs’ effectiveness.</p><h3>Blasting Specialty</h3><p>Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, your bombs deal double damage to objects and structures.</p><h3>Formula: Shrapnel Bomb</h3><p>At 2nd level, you can augment your bomb’s explosive contents with metal bearings, changing it into a shrapnel bomb. A shrapnel bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d8s, and it explodes in a 10-foot radius.</p><h3>Timed Demolition</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, when you prime and throw a bomb, you can set a duration for its detonation, which can be any number of rounds (any increment of 6 seconds) up to 1 minute. The bomb detonates at the end of your turn after this duration. If a creature is in the area of more than one bomb’s blast radius simultaneously, the creature is only affected by one of the bombs of your choice.</p><h3>Blast Shield</h3><p>By 10th level, you have developed an elemental plating to protect you from hazardous energies. You gain resistance to your choice of acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage and can change your selection whenever you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Formula: Black Powder Bomb</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you can replace your bomb’s explosive contents with a charge of black powder, changing it into a dreaded black powder bomb. A black powder bomb’s damage dice are d12s.</p><h2>Mutagenist</h2><p>The study of alchemy is fundamentally the study of transformation. All alchemists transmute mundane materials into magical substances—potions, elixirs, and bombs—yet some take it one step further. You have discovered the secrets of the mutagen, the keystone of transmutation, which allows you to transform your very body, gaining supernatural strength or speed, sprouting additional limbs or claws, or thickening your skin into a stony aegis.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of the Acrobatics or Athletics skill, as well as with shields.</p><h3>Mutagen</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to inject yourself with a potent transmutative potion known as a mutagen. You gain one of the following benefits of your choice for 1 minute, or until you use your bonus action to inject yourself with a different mutagen:</p><p><em><strong>Strength.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20.</p><p>Additionally, you sprout claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. You can use this natural weapon to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. The damage of this attack is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate for the natural weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Dexterity.</strong></em> Your Dexterity score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20. Additionally, your walking speed increases by 5 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Constitution.</strong></em> Your Constitution score increases by 3, to a maximum of 20. As a result, your current and maximum hit points increase accordingly with your new Constitution score, but when this effect ends, both your current and maximum hit points decrease by the same amount.</p><h3>Shared Mutagen</h3><p>At 6th level, you’ve created a mutagen formulation generic enough to safely be injected into others. You can use your action and spend a reagent die to inject a willing creature within 5 feet of you with a mutagen of your choice. A creature can only be under the effect of one mutagen at a time. Once you injected another creature with a mutagen, you can’t do so again until the original mutagen ends.</p><h3>Advanced Mutation</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, whenever you inject yourself with a mutagen, you can choose one of the following additional mutations:</p><p><em><strong>Hyperelastic.</strong></em> Your flesh takes on a rubbery quality, allowing you to bend and stretch with ease. Melee weapons you use are considered to have the Reach property, if they didn’t have it already. Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks you make to escape grapple or slip binds.</p><p><em><strong>Mucilaginous.</strong></em> Your skin secretes a thick, extremely sticky substance that helps you adhere to objects. You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You also have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p>Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on ability checks made to escape your grapples.</p><p><em><strong>Polybrachia.</strong></em> You grow a pair of additional arms. These arms are fully functional and can be used to hold weapons and shields (allowing you to hold 2 two-handed weapons, or 4 one-handed weapons), perform somatic components of spells, and perform other actions, though the arms themselves don’t grant you any additional actions.</p><h3>Mutated Blood</h3><p>By 18th level, your mutagens have permanently altered your biology. Choose Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. The chosen ability score increases by 2, and your maximum for this score increases to 22. Once you have chosen an ability score, this selection can’t be altered.</p><h2>Ooze Rancher</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, oozes, jellies, and slimes are a fascinating subject for alchemists who wish to figure out how inanimate chemicals can form together and rise up in a moving, hungry mass. The answer to this question may very well be at the heart of alchemy itself. Alchemists who choose to research slimes in depth are called ooze ranchers, for they breed and keep numerous slimes to experiment upon.</p><h3>Ooze Empathy</h3><p>Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you’ve developed a pheromone mix that endears all kinds of slime to you. Whenever an Ooze tries to attack you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your bomb save DC. On a failed save, its attack misses. On a successful save, the Ooze is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.</p><h3>Formula: Slime Bomb</h3><p>At 2nd level, you can mix your bomb’s explosive contents with the remnants of an Ooze, changing it into a slime bomb. A slime bomb deals no damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a viscous, green slime. A creature coated in slime can’t take the Dash or Disengage actions. Slime can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water or by taking an action to remove most of it.</p><h3>Bottled Oozes</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you’ve learned a clever alchemical trick for condensing Oozes into denser states and storing them in stasis for later use. Whenever you brew potions, you can spend 2 reagent dice to create an <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.ka93mXTxLKYidwGc]{ooze bottle}</em>.</p><p>Your Oozes use your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus for their attack rolls, and use your bomb save DC in place of their save DCs.</p><h3>Liquid Anatomy</h3><p>By 10th level, you have injected yourself with ozoplasm, the gooey substance which composes Oozes and slimes, mutating your form. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing (though your equipment doesn’t similarly compress). Additionally, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.</p><h3>Ooze Jug</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you’ve solved the problem that prevented large Oozes from being bottled: you just needed a much larger bottle. You have an <em>ooze jug</em>, which functions like an <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.ka93mXTxLKYidwGc]{ooze bottle}</em>, but contains a single larger Ooze. You can only have one <em>ooze jug</em> at a time. You can fill it with the following Oozes when you brew potions:</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Ooze</td><td>Cost</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.xBhG7Dos3tkg9jWz]{Ochre Jelly}</td><td>4 reagent dice</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.3fzQVYQhXxCXRa2o]{Gelatinous Cube}</td><td>8 reagent dice</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.NwQpeeaMxAC3fRft]{Black Pudding}</td><td>10 reagent dice</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Venomsmith</h2><p>For every alchemist that has devoted their life to healing the sick and infirm, there is another with a darker calling. Commonly called poisoners or venomsmiths, these alchemists are masters in the art of crafting deadly and debilitating poisons. Whether employed by an assassin’s guild or performing assassinations themselves, a venomsmith’s presence is usually accompanied by untimely death.</p><h3>Poisoner</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you gain the Poisoner discovery. Until you reach 3rd level, you have 2 reagent dice, which you can spend only on crafting poisons using this discovery. This discovery doesn’t count against your number of discoveries known, and you can’t later replace this discovery with a different one when you gain a level in this class.</p><p>Additionally, when you deal poison damage to a creature, you ignore resistance to poison damage and you treat immunity to poison damage as resistance instead, dealing half damage.</p><h3>Formula: Venom Bomb</h3><p>At 2nd level, you can mix a few drops of a fast-acting toxin into your bomb’s explosive components, changing it into a venom bomb. A venom bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d8s, and it requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has disadvantage on the next Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.</p><h3>Alchemical Assassin</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, you are adept at applying poisons without being seen. You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks you make to add ingested poison to food or drink, to apply poison to a weapon you are holding without being seen, or to place a vial of poison on another creature without it noticing.</p><h3>Mithridatism</h3><p>By 10th level, by administering yourself small doses of various poisons and toxins, you have developed an immunity to their ravages. You have immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</p><h3>Toxic Recompense</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to unleash a spray of poisonous vapor. The attacker must make a Constitution saving throw against your bomb save DC or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the creature takes 1d10 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><h2>Xenoalchemist</h2><p>A small number of renegade alchemists elect to experiment on themselves, modifying their anatomy or even outright attaching new body parts. These experiments are often considered unethical and dangerous, even by other alchemists, and those that practice them are branded xenoalchemists for their efforts. As xenoalchemists progress in their studies, they invariably stumble upon the dangerous practice of alchemical necromancy, which allows them to imbue unlife upon amalgamations of body parts.</p><h3>Xenobiology</h3><p>Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you have advantage on all ability checks you make to identify or research monsters.</p><h3>Mad Scientist</h3><p>By 2nd level, you’ve learned the finer points of reanimating dead appendages and stitching them to things. You gain two monstrous grafts of your choice. Additionally, you don’t lose hit points or Hit Dice from installing or removing grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft. See Appendix C for [monstrous grafts].</p><h3>Surgical Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, whenever you take the Attack action or prime and throw a bomb on your turn, you can make an unarmed strike as part of that action. You can only use this ability if your unarmed strike is improved by a graft, such as Bestial Weapons.</p><h3>Necromantic Organs</h3><p>By 10th level, you’ve learned how to tinge your own biology with necromancy through reanimated organs that will persist after your death. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>It's Alive!</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, your research into the field of necromancy has culminated in an alchemical golem stitched together from discarded body parts. You can create an alchemy golem through an 8-hour-long procedure, which can be conducted over the course of a long rest. To complete this process, you must have a healer’s kit, alchemist’s supplies, and a knife (or a facility with access to such tools), as well as at least three recently deceased Humanoid corpses.</p><p>Your alchemy golem acts independently on its own turn, but always obeys your commands. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command your golem if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the golem will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the golem only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the golem continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p><p>The golem can use your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus for its attack rolls.</p><p>When the alchemy golem drops to 0 hit points, it dies. You can restore your alchemy golem’s hit points and reanimate it over the course of a short or long rest.</p><p>You can attach up to three grafts to your alchemy golem. You can only have one alchemy golem at a time.</p></div>"

          "text": "<p>Squalid masses draw close around a young dwarf in spotless clothing. He touches each person in turn, healing injuries, curing illnesses, and restoring hope.</p><p>A ragged tiefling speaks in a crowded square. As if in response, dark clouds gather over her head and the earth trembles at her words.</p><p>A mad king spits and swears from his throne at imperial guards who have fled or been slain. A lone dragonborn stands before him, solemnly preparing herself for divinely demanded regicide.</p><p>Martyrs are implements of the gods, hand-picked to spill their blood in service of a divine cause. Such an end is inevitable, for once a martyr is chosen, their fate is fixed in the heavens.</p><h2>Fated to Die</h2><p>Martyrs are chosen by the gods as prophets, oracles, great priests, and liberators. However, regardless of how much good they might accomplish in their lives, the end must always be the same: a glorious death, to be remembered in legend.</p><p>No matter the circumstance, a martyr cannot avoid their destiny. While some martyrs gladly accept their holy approbation, others struggle against it. However, from the moment the gods choose their martyr, they shall intervene in the martyr’s fate, pulling them inexorably toward their cause. The gods will settle for a lesser martyr if they must—if the one chosen dies too soon—but they always prefer to uplift their martyr to the heights of sainthood before their inevitable demise.</p><h2>Blood of the Martyr</h2><p>Martyrs grow more powerful the closer they are to death, and those that spill their own blood evoke waves of divine energy. In the view of the gods, such hardship is necessary to lay the foundation for a story that will live on in history.</p><p>Paradoxically, martyrs are protected from death’s precipice even as they are edged closer toward it. Every torment and persecution suffered by them is weighed with equal moments of respite offered by the gods. The gods do not mean to kill their charge early; a martyr should meet their fate only at the preordained time and place.</p><h2>Creating a Martyr</h2><p>As you create a martyr, think about the moment you were chosen by the gods and your burden was placed upon you. Were you visited by an angelic host or a god disguised as a mortal? Did you quietly hear a divine voice in your ear, as stigmata formed on your body? Was your soul violently dragged to the Upper (or Lower) Planes for an audience with the gods?</p><p>Consider the life you led before you were ordained for martyrdom. Were you a wicked soul, purified and redeemed to undergo this task? Were you already a warrior, adventurer, or cleric in service of the gods? Also consider how you reacted. Did you accept the task and your inevitable destiny, or did you run from it? Are you still running?</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>To build a martyr quickly, follow these suggestions: Constitution should be your highest ability score. Your next highest ability score should be Strength if you choose a Burden, such as the Burden of Revolution, which focuses on melee combat, or Wisdom if you choose one focused on spellcasting. Choose any background.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[.20NfK6pgGi6lj6VS]{Martyr Class Table}</p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"5\">The Martyr</td></tr><tr><td>Level</td><td>Proficiency Bonus</td><td>Features</td><td>Max Spell Level</td><td>Spell Uses</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>Mortal Burden, Ordained Death</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>Spellcasting, Sainted Reprisal, Mark of the Herald</td><td>1st</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>Divine Healing, Torment</td><td>1st</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>1st</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>Extra Attack</td><td>2nd</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>Mortal Burden feature</td><td>2nd</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>Respite</td><td>2nd</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>2nd</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>—</td><td>3rd</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>Undying Conviction</td><td>3rd</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>Torment improvement</td><td>3rd</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>3rd</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>—</td><td>4th</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>Mortal Burden feature</td><td>4th</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>March Unto Destiny</td><td>4th</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>4th</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>—</td><td>5th</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>Mortal Burden feature</td><td>5th</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>5th</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>Final Martyrdom</td><td>5th</td><td>15</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h1>Class Features</h1><p>As a martyr, you have the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d12 per martyr level</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong></em> 12 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong></em> 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per martyr level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><em><strong>Armor:</strong></em> Light armor, medium armor, shields</p><p><em><strong>Weapons:</strong></em> Simple and martial weapons</p><p><em><strong>Tools:</strong></em> None</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws:</strong></em> Strength, Wisdom</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Choose two from Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>(<em>a</em>) a martial weapon and a shield or (<em>b</em>) two martial weapons</li><li>(<em>a</em>) scale mail or (<em>b</em>) chain mail (if proficient)</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<em>b</em>) any simple weapon</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a priest’s pack or (<em>b</em>) an explorer’s pack</li><li>A holy symbol</li></ul><h2>Mortal Burden</h2><p>Beginning at 1st level, you are fated to perish in the name of a great ideal, cementing your name alongside others who have done the same. Choose a Mortal Burden, detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p><h3>Burden Spells</h3><p>Each burden has a list of associated spells that you gain at the martyr levels specified in the burden description. Once you gain access to a burden spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you gain a burden spell that doesn’t appear on the martyr spell list, the spell is nonetheless a martyr spell for you.</p><h2>Ordained Death</h2><p>As a martyr, you have been predestined by the gods to perish for a great cause; there is no greater glory in death, and no greater joy in the afterlife. However, it is not yet your time. Starting at 1st level, when you fall to 0 hit points and begin to make death saving throws, you must fail 5 saving throws to die. Additionally, if a spell has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn’t need material components to cast the spell on you.</p><h2>Mark of the Herald</h2><p>At 2nd level, your divine cause manifests itself upon you, forming a special mark or stigmata for all to see. You have advantage on ability checks you make to convince other creatures to assist you in service of your holy cause.</p><h2>Spellcasting</h2><p>Starting at 2nd level, you can leverage the power of your suffering to cast divine magic.</p><h3>Casting Spells</h3><p>To cast one of your martyr spells of 1st level or higher, you must lose hit points to create and expend a spell slot greater than or equal to that spell’s level. The number of hit points is listed on the Hit Points Spellcasting table and can’t be reduced or avoided. You don’t make Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells as a result of losing these hit points.</p><p>The Martyr table shows the maximum level of spell slot you can create.</p><p>The Spell Uses column of the Martyr table shows how many spells you can cast. When you expend hit points to cast a spell, you expend one of these uses. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Hit Points Spellcasting</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Point Cost</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>45</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Preparing Spells</h3><p>You prepare the list of martyr spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the martyr spell list. When you do so, choose a number of martyr spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your martyr level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). Spells you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the Max Spell Level column for your level. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Healing Magic</h3><p>Because your power is derived from mortal suffering, you can’t regain hit points from any spell you cast.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your martyr spells, since your power originates in the devotion used to overcome your trials and tribulations. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a martyr spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your martyr spells.</p><h2>Sainted Reprisal</h2><p>Also at 2nd level, you can reprimand those who draw your blood. When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice) to that creature.</p><p>The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p><h2>Divine Healing</h2><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can utter a prayer to the gods for mercy. As an action, you can spend Hit Dice and regain hit points as if you had just finished a short rest. When you use this ability, you can spend a number of Hit Dice up to your proficiency bonus.</p><h2>Torment</h2><p>By 3rd level, you have learned to curry the gods’ favor through anguish and mortal trials. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can lose 5 hit points to deal an extra 10 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice) to the target. You don’t make Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells as a result of losing these hit points.</p><p>Starting at 11th level, you can choose to lose 10 hit points to deal an extra 20 damage to the target.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2>Extra Attack</h2><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h2>Respite</h2><p>Beginning at 7th level, you regain all expended Hit Dice when you finish a long rest, instead of only half of them.</p><h2>Undying Conviction</h2><p>Beginning at 10th level, when you drop to 0 hit points but aren’t killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>March Unto Destiny</h2><p>At 15th level, your inevitable end draws nearer, and nothing can hold you from it. You don’t need to eat or drink, and can’t be paralyzed, petrified, or stunned.</p><h2>Final Martyrdom</h2><p>At 20th level, you have at last reached your predestination: you will die in eternal glory. You can use your action to become immune to all damage for 10 minutes. For this duration, you can’t be blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned, restrained, or rendered unconscious. You have advantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.</p><p>Additionally, during this duration, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{wish}</em> spell once, without expending a spell slot or hit points. If you use the spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell, the stress of casting it doesn’t reduce your Strength or cause you to take necrotic damage.</p><p>At the end of this duration, you die. No force short of divine intervention can prevent your death, and you can’t be returned to life by any means.</p><h1>Mortal Burdens</h1><p>Martyrs are created and driven forth to right an inexorable wrong in the world.

Your burden is to atone, to undo all the evils you have done in your life, and to seek redemption before the gods. How you accomplish this is your choice, so long as you remove any dark marks you leave behind. Ultimately, your final martyrdom might be a grand act, averting a great disaster or banishing a force of evil, or it might be as humble as redirecting the life of an evil person and causing them to seek redemption, passing the torch to a new martyr of atonement.</p><h3>Burden Spells</h3><p>You gain burden spells at the martyr levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Martyr Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{cure wounds}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{sanctuary}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3MYDjS6k9IYL0aTj]{calm emotions}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.I2LUSF5ogc7Bj62e]{speak with dead}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{death ward}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.avD5XUtkBPQQR97c]{fire shield}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Pyzmm8R7rVsNAPsd]{mass cure wounds}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p><h3>Self-Sacrifice</h3><p>Also at 1st level, you can dive in the way of an attack. When a friendly creature within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack while you are within the attack’s range or reach, you can use your reaction to change the target of the attack to you instead.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Bloody Reprieve</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you use your Torment feature against a hostile creature and you reduce the target to 0 hit points, you don’t lose any hit points from using the ability.</p><h3>Draw Aggression</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, as a bonus action on your turn, you can invoke the ire of your foes to protect your allies. Until the start of your next turn, each hostile creature you choose within 5 feet of you that can see or hear you has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and advantage on attack rolls against you.</p><h3>Sin Eater</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can use your action to transfer negative effects from any number of willing creatures within 60 feet to yourself. You can transfer one of the following effects from each creature:</p><ul><li>One level of exhaustion</li><li>One disease or poison</li><li>One curse, including the target’s attunement to a cursed magic item</li><li>Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores</li><li>One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum</li><li>The blinded, charmed, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, or stunned condition</li></ul><p>The effect ends for the creature and targets you as if you were the original target, with the effect’s original duration.

They light things on fire, commit petty crimes, and even murder when the fancy strikes. Given to their own predilections, martyrs of discord are unified only by their charge to disrupt the status quo as much as possible.</p><p>No one is certain why the gods make martyrs of Discord in the first place. Perhaps it is at the whim of one capricious or evil god, or perhaps the gods desire a balance between chaos and law, and must sometimes stoke the fire to restore this balance.</p><h3>Burden Spells</h3><p>You gain burden spells at the martyr levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Martyr Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BQk5Row4NymMnUQl]{hideous laughter}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ksaaTxIbKx2sJfia]{inflict wounds}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1nhIxh0DsJsntCfj]{knock}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.wJKpSvSTbSkTjqyb]{shatter}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.IyikgTEOTv701jgQ]{lightning bolt}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.TwlD4PLcltv7Xh7j]{stinking cloud}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9hQXdMSmerkTsHDe]{confusion}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.04nMsTWkIFvkbXlY]{polymorph}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ATo0Eb63TDtnu6iA]{animate objects}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, your divine mission grants you a sliver of divine magic.

The exact nature of the coming End may vary: sometimes the awakening or arrival of an evil entity, sometimes the discovery and abuse of a powerful artifact, and sometimes a singularly destructive event that endangers the gods themselves, but the martyr must be dedicated to give their life to stop it. To this end, the gods imbue their martyr with ancient and powerful spells, tools once gifted only to prophets.</p><p>When the coming cataclysm threatens the world, a martyr would be ill-served to ignore their call, for the cataclysm imperils them directly—as well as the lives of their family and companions.

This burden, however, has no end. A martyr may spend all their days healing the sick and driving demons out of the possessed, but they will scarcely impact the world at large. Indeed, the onus upon them is not to mend every wound or comfort every widow, but to provide hope in the darkest of times that the gods have not forsaken their people, that peace will soon reign, and that light will be victorious.</p><h3>Burden Spells</h3><p>You gain burden spells at the martyr levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Martyr Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.o8Dh7fblk1d16tnO]{healing word}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{sanctuary}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9eOZDBImVKxbeOyZ]{enhance ability}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{death ward}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Pyzmm8R7rVsNAPsd]{mass cure wounds}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz]{raise dead}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, your divine mission grants you a sliver of divine magic.

This blessing lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest. Whenever a blessed creature makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, it can expend the blessing to reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p><h3>Anointed Healer</h3><p>By 18th level, your status as a divine healer is enshrined in sainthood. Whenever you restore hit points to a creature, you can add your martyr level to the number of regained hit points. A creature can benefit from this additional healing once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Burden of Rebirth</h2><p>When the natural world is threatened by the needs of growing industry, the ravages of war, or a catastrophic event, the gods may choose a martyr to protect the wild places of the world. Martyrs with this burden don’t seek to prevent the destruction of the world; that would be impossible given the number of factors that threaten it.

When you do so, and again at the start of each of your turns for 1 minute, you regain hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier. Also, for this duration, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and you can’t cast martyr spells. You can use a bonus action to end this effect early.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>Turn of the Wheel</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.zMEo5DKK8uxsuWnq]{reincarnate}</em> spell without expending material components or losing hit points. When you do, you can choose which race the target reincarnates as rather than the GM rolling randomly.</p><p>If you die without using your Final Martyrdom feature, you can return to life 24 hours after you die as if you were targeted by the <em>reincarnate</em> spell. You can choose which race you reincarnate as rather than the GM rolling randomly. Once you return to life in this way, you can’t do so again for 10 days.</p><h2>Burden of Revolution</h2><p>Kings and leaders are bound by an unspoken covenant to the gods to govern their people justly and peacefully. When a monarch turns their back on the gods, embraces tyranny, or uses cruel measures against their own people, a martyr is called to end their reign. Rarely does a Martyr of Revolution come with peaceful measures, for when a king must fall, only the sword can provide the necessary leverage.</p><p>Such martyrs are not only called to battle kings; any person of influence that oppresses others and abuses their power might wrong the gods enough to earn the ire of a martyr. In dark times, a martyr might be tasked with clearing a continent of despots and oppressors, calling for a full-scale military campaign of liberation.</p><h3>Burden Spells</h3><p>You gain burden spells at the martyr levels listed.

Such a martyr must earn the people’s hearts and minds, turning their favors away from evil influences and toward divine ones. It is an uphill battle, but one that rarely requires grievous violence except in the most dire of circumstances.</p><p>Martyrs of Truth are often deemed prophets, for their gods entrust them with knowledge of the future, insights into the past, and sagacious perspective on the present. Such information is proof of their messages’ divine origin and is a necessary balm, for the truths such martyrs are called to preach are often a bitter pill for listeners to swallow.</p><h3>Burden Spells</h3><p>You gain burden spells at the martyr levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Martyr Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eS7XnnApoxRxYXPs]{charm person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{identify}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.4v2H3hHb3Ph9XLNd]{augury}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ppWAAEul0QHtm4er]{detect thoughts}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD]{sending}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.I2LUSF5ogc7Bj62e]{speak with dead}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9]{divination}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.W4Qx5z0id6da0vqg]{legend lore}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{scrying}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Moral Erudition</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Charisma, for Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

Once unleashed, this martyr stops at nothing to establish an empire to rule over with an iron fist. They demand bloodshed from their foes and pledges of absolute fealty from their allies, taking gleeful satisfaction with every power grab and malicious turn. It is not enough to rule: they must be feared, and any resistance must cower in their shadows.

          "text": "<p>A glass falls, clattering to the floor, and the tavern grows silent. A dwarf with a deep scowl, dripping with freshly spilled beer, leers at a nearby drunken orc and fingers for a pair of revolvers at his waist.</p><p>High on a hillside, carefully concealed beneath foliage and stones, a marksman steadies her breathing and adjusts her scope, acquiring her target and waiting for the moment to strike.</p><p>Risk is in a gunslinger’s blood. They are bold renegades, bucking tradition and forging a new path with dangerous and inelegant firearms. Gunslingers are infamous for surviving by their wits, relying on split-second timing and a considerable amount of luck to survive.</p><h2>Guts and Gunpowder</h2><p>Black powder is not for the faint of heart. Its thunderous applause is volatile and imprecise—a barely controlled explosion directed at an enemy. Unlike a sword or a bow, a firearm can explode in your hands, and its ammunition turns into a bomb whenever it catches a spark. Only the truly mad or eerily stalwart choose to become gunslingers.</p><p>Gunslingers hurl death from their guns in a roaring cacophony. Whenever they draw their weapons, life or death hangs in the balance, hinging on their guts, snap decision-making, and quick aim.</p><h2>Dangerous Outsiders</h2><p>A gunslinger’s explosive lifestyle lends well to wandering and adventuring. Gunslingers often shoot first and ask questions later, an attitude that earns them few friends and plentiful enemies. In their travels, most gunslingers are secretive and go to great lengths to remain incognito, lest they be spotted by old foes with scores to settle.</p><p>Yet their skills are always in demand. Anyone seeking protection or revenge can count on a gunslinger when they roll into town. After all, gunslingers often pick up odd jobs to make ends meet, and they have one truly marketable skill.</p><h2>Creating a Gunslinger</h2><p>When creating your gunslinger, consider where firearms fit in the campaign’s world and the common perceptions of those who use them. If firearms are the norm, your gunslinger might be a mercenary or militia fighter. If firearms are rare, your gunslinger might be one of a kind, a trailblazer in new types of warfare.</p><p>It’s also not unusual for a gunslinger to be haunted by their past. Did some event drive you to the gun and motivate you to travel? Is there a bounty on your head in one or more regions? Do you have old enemies that seek you for revenge?</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>To make a gunslinger quickly, follow these suggestions. Make Dexterity and Constitution your highest ability scores. If you plan to choose the Gun Tank creed, instead make Strength your highest ability score. Lastly, choose any background, preferably one that emphasizes your familiarity with firearms and penchant for risk-taking.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[.hM3JxFbKydwH55jY]{Gunslinger Class Table}</p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"4\">The Gunslinger</td></tr><tr><td>Level</td><td>Proficiency Bonus</td><td>Risk Dice</td><td>Features</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>—</td><td>Fighting Style, Quick Draw</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>4d8</td><td>Critical Shot, Poker Face, Risk</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>4d8</td><td>Gunslinger’s Creed</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>4d8</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>4d8</td><td>Extra Attack</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>5d8</td><td>Gut Shot</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>5d8</td><td>Creed feature, Evasion</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>5d8</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>5d8</td><td>Critical Shot improvement</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>5d10</td><td>Creed feature</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>5d10</td><td>Mankiller</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>5d10</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>5d10</td><td>Dire Gambit</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>6d10</td><td>Creed feature</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>6d10</td><td>Cheat Death</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>6d10</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>6d10</td><td>Critical Shot improvement</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>6d12</td><td>Maverick</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>6d12</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>6d12</td><td>Head Shot</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h1>Class Features</h1><p>As a gunslinger, you gain the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d8 per gunslinger level</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong></em> 8 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong></em> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per gunslinger level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><em><strong>Armor:</strong></em> Light armor</p><p><em><strong>Weapons:</strong></em> Simple weapons, simple firearms, martial firearms</p><p><em><strong>Tools:</strong></em> One type of gaming set</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws:</strong></em> Dexterity, Charisma</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Choose two from: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>Leather armor with a longcoat</li><li>A dagger and (<em>a</em>) a handgun and 20 bullets or (<em>b</em>) a revolver and 10 bullets</li><li>Any two-handed firearm that isn’t heavy and 30 bullets or shells</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<em>b</em>) an explorer’s pack</li></ul><h2>Fighting Style</h2><p>You adopt a particular style of gunfighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h3>Akimbo</h3><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting with firearms, you don’t take a penalty to the damage of the second attack.</p><h3>Bullseye</h3><p>You gain a +2 bonus to ranged attack rolls you make with firearms. The weapon must have the Sighted property or have a normal range of 80 feet or longer to gain this benefit. This benefit doesn’t stack with the Archery fighting style.</p><h3>Duelist</h3><p>While you are wielding a firearm in one hand and nothing in the other, if you make a ranged weapon attack and exceed the target’s AC by 5 or more, you deal one extra die of weapon damage. You can only use this ability once per round.</p><h3>Shotgunner</h3><p>When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a firearm that has the Scatter property, you can reroll the lowest damage die, and you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is worse than the original.</p><h2>Quick Draw</h2><p>Gunslingers have twitch reflexes and can pull a gun in the blink of an eye. You have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, you can draw or stow up to two weapons when you roll initiative and whenever you take an action on your turn.</p><h2>Critical Shot</h2><p>At 2nd level, your ranged firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p><p>Starting at 9th level, your ranged firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20, and at 17th level your ranged firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 17–20.</p><h2>Poker Face</h2><p>Starting at 2nd level, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to prevent others from sensing your motives, perceiving your emotions, or reading your thoughts.</p><h2>Risk</h2><p>By 2nd level, you can perform incredible feats of daring that are fueled by special dice called risk dice.</p><h3>Risk Dice</h3><p>You have four risk dice, which are d8s. You gain additional risk dice, and your risk dice change as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Risk Dice column of the Gunslinger table. You regain all expended risk dice when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Using Risk Dice</h3><p>Once per turn, you can expend a risk die to perform a deed of your choice. Your deed options are detailed at the end of the class description.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>Some of your deeds require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deed’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Deed save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p><h2>Gunslinger's Creed</h2><p>By the time gunslingers reach 3rd level, they embrace a way of living, known as their creed, which guides their judgments and their unique brand of gunslinging. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2>Extra Attack</h2><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h2>Gut Shot</h2><p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you score a critical hit against a Large or smaller creature with a ranged firearm attack, the bullet lodges itself in the target. Until the creature uses its action to dislodge the bullet, it moves at half speed and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Elementals, Oozes, and Undead are immune to this effect.</p><h2>Evasion</h2><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WN2LWEljYU6QqnRH]{ice storm}</em> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h2>Mankiller</h2><p>Starting at 11th level, when you use your action to make ranged firearm attacks, you can add your ability modifier to the firearm’s damage rolls. Note that firearms don’t normally add your ability modifier to their damage rolls.</p><h2>Dire Gambit</h2><p>Beginning at 13th level, whenever you score a critical hit, you regain one expended risk die.</p><h2>Cheat Death</h2><p>By 15th level, you have a knack for evading the grave. When you drop to 0 hit points and don’t die outright, you can use your reaction and expend one risk die to remain standing. You instead drop to a number of hit points equal to the number rolled on the die.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Maverick</h2><p>By 18th level, you have become unshakable. You have advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws.</p><h2>Head Shot</h2><p>At 20th level, when you score a critical hit against a creature with a firearm, you can choose for the shot to be a head shot. If the creature has less than 100 hit points, it dies. Otherwise, it takes an extra 10d10 damage from the hit. Elementals, Oozes, Undead, and creatures that lack nervous systems or vital organs take no extra damage from this feature.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h1>Deeds</h1><p>The deeds are presented in alphabetical order.</p><h3>Bite the Bullet</h3><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one risk die to gain temporary hit points equal the number rolled on the die + your Constitution modifier.</p><h3>Covering Fire</h3><p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one risk die as a bonus action to cow the creature. Roll the risk die and subtract it from the next attack roll the creature makes before the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Dodge Roll</h3><p>You can expend one risk die as a bonus action to move up to 15 feet and reload any firearm you are holding. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, ignores difficult terrain, and allows you to move through a hostile creature’s space, as long as you don’t end your movement there.</p><h3>Limb Shot</h3><p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one risk die as a bonus action and aim for one of its limbs, attempting to force it to drop one item of your choice that it is holding. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose, which lands at its feet.</p><h3>Skin of Your Teeth</h3><p>When an attacker you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can expend a risk die as a reaction to dodge out of harm’s way at the last second. You add the risk die to your AC against this attack, potentially causing it to miss.</p><h3>Steady Aim</h3><p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one risk die to double the normal and maximum range for the next ranged weapon attack you make.</p><h1>Gunslinger's Creeds</h1><p>Gunslingers have many features in common, but each of them walks their own path and follows their own code. This code, which gunslingers call a creed, embodies their core beliefs and informs their unique combat style.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Gunslinger’s Creeds</td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.y6brrWePlzMp9gM3#gun-tank]{Gun Tank}</td><td>Lugs around heavy mounted firearms</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.y6brrWePlzMp9gM3#gun-ko-master]{Gun-Ko Master}</td><td>A martial artist who uses the gun as a total weapon</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.y6brrWePlzMp9gM3#high-roller]{High Roller}</td><td>Gambles with their life and fortune; no risk is too high</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.y6brrWePlzMp9gM3#musketeer]{Musketeer}</td><td>A musket-and-rapier-weilding soldier of honor and courage</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.y6brrWePlzMp9gM3#pistolero]{Pistolero}</td><td>Fires six-shooters from the hip at incredible speed</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.y6brrWePlzMp9gM3#sharpshooter]{Sharpshooter}</td><td>A careful and precise, eagle-eyed marksman</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.y6brrWePlzMp9gM3#spellslinger]{Spellslinger}</td><td>Fires spells as well as bullets in deadly bombardments</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.y6brrWePlzMp9gM3#trick-shot]{Trick Shot}</td><td>Ricochets bullets to hit targets from any angle</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.y6brrWePlzMp9gM3#white-hat]{White Hat}</td><td>A law-abiding protector of the weak that never blinks in the face of danger</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Gun Tank</h2><p><em>Prerequisite: Strength score 15 or higher</em></p><p>Be bigger, be badder, and be tougher, and no man will stand in your way. You are a living siege engine, a titan of muscle, brandishing weapons most men are incapable of lifting. Armed with these devastating firearms, you wade into the field of battle, bombarding and destroying those foolish enough to approach you.</p><h3>Heavy Gunner</h3><p>When you choose this creed at 3rd level, you can carry heavy firearms regardless of their weight. Additionally, you can use Strength, rather than Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls using heavy firearms, and you can use your Strength, instead of your Dexterity, when calculating your Deed save DC.</p><h3>Tough as Nails</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</p><p>You also gain proficiency with medium and heavy armor.</p><h3>Thick-Headed</h3><p>At 7th level, you have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.</p><h3>Strong as an Ox</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, and lift are doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Additionally, you can ignore the Two-Handed property on firearms with which you are proficient.</p><h3>Gun Rage</h3><p>At 14th level, as a bonus action, you can explode into a fury to destroy lesser men. For the next minute, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and can make one additional attack whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. However, for the duration, your speed is halved and you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws.</p><p>Your gun rage ends if you take cover, end your turn without attacking, or use your bonus action to end it early.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Gun-Ko Master</h2><p>The ancient art of gun-ko is passed through generations of gunslingers who study the gun as a perfect weapon and meditate on its intricacies. This path is not for the impatient or the faint of heart, as those who practice it diligently make their guns an extension of themselves, learning to strike with the speed of a rifle and catch bullets out of the air.</p><h3>Point-Blank Shot</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged firearm attacks.</p><h3>Gun-Ko</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the immortal art of gun-ko, which sees the gun as a total weapon, as devastating used as a melee weapon in close quarters as it is fired at range. You can treat firearms as melee weapons with the Finesse property that deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit, or 1d8 damage if the firearm has the Two-Handed property.</p><p>Additionally, when you make a ranged weapon attack with a firearm against a creature within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack using that firearm as a bonus action.</p><h3>Lightning Disarm</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, if a creature within 5 feet of you is holding a firearm, you can use your bonus action and expend a risk die to attempt to disarm that creature. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Deed save DC. On a failed save, you take the firearm from the creature’s hands after a series of rapid movements. You must have at least one empty hand to use this feature.</p><h3>Bullet-Catch</h3><p>Also at 7th level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the projectile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0).</p><h3>Predictive Dodge</h3><p>At 10th level, your reflexes are so honed that you can dodge incoming bullets. You can use your bonus action to choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. You gain the benefits of the Dodge action against the target’s ranged attacks and effects until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you take damage from the target.</p><h3>Gatling Strikes</h3><p>By 14th level, you have mastered the most advanced techniques of gun-ko. You can use your bonus action to make two melee weapon attacks and one ranged weapon attack with a firearm against targets within 15 feet of you.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>High Roller</h2><p>Fortune is a fickle thing—unless you’re a high roller. These gunslingers are master card sharps and dice throwers that mix their love of risk with their talent for gunplay. High rollers push their luck until it runs out, then push harder. Why settle for just a win when you could bet it all and win big?</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you choose this creed at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with all gaming sets and in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, or Perception.</p><h3>All In</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action when you make an attack roll or ability check, or as a reaction when you make a saving throw, you can expend a risk die, roll it, and add it to the result. You choose to use this feature after you roll the d20 but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. If you roll a 1 on the risk die, you fail the roll, regardless of the result.</p><h3>Liar's Dice</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, when you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can roll the d20 in secret and declare any result you wish. If the GM chooses to call your bluff, reveal the number rolled on the d20. If you were telling the truth, treat the result as if you rolled a 20. If you were telling a lie, roll the d20 again and use the lowest of the rolls. If the GM chooses not to call your bluff, you use the result you declared regardless of what you rolled.</p><p>You can choose to roll in secret a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Boom and Bust</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, when you hit with a ranged firearm attack, you can expend a risk die and add it to the weapon’s damage roll. After this attack, the weapon jams. A jammed weapon can’t be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.</p><h3>Unlucky Numbers</h3><p>By 10th level, you can accumulate a debt of misfortune. When a hostile creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to record the number rolled on the d20 and impose disadvantage on the attack roll. Until you finish a short or long rest, creatures that attack you score a critical hit when rolling that number.</p><h3>Double or Nothing</h3><p>At 14th level, when you score a critical hit with a firearm, you can roll two additional d20s. Treat these d20s as if they were ranged firearm attacks you made against the target. If they both miss, your critical hit becomes a normal hit. If either of these d20s would score a critical hit, roll the weapon’s damage three times, instead of twice as normal for a critical hit. Otherwise, the critical hit happens as normal.</p><h2>Musketeer</h2><p>You believe that camaraderie and glory go hand-in-hand, that you and your allies are undefeatable as long as you stand together. As such, you have trained with blades and halberds for close-quarters combat. Your place isn’t supporting your allies from afar, but launching a single volley of shot before charging in, bayonet or cutlass in hand, that you might all succeed or fail as one.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>Starting when you choose this creed at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the bayonet, cutlass, halberd, rapier, and shortsword.</p><h3>Heavy Shot</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can load and fire especially dense bullets. Whenever you hit a target with a ranged attack using a blunderbuss, flintlock, or musket, you deal extra damage equal to the number of damage dice rolled for the attack.</p><h3>Lock, Stock, and Barrel</h3><p>At 7th level, you ignore the Loading and Misfire properties of the blunderbuss, flintlock, and musket.</p><h3>Bayonet Charge</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, if you move at least 15 feet straight toward a target on your turn, you can use a bonus action to make an attack with a bayonet or a melee weapon you are holding.</p><h3>All for One</h3><p>By 14th level, whenever a friendly creature within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction to make an attack with a firearm or bayonet against the attacker.</p><h2>Pistolero</h2><p>Bullets are power, and you have long believed that more bullets equal more power. As such, your expertise is in delivering a hail of deadly fire to pulverize your enemies. Not every bullet needs to be accurate to make a difference.</p><h3>Point-Blank Shot</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged firearm attacks.</p><h3>Fan the Hammer</h3><p>At 3rd level, when you take the Attack action on your turn to attack with a firearm, you can expend a risk die as a bonus action to make two additional ranged firearm attacks with that weapon. These additional attacks always have disadvantage, regardless of circumstance. This weapon can’t have the Automatic or Two-Handed property, and you must have a free hand to use this feature.</p><p>At 14th level, you can make three additional attacks with disadvantage, instead of two, when you use this feature.</p><h3>Speed Loader</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you have mastered the art of quickly reloading your weapon. On your turn, you can reload a single one-handed firearm without using an action or bonus action.</p><h3>Bullet Time</h3><p>At 10th level, when you make a ranged firearm attack with a one-handed firearm, you can use your bonus action to gain advantage on the attack roll.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Swift Vengeance</h3><p>At 14th level, as a reaction when you take damage from a creature within 15 feet of you, you can make a firearm attack against that creature.</p><h2>Sharpshooter</h2><p>A well-placed bullet is more powerful than a sword, arrow, or spell. Indeed, you believe that every violent conflict should sound like a single loud crack followed by a long silence. Such shots need to be delivered perfectly, even at range, for when they are done right, they are as deadly for the target as they are stupendous for the audience.</p><h3>Eagle Eye</h3><p>Starting when you choose this creed at 3rd level, when you make a ranged attack with a firearm you are holding in two hands, you can use a bonus action to expend a risk die and add it to the attack roll. The attack doesn’t gain disadvantage as a result of long range.</p><h3>Sniper's Stance</h3><p>At 3rd level, you don't have disadvantage on ranged firearm attacks as a result of being prone. Additionally, when you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement.</p><h3>Camouflage</h3><p>By 7th level, you’ve learned to expertly conceal yourself in a sniper’s nest. You can spend 1 minute preparing camouflage for yourself. Until you move, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make to hide.</li><li>Attacks you make while hidden don’t automatically reveal your location.</li><li>Creatures have disadvantage on ability checks they make to discern the origin of your firearm attacks.</li></ul><h3>Eye for Movement</h3><p>By 10th level, your vision is keen enough to place invisible targets in your sights. As a bonus action, you can gain @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ.JournalEntryPage.0RBamBThjzeAdMSt]{darkvision} and the effects of the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.DQzlB5Y3k791W5bH]{see invisibility}</em> against creatures that are 20 feet away from you or further until the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Focused Shot</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, once on each of your turns when you make a ranged firearm attack, you can choose to fire a shot that penetrates through targets. If you hit, the bullet passes through the target and continues in a straight line out to its normal range, stopping early if it strikes a solid object. Make a separate ranged attack roll against each creature in this line in order. On a hit, the bullet deals damage to the target and passes through it; on a miss, the bullet stops.</p><h2>Spellslinger</h2><p>Magic and guns aren’t so different. If arcane power is like gunpowder and a spell is like a bullet, you are like a gun, directing your spells with precision at unfortunate targets. You mix the disciplines of gun and spell, sometimes loading arcane charges with your shots and firing streaks of lighting, frost, or flame in the wake of your bullet.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[.rjZzazgLdPkPNTrz]{Spellslinger Spellcasting Table}</p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Spellslinger Spellcasting</td></tr><tr><td>Gunslinger Level</td><td>Cantrips Known</td><td>Spells Known</td><td>1st</td><td>2nd</td><td>3rd</td><td>4th</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>4</td><td>13</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>When you reach 3rd level, you complement your bullets with the ability to cast spells.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You learn <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.LjTrnhBJRwTJkeuS]{finger guns}</em> and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Calibri, sans-serif\"><em>Spell Slots.</em></span> The Spellslinger Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</strong></em> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Spellslinger Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h3>Bang, You're Dead!</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can use Deeds with <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.LjTrnhBJRwTJkeuS]{finger guns}</em> spell attacks. Additionally, when you hit a creature with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.LjTrnhBJRwTJkeuS]{finger guns}</em> attack, you can spend a risk die as a bonus action to deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the target.</p><h3>Spellshot</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can load an entire cantrip into your gun. When you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can use your bonus action to make one ranged attack with a firearm or make a ranged spell attack using the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.LjTrnhBJRwTJkeuS]{finger guns}</em> cantrip.</p><h3>Rune-Carved Cartridges</h3><p>Also at 7th level, your ranged firearm attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h3>Magic Bullet</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, when you make a ranged firearm attack on your turn, you can use a bonus action to wreathe the bullet in a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{magic missile}</em> spell. The attack must be within the firearm’s normal range. Don’t roll this attack; it automatically hits its target and deals an extra 3d4 + 3 force damage.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Improved Spellshot</h3><p>At 14th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can expend a risk die as a bonus action to make one ranged attack with a firearm or make a ranged spell attack using the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.LjTrnhBJRwTJkeuS]{finger guns}</em> cantrip. Add the risk die to the attack roll.</p><p>If the spell requires a spell attack roll, you can choose to channel the spell through the firearm or <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.LjTrnhBJRwTJkeuS]{finger guns}</em> attack. On a hit, the attack deals its normal damage, in addition to the effects of the spell.</p><h2>Trick Shot</h2><p>Accuracy means different things to different people. For you, true accuracy isn’t necessarily in hitting a target on the first shot, but might include hitting the mark after the bullet bounces around a dozen times. Your attacks are just as dangerous if they miss, or even after hitting their mark, as others’ are while they’re still in the air.</p><h3>Creative Trajectory</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you begin to learn how to make your bullets travel in unexpected ways. Your ranged firearm attacks ignore half cover.</p><h3>Ricochet</h3><p>At 3rd level, when you miss with a ranged firearm attack and you don’t have disadvantage, you can use your bonus action to reroll the attack roll, and you must use the new roll. If this causes the attack to hit, the attack deals only half damage.</p><h3>Light-Footed</h3><p>By 7th level, you’re just as good at escaping from trouble as you are at getting into it. Difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.</p><h3>Deft Deflectionist</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, when a creature you can see makes a ranged weapon attack against you, you can attempt to deflect the projectile by shooting it out of the air. As a reaction, make a ranged attack with a firearm. If the result of your roll is greater than the result of the attacker, the attack targeting you has disadvantage. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack hits.</p><h3>Pinball Shot</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a ranged firearm attack, you can ricochet the bullet to hit an additional target. The distance to the second target can be no greater than half the firearm’s normal range. Make a separate attack roll for the second target.</p><h2>White Hat</h2><p>Some gunslingers live by a code and expect others to do the same. These gunslingers, known as white hats, sometimes serve as agents of local or regional law but never hesitate to do what’s right no matter what the rules say. Despite their affinity for deadly weapons, white hats prefer to keep their friends safe and take their enemies in unharmed—a preference they find their enemies aren’t often inclined to oblige.</p><h3>Lay Down the Law</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action and expend one risk die to keep a keen eye out for dangers that threaten your companions. When you do, roll the risk die and gain a pool of temporary hit points equal to the number rolled + your level in this class. This pool of temporary hit points is immediately divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see (other than you) within range of a firearm you are holding. You must give at least 1 temporary hit point to each chosen creature.</p><p>When a creature loses temporary hit points granted by this feature as the result of an attack, you can use your reaction to make one ranged weapon attack with a firearm against the attacker. Any remaining temporary hit points granted by this feature are lost at the start of your next turn.</p><p>At 10th level, this feature improves: your pool of temporary hit points equals the number rolled on the risk die + twice your level in this class.</p><h3>Steely-Eyed Aura</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the frightened condition while you are conscious.</p><h3>Reach for the Skies</h3><p>At 7th level, you can use your action to call for your enemy’s surrender. When you do, a creature of your choice within 30 feet that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Deed save DC. A creature that is immune to being frightened automatically succeeds on this saving throw.</p><p>On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated and can’t willingly move for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Long Arm of the Law</h3><p>At 10th level, once per turn when you hit a Large or smaller creature with a firearm attack, you can choose to deal half as much damage to hobble the target. The creature can’t move on its next turn unless it first takes the Disengage action.</p><h3>Gold Star Hero</h3><p>At 14th level, your capacity for heroism increases. Your features from this archetype gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>While a creature has temporary hit points granted by your Lay Down the Law feature, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li><li>The range of your Steely-Eyed Aura feature increases to 30 feet.</li><li>You regain the use of your Reach for the Skies feature when you finish a short or long rest.</li></ul><p>@UUID[.ocyeGv1m8ff8E3NX]{Sidebar: Gunslingers in Other Settings}</p>"

With a single, precise stroke, she unleashes a wave of arcane energy, focused into a searing blue beam.</p><p>A tiefling waves her hands to conjure floating greatswords of humming blue energy that dance about in mesmerizing and deadly arcs. One blade takes on an aspect of fire, and the other lightning, as she begins to cleave through the goblinoid horde.</p><p>Waving a black-and-red checkered banner, a dragonborn king charges into the fore. At his sides are warmages of all houses, a chessboard of elite arcanists, poised to turn the tide of battle.</p><p>The undisputed masters of cantrips, warmages turn the most fundamental types of magic into a deadly and precise art.</p><h2>Cantrip Masters</h2><p>While other spellcasters aspire to grander and more complex spells, warmages refine and master the most fundamental magic: cantrips. Warmages wield their magic in the same way that a warrior uses a sword, bow, or axe—as weapons to be perfected, not as an unknowable force to be feared. In contrast to sorcerers and wizards, their magic is a trainable skill, one that can be mastered by almost anyone with discipline and aptitude. Therefore, warmages stand among the most fearsome of spellcasters, with only the most rudimentary of spells.</p><h2>Strategic Geniuses</h2><p>Warmages have a long and storied history as masterful strategists and tacticians, both in grand battles and personal skirmishes. If a warmage is outgunned or outmanned, they’ll try to outthink their foes, which works more often than not. Warmages demonstrate an efficient kind of pragmatism, owing perhaps to their ability to solve many problems with just a few magical tools.</p><h2>Aligned Free Agents</h2><p>While some warmages are fully self-taught, the majority join a house: a loose confederation of warmages who practice together and share secrets of the trade. Houses teach invaluable battlefield strategy, but each individual house also touts their own brands of tactics and styles of magical tricks. The House of Knights, for example, emphasizes armor and martial prowess, whereas the House of Kings emphasizes battlefield strategy.</p><p>By way of metaphor, houses that value honor and teamwork above all else brand themselves after games of strategy, whereas those who epitomize self-reliance name themselves for games of chance. This division in the warmage houses is representative of a schism that dates back to the earliest warmage masters. Legend has it that the first two masters separated when one decided to found a college. The other, out of spite, built a casino outside its grounds.</p><h2>Creating a Warmage</h2><p>Warmages come from all walks of life, so as you build yours, consider where you first learned the fundamentals of magic, which you would go on to perfect. You might have picked up cantrips from a fellow adventurer or in the early stages of wizarding training. You could even be self-taught. Choose an Arcane Initiation which best fits your character’s history with magic.</p><p>Moreover, consider how you feel about magic as a whole. Are you envious of other spellcasters, or are you confident you could best them regardless? Did you once pine to be a wizard, but found you could never muster enough true magic to form a spell slot? Did you choose warmagistry to hone your talents to their absolute peak, or did you choose it to wield power no warrior can equal?</p><p>Lastly, consider your prospective warmage House. Though you don’t choose one until reaching 3rd level, your aspirations might shape which house you favor the most. If you would like to dabble with greater arcane magic, the House of Bishops is the best fit. If the clashing of swords at the frontlines piques your interest, consider the House of Knights.</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>You can make a Warmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Make Strength your third highest if you plan to take the House of Knights. Then choose the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.vrN18tbTw7io5MWd]{chill touch}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.azLLSylqxURWV6ih]{force dart}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.zfwEl9lWgU2SGM8q]{force weapon}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.6KEFY7FZm3Kuxn5o]{phantom grapnel}</em> cantrips, and the Adventurer Arcane Initiation.

At 1st level, choose one of the following fighting styles:</p><h3>Blaster</h3><p>You gain a +1 bonus to the saving throw DCs of your warmage spells.</p><h3>Deflector</h3><p>When you have at least one hand free and a creature hits you with a spell attack or a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your Armor Class for that attack, potentially causing it to miss.</p><h3>Resistive</h3><p>While you are wearing light armor or are under the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.CKZTpZlxj7hjjo2H]{mage armor}</em> spell, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.</p><h3>Sniper</h3><p>You gain a +1 bonus to ranged spell attack rolls. Additionally, your warmage cantrips ignore half cover.</p><h3>Striker</h3><p>When you hit a creature with a cantrip that requires a melee attack and exceed the target’s AC by 5 or more or score a critical hit, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.</p><h2>Warmage Edge</h2><p>Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you deal damage with a warmage cantrip, you can improve one damage roll of the spell, adding your Intelligence modifier to the roll if you don’t already add it. Starting at 5th level, and as you gain levels in this class, you also add extra dice to the damage roll of your warmage cantrips, as shown in the Cantrip Bonus Dice column of the Warmage table. For example, when you are at 5th level, you can improve the damage of the <em>fire bolt</em> cantrip to deal fire damage equal to 3d10 + your Intelligence modifier on a hit.</p><h2>Warmage Tricks</h2><p>Beginning at 2nd level, you learn to use Warmage Tricks, special techniques that alter the way you fight, move, and cast your spells. You learn two tricks of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. At higher levels, you learn additional tricks as shown in the Tricks Known column of the Warmage table.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tricks you know and replace it with another trick for which you meet the prerequisites.</p><h2>Warmage House</h2><p>Upon reaching 3rd level, you choose a Warmage House that teaches you a suite of magical strategies. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2>Arcane Surge</h2><p>Starting at 5th level, you learn to tap into a vast reservoir of magical power and unleash it upon your foes. Once on each of your turns, when you deal damage with a warmage cantrip, you can double the number of damage dice dealt by the spell. You can’t use this feature on a spell that has scored a critical hit.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 11th level, you can use this feature twice between rests.</p><h2>Tactical Insight</h2><p>At 6th level, you learn how to use ambient magical power to defend yourself from your foes’ magical attacks. You can add your Intelligence modifier to saving throws you make against spells and other magical effects that deal damage.</p><h2>Strategic Deflection</h2><p>Starting at 14th level, when a creature casts a spell that forces you to make a saving throw to avoid damage, you can use your reaction to attempt to redirect some of the spell’s energy to a new target. If you succeed on your saving throw against the spell, choose another creature you can see within the spell’s range or up to 30 feet away from you, whichever is closer, to make a saving throw against the spell, using your spell save DC. The chosen creature can be the original spellcaster. On a failed save, the creature suffers the effects of the spell as if you had cast the spell and it had been the original target or been within the area of the spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Master Warmage</h2><p>At 20th level, you reach the pinnacle of your warmage prowess. Whenever you cast a cantrip that deals 4 dice of damage to a target, it instead deals 5 dice of damage (excluding your cantrip bonus dice). If you cast a cantrip that makes 4 attacks, it instead makes 5 attacks.</p><h1>Warmage Tricks</h1><p>The following tricks are presented in alphabetical order. If a warmage trick has prerequisites, you must meet them to choose it. You can choose the trick at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p><h3>Bishop's Maneuver</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Bishops</em></p><p>You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. When you do so, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn.</p><h3>Blasting Cantrip</h3><p>Once on each of your turns, when you deal force damage to a creature with a warmage cantrip, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.</p><h3>Blinding Light</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: light cantrip</em></p><p>When you use the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Bnn9Nzajixvow9xi]{light}</em> cantrip to target an object you are holding, you can direct a flare at a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, which must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is blinded until the start of your next turn. After a creature has failed a saving throw against this trick, it has advantage on all saving throws against it for the next 24 hours.</p><h3>Castle</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Rooks</em></p><p>As an action, you can choose a willing Small or Medium creature you can see within 120 feet of you. You both teleport, swapping places.</p><p>Once you use this trick, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Chivalrous Presence</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: House of Knights</em></p><p>You gain proficiency in the Insight and Persuasion skills, and you have advantage on ability checks you make to interact with nobility. Additionally, other creatures can always discern when you are telling the truth.</p><h3>Cloak of Feathers</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: House of Rooks</em></p><p>While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier.</p><h3>Commander's Steed</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: House of Kings</em></p><p>You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.5eh2HFbS13078Y3H]{find steed}</em> spell and can cast it at will without expending a spell slot. Your steed is more resilient than most; its hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your warmage level.</p><h3>Corrosive Cantrip</h3><p>Once on each of your turns, when you deal acid damage to a creature with a warmage cantrip, you can cause the acid to erode the target’s defenses. The next time a creature makes an attack roll against the target before the start of your next turn, the target takes a penalty to its Armor Class equal to half your warmage level (up to a maximum of −5) for that attack.</p><h3>Directed Momentum</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Lancers</em></p><p>Once on each of your turns, when you score a critical hit with a melee attack or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make an unarmed strike against a second target. If the target is within range of your Shock Trooper feature, you can lunge toward it. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d8 force damage.</p><h3>Draining Cantrip</h3><p>Whenever you deal necrotic or poison damage to a hostile creature with a warmage cantrip, you can siphon some of its life force. You gain temporary hit points equal to half your warmage level, which last for 1 minute.</p><h3>Encryptogram</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: cryptogram cantrip</em></p><p>Your knowledge of ciphers has improved your magically clandestine communications. When you cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.OAsbdPB9hmlnSRAK]{cryptogram}</em> cantrip, its limit is 20 characters, instead of 8, and only the specified recipient can read the message.</p><h3>Explosive Cantrip</h3><p>Once on each of your turns, when you deal fire damage to a creature with a warmage cantrip, you can cause it to explode. Each creature within 5 feet of the target, except you and the target, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take half the fire damage dealt to the target.</p><h3>Extended Range</h3><p>Whenever you cast a warmage cantrip that has a range of 5 feet or greater, its range is doubled.</p><h3>Field Medic</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: House of Bishops</em></p><p>You learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8zT7njvqbpXs4Cel]{spare the dying}</em> cantrip, which doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known. Additionally, when you cast <em>spare the dying</em> on a creature that has 0 hit points, the target regains 1 hit point and gains temporary hit points equal to your warmage level, which last for 1 minute. Once a creature regains hit points from this trick, it can’t do so again until it finishes a long rest.</p><h3>Flexible Range</h3><p>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls. Additionally, when you cast a warmage cantrip that requires a melee spell attack, its range increases to 10 feet.</p><h3>Fold</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Cards</em></p><p>You have learned to graciously accept defeat using your Deck of Fate. As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can play your entire hand to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.z1mx84ONwkXKUZd7]{shield}</em> spell without expending a spell slot.</p><p>Once you use this trick, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Gamble</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: House of Cards or House of Dice, cheat cantrip</em></p><p>You are always under the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.4QK5rxqGTtd7tSx2]{cheat}</em> cantrip.</p><p>Additionally, when you miss with an attack roll, or you fail an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the d20 and must use the new roll. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Infinite Variation</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: prestidigitation cantrip</em></p><p>You have become exceptionally skilled at using the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.udsLtG0BugXHR2JQ]{prestidigitation}</em> cantrip to mimic other spells. When you cast <em>prestidigitation</em>, you can use it to emulate the effects of any other cantrip that doesn’t deal damage, even one that is not on the warmage spell list. To do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, otherwise the spell fails. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for a cantrip cast using this trick, and it counts as a warmage cantrip for you.</p><h3>Icy Cantrip</h3><p>Once on each of your turns, when you deal cold damage to a creature with a warmage cantrip, you can numb the target with a frigid blast. The first time the target makes an attack roll before the end of its next turn, subtract half your warmage level from the attack roll.</p><h3>Knight's Aegis</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Knights, force buckler cantrip</em></p><p>When you cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.5BXHZiaNeDZNCCb1]{force buckler}</em> cantrip, you can concentrate on it for up to 1 minute. The spell doesn’t end early if you are hit by an attack.</p><h3>Leading Edge Tactics</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: House of Lancers</em></p><p>You always have a plan when engaging the enemy. Attacks against you have disadvantage during the first round of combat. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.</p><h3>Lieutenant's Demand</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Kings</em></p><p>You can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.arzCrMRgcNiQuh43]{command}</em> at will without expending a spell slot.</p><h3>Mage Hand Knack</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: mage hand cantrip</em></p><p>Your skill with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hand}</em> cantrip allows you to use it as an extension of yourself. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can use one of the following effects with the hand:</p><p><em><strong>Press.</strong></em> The hand pushes against a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. Choose a direction away from that creature. Every foot of movement in that direction while the hand is pressing against it costs the creature 1 extra foot of movement. The hand continues to push against the target until the spell ends or you use your bonus action to use a different effect with the hand.</p><p><em><strong>Punch.</strong></em> The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 force damage.</p><p><em><strong>Seize.</strong></em> The hand grabs a Small or smaller creature and attempts to grapple it. The creature must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice) against your spell save DC or be grappled by the hand. The hand continues to grapple the target until the target uses an action to break the grapple on its turn, the spell ends, or you use your bonus action to use a different effect with the hand.</p><h3>Minor Shadow Illusion</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: minor illusion cantrip</em></p><p>When you create the image of an object in an unoccupied space using the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.oIzA2MEHwxhtQneU]{minor illusion}</em> cantrip, you can fill it with fibers of shadowstuff, causing it to become partially real. No matter what form the semi-real object takes, it still must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. It has AC 10 and 5 hit points, and it weighs 5 pounds. You can only have one semi-real illusion at a time. While this semi-real object exists, the cantrip requires your concentration.</p><p>The illusion can’t replicate a creature, but it can deal damage to a creature within its 5-foot cube. If the illusion is of an object that can deal damage, a creature that enters the object’s 5-foot cube or begins its turn there must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 damage of a type appropriate to the illusion. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). This damage can’t trigger Warmage Edge or any warmage tricks.</p><h3>Mystical Armor</h3><p>You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.CKZTpZlxj7hjjo2H]{mage armor}</em> spell on yourself at will, without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><h3>Mystical Athlete</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: quickstep or springheel cantrip</em></p><p>When you cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.dcgjpIdK6iJOr9uy]{quickstep}</em> cantrip, your speed increases by 20 feet instead of 10 feet. When you cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.DPA4NtW5VJ2rMpm4]{springheel}</em> cantrip, your jumping distance increases by 20 feet instead of 10 feet. If you know both of these cantrips, you can cast both of them as part of the same bonus action.</p><h3>Mystical Weaponmaster</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: force weapon or magic daggers cantrip</em></p><p>When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.zfwEl9lWgU2SGM8q]{force weapon}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.Tlx8w6r6RjUO7ltT]{magic daggers}</em> cantrips, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p><h3>Mystical Vision</h3><p>You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{detect magic}</em> spell at will without expending a spell slot.</p><h3>Phantom Hookshot</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: phantom grapnel cantrip</em></p><p>You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.6KEFY7FZm3Kuxn5o]{phantom grapnel}</em> cantrip as a bonus action. If you do so, its range is reduced to 15 feet. When you cast the spell as an action, creatures are pulled an extra 10 feet toward you by the spell.</p><h3>Rapid Fortification</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: mending cantrip</em></p><p>You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.kjmjY0zlE6IEiQVL]{mending}</em> cantrip as an action or a bonus action. If you cast it as an action, you can use one of the following effects:</p><ul><li>You can restore a single nonmagical object, such as a door, cart, or window, to pristine condition if at least half of its parts are present. This object can be no larger than 10 cubic feet, or 1 cubic foot if it is exceptionally complex (such as a clock).</li><li>You can create simple fortifications, such as sealing a door shut, adding wooden planks to a window, or building a short stone wall (no larger than 10 cubic feet). You must have the materials present to use this ability.</li></ul><h3>Snake Eyes</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Dice</em></p><p>If you roll a 1 or 2 on a Die of Fate, you keep the die instead of giving it to the GM.</p><h3>Severe Cantrip</h3><p>When a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw against one of your warmage cantrips, it automatically fails the save and takes twice the number of damage dice dealt by the spell, as if you scored a critical hit. The additional damage only applies to the creature that rolled a 1.</p><h3>Signature Focus</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></p><p>When you finish a long rest, you can place a unique sigil on a simple or martial weapon, which becomes your signature focus until you use this ability again. This weapon becomes magical, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warmage spells. Your signature focus is bonded to you, and gains a number of special abilities:</p><ul><li>As a bonus action, you can call your signature focus to your hand, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as it.</li><li>You can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, to attack and damage rolls using your signature focus.</li><li>Your signature focus gains a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1).

Your focus regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest.</li></ul><h3>Silent Cantrip</h3><p>Once on each of your turns when you deal thunder damage to a hostile creature with a warmage cantrip, you can create a 15-foot-diameter sphere of magical silence (as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.5VhqFROQYjr1P9lp]{silence}</em> spell), centered on yourself or the creature (your choice), which lasts until the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Split Fire</h3><p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em></p><p>When you cast a warmage cantrip that requires a single spell attack roll, you can select multiple creatures and make a spell attack roll against each one. You can target a number of creatures equal to the number of damage dice the cantrip deals, and split your damage dice up amongst your targets, to a minimum of 1 die of damage per target. Each attack must target a different creature.</p><p>For example, <em>fire bolt</em> deals 3d10 damage. You can choose to target three creatures and deal 1d10 damage to each creature, or you can target two creatures, dealing 1d10 damage to one creature and 2d10 damage to the other creature, or you can target one creature for 3d10 damage.</p><h3>Static Cantrip</h3><p>Whenever you deal lightning damage to a hostile creature with a warmage cantrip, you can sap part of the energy into a charge, which clings to your body until the start of your next turn. While charged, you can use your reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see within 5 feet of you to deal lightning damage equal to half your warmage level to the creature.</p><h3>Unerring Strike</h3><p><em>Prerequisites: 10th level, true strike cantrip</em></p><p>When you cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.mGGlcLdggHwcL7MG]{true strike}</em> cantrip, you can concentrate on it for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Such warmages might be easily confused for wizards or sorcerers, for they don the same garb and wield many of the same spells, but the warmage focus on perfection still holds precedence over garnering a vast array of spells.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>When you choose this house at 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells more potent than cantrips.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> The Bishop Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Spells known of 1st-Level and Higher.</strong></em> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the conjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Bishop Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a conjuration or evocation spell of your choice, except for the spells learned at 8th, 14th, and 20th level, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a conjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th or 14th level.</p><p><em><strong>Warmage Edge.</strong></em> You can deal additional damage with your warmage spells of 1st level or higher using your Warmage Edge feature, as if they were cantrips.

The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: <strong>imp</strong>, <strong>pseudodragon</strong>, <strong>quasit</strong>, or <strong>sprite</strong>.</p><h3>Siege Casting</h3><p>At 10th level, your warmage spells deal double damage to objects and structures. Additionally, when you cast a warmage spell that requires you to make a ranged spell attack roll, the spell’s range is doubled.</p><h3>Spell Sculpting</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, when you cast a warmage spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them up to your Intelligence modifier. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p><h3>Arcane Dominance</h3><p>At 18th level, you learn a powerful magical trick. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a number of spell slots with a combined level of six or more to regain an expended use of your Arcane Surge.</p><h2>House of Cards</h2><p>Warmages who join the House of Cards approach combat the same way they do games of chance: with high stakes and calculated gambles. Each warmage of this house wields a special deck of cards tied to the very threads of fate, through which they can empower their magic with deft flurries of hands. However, while these warmages command incredible power, their magical surges are at the whims of the cards, and so they must make strategic, ingenious plays to master them.</p><h3>Bluff</h3><p>When you choose this house at 3rd level, your poker face carries you through practically any lie. You gain proficiency in the Deception skill and with playing card sets, if you don’t already have it.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Charisma, for Charisma (Deception) checks.</p><h3>Deck of Fate</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain a deck of magical playing or tarot cards, called a Deck of Fate, through which you can enhance the power of your cantrips. Shuffle a standard 52-card playing card deck and draw a hand of five cards when you roll initiative.</p><p>Whenever you target a hostile creature with a warmage spell that deals damage, you can use your bonus action to play one or more cards from your hand to enhance the power of the spell. If the cards exactly match one of the results on the Hands table below, the spell deals extra damage to one of its targets of your choice or grants you one additional effect, according to the result. If the cards don’t match a result, they have no effect. Aces count as ones for results. Once you play a card, place it on the bottom of your deck and draw until you have five cards in your hand again.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Hands</td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td>Cards</td><td>Benefit</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Straight</td><td>Any five sequential cards of any suit.</td><td>You deal an extra 12 damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Flush</td><td>Any five cards of the same suit in any order.</td><td>You deal an extra 10 damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Three of a Kind</td><td>Any three of the same number.</td><td>You deal an extra 6 damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Pair</td><td>Any two of the same number.</td><td>You deal an extra 2 damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Hearts</td><td>Any two hearts.</td><td>You gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier.</td></tr><tr><td>Spades</td><td>Any two spades.</td><td>Your speed increases by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>Diamonds</td><td>Any two diamonds.</td><td>You gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>Clubs</td><td>Any two clubs.</td><td>You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws until the start of your next turn.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>High Stakes</h3><p>At 7th level, you’ve mastered a very risky card trick using your Deck of Fate. On your turn, you can choose any number of cards from your hand and place them on the bottom of your deck (no action required), losing 2 hit points per card you chose. You then draw until you have five cards in your hand again.</p><h3>Dealer's Choice</h3><p>At 10th level, you can use your bonus action to gain one of the following effects, chosen by the GM:</p><ul><li>You gain resistance to all damage until the end of your next turn.</li><li>You teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you.</li><li>You vanish into a safe, endless demiplane. At the start of your next turn, you reappear in the space you left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Card Reading</h3><p>Beginning at 15th level, once on each of your turns when you draw a card from your deck as part of your Deck of Fate feature, you can declare a suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, or Spades) and check the top card of your deck. If you guessed the suit correctly, you can take the Dash, Disengage, or Use an Object action as part of the bonus action used for the Deck of Fate feature.</p><h3>Ace in the Hole</h3><p>By 18th level, you have become a deckmaster. Whenever you would draw one or more cards from your deck, draw twice as many. Put half of the cards drawn on the bottom of your deck and the other cards in your hand.</p><h2>House of Dice</h2><p>The House of Dice throws out the warmage convention of meticulous, deliberate spellcasting in favor of wild, chaotic magic that presses the odds. Everything from their magical bursts to their enchanted sets of dice can fail horribly, so it’s auspicious that they often keep their fingers on the scales of fate. These warmages have mastered not only a repertoire of cantrips, but also techniques to manipulate fortune itself, allowing them to risk everything, and more than often come out on top.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>Starting when you choose this house at 3rd level, your light fingers and unscrupulous tactics help you win the day. You gain proficiency in the Sleight of Hand skill and dice sets, if you don’t already have it.</p><h3>Dice of Fate</h3><p>At 3rd level, you gain four Dice of Fate, which are d6s. Whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, saving throw, or damage roll, you can expend one Die of Fate and add it to the roll. You can wait until after you make the roll before deciding to expend the Die of Fate, but must decide before the GM determines the roll’s outcome. Once you expend a Die of Fate, it goes to the GM, who can use it to add it to a roll made by an NPC or monster. Once the GM has used a die, it passes back to you, and so on. When you finish a long rest, you regain all of your expended Dice of Fate, whether or not the GM has used them.</p><p>Beginning at 7th level, you have an additional two Dice of Fate, and you can add two Dice of Fate to your damage rolls with warmage cantrips.</p><h3>Chaos Roll</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can expend two of your Dice of Fate as an action, rolling them on the table below to create a chaotic surge of energy.</p><p></p><p>[[/r 2d6]]</p><table><thead><tr><td>2d6</td><td>Effect</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>You cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{fireball}</em>, centered on yourself.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Your AC is reduced by 2 until the start of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You fall prone.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Each creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you can speak only in a babbling nonsense language, and can’t perform the verbal components of spells until the start of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>A 5-foot-radius sphere of butterflies, insects, or doves fills a location you choose within 60 feet of you, heavily obscuring the area until the start of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>You gain 7 temporary hit points and keep the Dice of Fate instead of giving them to the GM.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>You become invisible until the end of your next turn, as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]{invisibility}</em> spell.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>An object within 60 feet of you chosen by the GM explodes, dealing no damage to you or your allies, and dealing 3d6 fire damage to one creature caught in the blast.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of the destination must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 force damage.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Choose a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>You cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.IyikgTEOTv701jgQ]{lightning bolt}</em> and can add the Dice of Fate to the damage roll.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Loaded Dice</h3><p>By 7th level, you can subtly cheat your dice. Once on each of your turns when you roll a d6, you can flip the die upside down. Note that on a balanced d6, the top and bottom numbers add up to 7, so you can determine the bottom number by subtracting the top number from 7.</p><h3>Twisted Fate</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, the winds of chance follow your die rolls, rather than vice versa. When you make an attack roll or ability check with disadvantage on your turn, you can attempt to invert fate as a bonus action. Expend a Die of Fate and roll it. On a 5, you ignore disadvantage on the roll. On a 6, you instead have advantage on the roll.</p><h3>Roll the Bones</h3><p>Beginning at 15th level, you can channel the chaotic energy of your dice in an instant. As a reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see, you can expend two Dice of Fate to make a Chaos Roll.</p><h3>Steal Luck</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, when you roll initiative, roll a d6. You steal that many Dice of Fate back from the GM.</p><h2>House of Kings</h2><p>Warmages who train in the House of Kings specialize in tactics and strategy, learning age-old maneuvers to give them the edge in combat. Natural-born leaders, Kings work best with a cadre of supporters to perform their tactics and overwhelm the enemy. More so than all other warmages, those in the House of Kings treat life and death as little more than a game of strategy to be understood and conquered.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you choose this house at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, as well as battleaxes, lances, longswords, tridents, and warhammers.</p><h3>Battle Tactics</h3><p>At 3rd level, you learn stratagems that are fueled by special dice called battle dice.</p><p><em><strong>Battle Dice.</strong></em> You have two battle dice, which are d8s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative.</p><p>Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Warmage Level</td><td>Battle Dice</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>3d8</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3d10</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>4d10</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p><em><strong>Using Battle Dice.</strong></em> Once per turn, you can expend a battle die to perform a stratagem of your choice. Your stratagem options are detailed at the end of the subclass description.</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em> When a stratagem calls for a saving throw to resist its effects, the saving throw DC is equal to your spell save DC.</p><h3>Lead From the Front</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you and each friendly creature within 120 feet of you that can see you ignore nonmagical difficult terrain.</p><h3>Tactical Master</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, friendly creatures within 10 feet of you add your Intelligence modifier to their saving throws against spells and magical effects that deal damage.</p><h3>Stratagem: Checkmate</h3><p>At 15th level, you learn the following stratagem:</p><p>When you hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack, you can use your bonus action and expend a battle die to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you that is within reach of the creature you hit. The friendly creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack or cast a cantrip that requires an attack roll, adding the battle die to the attack’s damage roll.</p><h3>Grandmaster</h3><p>At 18th level, when you roll initiative, choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. Each of the chosen creatures gains a battle die. You don’t expend battle dice for this feature.</p><p>Once within the next 10 minutes, a chosen creature can expend the battle die when it makes an attack roll, ability check, saving throw, or damage roll, adding the battle die to the roll. The creature can wait until after it makes the roll before deciding to expend the battle die, but must decide before the GM determines the roll’s outcome. A creature can have only one battle die from this feature at a time.</p><h3>Stratagems</h3><p>The stratagems are presented in alphabetical order.</p><p><em><strong>Blitz.</strong></em> As a bonus action, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. Choose a friendly creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p><p><em><strong>Check.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die as a bonus action to force that creature to flee. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. A creature that is immune to being frightened automatically succeeds on this saving throw. On a failed save, the target must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up to half its speed directly away from you.</p><p><em><strong>Flash of Brilliance.</strong></em> When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check, you can expend one battle die to add it to the check. You can choose to use this stratagem after the ability check is rolled but must decide before the GM says whether the check succeeds or fails.</p><p><em><strong>Gambit.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die to give your allies an opening. The next creature other than you to make an attack against the target adds the battle die to their attack roll.</p><p><em><strong>Mystic Counsel.</strong></em> You can use a bonus action and expend one battle die to give counsel to a creature that can hear you within 30 feet of you. Once in the next minute when the creature makes a saving throw against a spell it can choose to roll the battle die and add the result to the saving throw.</p><p><em><strong>Stalemate.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die as a bonus action to hold that creature in place. Until the end of its next turn, the target can’t willingly move unless it first takes the Disengage action.</p><h2>House of Knights</h2><p>The House of Knights has a long and storied tradition of melding melee combat and swordplay with the warmage’s simple spellcasting. Unlike other warriors, however, Knights rarely carry swords or shields into combat, for they can forge both out of magical force at a moment’s notice.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you choose this house at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and martial weapons.</p><h3>Force Breastplate</h3><p>At 3rd level, plates of magical force reinforce your armor. While you are wearing light or medium armor or are under the effects of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.CKZTpZlxj7hjjo2H]{mage armor}</em>, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, to your Armor Class.</p><h3>Mystical Weapon</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.zfwEl9lWgU2SGM8q]{force weapon}</em> cantrip, which doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p>Additionally, you possess a weapon made entirely of magical force. Whenever you would draw a weapon, you can summon this weapon to your empty hand and transform it into any simple or martial weapon of your choice. This weapon deals force damage on a hit instead of its normal damage type. Whenever the weapon leaves your hand, it vanishes into a pocket dimension until you summon it again.</p><h3>Flurry of Blades</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, when you cast a cantrip that allows you to make multiple spell attacks, such as <em>force weapon</em> or <em>magic daggers</em>, you can use your bonus action to make one additional spell attack with that cantrip.</p><h3>Knight's Ward</h3><p>Starting 10th level, you learn to forge a hardened magical barrier between you and your foes. As a bonus action, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your warmage level, which last for 1 minute.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Tactical Maneuver</h3><p>At 15th level, you can spend your entire movement to teleport up to half your speed to an unoccupied space you can see.</p><h3>Field of Blades</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can summon a whirlwind of mystical weapons for a flurry of strikes. As an action on your turn, you can make a melee spell attack against up to five creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. On a hit, a target takes force damage equal to 2d10 + your Intelligence modifier.</p><h2>House of Lancers</h2><p>Warmages who join the House of Lancers are trained in fluid martial arts and meditative asceticism, melding the stoic discipline of monks with potent spellcasting. As such, they are unarmed elemental warriors, self-reliant and capable of feats unmatched by their peers. However, Lancers are notoriously neutral and abstain from the politics of the other warmage houses.</p><p>Lancers derive their name from an ancient precursor to the pawn, a piece remembered only in early variants of chess. It is a relic from a forgotten age, rife with symbolism.</p><h3>Intercept Technique</h3><p>Starting when you choose this house at 3rd level, you adopt the monastic principle of offensive protection. While you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. If you are under the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.CKZTpZlxj7hjjo2H]{mage armor}</em> spell, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier or your Intelligence modifier (your choice). You can't use a shield and gain the benefit of this feature.</p><h3>Hand-to-Hand Arcana</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the Lancers’ secret unarmed combat technique, granting you the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You can use Intelligence instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.</li><li>You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strikes.</li><li>Your unarmed strikes count as melee weapons for the purposes of warmage spells.</li><li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.</li></ul><h3>Shock Trooper</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can rapidly close the distance between you and your foes. Whenever you make a melee attack on your turn against a creature you can see, you can lunge up to 15 feet toward your target before making the attack. Doing so doesn’t spend movement or provoke opportunity attacks. You can perform this movement even if it causes you to travel through the air, though you fall after making the attack if you have nothing holding you aloft.</p><h3>Mystical Physicality</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, whenever you make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of the normal modifier.</p><p>Additionally, difficult terrain doesn’t cost you extra movement.</p><h3>Deflect Energy</h3><p>By 10th level, you can deflect bolts of energy with your bare hands. As a reaction when you are hit by a ranged spell attack or a ranged weapon attack that deals cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, or radiant damage, you can use your reaction to deflect the bolt. The damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier + half your warmage level (rounded down).</p><h3>Improved Shock Trooper</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, you can lunge up to 30 feet using your Shock Trooper feature. This movement causes you to teleport through creatures and objects, blinking to the target in an instant. You can’t teleport into an occupied space.</p><h3>Flurry of Spells</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can cast spells with superhuman speed. As an action, you can expend a use of your Arcane Surge feature to cast three different cantrips that have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action. You can’t use your Arcane Surge feature on any of these cantrips.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>House of Pawns</h2><p>By far the most prominent warmage house is that of the Pawns. Warmages who join the House of Pawns learn to stretch their skill with cantrips to its limits. Pawns can master any cantrip or trick known to the other warmage houses, for they embody the adaptability to which all warmages aspire.</p><h3>Promotion</h3><p>When you choose this house at 3rd level, you gain the adaptability of the quintessential warmage. You learn one warmage trick of your choice, which doesn’t count against your number of warmage tricks known. Additionally, whenever you learn a warmage trick, you can choose a trick that has the House of Bishops, House of Kings, House of Knights, or House of Rooks as a prerequisite, as long as you meet all of the trick’s other prerequisites.</p><h3>Adaptive Arcanist</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to emulate the spellcasting prowess of other warmages. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one warmage cantrip. You learn this cantrip, which doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known, until you choose a different one with this feature.</p><h3>Pawn Storm</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, if you target a creature with a cantrip, that creature can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of the turn, whether you deal damage with the cantrip or not.</p><h3>Additional Arcane Fighting Style</h3><p>At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Arcane Fighting Style class feature. You can't take the same Arcane Fighting Style option more than once.</p><h3>Opening Move</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative rolls. Additionally, when you roll initiative and you aren’t surprised, you can move up to your speed.</p><h3>Fundamental Mastery</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, your magic always finds its way to your foes’ most vulnerable spots. Once per turn when you roll damage for a warmage cantrip, you can choose one damage die and treat it as having rolled its maximum value.</p><h2>House of Rooks</h2><p>The clandestine members of the House of Rooks make adept spies, assassins, and scouts, though they might just as easily pick up jobs run by rogues and brigands. In addition to their suite of cantrips, Rooks are light on their feet and know a few tricks to magically open doors in utter silence.</p><h3>Rook Strike</h3><p>Starting when you choose this house at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can gain advantage on the next attack roll you make on your turn. Alternatively, you can impose disadvantage on a saving throw a creature makes against a warmage spell you cast before the end of your turn.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest, or until you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a warmage cantrip.</p><h3>Rasp</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1nhIxh0DsJsntCfj]{knock}</em> spell at will without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell in this way, it has a casting time of 1 minute and the spell’s casting is completely silent.</p><h3>Arcane Acrobat</h3><p>At 7th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to all Dexterity checks you make. Additionally, when you fall and aren’t incapacitated, you can subtract up to 60 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage.</p><h3>Fleeting Decoy</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, as a reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see, you raise a defensive illusion to protect you from further harm. Attacks made against you have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Elusive Step</h3><p>By 15th level, you’re extremely difficult to pin down. If you move more than 15 feet on your turn, any subsequent movement you make doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p><h3>Flash of Feathers</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]{invisibility}</em> spell once, targeting only yourself, without expending a spell slot or spell components. While you are invisible, your speed is doubled, and you can make one attack or cast one warmage cantrip without ending the spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature to cast <em>invisibility</em>, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>"

          "name": "Captain",
          "text": "<p>A half-elf, adorned in the ribbons and medals of a high-ranking commander sits astride an armored warhorse. To her right, a powerfully built orcish man in more pedestrian attire sits atop his own horse, shouldering a hefty greataxe. They set down the road together, accompanied by blaring trumpets and banging drums, which announce their approach.</p><p>Puffing on a pipe and eyeing the room, a halfling guildmaster in a fitted suit twirls a dagger between his fingers. A crowd of thieves, crooks, and bandits are arrayed before him, all studying blueprints laid out on a candlelit table. Tonight, their chapter of the Thieves’ Guild becomes rich, and their guildmaster goes down in history.</p><p>Kobolds swarm left and right, scampering across piles of gold pieces, only to be met by the dwarf’s greataxe. Arrow after arrow, a human archer looses shots that merely plink off the enraged dragon’s crimson scales. A gnomish mage gathers crackling arcane might in his hands for a devastating magical blast. Across the chamber, amidst the chaos, a plan crystallizes in the adventuring company’s leader. She begins shouting orders, and the party sets into motion.</p><p>Decisive leaders and brilliant strategists, captains inspire their allies to greatness. Invariably, they stand alongside their cohorts—their devoted lieutenants, whom they entrust with their lives. Captains out-strategize their enemies, ensuring that, while they rarely deal the killing blow, they’re always on the winning side.</p><h2>Fearless Leaders</h2><p>Many people aspire to command, but few inspire loyalty as a captain does. Captains rally allies to their side through confidence and determination, but gain long-term friends through wisdom and accountability.</p><p>A good captain thinks a little bigger than their compatriots, planning one step further and fitting their allies like puzzle pieces to the challenges ahead. To their eyes, there are few defeats; only setbacks, diversions, and detours. Success is always on the path ahead.</p><p>Moreover, captains lead by example. They stand shoulder-to-shoulder with knights, creep through the night alongside rogues, and study arcane texts with mages, even when they barely understand what they’re reading. Captains are at the front line with their allies, not barking orders from afar.</p><h2>Cohort and Commander</h2><p>A captain is only as good as their second in command, their cohort, who stands by them at every step and safeguards their plan’s success. Far more than a simple ally, a captain’s cohort is a confidant, an advisor, and a trusted friend. Cohorts see their captain as a wellspring of information, and will follow them to the ends of the earth.</p><h2>Creating a Captain</h2><p>The ideal captain—a consummate leader—can be realized in many different ways. Your captain could be a head of an adventuring company, an officer in an army, the president of a corporation, the chief of a tribe, the admiral of a fleet, or any other type of leader. The only commonalities amongst captains are their positions of authority and natural inclinations toward leadership.</p><p>You should consider how your captain chooses to lead: not simply what banner they fly, but how they treat their followers and how they give orders. Do you rally others to your side with a magnetic personality or a stoic facade? How would you deal with a dilemma that offers only losing strategies? How do you treat your opponents once you’ve secured victory?</p><p>You should also think of previous victories or defeats that have defined your captain in the past. Has your story been that of a meteoric rise or a disgraceful fall? What event first thrust you into leadership, and how did you first take to it? Which success or defeat led you to the life of an adventurer?</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>You can make a captain quickly by following these suggestions.

Common folk defer to your authority and influence, especially in times of crisis. As a result, you have advantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check you make to convince someone to let you take charge of a situation or to give someone orders in a dangerous situation.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of your Intelligence, for any ability check you make related to planning, strategy, or tactics.</p><h2>Fighting Style</h2><p>At 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><h3>Archery</h3><p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p><h3>Defense</h3><p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><h3>Dueling</h3><p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><h3>Protection</h3><p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p><h2>Cohort</h2><p>Starting at 2nd level, you gain a loyal cohort who carries your banner and follows your lead.</p><h3>Initiating a Cohort</h3><p>Select a companion from the Cohort section; following an 8-hour initiation period, that creature becomes your cohort. You can have only one cohort at a time.</p><p>If your cohort is ever slain, you can raise them from the dead by the usual methods, such as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz]{raise dead}</em> spell, or you can spend 8 hours initiating a new cohort. If you do so, your previous cohort loses all abilities granted by this ability, even if it is later returned to life.</p><p>Your cohort obeys your commands as best it can. Your cohort takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice), and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</p><h3>Cohort Features</h3><p>At 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, your cohort gains new abilities based on its archetype.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p>For each captain level you gain after 2nd, your cohort gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p><h3>Ability Scores</h3><p>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your cohort’s abilities also improve. Your cohort can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature, unless its description specifies otherwise.</p><p>When you improve a cohort’s ability scores, remember to also increase other relevant statistics, such as skill bonuses, bonuses to hit and damage, and spell save DCs.</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p>Your cohort gains proficiency in skills listed in its statistics. It also gains proficiency with simple weapons, martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, or shields if its statistics contain weapons or armor from that category.</p><p>Your cohort uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. Because cohort statistics already include a +2 proficiency bonus, you need only adjust the attack bonus, skill proficiencies, and saving throw proficiencies starting at 5th level.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>Your cohort’s alignment is within one step of your own, and has a personality trait and flaw determined by the GM. Its bond is always, “I will follow my commander into any fray, and I will gladly fight by their side until my death.”</p><h2>Banner</h2><p>Starting at 3rd level, you adopt a banner which you fly in combat, emblazon on your armor, and fix to your seal. You can select from the banners which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.</p><h2>War Tactics</h2><p>Starting at 3rd level, you have a pool of battle dice that you can use to bolster your allies or perform special maneuvers in combat. You begin with 2 battle dice, which are d8s. You regain all expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative.</p><p>Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Dice column of the Captain table.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>If one of your maneuvers calls for a saving throw to resist its effects, the saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Maneuver Save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h3>Maneuvers</h3><p>You can spend battle dice to use the following maneuvers:</p><p><em><strong>Brace.</strong></em> As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a battle die to bolster your allies. Each allied creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you adds the battle die to all saving throws it makes until the end of your next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Rally.</strong></em> As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a battle die to choose one allied creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. That creature regains hit points equal to the number rolled + your Charisma modifier. You can’t use this ability to heal a creature that has 0 hit points.</p><p><em><strong>Staggering Strike.</strong></em> As a bonus action when you make a weapon attack against a Large or smaller creature, you can expend a battle die to attempt to daze the target. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2>Blitz</h2><p>Starting at 5th level, as a bonus action on your turn, you can direct your cohort or a friendly creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you to fight alongside you. The chosen creature can use its reaction to move up to its speed or make a single weapon attack.</p><h2>Advanced Tactics</h2><p>At 9th level, your maneuvers improve in the following ways:</p><p><em><strong>Brace.</strong></em> Allies can also add the battle die to their ability checks until the start of your next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Rally.</strong></em> Whenever you spend a battle die to restore hit points to a creature, that creature also gains temporary hit points equal to your captain level.</p><p><em><strong>Staggering Strike.</strong></em> When you hit with a staggering strike, you add the battle die to the damage roll.</p><h2>Coordinated Strike</h2><p>By 11th level, you and your cohort fight as a perfect fighting unit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack, you can deal an extra 2d8 damage to the creature if your cohort has also hit that creature with an attack since the end of your last turn.</p><h2>Lead by Example</h2><p>Starting at 15th level, whenever you roll a 20 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, each friendly creature within 30 feet of you has advantage when it makes the same type of roll (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw) before the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Legendary Commander</h2><p>At 20th level, you have 3 legendary actions. At the end of another creature's turn, you can spend a legendary action to take an action of your choice, or allow a friendly creature within 60 feet of you that can hear or see you to take an action of their choice. If a creature takes the Attack action as a legendary action, it can attack more than once if it has a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives it extra attacks.</p><p>You regain all expended legendary actions when you finish a long rest.</p><h1>Banners</h1><p>Captains adopt emblems that denote their virtues, skills, and command styles, which they fly upon their banners to rally allies to their side. A symbolic statement, this heraldry speaks volumes about what a captain prizes in the world, be it knowledge, allies, or personal gain.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Banners</td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.foCkjiW57oAM6oxU#dragon-banner]{Dragon Banner}</td><td>Uses maneuvers to annihilate their foes on the battlefield</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.foCkjiW57oAM6oxU#eagle-banner]{Eagle Banner}</td><td>A bow master who uses precision shots to strike foes from high above</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.foCkjiW57oAM6oxU#jolly-roger-banner]{Jolly Roger Banner}</td><td>A duelist and swashbuckler trained with a cutlass and the unfair tactics of brigands</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.foCkjiW57oAM6oxU#lion-banner]{Lion Banner}</td><td>A knightly leader who challenges their foes to honorable combat</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.foCkjiW57oAM6oxU#ram-banner]{Ram Banner}</td><td>Shoves their foes and knocks them prone to gain the upper hand in combat</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.foCkjiW57oAM6oxU#raven-banner]{Raven Banner}</td><td>A stealthy master of guerilla warfare and covert tactics</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.foCkjiW57oAM6oxU#turtle-banner]{Turtle Banner}</td><td>Emphasizes defense above all else, using heavy armor and shield wall tactics</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Dragon Banner</h2><p>Captains under the banner of the Dragon are among the most formidable warriors to grace the battlefield. Armed with an array of lethal maneuvers, these captains cut through lesser combatants with ease, turning the tides of battle on their own, if needed. The visage of the Dragon Banner inspires fear and loyalty in equal measure, for the carnage and bloodshed left in a dragon warrior’s wake speaks volumes of their skill.</p><h3>Bonus Battle Die</h3><p>Starting when you choose this banner at 3rd level, your total number of battle dice increases by 1.</p><h3>Maneuver: Cleave</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the following maneuver:</p><p>Once on each of your turns, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can spend a battle die to move up to 15 feet and make another melee weapon attack as part of the same action. On a hit, you add the battle die to the attack’s damage roll.</p><h3>Maneuver: Wade into Battle</h3><p>At 7th level, you learn the following maneuver:</p><p>You can expend a battle die to take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on your turn.</p><h3>Maneuver: Fury Attack</h3><p>At 13th level, you learn the following maneuver:</p><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can expend a battle die as a bonus action to unleash a barrage of strikes. Make up to three melee weapon attacks as part of the Attack action, instead of one. Each attack must target a different creature.</p><h3>Vicious Focus</h3><p>Beginning at 17th level, whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you enter a zen state of battle for 1 minute. For the duration, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Each time during the duration that you reduce another hostile creature to 0 hit points or score another critical hit, this critical hit range increases, first allowing your melee weapon attacks to score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20, then on a roll of 17–20, then finally on a roll of 16–20. If you fall unconscious, this effect ends early.</p><h2>Eagle Banner</h2><p>With sharp eyes and even sharper arrows, captains of the Eagle seek to be lords of speed and ranged combat, mastering bow, sling, and ballista alike. Such captains are just as dangerous in close range as they are perched on the horizon, for they can accurately deliver an arrow or a crossbow bolt at point blank range.</p><h3>Maneuver: Eagle Shot</h3><p>Starting when you choose this banner at 3rd level, you learn the following maneuver:</p><p>When you make a ranged weapon attack roll against a creature, you can use your bonus action and expend a battle die to add it to the roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before the GM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p><h3>Vantage Point</h3><p>By 7th level, you can quickly scale walls to gain a perch above your foes. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, by climbing at half speed, you can climb up difficult surfaces (such as slippery vertical walls) without making an ability check.</p><h3>Close-Quarters Shooting</h3><p>Starting at 13th level, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls or those of friendly creatures within 15 feet of you.</p><h3>Scatter Shot</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to launch a volley of projectiles. Make a ranged weapon attack against any number of creatures you choose within a 15-foot cone, making a separate attack roll for each target. If you target only one creature in this cone, your attack deals one additional weapon damage die on a hit.</p><h2>Jolly Roger Banner</h2><p>The skulls and crossbones adorning the Banner of the Jolly Roger need no introduction: it means thieves, brigands, treasure, and adventure on the high seas. Moreover, it means the strong backs of a crew working in unison, piloting a ship from horizon to horizon, under the command of a fierce captain and their first mate.</p><h3>Maneuver: Double Thrust</h3><p>Starting when you choose this banner at 3rd level, you learn the following maneuver:</p><p>When you make an attack with a finesse weapon as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can spend one battle die as a bonus action to make an additional attack with that weapon. This attack adds the battle die, instead of your ability modifier, to the weapon’s damage roll.</p><h3>Tricky Footwork</h3><p>By 7th level, your elegant swordplay lets you place enemies where you want them. Whenever you hit a creature of your size or smaller with a melee attack on your turn, you can switch places with the target. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p><h3>Unfair Play</h3><p>Beginning at 13th level, both you and your cohort can use a bonus action to take the Hide or Use an Object action, or to attempt to shove a creature. You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to push another creature out of a boat or other waterborne vessel.</p><h3>All Hands on Deck</h3><p>By 17th level, your crew works in perfect unison at your directive. You can use your action on your turn to direct each friendly creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you to take an action of your choice; this action can’t be the Attack, Cast a Spell, Dodge, or Use a Magic Item action. A creature can immediately use its reaction to take this action.</p><h2>Lion Banner</h2><p>Bravery in the face of overwhelming odds, mastery of horsemanship, and unwavering honor are the hallmarks of captains of the Lion. This banner represents the very ideal of gallantry and fortitude that knights and paladins aspire to achieve. The mere sight of it inspires heroism in its troops, and a captain who flies it can turn even the most poorly equipped militia into a fit fighting force.</p><h3>Maneuver: Lion's Challenge</h3><p>Starting when you choose this banner at 3rd level, you learn the following maneuver:</p><p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one battle die as a bonus action to challenge the target to a duel. Until the end of your next turn, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you.</p><h3>Saddle Sure</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount, you always land on your feet unless you’re incapacitated. Additionally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, instead of half your speed.</p><p>Finally, you can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.</p><h3>Reposition</h3><p>Beginning at 13th level, when you roll initiative, you and up to three friendly creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you can each move up to 20 feet. A creature can’t benefit from this feature if its speed is 0.</p><h3>Lion's Gambit</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, when you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature. If you hit, you can add half your level to the damage roll.</p><p>You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Ram Banner</h2><p>Captains who brandish the banner of the Ram seek to batter through their obstacles with overwhelming force. Whenever possible, these captains put their enemies on the back foot, literally hurling their foes to the floor or shoving them onto unfavorable ground, from which position their cohorts can make swift work of any resistance. The Banner of the Ram sees such tactics as not only fair, but optimal, as validity in combat should be judged only by effectiveness.</p><h3>Maneuver: Bull Rush</h3><p>Starting when you choose this banner at 3rd level, you learn the following maneuver:</p><p>When you move at least 10 feet in a straight line and immediately make a melee weapon attack against a creature, you can use a bonus action and expend a battle die to shove the target after the attack. Add the battle die to the Strength (Athletics) check you make to shove the target. On a success, you can choose to either knock the target prone or push it up to 10 feet away from you.</p><h3>Surefooted</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.</p><h3>Lock Horns</h3><p>At 13th level, you can buck your foes into harm’s way. Whenever you shove a creature into one of your allies, that ally can use its reaction to make an attack against the shoved creature.</p><h3>And Stay Down!</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, whenever a creature stands up from being prone while within your reach, you can make an opportunity attack against it.</p><h2>Raven Banner</h2><p>The Banner of the Raven signifies a clandestine captain who prefers stealth to action and ambushes to open fights. If pressed, a captain of the Raven might be drawn into a direct confrontation, but they can never be expected to play fair. These captains might have more in common with rogues, and might even hold a position of leadership within a thieves’ guild. More than one guildmaster and bandit leader has flown the Raven Banner while on a raid.</p><h3>Maneuver: Flanking Strike</h3><p>Starting when you choose this banner at 3rd level, you are trained in ambush tactics. You learn the following maneuver:</p><p>If you hit a creature with a weapon attack while one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, you can expend a battle die to aim for the creature’s most vital areas. Add the battle die and half your level (rounded down) to the attack’s damage roll. This attack must use a finesse weapon or a light weapon.</p><h3>Maneuver: Effortless Dodge</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the following maneuver:</p><p>As a bonus action, you can spend a battle die to take the Dodge action. You can’t use this maneuver while wearing medium or heavy armor.</p><h3>Covert</h3><p>At 7th level, when you are hidden and a creature discovers you with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check, you can reattempt your Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide. On a success, you silently reposition yourself and the creature doesn’t notice you.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Strike First, Strike Last</h3><p>Beginning at 13th level, you can intercede moments before an enemy strikes. As a reaction when a hostile creature you can see attacks, you can move up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks toward the creature and make one attack targeting it. Resolve your attack before the creature makes any attacks.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Guerilla Warfare</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, you are a master of unconventional combat. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, the first time you hit a creature with an attack during the first round of combat, you can add two battle dice to the attack’s damage roll without expending them.</p><h2>Turtle Banner</h2><p>The fortified defenses of captains who fly the Turtle banner are legendary. Turtle tactics emphasize endurance and survival, as well-protected soldiers cannot only win battles, but entire wars. Thinking long term is key to any defensive strategy, as captains of the Turtle know the answer is never how they shall counterattack, but when.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3><p>When you choose this banner at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p><h3>Maneuver: Iron Shell</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn the following maneuver:</p><p>As a bonus action, you can spend a battle die to fortify an ally you can see within 60 feet of you. The ally gains a bonus to its Armor Class equal to half the number rolled on the battle die, rounded down (to a minimum of +1) against the next attack made against it within the next minute.</p><h3>Slow and Steady</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, your speed can’t be removed and you can’t be knocked prone or moved against your will.</p><h3>Shield Wall</h3><p>By 13th level, you can shelter others behind your armor. You count as three-quarters cover for effects passing through your space for allied creatures of your size and smaller within 5 feet of you.</p><h3>Unbreakable</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, you can shrug off attacks that would otherwise hit you. You have a pool of 20 armor points. As a reaction when you’re hit by a melee weapon attack, you can expend any number of armor points and add them to your Armor Class against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss. You regain all expended armor points when you finish a long rest.</p><h1>Cohorts</h1><p>Your cohort is the most steadfast of allies, is loyal to a fault, and will likely be a lifelong ally and friend. But not all cohorts are cut from the same cloth or possess the same skills.

The room resonates with the sound of metal impacting metal, while the bright, hot piece of steel in her tongs begins to take shape.</p><p>An elf threads a needle with an impossibly thin metallic wire, preparing to set the stitches into what looks to be leather armor, but made of dragon’s hide. Once satisfied with the measurements, he proceeds with a flurry of dexterous needlework.</p><p>A gnome with an intricate set of goggles examines the stock for her latest work: a portable ballista. She examines the gearing and loading crank, ensures the tension on the bowstring, and scans the bolt rail for imperfections. She smiles, for she knows her work is without flaw.</p><p>Craftsmen are virtuoso artisans and genius inventors. Not content merely creating masterwork pieces of weapons and armor, they invent and engineer ingenious devices and singularly deadly weapons.</p><h2>Master of Craft</h2><p>Artisans of all types are an integral part of every culture: buildings must be erected, pots must be sent to the kiln, tools must be forged. Despite their pervasiveness, master craftsmen are as rare as they are prized. These artisans, creators, and inventors can smith items of mythic quality, and can solve most any problem simply by using the right tool and the appropriate amount of force.</p><h2>Secret of Steel</h2><p>Adventuring craftsmen come in many varieties, but nearly all leverage their advanced knowledge of metallurgy, smelting, and construction to forge arms and armor rarely seen, even by other adventurers. The smiths test their schematics and designs themselves, building prototypes and experimental gear that can later be refined into mass-produced items.</p><h2>Creating a Craftsman</h2><p>When you create your craftsman, the most important thing to consider is your crafting expertise. Though all craftsmen of adventuring stock can stitch leather armor, forge weapons, and tinker with magic items, only those who dedicate themselves to a single craft can attain legendary works. Each type of craftsman, from the practical to the wildly eccentric, have their place, but no craftsman can specialize in everything.</p><p>Moreover, few craftsmen are self-taught. Most learn the finer points of their craft under the tutelage of a master artisan (whether or not their master was a craftsman, in the conventional sense). Did you study under a master, and if so, what drove you to apprentice underneath them?</p><p>Lastly, consider how you view your work. Are you pragmatic, viewing your creations as tools to serve a purpose? Are you artistic, striving to craft pieces of unrivaled beauty and perfection? Or are you experimental, tinkering and building with wild abandon to break new ground and innovate on established norms?</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>You can make a craftsman quickly by following these suggestions. Make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Next, select Athletics and Investigation as your skills. Finally, choose a background befitting of your history of craftsmanship.</p><p></p><p>@UUID[.h2CpdZ5PAXdigrEj]{Craftsman Class Table}</p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"4\">The Craftsman</td></tr><tr><td>Level</td><td>Proficiency Bonus</td><td>Features</td><td>Active Crafting</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>Exotic Proficiencies, Active Crafting</td><td>25 gp</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>Masterwork (Apprentice properties), Tool Belt</td><td>25 gp</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>Artisans’ Guild</td><td>50 gp</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>75 gp</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>Extra Attack, Masterwork (Journeyman properties)</td><td>100 gp</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>Folded Steel</td><td>125 gp</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>Artisans’ Guild feature</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>175 gp</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>Eye for Quality</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>Artisans’ Guild feature</td><td>225 gp</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>Masterwork (Master properties)</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>275 gp</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>Flawless Construction</td><td>300 gp</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>Artisans’ Guild feature</td><td>325 gp</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>Uncanny Tool Belt</td><td>350 gp</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>375 gp</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>Masterwork (Legendary properties)</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>Artisans’ Guild feature</td><td>425 gp</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>450 gp</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>Magnum Opus</td><td>500 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h1>Class Features</h1><p>As a craftsman, you gain the following class features.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p><em><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></em> 1d10 per craftsman level</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong></em> 10 + your Constitution modifier</p><p><em><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong></em> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per craftsman level after 1st</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p><em><strong>Armor:</strong></em> All armor, shields</p><p><em><strong>Weapons:</strong></em> Simple weapons, martial weapons</p><p><em><strong>Tools:</strong></em> All artisan’s tools</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws:</strong></em> Constitution, Intelligence</p><p><em><strong>Skills:</strong></em> Choose two from: Arcana, Athletics, History, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, and Persuasion</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p><ul><li>A set of craftman’s tools</li><li>A shield and (<em>a</em>) chain mail, (<em>b</em>) leather armor, or (<em>c</em>) scale mail</li><li>A dagger and (<em>a</em>) a warhammer or (<em>b</em>) any simple weapon</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<em>b</em>) a shortbow and 20 arrows</li><li>A dungeoneer’s pack</li></ul><p>@UUID[.tS0icsDcjhzw5aDo#craftsmans-tools]{Sidebar: Craftsman's Tools}</p><h2>Exotic Proficiencies</h2><p>Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with exotic weapons and exotic armor, which are unconventional, yet effective items with which no other class is proficient. If a feature or effect grants proficiency with a weapon or suit of armor, it doesn’t grant proficiency with exotic weapons or exotic armor, unless otherwise stated.</p><h2>Active Crafting</h2><p>Also at 1st level, you can craft one nonmagical item each day when you take a long rest, without losing the benefits of a long rest. You pay half the item’s gold piece cost in materials, up to 25 gp. If an item costs more than 25 gp in materials, you can finish the item by working on it for multiple days, spending 25 gp each day until the item is completed.</p><p>As you gain levels in this class, your crafting speed increases, allowing you to spend more on materials for each day of crafting, as shown in the Active Crafting column of the Craftsman table.</p><p>Items you craft using this feature are worth half their gold piece cost when sold. This means that you can sell an item to refund its cost in materials, but not to make a profit.</p><h2>Masterwork</h2><p>At 2nd level, you begin to learn the deeper intricacies of weapon and armor craftsmanship.</p><h3>Masterwork Equipment</h3><p>As a craftsman, you are capable of creating weapons and armor of the utmost quality; such creations are known as masterwork items. To create a masterwork version of an item, add 50 gp to the cost in materials you pay to craft the item. Masterwork weapons you create have a +1 bonus to attack rolls. A magic weapon that adds a bonus to your attack and damage rolls doesn’t add this bonus to attack rolls.</p><p>@UUID[.N0zfPY8msXjKOioc]{Masterwork Properties Table}</p><h3>Masterwork Properties</h3><p>Masterwork weapons and armor can be modified with masterwork properties, advanced modifications that transform them into truly unique weapons and armor. Masterwork properties are separated into 4 levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, and Legendary. You can apply any number of Apprentice properties to a masterwork weapon, or up to three Apprentice properties to a masterwork suit of armor. Additionally, you can apply one Journeyman, one Master, and one Legendary property to each masterwork item.</p><p>If you add a Master or Legendary property to an item, only you can use it.</p><h3>Modifying Equipment</h3><p>Using the Active Crafting feature, you can modify a weapon or suit of armor when you take a long rest. This allows you to do the following:</p><p><em><strong>Improving Equipment.</strong></em> You can make any nonmagical weapon or suit of armor masterwork for a cost of 50 gp in materials.</p><p><em><strong>Adding Masterwork Properties.</strong></em> Adding masterwork properties of Journeyman level or higher requires a cost in gold pieces and also requires you to be of a high enough level in this class, as shown in the Masterwork Properties table. When you learn a new level of masterwork properties, you can apply a property from that level to a masterwork item at no cost.</p><p>Check the @UUID[.tS0icsDcjhzw5aDo#weapon-exceptions]{Weapons Exceptions sidebar} later in this chapter before adding masterwork properties to a weapon.</p><p>Whenever you modify the properties of a masterwork weapon, you can change its damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, if its damage was already one of these types.</p><p><em><strong>Removing Properties.</strong></em> You can remove any properties of a masterwork item, including those a weapon had when you first created it. You can’t remove a property from an item that is a prerequisite for another of the item’s properties. If you replace a property of Journeyman level or higher with a property of the same level over the same long rest, you can do so without an additional cost in materials.</p><p>@UUID[.tS0icsDcjhzw5aDo#downtime-crafting]{Sidebar: Downtime Crafting}</p><h3>Crafting Ability</h3><p>Intelligence is the primary ability you use when crafting items. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for items that you craft.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Masterwork Save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h2>Tool Belt</h2><p>By 2nd level, you always have the right tool at hand. You can use your action to retrieve a piece of nonmagical gear from your belt, pack, cart, or wherever you keep your tools, even if you didn’t have it in your inventory before. The item’s gold piece cost can be up to 50 gp. You can’t use this feature to produce a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or potion. An item retrieved in this way becomes lost in your inventory and vanishes when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Artisans' Guild</h2><p>At 3rd level, you join an Artisans’ Guild. Select one of the Guilds from those listed below; you gain the 3rd level feature of that guild. You gain an additional Guild feature at 7th, 10th, 14th and 18th level.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2>Extra Attack</h2><p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h2>Folded Steel</h2><p>At 6th level, you discover or create new processes for making your masterwork gear even stronger than before. Masterwork weapons crafted or modified by you count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h2>Eye for Quality</h2><p>Starting at 9th level, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{identify}</em> spell at will, without using a spell slot or spell components. Additionally, when you cast the spell, you also appraise the target item, learning its market value in gold pieces.</p><h2>Flawless Construction</h2><p>Beginning at 13th level, masterwork items you create don’t rust, pit, fray at the edges, or otherwise show signs of aging. Additionally, they have resistance to all damage. Items you create can only be destroyed by effects that can destroy magic items.</p><h2>Uncanny Tool Belt</h2><p>By 15th level, you have a knack for finding the most useful things buried away in your cart. You can produce a single common or uncommon magic item from your tool belt. The item becomes lost in your inventory and vanishes when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Magnum Opus</h2><p>At 20th level, you complete an object of unparalleled majesty. You work feverishly for a period of 30 days to create a single magic item of very rare or legendary rarity. This item is tied to your very soul: regardless of type, you are always considered attuned to it, and no other creature can attune to it while you are alive. This item doesn’t count against your maximum number of attuned items, and you ignore all attunement requirements for the item. As long as you are on the same plane of existence as your item, you can use a bonus action to call it to your hand or onto your body (as appropriate). You can only craft a <em>Magnum Opus</em> once.</p><h1>Artisans' Guilds</h1><p>All master craftsmen learn the basics of smithing, leatherworking, woodworking, and other necessary disciplines on the path to mastery, either on their own or under the tutelage of another master artisan. However, as they hone their skills, they invariably find themselves drawn to gatherings of other like-minded craftsmen. These groups, formalized as Guilds, provide a means for craftsmen to compare notes and schematics, acquire resources, and provide a means for craftsmen to ply their trade.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Artisan’s Guilds</td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.spcJHlTTV7cUHeZR#arcane-maesters-guild]{Arcane Maesters’ Guild}</td><td>Magical craftsmen that forge mundane steel into magic items</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.spcJHlTTV7cUHeZR#armigers-guild]{Armigers’ Guild}</td><td>Armorsmiths of great renown that wear reinforced steel</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.spcJHlTTV7cUHeZR#bladeworkers-guild]{Bladeworkers’ Guild}</td><td>Weaponsmiths who build innovative implements of war and train in their use</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.spcJHlTTV7cUHeZR#calibarons-guild]{Calibarons’ Guild}</td><td>Gunsmiths who develop advanced firearms and attachments</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.spcJHlTTV7cUHeZR#forgeknights-guild]{Forgeknights’ Guild}</td><td>Wields a portable forge to heat their weapons and armor to explosive limits</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.spcJHlTTV7cUHeZR#mechanauts-guild]{Mechanauts’ Guild}</td><td>Pilots a modified apparatus of the crab, a walking construct of fearsome power</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.spcJHlTTV7cUHeZR#thunderlords-guild]{Thunderlords’ Guild}</td><td>An electric innovator that uses lightning-charged equipment</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.spcJHlTTV7cUHeZR#trappers-guild]{Trappers’ Guild}</td><td>A mechanical tinkerer that deploys lethal booby traps during combat</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Arcane Maesters' Guild</h2><p>While most seasoned spellcasters will enchant a handful of magic items over the course of their careers, artisans belonging to the Guild of Arcane Maesters seek to become true masters of magic item creation. They rightly take seriously the forging of such powerful relics: each creation must be a masterwork in its own right to contain the potent magic woven into them. Despite laboring for months or even years to perfect their creations, seasoned maesters are always seen to be laden with dozens of magic items, attuned to a handful of rings, and carrying a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.1taRIMF9w7jpnonN]{wand of magic missiles}</em>, just in case.</p><h3>Magic Item Crafting</h3><p>When you join this guild at 3rd level, you unlock the secrets of crafting items infused with magical energy. The Magic Item Crafting sidebar details the magic items you can create, specifies the level you must reach in this class to create each magic item, and shows the cost in materials an item will require. You can craft a magic item by spending multiple days working on it, as per the Active Crafting feature.</p><p>From among those available at 3rd level, you can craft 5 magic items. You can craft 3 from among those available at 7th, 3 from among those at 10th, and 2 from among those at 14th. In the process of creating a new magic item, you can dismantle a magic item you have created in order to build a new one from the same category.</p><p>@UUID[.tS0icsDcjhzw5aDo#magic-item-crafting]{Sidebar: Magic Item Crafting}</p><p>@UUID[.tS0icsDcjhzw5aDo#magic-item-blueprints]{Sidebar: Magic Item Blueprints}</p><h3>Apprentice Property</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to apply the following masterwork property to your equipment:</p><h3>Enchanted</h3><p><em>Apprentice weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork weapon</p><p>This weapon is interwoven with strong magical enchantments. You can use your Intelligence, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for this weapon’s attack and damage rolls.</p><h3>Instant Attunement</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, your experience in creating magic items allows you to quickly bond with them. You can use your action to attune to a magic item, and you can end your attunement to an item as part of the same action. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Ephemeral Enchantment</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes to lay an enchantment on a nonmagical weapon, enchanting up to 6 nonmagical weapons during a short or long rest. For the next 8 hours, each enchanted weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><h3>Sever Connection</h3><p>By 14th level, you can break the connection that binds you to your magic items and repurpose that magic to protect yourself. As a reaction when a creature you can see targets you with an attack, or when you make a saving throw, you can end your attunement to one magic item. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class and saving throws equal to your Intelligence modifier. The total number of magic items you can attune to is reduced by 1 until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Legendary Property</h3><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft. You learn the following Legendary masterwork property, which you can immediately apply to a suit of masterwork armor:</p><h3>Resonant</h3><p><em>Legendary armor property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork suit of exotic armor</p><p>By spending a short rest focusing on a magic item while wearing this armor, you can attune the item directly to the armor. You can use the magic item as though you were attuned to it while you are wearing the armor. You can attune up to two items to the armor, and can end an item’s attunement to the armor by spending another short rest focused on the item.</p><h2>Armigers' Guild</h2><p>The Armigers devote their skills to the art of armor smithing, with the firm belief that the right plate in the right place can make a warrior invincible.</p><h3>Fighting Style</h3><p>Beginning at 3rd level, you not only learn to forge powerful armor, but can wear it with skill. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><p><em><strong>Defense.</strong></em> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p><p><em><strong>Protection.</strong></em> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p><h3>Shining Steel</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, your imposing, shining armor makes you a clear target for your foes. When you roll initiative and aren’t surprised, you can challenge any number of creatures within 60 feet of you that can see you to battle. Each affected creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Masterwork save DC or have disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn’t target you on the first round of combat. A creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less automatically succeeds on this saving throw.</p><h3>Armor Reinforcement</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes to reinforce a suit of armor, or you can reinforce up to 6 suits of armor during a short or long rest. This armor retains its reinforcement until the creature wearing it is hit, after which it is no longer fortified. Reinforced armor gains one of the following properties of your choice:</p><p><em><strong>Adamant.</strong></em> When a creature wearing this armor takes damage, it reduces the amount it takes by 1d8.</p><p><em><strong>Banded.</strong></em> A creature wearing this armor has a +1 bonus to Armor Class.</p><h3>Fortify</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, as a bonus action, you can gain resistance to all damage until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Legendary Property</h3><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft. You learn the following Legendary masterwork property, which you can immediately apply to a suit of masterwork armor:</p><h3>Invincible</h3><p><em>Legendary armor property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork suit of exotic armor</p><p>While you are wearing this armor, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take from nonmagical attacks is reduced by 5.</p><h2>Bladeworkers' Guild</h2><p>Blade and bow, axe and mace: these are the tools with which the Bladeworkers try to change the world. They believe that the right blade in the right hand can make a warrior unstoppable.</p><h3>Fighting Style</h3><p>Starting when you choose this guild at 3rd level, you not only learn to forge great weapons, you fight with them as well. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><p><em><strong>Dueling.</strong></em> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Great Weapon Fighting.</strong></em> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p><p><em><strong>Hand-and-a-Half.</strong></em> While wielding a versatile weapon in two hands, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting.</strong></em> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p><h3>Sabotaging Strike</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you can use your knowledge of armament construction to disarm your foes and crush their armor. Once on each of your turns, when you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with one of the following special melee attacks.</p><p><em><strong>Disarm.</strong></em> You attempt to disarm a target within your reach. The target makes a Strength saving throw against your Masterwork save DC. On a failed save, it drops one item of your choice that it is holding or carrying. The object lands at its feet.</p><p><em><strong>Sunder.</strong></em> You attempt to shatter the defenses of a target within your reach that is wearing armor or carrying a shield. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC. On a failed save, the target’s armor or shield takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If a creature’s armor or shield is damaged but not destroyed, it can repair it over the course of a short or long rest.</p><h3>Honed Weapons</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes to fortify a weapon, or fortify up to 6 weapons during a short or long rest. This weapon retains its fortification until it hits a target, after which it is no longer fortified. A fortified weapon gains one of the following properties of your choice:</p><p><em><strong>Honed.</strong></em> This weapon has a +2 bonus to attack rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Sharpened.</strong></em> This weapon deals an extra 1d8 damage on a hit.</p><h3>Versatile Weapon Master</h3><p>By 14th level, you can wield all manner of weapons in rapid succession. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a weapon, you can gain advantage on the attack roll. You can use this ability four times: once to make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon that has the Ammunition property, once to make a melee weapon attack with a two-handed weapon, once to make a melee weapon attack with a one-handed weapon, and once to make a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon. Each use must be with a different weapon, and you regain each use of this ability after one minute. You can’t use this ability if you have disadvantage on the attack roll, or if you can’t see the target.</p><h3>Legendary Property</h3><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft. You learn the following Legendary masterwork property, which you can immediately apply to a masterwork weapon:</p><h3>Devastating</h3><p><em>Legendary weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork exotic weapon</p><p>This weapon scores a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.</p><h2>Calibarons' Guild</h2><p>The Calibarons know, better than most, that gunpowder is the single greatest invention ever created by mortals. A sword may let a skilled wielder lay a giant low and magic may let the savvy and the blessed stand up to the gods, but only a gun will let a common man put a dragon in its place.</p><h3>Fighting Style</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of gunfighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><p><em><strong>Akimbo.</strong></em> When you engage in two-weapon fighting with firearms, you don’t take a penalty to the damage of the second attack.</p><p><em><strong>Bullseye.</strong></em> You gain a +2 bonus to ranged attack rolls you make with firearms. The weapon must have the Sighted property or have a normal range of 80 feet or longer to gain this benefit. This benefit doesn’t stack with the Archery fighting style.</p><p><em><strong>Duelist.</strong></em> While you are wielding a firearm in one hand and nothing in the other, if you make a ranged weapon attack and exceed the target’s AC by 5 or more, you deal one extra die of weapon damage. You can only use this ability once per round.</p><p><em><strong>Shotgunner.</strong></em> When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a firearm that has the Scatter property, you can reroll the lowest damage die, and you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is lower than the original.</p><h3>Apprentice Property</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can add the following special property to your firearms:</p><h3>Suppressor</h3><p><em>Apprentice weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork martial ranged weapon with the Firearm property</p><p>Attacks with this weapon make only a low thud or a quiet clink, audible out to 10 feet, and release a puff of smoke to mask the light given off by the blast.</p><h3>Ballistic Calibration</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes to calibrate and reinforce a ranged weapon, or you can calibrate up to 6 ranged weapons during a short or long rest. This weapon retains its calibration until it hits a target, after which it is no longer calibrated. A calibrated ranged weapon gains one of the following properties of your choice:</p><p><em><strong>Ballistic.</strong></em> This weapon deals an extra die of damage on a hit.</p><p><em><strong>Calibrated.</strong></em> This weapon scores a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.</p><h3>Underbarrel Grenade Launcher</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you have learned to construct the ultimate firearm attachment: an underbarrel grenade launcher. You can use your action to attach this launcher to a two-handed ranged weapon with the Firearm property or remove it from one. If the launcher is ever lost or stolen, you can construct a new one over the course of a long rest with 100 gp in materials.</p><p>You can use your action to fire the launcher at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC, taking 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.</p><p>Once you fire the launcher, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Legendary Property</h3><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft. You learn the following Legendary masterwork property, which you can immediately apply to a masterwork weapon:</p><h3>Burst Fire</h3><p><em>Legendary weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork exotic firearm with the Automatic property</p><p>When you take the Attack action to make an attack with this firearm, you can use your bonus action to make one additional attack with it.</p><h2>Forgeknights' Guild</h2><p>To a Forgeknight, heat is not merely integral to forging, curing, and welding gear, it is a weapon in its own right, for the swing of a white-hot blade bites not only with steel, but with flame. A Forgeknight carries the intensity of a forge with them, storing it in their armor and building it up in their weapons, before unleashing it in a scorching blast.</p><h3>Portable Forge</h3><p>When you join this guild at 3rd level, you construct a portable forge that allows you to heat objects you are forging without a specially constructed shop or foundry. When you gain this forge, you are assumed to have been working on it in your spare time, only bringing it to full functionality when you take this subclass. If your forge is ever lost or damaged, you can repair or replace it over the course of a long rest with 100 gp of materials.</p><p>While you are carrying your forge, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You can choose for weapons you wield to deal fire damage instead of their normal damage type.</li><li>You have resistance to fire damage.</li><li>You can cast the cantrips <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.kjmjY0zlE6IEiQVL]{mending}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eCPQuQkIabFKTl9u]{produce flame}</em>. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</li></ul><h3>Forgefired Armory</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can add the Explosive and Heat properties to your exotic melee weapons. You can add the Heat property to any melee weapon, even if it already has another Journeyman property. When you hit a target with an explosive melee weapon, it creates an explosion at the point of impact, as per the Explosive property, which doesn’t harm you or the weapon.</p><h3>Superheated Weapons</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can plunge a number of melee weapons or pieces of ammunition into an active forge or your portable forge, heating them to white-hot temperatures. Weapons and ammunition placed in the forge must be made of metal, and remain heated for 10 minutes. You can heat one weapon or 2 pieces of ammunition in the forge as an action, or up to 10 weapons or 20 pieces of ammunition over the course of 1 minute.</p><p>The first time a heated weapon or piece of ammunition hits a target, it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage and is no longer heated.</p><h3>Fire Burst</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can release the heat of your portable forge in a colossal burst. While holding your forge, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{fireball}</em> spell, centered on yourself, without using a spell slot or material components, using your Masterwork save DC. You take no damage from this spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Legendary Property</h3><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft. You learn the following Legendary masterwork property, which you can immediately apply to a suit of masterwork armor:</p><h3>Forge Plate</h3><p><em>Legendary armor property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork suit of exotic heavy armor</p><p>You build a miniature furnace into this armor, as well as layers of heat-dispersing materials. While wearing this armor, you have immunity to fire damage.</p><p>Additionally, when you take the Dash action, you can choose to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X3DrXgxjwI2dvkD6]{wall of fire}</em> spell without using a spell slot or spell components as part of that action. The wall appears at the end of your turn. Instead of creating a straight or ringed wall of fire, the wall follows the path along the ground over which you moved on your turn, up to a distance of 60 feet.</p><p>Once you use this property, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Mechanauts' Guild</h2><p>For centuries, the pinnacle of mechanized vehicles was the <em>apparatus of the crab</em>, a singular device capable of exploring inhospitable environments, from the sea floor to lava-strewn volcanic fields. However, ambitious craftsmen from the Mechanauts’ Guild have drawn up designs for a new vehicle, mightier and more customizable than the old apparatus. This device is a walking tank, equipped with savage fists, scuttling legs, and climate control enhancements—a vehicle to dwarf all others, a true feat of engineering.</p><h3>Mechanaut's Apparatus</h3><p>At 3rd level, you complete the frame of a Mechanaut’s Apparatus, with ample room for upgrades and improvements. Its blueprints are based on the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.lSd5QHnIJbKvP1bh]{apparatus of the crab}</em>, but you can model your apparatus after any Beast or as a Humanoid figure.</p><p><em><strong>Apparatus Statistics.</strong></em> The statistics of your apparatus are given in the Mechanaut’s Apparatus stat block. The apparatus’s Armor Class is based on your Intelligence modifier and its hit points are based on your craftsman level.</p><p><em><strong>Customizing the Apparatus.</strong></em> Your apparatus comes with two installed masterwork weapons, which you can modify with masterwork properties or replace with different weapons when you finish a long rest. Only one installed weapon can be ranged. Furthermore, you can only load or reload an installed ranged weapon by using your action while you are inside the apparatus (or two actions if the weapon has the Mounted property). Your apparatus is always proficient with its installed weapons, and can use masterwork weapons with Master and Legendary properties.</p><p><em><strong>Repairing the Apparatus.</strong></em> When your apparatus drops to 0 hit points, it can’t move or act, but can be repaired. You can spend 1 minute restoring the apparatus’s ability to move at half speed, which it loses if it takes damage again before it is repaired.</p><p>You can repair your apparatus at the end of a short rest by spending your Hit Dice, causing it to regain hit points as if it had taken a short rest. When you finish a long rest, you can repair your apparatus, causing it to regain all its hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to repair your apparatus. If your apparatus is lost, you can build a new one for 400 gp.</p><p><em><strong>Entering and Exiting the Apparatus.</strong></em> A creature can enter or exit the apparatus by using half its movement. While within the apparatus, a creature has total cover from effects originating outside of it.</p><p>Your armor properties have no effect while you are within the apparatus. Only one Medium or Small creature can be in the apparatus at a time.</p><p><em><strong>Piloting the Apparatus.</strong></em> A creature that is inside the apparatus can pilot it; the apparatus acts on its pilot’s turn. Any creature piloting the apparatus can command it to move on its turn (no action required). When you pilot the apparatus, you can use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. You can also command it to use a reaction, using your own reaction to do so.</p><p>Only one creature can pilot the apparatus at a time. The pilot takes half of the amount of damage the apparatus takes.</p><p>While you are outside the apparatus, you can command the apparatus to wait or follow you. While following, it moves on its turn to remain within 30 feet of you.</p><p><em><strong>Attacking with the Apparatus.</strong></em> The apparatus attacks with its integrated weapons as if you were wielding them, and uses your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (your choice) for its attack and damage rolls, using the same modifier for both. When you take the Attack action, it makes the same number of attacks you normally would.</p><h3>Cockpit Upgrade</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can customize your apparatus by upgrading its piloting compartment. Choose one of the following upgrades:</p><p><em><strong>Comfortable Amenities.</strong></em> The interior of the apparatus is particularly cozy, perhaps even including a warm blanket and pillow. You can sleep while within the apparatus without ill effect.</p><p><em><strong>Ejector Seat.</strong></em> This apparatus comes equipped with an emergency ejection system, allowing for quick escape. Exiting this apparatus costs no movement.</p><p><em><strong>Loudspeaker.</strong></em> The apparatus comes equipped with a system that magnifies your voice up to three times as loud as normal.</p><h3>Limb Upgrade</h3><p>By 7th level, you have redesigned your apparatus’s legs to achieve better mobility. Choose one of the following upgrades:</p><p><em><strong>Arachnotron Legs.</strong></em> The apparatus can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and ceilings, and it gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.</p><p><em><strong>Heavy Suspension.</strong></em> The apparatus’s jump distance triples, and it takes no damage from falling a distance of less than 100 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Telescopic Frame.</strong></em> While no one is inside the apparatus, you can use your bonus action to command it to collapse down to Medium size or return to Large size. While collapsed in this way, the apparatus can’t be entered.</p><h3>Passenger Seat</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you have installed a second seat inside the cockpit, which takes an action to enter and exit. A creature can’t pilot the apparatus from this seat, but it does have total cover from outside effects.</p><h3>Attachment Upgrade</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you have installed an external attachment to your apparatus. Choose one of the upgrades below. Once you use the installed upgrade, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><p><em><strong>Ballista Cannon.</strong></em> As an action, you can fire the apparatus’s integrated heavy ballista in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC, taking 5d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><em><strong>Gyro Module.</strong></em> You can use your action to rapidly rotate your apparatus, allowing you to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. You can't move between these attacks.</p><p><em><strong>Rocket Engine.</strong></em> You can use your bonus action to light the apparatus’s installed rocket engine, propelling you up to 30 feet in a straight line in any direction you choose. If you make a melee attack immediately after this movement, the attack is made with advantage. On a hit, this attack knocks the target prone or pushes it up to 10 feet away from you (your choice).</p><h3>Legendary Property</h3><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft. You learn the following Legendary masterwork property, which you can immediately apply to a masterwork weapon:</p><h3>Pneumatic</h3><p><em>Legendary weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork exotic melee weapon</p><p>If this weapon is installed in a mechanaut’s apparatus and it deals more than one die of damage on a hit, whenever you roll damage, you can maximize one of the weapon’s damage dice instead of rolling it.</p><h2>Thunderlords' Guild</h2><p>From the earliest days of life, storms (and particularly lightning) have struck the creatures caught in them with awe and terror. The Thunderlords, by contrast, draw wild inspiration from the majesty of nature, and seek to, quite literally, capture lightning in a bottle.</p><h3>Power Cell</h3><p>Starting when you join this guild at 3rd level, you construct a lightning-generating power cell, which comes connected to a set of conduit gauntlets. When you gain these items, you are assumed to have been working on them in your spare time, only bringing them to full functionality when you choose this subclass. If these pieces of equipment are lost or damaged, you can replace them over the course of a long rest with 100 gp worth of materials.</p><p><em><strong>Charge Points.</strong></em> You have a number of charge points equal to half your craftsman level, rounded up, which represent the electrical energy stored within your power cell. You can spend these points to generate various electrical effects through your power cell. You regain all expended charge points when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Using Charge Points.</strong></em> Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack that deals lightning damage, you can spend a number of charge points up to your proficiency bonus to enhance the power of the attack. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:</p><p><em>Arc.</em> Lightning arcs to nearby targets. Choose a number of creatures equal to the number of charge points you spent that are within 15 feet of the target of your attack. Each of the chosen creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC or take lightning damage equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier.</p><p><em>Discharge.</em> The creature you hit takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage for each charge point you spent.</p><p><em>Jolt.</em> The creature you hit can’t take reactions until the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Shock</h3><p>At 3rd level, while you are carrying your power cell and it has at least 1 unspent charge point, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Weapons you wield can deal lightning damage instead of their normal damage type.</li><li>You know the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XvbiNhNqXXIFisIy]{shocking grasp}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8zT7njvqbpXs4Cel]{spare the dying}</em> cantrips. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</li></ul><h3>Lightning Rod</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, while you’re carrying your power cell, you have resistance to lightning damage.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you take lightning damage from a hostile creature while wearing your gauntlets, you can regain 2 expended charge points as a reaction.</p><h3>Static Charge</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes to store an electric charge in a weapon or suit of armor, or you can store an electric charge in up to 6 different weapons or suits of armor during a short or long rest. Unexpended charges dissipate after 1 hour. A charged weapon or suit of armor gains the following appropriate property:</p><p><em><strong>Charged Armor.</strong></em> When you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your reaction to expend the charge, dealing 1d8 lightning damage to the creature that hit you.</p><p><em><strong>Charged Weapon.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can expend the charge to deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to the target.</p><h3>High Voltage</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, while carrying your power cell, you can expend 5 charge points to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.IyikgTEOTv701jgQ]{lightning bolt}</em> spell without using a spell slot or material components. This spell uses your Masterwork save DC.</p><h3>Legendary Property</h3><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft. You learn the following Legendary masterwork property, which you can immediately apply to a masterwork weapon:</p><h3>Electroshock</h3><p><em>Legendary weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork exotic weapon</p><p>When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend the weapon’s built-in power cell to shock the target. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Masterwork save DC or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Once you use this property, you can’t use it again with this weapon until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Trappers' Guild</h2><p>Craftsmen are no strangers to turrets, bombs, and clockwork mechanisms, but the craftsmen of the Trappers’ Guild raise this to a level of artistry. Given enough time and resources, a trapsmith can veritably blanket a room in dangerous implements, setting the stage to slay an intruder in a half-dozen unique ways. While the traps do the dirty work, the trapsmith is free to lounge about some distance away, enjoying a cold beverage and dreaming up new, dangerous designs.</p><h3>Danger Sense</h3><p>Starting when you join this guild at 3rd level, your experience with traps gives you an edge when escaping danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p><h3>Traps</h3><p>You are an expert in designing ingenious and lethal traps. Starting at 3rd level, you can craft traps designed for quick deployment, which are detailed in the [Traps section] that follows.</p><p>When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one or more of your attacks to deploy a trap. You can deploy a number of traps equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended deployments when you finish a short or long rest. You can use an action to disarm and recover one of your traps that hasn’t been triggered, which also restores one use of your trap deployments.</p><h3>Booby Trap</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can take 1 minute to conceal one of your traps from an unsuspecting target. A creature can detect a concealed trap by using its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your Masterwork save DC, or by having a passive Perception score higher than that DC. The next time this trap activates before being disarmed, it deals twice as many damage dice.</p><h3>Ambush Modification</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes to modify a ranged weapon, or you can modify up to 6 ranged weapons during a short or long rest, each of which gains the following property:</p><p><em><strong>Hair-Trigger.</strong></em> This weapon has advantage on the first attack it makes using the Ready action.</p><h3>Rapid Setup</h3><p>At 14th level, as an action, you can deploy up to four traps.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Legendary Property</h3><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft. You learn the following Legendary masterwork property, which you can immediately apply to a masterwork weapon:</p><h3>Net</h3><p><em>Legendary weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork exotic ranged weapon that doesn’t have the Firearm property</p><p>When you hit a Large or smaller creature with this weapon’s projectile, it also deploys a net that automatically hits the creature.</p><h2>Traps</h2><p>Craftsmen of the Trappers’ Guild can build the following traps:</p><h3>Ballista Trap</h3><p>You load this compact, ballista-like device in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and aim it in a direction you choose. The trap triggers when a creature enters the area within a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line extending from the front of the trap. When it triggers, the ballista fires automatically, making a ranged attack against the creature.</p><p>This attack roll uses your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 piercing damage.</p><h3>Man-Trap</h3><p>You affix this oversized hunting trap to the ground in an unoccupied 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of you. When a Small or larger creature moves within the trap’s area, the trap clamps down on the creature. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 slashing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, it becomes trapped, rendering it unable to move. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t trapped. The trapped creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your Masterwork save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success. A Huge or larger creature that failed its saving throw rips the trap from its mounting the next time it moves.</p><h3>Razor Wire</h3><p>You deploy a tangle of razor-sharp wire in up to four unoccupied, contiguous, 5-foot-square areas you choose within 10 feet of you. Each of these areas becomes difficult terrain. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. Once deployed, the razor wire can’t be recovered.</p><h3>Trigger Bomb</h3><p>You toss this explosive device into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. As a reaction when a creature you can see or hear moves within 5 feet of the bomb, you can press the detonator, causing the bomb to explode. Each creature within 5 feet of the bomb must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</p>"

The GM will determine the craftsman level and cost in materials required for a magic item created from a blueprint. Unless otherwise stated, a blueprint can only be used to create one magic item.</p><h2>Weapon Exceptions</h2><p>Some weapons, in the name of verisimilitude, have unusual balancing that makes them slightly stronger or weaker compared to weapons a craftsman might usually craft. If you modify one of these weapons as a craftsman, first remove any of the weapon’s Special properties, then check following rules:</p><p><em><strong>Assault Rifle.</strong></em> Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d6 + 1 and decrease its reload to 10.</p><p><em><strong>Bayonet, Whip.</strong></em> Increase the weapon’s damage to 1d6.</p><p><em><strong>Blowgun, Bolas, Bomb, Net.</strong></em> This weapon can’t be modified by masterwork properties.</p><p><em><strong>Boomerang, Doomerang, Throwing Dagger.</strong></em> Add the Aerodynamic masterwork property.</p><p><em><strong>Catchpole, Trident.</strong></em> Increase the weapon’s damage to 1d8.</p><p><em><strong>Gatling Gun.</strong></em> Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d8 + 1, and decrease its reload to 10.</p><p><em><strong>Handaxe.</strong></em> Decrease the weapon’s damage to 1d4.</p><p><em><strong>Handgun, Revolver.</strong></em> Decrease the weapon’s range to 50/200 ft.</p><p><em><strong>Hunting Rifle.</strong></em> Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d6 + 1.</p><p><em><strong>Javelin.</strong></em> Decrease the weapon’s range to 20/60 ft.</p><p><em><strong>Lance.</strong></em> Add the Two-Handed property and decrease the weapon’s damage to 1d8.</p><p><em><strong>Light Cannon.</strong></em> Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d12 + 1.</p><p><em><strong>Longbow.</strong></em> Decrease the weapon’s range to 100/400 ft.</p><p><em><strong>Magnum, Explosive Magnum.</strong></em> Add the Two-Handed property and increase the weapon’s range to 100/400 ft.</p><p><em><strong>Musket, Volley Gun.</strong></em> Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d8 + 1.</p><p><em><strong>Parlor Gun.</strong></em> Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d4 + 1.</p><p><em><strong>Rocket Launcher.</strong></em> Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d12 + 1 and add the Mounted property.</p><h2>Craftsman's Tools</h2><p>As a craftsman, you carry a set of craftsman’s tools, a combined toolkit that covers a broad range of applications. You can use a set of craftsman’s tools for any ability check you would make with any set of artisan’s tools. A set of craftsman’s tools costs 75 gp.</p><h2>Downtime Crafting</h2><p>Any character can craft nonmagical items in their downtime; the craftsman is simply better at it. To craft an item, a character requires three things:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Materials.</strong></em> In most cases, the raw materials for an item can be obtained for half the item’s gold piece cost. This cost can fluctuate depending on the character’s current circumstances, contacts, or access to materials.</li><li><em><strong>Tools.</strong></em> You must have a set of appropriate artisan’s tools and proficiency with them to craft an item. Occasionally, an item might call for an entire workshop or other special tools.</li><li><em><strong>Time.</strong></em> The time required to craft an item is measured against its cost in materials. A character makes progress toward crafting an item equal to 5 gp for each day of downtime, completing their work when this amount exceeds the item’s cost in materials. As a craftsman, you work faster than a normal character, and make progress equal to 10 gp progress each day.</li></ul><p>You can sell any item you craft during your downtime for its total gold piece cost. As such, if you run a shop or craft items during your downtime purely to make profit, you can make 5 gp per day, assuming you sell all of your items.</p><h2>Variant Damage Dice</h2><p>With the GM’s permission, you can exchange your exotic weapon’s damage dice for an equivalent variant. Sets of dice are equivalent when the sum of the largest numbers of each set of dice are equal. For example, you can replace a weapon that deals 1d8 with 2d4 or a weapon that deals 2d12 with 4d6 or 3d8.</p><h2>Changing Weapon Ranges</h2><p>A ranged weapon’s long range is either three times its normal range or four times its normal range, depending on the type of projectile it fires. When a masterwork property changes a weapon’s normal range, change the long range by three or four times the amount, as appropriate to the weapon.</p><p>You can’t apply a weapon property if it would reduce a ranged weapon’s normal range to 0 feet, and you can’t remove the Ammunition or Thrown properties from a ranged weapon.</p><h2>Blaster</h2><p>In high-tech settings, such as the Dark Matter campaign setting, many weapons release blasts of energy instead of conventional projectiles. The Blaster property replaces the Firearm property in such settings. All rules that apply to firearms apply to blasters as well.</p><p>For the purpose of applying masterwork properties, blasters count as ranged weapons with the Ammunition and Reload properties. You can also apply the Overheat and Variable properties listed below to blasters.</p><h3>Blaster</h3><p><em>Apprentice weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork ranged weapon with the Loading or Reload property that doesn’t have the Tension property</p><p>This weapon loses the Ammunition, Loading, and Reload properties, as well as any damage die increases associated with those properties. (It regains these properties if you later remove Blaster.) It gains the Blaster property and deals radiant damage instead of its normal damage type. If this weapon wasn’t previously a firearm, its damage die increases by four steps and moves to two damage dice, if possible. The weapon’s normal range increases by 20 feet and its long range increases accordingly.</p><p><em><strong>Blaster.</strong></em> A weapon with the Blaster property is a ranged weapon that requires no ammunition. Blasters are considered firearms for the purpose of class features and abilities. Like firearms, you don’t add your ability score modifier to blasters’ damage rolls.</p><h3>Variable</h3><p><em>Apprentice weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork exotic ranged weapon with the Blaster property</p><p>This weapon has a variable power cell. As a bonus action, you can change the damage type of the blaster to cold, fire, lightning, necrotic radiant, or back to its normal damage type.</p><h3>Overheat</h3><p><em>Journeyman weapon property</em></p><p><em><strong>Components:</strong></em> Masterwork martial or exotic weapon with the Blaster and Heavy properties</p><p>This weapon gains the Overheat property and its damage die increases by two steps.</p><p><em><strong>Overheat.</strong></em> Once you make an attack with this weapon, it can’t be used again to make an attack until the end of your next turn.</p><h2>Modified Weapons</h2><p>Once you modify a weapon’s properties, it may no longer resemble its original function or profile. The GM decides if a modified weapon still counts as its base form for characters that have proficiency with it and for features which refer to a specific type of weapon (as opposed to a category of weapons, such as simple or martial weapons).</p>"

Many rogues are specialized around a favored criminal profession, from petty theft to assassination, while others learn increasingly intricate and arcane skills that separate them from common cutpurses.

This transformation might have left you physically unchanged, or you could have a half-dozen eyes, lanky and hairy limbs, or a set of inhuman mandibles. Whatever the transformation’s side effects, you can now produce deadly poison and ropes of silken web from your palms, and eventually can scale the wall with your fingertips.</p><h3>Webbing</h3><p>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can magically produce sticky, silken spider webs from your palms. You can project a line of web as a bonus action, allowing you to create a temporary rope, pull an unattended object, close doors, or snatch a small object weighing less than 10 pounds within 60 feet. This line of web dissolves after 1 minute.</p><p>If you project the line of web at a point you can see within 60 feet, you can pull yourself to that point in a straight line. This expends movement and provokes opportunity attacks normally.</p><p>You can use this ability as a reaction when you fall to pull yourself up to 10 feet in any direction, or create a rope of web of up to 60 feet in length and anchor it to a point you choose.</p><h3>Venomous Strike</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can produce an endless supply of deadly spider venom. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can choose for the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack} to deal d8s of poison damage instead of d6s of the weapon’s normal damage type.</p><h3>Wall Crawling</h3><p>Starting at 9th level, you have the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p>Additionally, if you are on a ceiling, you can hide from any creature that is at least 10 feet or more below you even if you otherwise lack appropriate cover.</p><h3>Web Walker</h3><p>Beginning at 13th level, you can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.XImnGI2q4TIWj6vk]{web}</em> at will, without using a spell slot or spell components. Your save DC for this spell equals 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you ignore movement restrictions caused by webbing.</p><h3>Paralytic Venom</h3><p>Beginning at 17th level, when you use your @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.XKzKMu5tUoPvVAvp]{Venomous Strike} to deal poison @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack} damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). If the target fails its saving throw, it is paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed creature can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Enforcer</h2><p>The backbones of any good Thieves’ Guild, enforcers are ruthless thugs skilled at intimidation and violence. Usually charged with running protection rackets for the Guild, enforcers also handle internal problems of the Guild, ensuring that no Guild member snitches to the authorities or takes more than their own share.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and martial weapons.</p><h3>Brutal Attack</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can make a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack} using any simple or martial melee weapon.</p><h3>Massive Shove</h3><p>At 9th level, when you make an attack, you can shove the target as a bonus action. If you succeed, you can push the creature up to 15 feet away from you, rather than 5 feet.</p><p>Additionally, if you make an attack with a reach weapon, you can use your bonus action to make a shove attempt in reverse, pulling the target toward you on a success.</p><h3>Threatening Demeanor</h3><p>By 13th level, you are an expert in threatening postures and gestures. When you roll initiative, choose one creature within 60 feet that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Charisma modifier (your choice). On a failed save, the target is frightened by you for up to 1 minute. While the creature is frightened of you, your attack rolls against it have advantage. The frightened creature can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><h3>Double Attack</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make another attack. This attack can be a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack}, even if you have already made one on your turn.</p><h2>Grifter</h2><p>Swindlers, cheats, and most of all, grifters hang around taverns where people might have a looser grasp on their coins. The archetypal grifter knows that, with the right words and the right scheme, you can part anyone from their money, and even make it seem fair. Grifters are masters of cons, big and small, from counting cards and rolling loaded dice, to pyramid schemes and fraud.</p><h3>Swindle</h3><p>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in all gaming sets. Additionally, you learn the <em>@UUID[Item.bMJhqqn9oBKDxPm4]{cheat}</em> cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p><h3>Double Bluff</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can feint between two opponents, striking whichever one is least prepared. You gain an additional way to use your @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack}; you don’t need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it and also within 5 feet of another hostile creature.</p><h3>Cut and Run</h3><p>By 9th level, you know to get out of dodge just before a ruse goes south. Whenever you take the Dash action, creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you. When you take the Disengage action, you can move up to half your speed.</p><h3>Long Con</h3><p>At 13th level, you can perfectly rehearse a lie. When you take a long rest, you can choose one falsehood to rehearse. This falsehood can be a single lie or an entire false history. You never need to make a Deception check for this falsehood. You can perfectly recite this falsehood until you use this feature to rehearse another one.</p><h3>Heist Plan</h3><p>Starting at 17th level, you always plot out your schemes several moves ahead of time. You can take the Ready action on your turn as a bonus action. Whatever action you choose, your trigger must be based on a hostile creature performing a specific type of action (such as “when the kobold attacks” or “when the mage casts a spell”) and can’t activate until after your turn ends.</p><h2>Shadow Master</h2><p>Rogues that wish to gain membership in the furtive Order of Shadow Masters must perform twelve trials, train relentlessly, and undergo the Umbral Rite, a ritual of profound darkness that severs their shadow from their heels. In return, they grow pale and gaunt with empty holes for eyes, but can manipulate the shadows as one does a marionette. They can summon inky blackness and see through impenetrable night, while their shadows skulk about the walls and floors, doing their every bidding.</p><h3>Abyssal Eyes</h3><p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your eyes change to an inky black, granting you darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.</p><h3>Release Shadow</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to magically detach your shadow from your body, allowing it to move independently. Your shadow is a flat, perfectly black silhouette of you that crawls along surfaces. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. It is the same size as you, albeit perfectly flat, and can occupy the same space as other creatures, and vice versa. If your shadow makes a saving throw or an ability check to interact with the environment, it uses your bonus for the roll.</p><p>In combat, your shadow acts on your turns and follows your commands. You can command your shadow on each of your turns to move up to 30 feet along the walls or floor (no action required). Your shadow doesn’t attack, but can interact with objects and counts as an ally for the purposes of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack}.</p><p>Your shadow vanishes if it drops to 0 hit points, if it is within the area of light created by a spell of 1st level or higher, or if it is ever more than 60 feet from you. Once it vanishes, your shadow reappears at your heels at the end of your next turn.</p><p>If your shadow enters a heavily obscured area or one of magical darkness, it is effectively invisible. Your shadow can appear to be the shadow of other creatures and act convincingly using your Charisma (Performance) or Charisma (Deception) skill.</p><h3>Gloaming Black</h3><p>At 9th level, you can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.XpSi0ANsl8Wd00UP]{darkness}</em> without using a spell slot or spell components. When you use this feature, you can see through the darkness created by this spell. Additionally, when your shadow enters this area of darkness, you can choose for it to grow to fill the entire area.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Shadow Puppet</h3><p>Starting at 13th level, your shadow can reach out to the shadows of other creatures, interacting with them as if they were physical. If your shadow is within 5 feet of the shadow of another creature you can see, you can use your bonus action to command it to use one of the following abilities:</p><ul><li>Your shadow makes an attack against the shadow of another creature. Your shadow uses Dexterity for its attack rolls and has proficiency with its shadowy weapons. On a hit against the creature’s AC, the creature takes 2d6 damage. This damage counts as magical and its type matches the weapon you are carrying if it deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, or deals bludgeoning damage otherwise.</li><li>Your shadow grapples the shadow of another creature. Your shadow can use your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check for its grapple check and the target makes its grapple check as normal. If your shadow succeeds, the creature is grappled until the end of its next turn.</li><li>Your shadow hooks onto the heels of another creature, becoming its second shadow until the end of its next turn. If you see the creature make an attack while your shadow is on its heels, you can use your reaction to cause the shadow to leap in the way, becoming the target of the attack.</li></ul><h3>Shadowdance</h3><p>By 17th level, your body has absorbed much of the shadowstuff that prevails in the darkest planes of existence, allowing you to mingle with your shadow as if you were a creature of its kind. You can use your bonus action to swap places with your shadow, both of you teleporting in a dim haze. Once you use this ability, you can use it once more before the end of your turn without using a bonus action. If you teleport into an area of dim light or darkness, you have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn while you are in that area.</p><h2>Temporal Trickster</h2><p>Of the rogues who dabble in magic, only a few possess the aptitude to master chronomancy, the magic of time. These skillful dilettantes practice a variety of professions, for the ability to manipulate time is useful in all manner of roguish pursuits. With a flick of the fingers, a temporal trickster can freeze time, rearrange seconds, or leap into the future.</p><h3>Moment to Act</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn the <em>@UUID[Item.sr2ehzkveYvjRosg]{moment to think} </em>cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip. When you cast this cantrip, you can move 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. Additionally, you can use your action while time is stopped to take the Hide action.</p><h3>Chrono-Master</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, your time-bending tricks allow you to cast chronomancy spells to beguile your foes. The energy you use to accomplish this is represented by a pool of chronomancy points, equal to twice your proficiency bonus, which you spend to cast spells. You regain all expended chronomancy points when you finish a long rest.</p><p>The spells you have available and their cost in chronomancy points are given on the Time Magic table below. New spells are marked with an asterisk. Additionally, when you reach 9th level and 13th level in this class, you gain the ability to cast more spells, as shown on the table.</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your chronomancy spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for chronomancy spells you cast.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Rogue Level</td><td>Chronomancy Points</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.ar58Y4Q4kTJ6A8MF]{action},* @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.qBJrjstLhzRYML9Z]{instant replay}*</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>3</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.kbF9dXED84QCzcuO]{delay},* @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.aoo1XE9pbq3enp1V]{recall}*</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>5</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.B9cqZrICkke4d1t6]{haste}, @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.BU2hVNbDyCtyGSho]{slow}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Impressions of the Future</h3><p>Beginning at 9th level, you can perceive the fluctuating waves of time to anticipate how your actions might ripple forward. As a bonus action, you can glimpse a possible future. Describe to the GM what actions you will take on your turn. The GM will then tell you the likely immediate consequences that will happen before the start of your next turn. This glimpse of the future reveals anything you might see or hear in that time, but might be flawed; the prediction can’t take into account the actions of allies or unexpected failed rolls.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Time Dilation</h3><p>Beginning at 13th level, you can siphon excess temporal energy to enhance your reflexes. Whenever you cast a spell with the chronomancy tag (including <em>haste</em> and <em>slow</em>), you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class and Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Stop the Clock</h3><p>By 17th level, you have mastered the ultimate chronomantic ability, the power to stop time in its tracks. You can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.1FqQM69cpLGoFpXj]{time stop}</em> once without using a spell slot.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Titan Slayer</h2><p>Though titan slayers often adopt larger-than-life names and perform immense feats, they are universally little folk, such as halflings and gnomes, which excel at battling foes larger than themselves.</p><p>As a titan slayer, you have learned a number of techniques to dumbfound larger creatures so that you can target their vital areas and bring them down swiftly. You use your foe’s size against them, weaving between their limbs and striking when they least expect it. No challenge, no foe is too large for you, for as they say, “The bigger they are, the harder they fall.”</p><p>@UUID[.F4sdeDqhjR8ajM59]{Sidebar: Size}</p><h3>Underfoot Combat</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, while you are adjacent to a creature that is two or more size categories larger than you, you can use your bonus action to enter that creature’s space. You remain in this creature’s space until it moves, or until you use your bonus action to move to an unoccupied space adjacent to the creature.</p><p>While you are in a hostile creature’s space, you can use @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack} against that creature if you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll, even if you don’t have advantage against it and no enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it. Additionally, while in this space, you have half cover if the creature is two size categories larger than you, and three-quarters cover if the creature is three or more size categories larger than you.</p><h3>Knee Striker</h3><p>At 3rd level, when you make a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack} against a creature that is of a size larger than yours, you can forego half your Sneak Attack dice (rounded down, to a minimum of 1) to knock that creature prone.</p><h3>Confound the Big Folk</h3><p>By 9th level, you are an expert in the art of baffling the big folk, who are slow and unobservant by your standards. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide from and sneak around creatures that are a larger size than you. Additionally, if you make a check to avoid, climb on, or confuse a creature that is at least one size larger size than you, and the check doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus, you can add half your proficiency bonus to that check.</p><h3>Fear No Monster</h3><p>By 13th level, you are fearless in the face of impossible odds. You can’t be frightened. Additionally, whenever you roll initiative, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws you make until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Fell the Giant</h3><p>At 17th level, your weapon attacks against creatures that are at least one size larger than you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Your critical hits also knock the target creature prone.</p>"

Such paladins, often called ravens, bind themselves to higher ideals of justice, transcending law and allegiances, so that they can right the wrongs that go unpunished. Every foul action has its consequence, and when no others rise to the challenge, the blade of a raven is not far behind.</p><h3>Tenets of Eternal Night</h3><p>Paladins who swear the Oath of Eternal Night share a sense of moral absolutism and tend to believe in the following core tenets:</p><p><em><strong>None are Exempt.</strong></em> Even kings and magistrates that write the laws must be held accountable to them.</p><p><em><strong>Good of the Many.</strong></em> The needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few. It is your charge to protect the weak when the powerful seek to oppress.</p><p><em><strong>Knight of Night.</strong></em> When justice is not done in the light of day, it must be restored in darkness.</p><h3>Oath of Eternal Night Spells</h3><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Paladin Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pub0OWVEB71XQx1n]{feather fall}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.B0pnIcc52O6G8hi8]{longstrider}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.wqfAVANuQonNBgnL]{misty step}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pRMvmknwLf2tdMTj]{pass without trace}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.yfbK8gZqESlaoY5t]{fly}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Szvk5FEVQW3uhJi5]{haste}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.A4RsPuSvB9wFtz1j]{dimension door}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{teleportation circle}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><em><strong>Cover of Darkness.</strong></em> As a bonus action using your Channel Divinity, you can create a 15-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness centered on a point you can see within 30 feet of you. This sphere spreads around corners and lasts for one minute. You can see through darkness you create in this way.</p><p><em><strong>Shrouded Armor.</strong></em> As an action using your Channel Divinity, you can draw shadowstuff from the Plane of Shadow and imbue it upon a suit of armor you are wearing. This armor is cloaked in a tenebrous swirl and reflects no light. You can add your Charisma modifier to Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make while wearing the armor, and the armor doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Stealth checks.</p><p>This effect ends after 8 hours, or if you end the effect on your turn (no action required). The effect ends early if you remove your armor or fall unconscious.</p><h3>Slip into the Shadows</h3><p>At 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can take the Hide action as a bonus action.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Cloak of Night</h3><p>At 15th level, as a reaction when you take damage, you can shed small flakes of darkness which briefly whirl around you before disappearing. The next attack roll made against you before the start of your next turn has disadvantage.</p><h3>Shadow Form</h3><p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of a tenebrous stalker, drawing incredible power from the darkness around you. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits while you are within dim light or darkness:</p><ul><li>You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks and saving throws.</li><li>As a bonus action, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also within dim light or darkness.</li><li>Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an extra 4d8 necrotic damage to the target.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Oath of Heresy</h2><p>Heretics come in all forms, but those who swear an Oath of Heresy have borne witness to a great revelation: the prophets of history are false and their clerics have been misled, for the gods have deceived the entire world. Heretics vow to spread their truth to whoever will listen, rebuffing holy men and inquisitors that lack the sense to share in their revolution. Naturally, heretics end their crusades in one of two ways: canonized for revolutionizing the faith, or burned at the stake for their transgressions.</p><p>Heretics might embrace any fundamental truth that goes unrecognized. Many believe the gods are fundamentally false—a trick wrought by celestials or high priests—while others simply profess the nonnecessity of deities to gain entry to an afterlife. Others attack fundamental pillars of faith that are erected on prejudicial beliefs, such as priestly orders that disallow people of different races or genders to their own. No matter what truth they embrace, these paladins are empowered by their belief and their oaths (as all paladins are), and so can crusade in active rebellion against the gods.</p><p>@UUID[.PX8rG10HIPSljMDx]{Sidebar: True Nature of the Gods}</p><h3>Tenets of Heresy</h3><p>By swearing your oath, you vow to spread truth far and wide according to the following tenets.</p><p><em><strong>Spread the Revolution.</strong></em> Share the truth with everyone. Where truth itself does not dispel the lies, your sword might dispense truth of its own.</p><p><em><strong>Defy Convention.</strong></em> You stand to shatter the laws that seek to contain the truth.

Each creature you choose within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 psychic damage for each point of your proficiency bonus and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not deafened.</p><p><em><strong>Turn the Holy.</strong></em> As an action using your Channel Divinity, you censure Celestials and holy men. Each Celestial that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. Each Humanoid within range that can cast 1st-level spells or higher using Wisdom as their spellcasting ability score must also make a Wisdom saving throw. If a creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p><h3>Godless Aura</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, your aura divorces the area around you from divine powers. When a creature other than yourself within 10 feet of you regains hit points, you can choose for that healing to fail and have no effect. Furthermore, you can use your reaction to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.7dfAuDWbe5bQWpg7]{counterspell}</em>, without using a spell slot or spell components, to interrupt any spellcaster using Wisdom as their spellcasting ability score to cast a spell of 1st level or higher within 10 feet of you.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Implacable Will</h3><p>By 15th level, you can reroll with advantage a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Apostate</h3><p>At 20th level, fully divorced from the will of the gods, you can use your action to assume a form empowered by the influence of your blasphemy, an anti-apotheosis. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p><ul><li>You can use your Blaspheme Channel Divinity as a bonus action without using your Channel Divinity. When you use this ability this way, it deals 4d6 psychic damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success.</li><li>You gain 20 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Oath of Revelry</h2><p>Paladins who swear the Oath of Revelry make a solemn vow to party day and night until their hearts give out. The antithesis of stuffy, lawful crusaders, these emissaries of carousal travel the land, crashing parties and raising hell wherever they raise a glass. Authorities bristle at their arrival, but the youth cheer, for a Party Paladin is always accompanied by a good time.</p><h3>Tenets of Revelry</h3><p>Many paladins who swear the Oath of Revelry choose to abide by the Codicus Brodicus, a doctrine of moral judgments, both foul and fair, about the way one should conduct life and party. In general, paladins who take this oath abide by the following principles:</p><p><em><strong>The Party Don’t Stop.</strong></em> Every occasion deserves celebration, and everyone should be invited.</p><p><em><strong>Work Hard, Party Hard.</strong></em> Without planning and effort, a good bacchanal has no momentousness. Bring your “A” game to events.</p><p><em><strong>Fight for Your Right to Party.</strong></em> Those who would stand in your way need to be reminded what it’s like to have a good time, or failing that, be circumvented.</p><h3>Oath of Revelry Spells</h3><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Paladin Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eS7XnnApoxRxYXPs]{charm person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BQk5Row4NymMnUQl]{hideous laughter}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3MYDjS6k9IYL0aTj]{calm emotions}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9eOZDBImVKxbeOyZ]{enhance ability}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BV0mpbHh29IbbIj5]{create food and water}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.6g3WLOZ2u0EbaLAd]{hypnotic pattern}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.P6f1PPKPd9BCb742]{compulsion}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JQyigMNPiDnGI18b]{geas}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.uAwtVZkiSTyP6ORB]{telepathic bond}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><em><strong>Conjure Drink.</strong></em> When you finish a long rest, you can use your Channel Divinity to summon to your flask a frothy ale from the heavens itself. Up to three creatures can drink from this flask, and each has advantage on the next saving throw it makes before it takes a long rest, after which the buzz wears off. When you take a short rest, any remaining ale becomes nonmagical.</p><p><em><strong>Song and Dance.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity as an action to dance a catchy jig. Each creature you choose within 15 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw or join in. Creatures continue to dance as long as you do.</p><p>Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. This effect ends for a creature if you choose to end it on your turn (no action required), or if the creature reattempts the Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn and succeeds.</p><p>A creature that is dancing spends all its movement tapping its feet and shuffling about without leaving its space. It also has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls that rely on Dexterity.</p><h3>Aura of Fraternity</h3><p>At 7th level, you and your allies fight better together. While you have one or more ally adjacent to you, you and each of your allies within 5 feet deal an extra 1d4 damage on melee attacks.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 15 feet.</p><h3>Merrymaker</h3><p>At 15th level, when you or a friendly creature within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or saving throw that doesn’t have disadvantage, you can cause it to be made with advantage.</p><p>You can use this ability three times, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Party Animal</h3><p>Starting at 20th level, you can use your action to transform into an embodiment of partying. You sprout horns like a satyr and emanate a 30-foot aura of gaiety. For the next minute, you and friendly creatures within the aura can’t be blinded, deafened, exhausted, or poisoned. Additionally, at the start of each of your turns, you and each friendly creature that isn’t incapacitated within the aura regains 10 hit points.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Oath of Storms</h2><p>The Oath of Storms calls paladins to the salty brine and choppy seas, the altar of the raging storm. Paladins who swear this oath embrace the sea’s dispassionate neutrality and uphold few core tenets. With rare exceptions, these paladins are directionless crusaders, guided by the winds and tide, and might maintain distant lighthouses, hunt down vicious pirates, or seek undiscovered lands, as the gales dictate. However, storm knights, as they are often called, have a long memory for vengeance and deep penchants for superstition. Always listen to the wisdom of a storm knight, lest the winds turn foul and the ocean tempestuous.</p><h3>Tenets of the Storm</h3><p>Storm knights swear their oaths on sailing superstitions and unspoken laws of the sea, often containing the following principles:</p><p><em><strong>Safe Harbor.</strong></em> Protect sailors and wise captains that respect the laws of the ocean. No gale should break their masts while you are aboard.</p><p><em><strong>Howling Gales.</strong></em> The winds should steer your journey, wherever they might take you. Furthermore, it is proper that the winds should often guide you into storms.</p><p><em><strong>Thunderous Castigation.</strong></em> The fury of the storm demands equal reprisal for all slights, major and minor. Doing otherwise is bad luck.</p><h3>Oath of Storms Spells</h3><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Paladin Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.IBJmWjzbQGu7M4UX]{fog cloud}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WTbOQBsarsL1LuXJ]{thunderwave}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{gust of wind}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3Lo9boi7P2ro6QV4]{hold person}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ehvmg9U9fcMEhE4z]{call lightning}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ew6GA8dJy2spQmFW]{wind wall}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7fFHlBk3UNX8gPKL]{control water}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WN2LWEljYU6QqnRH]{ice storm}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.dp6xny4v8PDoIGjh]{commune with nature}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.l9Ju5KE7bbn3WpTm]{hold monster}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><em><strong>Thunderous Revenge.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity to strike back with the fury of a storm. Immediately after a creature you can see within 30 feet of you deals damage to you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes lightning damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p><p><em><strong>Walk on Waves.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to befriend the sea. For the next hour, you gain the benefits of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.YBda6nLKjxdT1LbS]{water walk}</em> spell, and your speed doubles while you are walking on water.</p><h3>Vortex Aura</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your bonus action to summon a strong wind to whirl around you in a 10-foot radius until you dismiss it on your turn (no action required). While your vortex is active, its area counts as difficult terrain for creatures that you choose. The wind extinguishes unprotected flames, such as candles and torches, and disperses gases and vapors within its area.</p><p>At 18th level, the radius of this aura extends to 30 feet.</p><h3>Storm Soul</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, you have resistance to lightning damage.</p><p>Additionally, whenever a creature you can see within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, it takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Thunder God</h3><p>At 20th level, as an action, you can mantle yourself in the powers of a tempest deity. For 1 minute, your body crackles with thunder and lightning and your eyes glow blue, revealing a raging storm within. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You are immune to lightning and thunder damage.</li><li>You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.</li><li>You can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ehvmg9U9fcMEhE4z]{call lightning}</em> as a bonus action on your turn as a 5th-level spell without using a spell slot or spell components, and can use your bonus action to call down lightning using the spell on subsequent turns.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Oath of the Sun</h2><p>In the wastes, the sun is a double-edged sword: though it brings light, warmth, and nourishment to the desert’s scant greenery, it also burns, blinds, and can destroy those who don’t respect it. Paladins who take the Oath of the Sun understand the sun’s dual nature, and strive to both bring its light to the darkest reaches of the world and protect those who fall prey to the sun’s rays out of happenstance or misfortune.</p><p>Unlike other paladins, most brothers who take the Oath of the Sun belong to a clergy of a sun god of some sort, be it Amaterasu, Apollo, Ra, or any other. They most often serve as templars, protecting their temples from raiders, bandits, and more supernatural threats. They are uniformly good, but have little adherence to laws other than those of their faith.</p><h3>Tenets of the Sun</h3><p>The Oath of the Sun is always taken in public at the height of noon, among the congregation of the paladin’s church.</p><p><em><strong>The Sun Rises.</strong></em> The sun rises over the horizon each day, without fail, spreading light over the whole of the world. So should you never fail in your task to spread your faith and knowledge every day.</p><p><em><strong>The Sun Blazes.</strong></em> Under the noonday sun, only the pure may survive for long. Those that fear the sun must see its light, so as to burn away their impurity.</p><p><em><strong>The Sun Sets.</strong></em> The sun must rest each night, and give the world a chance to sleep. So too should you give rest to your fury and righteousness in the service of mercy, though only to those who deserve it.</p><h3>Oath of the Sun Spells</h3><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Paladin Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.5SuJewoa1CRWaj1F]{burning hands}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7buEm5KhI5lP8m1z]{guiding bolt}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.hJ6ZiA3fpoY8v9cp]{darkvision}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7u2obDvuvtZBkTfq]{scorching ray}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{daylight}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.uCud2s4TjMfjiXUb]{spirit guardians}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.avD5XUtkBPQQR97c]{fire shield}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X3DrXgxjwI2dvkD6]{wall of fire}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{flame strike}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.SLxA9QhrggTz0taU]{hallow}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><em><strong>Glorious Radiance.</strong></em> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to radiate sunlight. While this effect is active, you shed bright light out to a radius of 30 feet. Additionally, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your paladin level + your Charisma modifier. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, you can use your reaction to deal 5 radiant damage to it. This effect lasts for 1 hour, ending early if the hit points are expended or you dismiss it on your turn (no action required). When you reach 11th level, the effect deals 10 radiant damage, and at 17th level, it deals 15 radiant damage.</p><p><em><strong>Solar Flare.</strong></em> As an action, you can emit a blinding flash of light using your Channel Divinity. When you do so, each creature you choose within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><h3>Sun's Warmth</h3><p>At 7th level, you and all friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to cold and fire damage, and can tolerate temperatures as low as −100 degrees Fahrenheit and as high as 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, when you deal fire damage, you can choose to deal radiant damage instead, or vice versa.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Incandescent Fury</h3><p>At 15th level, the damage die for your Improved Divine Smite becomes a d10.</p><h3>Zenith</h3><p>At 20th level, as an action on your turn, you can fill yourself with the sun’s brilliant wrath. You can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.2RC0EyvBLPH88PZF]{sunbeam}</em> without using a spell slot. Additionally, at the start of each of your turns during this spell’s duration, you regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier if you have no more than half your hit points left.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Oath of Winter</h2><p>The Oath of Winter was originally a concord with an ancient being of ice, Father Winter. With this treatise, a paladin swears to stand vanguard against the cold, protecting the innocent from the ravages of winter’s ice and the horrors of the bitter north. Even as Father Winter has faded into obscurity with the march of centuries, the order of paladins sworn to this oath has remained, their concord and duty neverending.</p><h3>Tenets of Winter</h3><p>Your concord with Father Winter, enumerated in your oath, is based on the following principles:</p><p><em><strong>Winter’s Snow.</strong></em> Though the winter is long and harsh, it is not altogether evil. Your concord with Father Winter himself is proof of that.</p><p><em><strong>Winter’s Wind.</strong></em> With the coming of winter frosts are harsh dangers and frigid creatures not found in the summer. It is your duty to protect the innocent from this peril.</p><p><em><strong>Winter’s Throne.</strong></em> Seeking to unseat Father Winter from his throne of ice is to break your vow. No matter the evils of his reign, never break your concord.

You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your paladin level + your Charisma modifier. You subtract fire damage from your temporary hit points as if you were vulnerable to it, but if fire damage reduces your temporary hit points to zero, you don’t subtract the remaining fire damage from your hit points, as your melting ice neutralizes the excess heat.</p><p><em><strong>North Wind.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity as an action to breathe a hoary wind. Each creature within a 30-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage for each point of your proficiency bonus, and its speed is halved until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much cold damage and its speed is not halved. A creature killed by this ability becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.</p><h3>Frigid Aura</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, you emanate bitter cold and draw heat from the room. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to cold and fire damage.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Iceflesh</h3><p>By 15th level, when you take damage or are blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, you can use your reaction to freeze the blood in your veins, delaying the effect. The damage or condition is suspended for 1 minute, after which it resumes and affects you normally. This ability pauses the duration of spells that affect only you to impose a condition, and the spellcaster doesn’t need to maintain concentration on such a spell until the effect resumes. You can only freeze one condition or instance of damage at a time. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again for 1 minute.</p><h3>Father Winter</h3><p>Starting at 20th level, you can invite the purest cold upon yourself as an action, becoming an effigy of Father Winter. For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You are immune to cold damage.</li><li>When a creature within 5 feet of you deals damage to you while you aren’t incapacitated, it takes 2d10 cold damage.</li><li>You emit a frigid 10-foot-radius aura that freezes the ground around you.

The knight laughs at the crone’s gesture before collapsing in mere seconds, desiccated and dead.</p><p>A scarred and grizzled warrior in breastplate leads a charge through a detachment of soldiers, swinging a glaive shrouded in dark energies at her foes. A shambling, undead vanguard follows her path, and her slain foes rise to join their ranks.</p><p>A grim, robed figure presides before his court, all arranged in a marble hall of gothic construction. Shambling corpses, abominations of flesh and bone, and dead-eyed, charmed nobles wait in attendance, forming perfect lines in silent obedience.</p><p>Necromancers are spellcasters that hold sway over the forces of life and death, twisting them to serve their own ambitions and commanding small armies of lifeless, animated thralls.</p><h2>Morbid Curiosity</h2><p>Necromancers must match their grand intellects with an equal lack of scruples—the willingness to turn to forbidden knowledge and unquestionably evil methods. No matter their means, every necromancer is driven by a deep fascination with the dark arts and the power necromancy can afford them. Most see themselves as outcast members of the academic elite, braving new territories of magic that other spellcasters are too cowardly to explore.</p><p>However, collecting knowledge expanding their understanding is merely a means to an end for most necromancers; they are almost always driven by a deeper, darker impulse, a goal that pushes them to the utter brink. This might be the distorted ideal of a “greater good” or a goal to right the wrong of mortality. In every case, necromancy is a grim implement for their life’s work.</p><h2>Masters of Undeath</h2><p>Necromancers have learned through trial and error how to puppet the flesh, bone, and spirits of the dead, binding them to their will. Through their terrible magic, they command the forms of lesser undead, and demand respect from those powerful enough to resist their thrall. All necromancers share the capability of simply animating corpses, along with the knowledge and foresight to create new and terrible undead abominations to further their goals. Beyond the basic command over the undead, each necromancer specializes in a method to impart their will upon the world. Some dive deeply into the necromantic arts or focus on their ability to assert control over the weak, while others still master the art of both martial and magical combat. Though their skills might seem specialized, properly prepared necromancers can dominate both on the battlefield and at the round table.</p><h2>Creating a Necromancer</h2><p>As you create your necromancer, the most important piece of information to consider is your character’s ambition. What is your goal? How do you intend to achieve it? How does necromancy fit into the picture? Once you’ve decided on your ambition, consider why you turned to necromancy to accomplish it. Were you scorned by your previous spellcasting master? Did you come across an old, rotting tome filled with forgotten knowledge? Were you the survivor of some great attack by another necromancer?</p><p>Work with your GM to determine how necromancy is viewed in the world. Is it just another method of spellcasting, or is it an abominable tool, used only by the most abhorred spellcasters? How do commoners react when they see you? Must you hide your thralls from public scrutiny, and if so, how? Furthermore, do the other player characters know of your sinister magic, and if so, how have they reacted to seeing your puppeteered corpses? Work with other players, especially those with cleric and paladin characters, to find suitable reasons you might work together.</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>You can make a necromancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, and then Strength or Dexterity if you plan to choose the Death Knight ambition. Second, choose a background of your choice, preferably one that ties into your ambition. Third, choose <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.vrN18tbTw7io5MWd]{chill touch}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.CU2YZWYKmXV7Rygq]{hocuspocus}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Bnn9Nzajixvow9xi]{light}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.kX9gcBZfjrPFA050]{spark of life}</em> for your cantrips, and then choose

1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the necromancer spell list. You learn additional necromancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Necromancer table.</p><h3>Spell Slots</h3><p>The Necromancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast spells of the 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the necromancer spell list.</p><p>You learn an additional necromancer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the necromancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the necromancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your necromancer spells, since your power is rooted in the fine manipulation of negative energy and research into magical secrets. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a necromancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h3>Ritual Casting</h3><p>You can cast any necromancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells. For a necromancer, these are typically objects with sentimental value, such as a locket, childhood toy, prison shackle, or wedding ring, which are altered with magically conductive materials.</p><h2>Charnel Touch</h2><p>Your connection to the negative energy realm grants you an inner nexus of dangerous power, ready to be unleashed at a moment’s notice. Starting at 1st level, you have a pool of Charnel Touch points equal to your necromancer level × 5 that replenishes when you finish a long rest.</p><p>As an action, declare the number of points you wish to expend, up to a maximum of 5 × your proficiency bonus, and make a melee spell attack against one creature within your reach. On a hit, you expend the declared amount of points and deal necrotic damage equal to the points expended. If the attack misses, you don’t expend any points. The damage dealt by your Charnel Touch is doubled when you score a critical hit, expending no additional points.</p><p>This attack deals no damage to Constructs and instead heals Undead for the number of points expended. You can target a willing creature with this ability without making a spell attack roll.</p><p>@UUID[.vGk02jpmgxkIeZ2v#variant-rule:-necromancy-unleashed]{Variant Rule: Necromancy Unleashed}</p><h2>Thralls</h2><p>While lesser spellcasters can only animate flesh and bone in a rudimentary fashion, and must expend valuable energy to maintain their undead’s loyalty, true necromancers can provide their undead with a portion of their own life force, ensuring long-term obedience. Beginning at 2nd level, you learn an ancient and powerful ritual that allows you to raise and command your own army of the undead.</p><h3>Animate Thralls</h3><p>By spending 10 uninterrupted minutes performing this ritual with a spellcasting focus or component pouch, you can raise the remains of one or more Small or Medium Humanoids within 30 feet of you into Undead creatures. Undead created in this way become your thralls. You maintain control over your thralls indefinitely. Stat blocks for <strong>skeletons</strong>, <strong>zombies</strong>, and other <strong>thralls</strong> can be found in the @UUID[.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#undead-thralls]{Undead Thralls} section at the end of the class description.</p><h3>Commanding Thralls</h3><p>You can mentally control all of your thralls while you are conscious without using any actions. If you are unconscious, your thralls will move to protect your body from harm, but will not attack.</p><p>In combat, your thralls take their turns immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice). All your thralls collectively share one reaction and bonus action, which a single thrall can use each round.</p><p>Thralls use your spell attack modifier to make their attacks.</p><h3>Maximum Thralls</h3><p>You can animate and control one thrall of challenge rating (CR) 1/4. As you gain levels in this class, you can animate more thralls. The combined CR of all your thralls can’t exceed the number shown in the Thrall CR Total column of the Necromancer table, and the total number of thralls under your control can never exceed your proficiency bonus.</p><p>At any time, you can use your action to sever your connection to one or more thralls, releasing them. Corporeal Undead crumple into a heap and incorporeal Undead flee to the Ethereal Plane.</p><h3>Animate Dead</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, a necromancer can learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.oyE5nVppa5mde5gT]{animate dead}</em> spell, a staple of the school of necromancy. Necromancers can cast this spell as an action, instead of over the course of 1 minute.</p><div><p>All Undead created by the <em>animate dead</em> spell (as well as any other magic, such as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.E4NXux0RHvME1XgP]{create undead}</em> spell, that allows you to control Undead) count as your thralls and can be commanded as such. If your new thralls granted to you by a spell cause you to exceed your total CR or number of thralls, you can immediately sever your connection to any of your existing thralls so as to stay within these limits. Your thralls can never command or create other Undead.</p><p>As always, you can’t reanimate Undead that have been reduced to 0 hit points. Your Animate Thralls ritual, the <em>animate dead</em> spell, and similar magic only affects Humanoid corpses, whereas your thralls are Undead creatures.</p><p>@UUID[.vGk02jpmgxkIeZ2v#variant-thralls]{Sidebar: Variant Thralls}</p><h2>Bag of Bones</h2><p>Also at 2nd level, you learn how to create a necromantic magic item, a <em>bag of bones</em>. The bag connects to a vast extradimensional space that can only hold Medium or smaller corpses, bones, and Undead creatures; it violently expels anything else placed within it. You can use an action to place a corpse or willing Undead creature into the bag, up to a maximum of ten corpses or Undead creatures, or use your action to dump the contents of the bag, which land in spaces within 5 feet of you.</p><p>You can transform any container you can carry into a <em>bag of bones</em> by performing a special ritual over the course of 1 hour while you hold it. This container ceases to be magical if you perform this ritual again to create a new <em>bag of bones</em>. The container always connects to the same extradimensional space. If the bag is placed inside an extradimensional space, such as that created by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.aDHRuUs29SrumWfq]{bag of holding}</em>, it is destroyed. Its contents remain in the same extradimensional space until you create a new bag.</p><h2>Grave Ambition</h2><p>When you reach 3rd level, you decide on a proper path of research into the dark arts in order to carve a path leading toward your ultimate goal. Choose a Grave Ambition, detailed at the end of the class. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 20th level.</p><h2>Black Arcana</h2><p>Also beginning at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to replenish your Charnel Touch pool. Your pool regains 1d8 expended points, plus 1d8 for each level of the spell slot expended, up to a maximum of your pool’s total.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2>Critical Spellcasting</h2><p>At 5th level, your potent necrotic powers punish your enemy at the first sign of weakness. When a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw against one of your spells, it automatically fails the save, and you can roll all the spell’s damage dice a second time, adding the total to the spell’s damage against that creature. The additional damage only applies to the creature that rolled a 1.</p><p>Additionally, your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p><p>Starting at 14th level, a creature automatically fails its saving throw against your spells and takes additional damage when it rolls a 1 or a 2. Additionally, your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.</p><h2>Enthralling Presence</h2><p>At 7th level, the negative energy that flows through you reinforces your thralls against those who would seek to destroy or control your servants. Your thralls and other Undead you control are immune to effects that turn Undead and can’t be forcefully controlled by another creature while you are conscious.</p><h2>Undying Servitude</h2><p>When you reach 18th level, your connection to your thralls can pull them back from the brink of destruction. When a thrall under your control is reduced to 0 hit points but not destroyed outright, you can use your reaction to restore it to half of its maximum hit points. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Lichdom</h2><p>By 20th level, you have unlocked the pinnacle of necromantic prowess, through which you will conquer death itself: The Rite of Lichdom. When you reach this level, you have completed your phylactery and are ready to undergo the rite. To do so, you shut yourself away for 30 days in an isolated location of your choice, and emerge as an immortal lich, an undead of unsurpassed power. Once the rite is complete, you gain the following benefits as well as those dictated by your choice of Grave Ambition.</p><h3>Phylactery</h3><p>A phylactery is an object that houses a lich’s soul, safeguarding its immortality. If you drop to 0 hit points, your body crumbles to dust, but your soul escapes to the phylactery. After 1d4 + 1 days, a new body coalesces as near to your phylactery as possible and you return to life (or rather, unlife). When your body reforms, you gain the benefits of a long rest. The new body is identical to the one that was destroyed.</p><h3>Undead Resilience</h3><p>You have immunity to necrotic and poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.</p><h3>Undead Traits</h3><p>You are immune to the effects of exhaustion and you don’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You must still rest for 4 hours to gain the benefits of a long rest. Though your type is Humanoid, spells and effects that specifically affect Undead affect you as well. You are immune to any effect that turns Undead.</p><p>@UUID[.vGk02jpmgxkIeZ2v#phylactery]{Sidebar: Phylactery}</p><h1>Grave Ambitions</h1><p>Becoming a necromancer is seldom an accident. Almost all who dive into the secrets of life and death do so with a purpose, a method to the madness. This ambition is what drives them into the tenebrous corners of forgotten libraries, long-abandoned tombs, and the graveyards of simple commoners. Ambition drives them further into the dark, where only the light of their end goal can lead them through the all-consuming shadows. A necromancer’s grave ambition represents the path to their ultimate goal, the lengths they’ll go to achieve it, and a source of justification for their actions, if only to themselves.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Grave Ambitions</td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#blood-ascendant]{Blood Ascendant}</td><td>Granted power from vampiric blood, without the myriad vampiric weaknesses</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#death-knight]{Death Knight}</td><td>Clad in armor, a terrible warrior brandishing dark energies and martial weapons</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#overlord]{Overlord}</td><td>A sinister manipulator backed by powerful allies</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#pale-master]{Pale Master}</td><td>Emphasizes the purest form of necromancy and brandishes devastating spells</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#pharaoh]{Pharaoh}</td><td>An echo of the ancient god-kings, a priest and necromancer in equal measure</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#plague-lord]{Plague Lord}</td><td>A necromantic disease carrier who commands vile, corpulent minions</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#reanimator]{Reanimator}</td><td>A mad scientist that stitches together new and terrible undead minions</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#reaper]{Reaper}</td><td>A furtive shadow of death, who foretells and beckons demise</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Blood Ascendant</h2><p>Necromantic might comes in many forms, but a singular, ancient source is the blood curse of vampirism. Though it promises much—immortality, agility, charm—it comes paired with insidious drawbacks, from the stinging burn of sunlight to a perpetual thirst for blood. Necromancers that wish to capture a measure of this power without suffering its myriad weaknesses perform a special ritual with vampiric blood in order to become Blood Ascendants. In doing so, they fall deathly pale and lose their reflection within mirrors, but learn to slowly pry out vampiric powers without fully succumbing to the all-devouring curse.</p><h3>Ascendant Spells</h3><p>When you choose this ambition at 3rd level, you learn additional spells as noted in the table below. Each of these spells counts as a necromancer spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of necromancer spells you know.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eS7XnnApoxRxYXPs]{charm person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{sleep}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.30ZgXtijJVCxQk5N]{enthrall}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4]{suggestion}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.6g3WLOZ2u0EbaLAd]{hypnotic pattern}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.UfHQhA54M4323gVO]{vampiric touch}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BYNvBJzHcF5VJhXw]{phantasmal killer}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.NJgxf7pmSsBArIG7]{private sanctum}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.91Sw6vOIaO7U8DvM]{dominate person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.r3243JU4AyQJyfX4]{modify memory}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Charnel Drain</h3><p>At 3rd level, you drain the essence of those you slay. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with your Charnel Touch, you regain hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your necromancer level (minimum 3).</p><h3>Vampiric Transformation</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your action and expend 15 Charnel Touch points to transform for up to 1 hour, or until you drop to 0 hit points or revert on your turn as an action. Anything you are wearing transforms with you, but objects you are carrying fall to the ground in your space. Choose one of the following transformations:</p><p><em><strong>Bat.</strong></em> You transform into a Tiny bat. While in bat form, you have all the senses of a bat, you can’t speak, your walking speed is 5 feet, and you have a flying speed of 30 feet. Your statistics, other than your size, speed, and senses, are unchanged.</p><p><em><strong>Mist.</strong></em> You transform into a Medium cloud of mist. While in mist form, you can’t speak, manipulate objects or take any actions, other than to revert to your true form. You are weightless, have a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter and occupy the space of another creature. In addition, if air can pass through a space, you can do so without squeezing, and you can’t pass through water. You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p><h3>Children of the Night</h3><p>By 10th level, the hordes of the night answer to your beck and call. When you perform your Animate Thralls ritual, you can summon one or more wolves, swarms of bats, or swarms of rats. You command these creatures as your thralls and they count as Undead for the purpose of your necromancer class features. When one of these creatures is reduced to 0 hit points or released by you, it vanishes in a cloud of mist.</p><h3>Lichdom: Nosferatu</h3><p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. You have embraced the blood curse of vampirism to become a vampire lord in all but name: a nosferatu.</p><p><em><strong>Coffin Phylactery.</strong></em> Your phylactery is a coffin filled with grave dirt. When you drop to 0 hit points, you reform in your coffin after 1 hour. You are permanently weakened until you spend 24 hours resting in the coffin. During this time, your hit point maximum is reduced to 1, and you drop to 0 hit points if you begin your turn in sunlight.</p><p><em><strong>Regeneration.</strong></em> At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points or you are in direct sunlight.</p><p><em><strong>Vampiric Agility.</strong></em> Your speed is doubled. Additionally, you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p><h2>Death Knight</h2><p>Some necromancers are content to sit in dusty tombs with moldering tomes, occasionally picking apart a battlefield for fresh ingredients and new company. By contrast, death knights are predators among scavengers, seizing their goals through a melding of magic and traditional combat. Bolstered with dark energies and sturdy armor, death knights are simultaneously the vanguard and general of their undead forces, unafraid of getting their hands dirty when necessary.</p><h3>Intensive Combat Research</h3><p>Starting when you choose this ambition at 3rd level, your body and mind are attuned to the various tools of war. You gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. Additionally, you can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.</p><h3>Charnel Strike</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, whenever you make a melee weapon attack as part of the Attack action, you can channel your Charnel Touch through the weapon. When you do so, make an attack with a melee weapon instead of a spell attack. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and it takes the necrotic damage of your Charnel Touch. You can only deal necrotic damage using this ability once per turn.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you deal damage using this ability or a Charnel Touch attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt, up to a maximum of half your total hit points.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><p>Additionally, your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p><h3>Overcharged Thralls</h3><p>At 10th level, your inner nexus of energy has spread to your thralls, turning them into your own personal pools of spare energy when the need arises. Whenever one of your thralls dies or you release it, your Charnel Touch pool regains a number of expended points equal to your necromancer level.</p><h3>Lichdom: Imperator</h3><p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. Due to your martial capabilities and potent necromantic power, you have transformed into an imperator lich—an Undead creature unmatched in both arcane and combat prowess. You gain the following features in addition to the Lichdom feature:</p><p><em><strong>Completed Combat Research.</strong></em> You gain proficiency with heavy armor if you didn’t have it already, and you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p><p><em><strong>Peerless Charnel Strike.</strong></em> The necrotic damage dealt by Charnel Touch ignores resistance and immunity to necrotic damage.</p><p>Additionally, you can gain any number of temporary hit points from your Charnel Strike, instead of a maximum of half your total hit points.</p><h2>Overlord</h2><p>Few ambitions capture the imagination more than the power to rule. Some necromancers, known as overlords, view their magic as a means to pull the strings of others as they do their undead minions. Seeking control both on and off the battlefield, overlords leverage their dark magic to bolster their allies and manipulate their foes.</p><h3>Overlord Spells</h3><p>When you choose this ambition at 3rd level, you learn additional spells as noted in the table below. Each of these spells counts as a necromancer spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of necromancer spells you know.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.95K2aUhAGV9qXjnf]{bane}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.arzCrMRgcNiQuh43]{command}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ppWAAEul0QHtm4er]{detect thoughts}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3Lo9boi7P2ro6QV4]{hold person}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Szvk5FEVQW3uhJi5]{haste}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.yqUDoxk4x0NWG5Bz]{slow}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.P6f1PPKPd9BCb742]{compulsion}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9hQXdMSmerkTsHDe]{confusion}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.91Sw6vOIaO7U8DvM]{dominate person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JQyigMNPiDnGI18b]{geas}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Charnel Boon</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can grant a boon to minions by empowering them with your own potency. As a bonus action, you can expend 5 or more points from your Charnel Touch pool to empower each of your thralls within 30 feet of you. Until the end of your next turn, those thralls gain a +1 bonus to their attack rolls, damage rolls, and AC for every 5 points expended, up to a maximum of +3.</p><h3>Despotic Discourse</h3><p>When you reach 6th level, your black magic has granted you a silver tongue, which you can use to manipulate those around you. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Charisma, for Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Intimidation), and Charisma (Persuasion) checks.</p><h3>Sacrificial Thralls</h3><p>At 10th level, you can force your thralls to sacrifice themselves to ensure your own safety. When you are targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction to change the target of the attack to one of your thralls instead. The thrall must be within the attack’s range or reach.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t do so until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Lichdom: Tyrant</h3><p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. Your desire for control has warped you into a tyrant lich. Your flesh and bone rapidly decay, reducing your features to nothing more than two glowing dots beneath your hood. You gain the following features in addition to the Lichdom feature:</p><p><em><strong>Immortal Rule.</strong></em> If you drop to 0 hit points, you can choose to possess a nearby body, instead of beginning the process of reforming at your phylactery. When you do so, choose an unconscious Humanoid or the corpse of one that has died within the last minute that is within 120 feet of you to possess (a creature warded by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{protection from evil and good}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.y8A4HfTwd93ypdEz]{magic circle}</em> spell can’t be possessed).</p><p>Once you possess a body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. If the body has 0 hit points when you possess it, its type becomes Undead and it regains 50 hit points, up to its hit point maximum. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.</p><p>If you possess the body of an unconscious creature, the creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC after 8 hours, and it repeats the save every 8 hours thereafter until the effect ends. On a success, you are ejected from the body and begin the process of reforming at your phylactery. You are also ejected if the body dies or you choose to leave it as an action. Once you’ve possessed a creature in this way, you can’t possess it again using this feature.</p><p><em><strong>Tyrant’s Influence.</strong></em> You can expend 25 points from your Charnel Touch pool to cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LrPvWHBPmiMQQsKB]{dominate beast}</em> without expending a spell slot. You can also expend 30 points to cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.91Sw6vOIaO7U8DvM]{dominate person}</em>, or 60 points to cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eEpy1ONlXumKS1mp]{dominate monster}</em> without expending a spell slot.</p><h2>Pale Master</h2><p>When the need for superiority drives a necromancer, there is no end to their ambition. Such necromancers, known as pale masters, work feverishly to master every corner of necromantic magic, less out of the desire to improve themselves and more out of spite for their rivals.</p><p>This perhaps speaks to a dirty secret of necromancy: most necromancers hate each other. Bitter rivalries, grudges, and insignificant slights motivate pale masters to embrace lichdom with unequaled fervor, for to master necromancy means to accept no equals.</p><h3>Pale Master Spells</h3><p>When you choose this ambition at 3rd level, you learn additional spells as noted in the table below.

When you deal damage with a necromancy spell of 1st level or higher, you can expend a number of Charnel Touch points up to your necromancer level + your Intelligence modifier. When you do so, one of the spell’s targets of your choice takes extra necrotic damage equal to the number of points expended.</p><h3>Frightening Gaze</h3><p>At 6th level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill, if you didn’t have it already.</p><p>Additionally, you can expend 10 Charnel Touch points as a bonus action to fix your horrific gaze on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><h3>Thrall Rush</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, whenever you roll initiative and aren’t surprised, you can command each of your thralls to either move up to its speed or make one attack.</p><h3>Lichdom: Archlich</h3><p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. Your skin clings tightly to your bones, your muscles wither, and your eyes turn milky and dull. Yet, through the veil of weakness, your body exudes unbelievable arcane power. You gain the following features in addition to the Lichdom feature:</p><p><em><strong>Devour Soul.</strong></em> When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you can immediately devour the creature’s soul to refuel your horrific powers (no action required). Roll a d8 and regain expended spell slots of your choice whose combined level is no greater than the number rolled. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>A creature whose soul is devoured can’t be restored to life by any means short of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY]{true resurrection}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{wish}</em> spell.</p><p><em><strong>Paralyzing Touch.</strong></em> When you hit with a Charnel Touch attack and expend 20 or more points, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><h2>Pharaoh</h2><p>The god-kings of ancient kingdoms practiced a unique style of necromancy, forgotten to time. Through the extraction of organs, the desiccation of flesh, and innumerable enchantments, those ancient kings were able to rule their subjects as divine, undead beings, long past their mortal deaths. While those kingdoms have been lost to the shifting sands and wild jungles of the world, their methods have been preserved in the carvings of colossal temples and revived by modern necromancers, who take on the guise of the erstwhile pharaohs. Their magic is a hybrid of divine and arcane influences, the legacy of god-kings from a forgotten age.</p><h3>Pharaoh Spells</h3><p>When you choose this ambition at 3rd level, you learn additional spells as noted in the table below. Each of these spells counts as a necromancer spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of necromancer spells you know. New spells are marked with an asterisk.</p><p>Additionally, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MUO1uYN7JR1hm4dR]{thaumaturgy}</em> cantrip, which is a necromancer spell for you and doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8dzaICjGy6mTUaUr]{bless}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7buEm5KhI5lP8m1z]{guiding bolt}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.6peH8olYNkDLlmRZ]{halo of flame},* @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify}, @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.I3nQcRiC9kV9YW9e]{snakestaff}*</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{death ward}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9]{divination}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.OVikYmSdHliAG2YD]{insect plague}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Holy Symbol</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells.</p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can channel your pseudo-divinity to fuel magical effects. You start with one effect: <em>Ankh of Radiance</em>. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Additionally, you can expend 15 Charnel Touch points as an action to regain one expended use of your Channel Divinity.</p><p><em><strong>Ankh of Radiance.</strong></em> As an action, you can brandish your holy symbol and bless a number of willing creatures up to your Intelligence modifier that you can see within 60 feet of you with holy radiance, which lasts for 1 minute. The first time a blessed creature takes damage, it has resistance to that damage. If it took damage from a melee weapon attack, the attacker takes 1d6 radiant damage. The blessing then ends for that creature.</p><p>The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p><h3>Mock Divinity</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can convincingly reflect the trappings of a demigod walking the earth. You can create the following additional effects when using the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MUO1uYN7JR1hm4dR]{thaumaturgy}</em> cantrip:</p><ul><li>You can brighten or darken the sun or moon, affecting the area within 120 feet of you for up to 1 minute. You can change darkness to dim light and dim light to bright light, or vice versa. Additionally, you can heighten bright light to a blazing radiance, which causes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks which rely on sight, or you can deepen darkness to a pitch black, which limits darkvision to a 30-foot radius. This deeper darkness has no effect on creatures that can see in magical darkness.</li><li>You manifest a Huge illusory avatar of a deity at a point you can see within 120 feet of you, which mimics your movements and projects your speech in a booming voice for 1 minute.</li></ul><h3>Channel Divinity: Scarab of Judgement</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to transfer life from the undead to the living. As an action, you can touch an Undead creature you control and choose a willing Humanoid you can see within 60 feet of you. The Undead is destroyed and reduced to dust, and the Humanoid regains hit points equal to the Undead’s hit points. Once a creature regains hit points in this way, it can’t do so again until it finishes a long rest.</p><h3>Lichdom: God-King</h3><p>At 20th level, you undergo the ancient funeral rites of the pharaohs, removing your organs and entombing your body in a sarcophagus amongst your worldly possessions. You become the oldest and most exalted type of lich: a god-king. You gain the following features in addition to the Lichdom feature:</p><p><em><strong>Canopic Phylacteries.</strong></em> Your phylactery has also changed with your transformation. Your stomach, lungs, intestines, and liver have been removed and placed into canopic jars. Each one has a specific weakness, which you will need to discuss with your GM, and your regeneration is only stopped when all four canopic jars are destroyed. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you reform at your sarcophagus.</p><p><em><strong>Mummy Rot.</strong></em> When you hit with a Charnel Touch attack and expend 20 or more points, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 3d6 for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or other magic.</p><p><em><strong>Whirlwind of Sand.</strong></em> As an action, you can magically transform into a whirlwind of sand, move up to 60 feet, and revert to your normal form. While in whirlwind form, you are immune to all damage, and you can’t be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned. Equipment you are wearing or carrying remains in your possession.</p><h2>Plague Lord</h2><p>Throughout history, unchecked plagues have toppled kingdoms and caused empires to crumble. Necromancers that realize the potential within sickness become plague lords, commanders of vermin and disease alike. Armed with a virulent touch and an army of infected vermin and thralls, plague lords spread filth to every corner of the world. Their fevers, chills, and poxes create fresh corpses for the hoard, making for an unending supply of undead.</p><h3>Charnel Toxin</h3><p>At 3rd level, even your touch can cause sickness. When you hit with a Charnel Touch attack and expend 5 or more points, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned until the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Vile Congregation</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, leagues of vermin cling to your skin and swarm over others nearby. Whenever a hostile creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack roll or saving throw, you can roll a d4 and subtract the result from its attack roll or saving throw. This ability has no effect on Constructs or Undead.</p><h3>Projectile Spew</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, your own inner nexus of power has become a volatile cocktail of disease, allowing your spells to have a far greater reach. You can reach creatures up to 15 feet away from you with your Charnel Touch feature and spells with a range of touch, as you use magically imbued projectile vomit to deliver your payload.</p><h3>Bloated Thralls</h3><p>At 10th level, your thralls have become hives of vermin and disease, ready to burst at any moment. When one of your thralls is reduced to 0 hit points or you release it, you can choose to cause it to explode in a shower of poison, gore, and vermin. Each creature within 5 feet of the thrall, other than you and your other thralls, must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.</p><h3>Lichdom: Corpulent Lich</h3><p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. Your obsession with disease and rot has affected your transformation: your body engorges, much like a waterlogged corpse, and your skin turns a sickly green. You gain the following features in addition to the Lichdom feature:</p><p><em><strong>Gore Burst.</strong></em> When you drop to 0 hit points, your body explodes in a shower of plague and necromantic energy. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and 5d10 poison damage and is poisoned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.</p><p><em><strong>Master of Disease.</strong></em> When you use your Charnel Toxin feature and expend 25 or more points, the creature is poisoned and cursed for up to 1 minute on a failed save. Choose two of the following effects which afflict the target while it is cursed:</p><ul><li>Choose one ability score. The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.</li><li>The target can only see out to a radius of 10 feet.</li><li>The target falls prone at the end of each of its turns.</li><li>The target loses an extra 1d6 hit points whenever it takes damage.</li><li>The target can speak only in a babbling nonsense language and can’t perform the verbal components of spells.</li></ul><p>At the end of each of its turns, the target makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, ending the curse and the poisoned condition on a success.</p><h2>Reanimator</h2><p>Through bubbling test tubes and sparking electrodes, you have discovered the true heart of necromancy: mad science. You’ve experimented in far-reaching disciplines of surgery, alchemy, and physics, using your animated minions as gruesome test subjects and walking surgical dummies. Most crucially, you have discovered that lightning can imbue almost anything with a semblance of life, from the smallest severed muscle to the most towering and soulless golems.</p><h3>Skilled Surgeon</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this ambition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill, if you didn’t already have it. You can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Wisdom, for Wisdom (Medicine) checks.</p><h3>Mad Science</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can spend 10 minutes installing a monstrous graft on one of your thralls that doesn’t have the Incorporeal Movement trait. Additionally, your thralls don’t lose hit points or Hit Dice from the installation or removal of grafts, and it takes them no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft. See Appendix C for @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.journals.JournalEntry.tbpIhS1BGMCaTkeL]{monstrous grafts}.</p><h3>Charnel Voltage</h3><p>At 3rd level, you supplement your necromantic energies with arcing bolts of electricity. You can choose to deal lightning damage instead of necrotic damage with your Charnel Touch. When you hit with a Charnel Touch attack that deals lightning damage and expends 5 or more points, you can cause the energy to arc to a second creature within 5 feet of the target. The second creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking lightning damage equal to half the number of Charnel Touch points expended on a failed save.</p><h3>Lazarus Bolt</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, as an action, you can drive a bolt into the torso of a creature within 5 feet of you that has died within the last minute and shock it back to life. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This feature can’t return a creature to life if it lacks a heart, has died of old age, or is missing vital organs. Once this creature returns to life, you can restore hit points to it using your Charnel Touch for 1 minute, as if the creature were Undead.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Arcane Stitching</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you’ve learned how to inscribe magical effects on your thralls using gruesome arcane stitches. You can expend 10 points from your Charnel Touch pool to apply an arcane stitch to one of your thralls in a process requiring 1 minute of work with a needle and thread. Only one of your thralls can have arcane stitches applied to it, and that thrall can only have one of each type of stitch.</p><p>A thrall can activate its arcane stitches to gain benefits in combat. An arcane stitch lasts until your thrall activates it, your thrall is killed, or you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can apply the following stitches to one of your thralls.</p><p><em><strong>Augmented Incision.</strong></em> The thrall gains advantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its turn (no action required).</p><p><em><strong>Bulwark Backstitch.</strong></em> The thrall casts the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.z1mx84ONwkXKUZd7]{shield}</em> when it is hit by an attack.</p><p><em><strong>Fleet Threads.</strong></em> The thrall’s speed is tripled until the end of its turn (no action required).</p><p><em><strong>Voltaic Suture.</strong></em> When the thrall hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 3d6 lightning or necrotic damage (your choice).</p><h3>Lichdom: Patchwork Golem</h3><p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. Through abominable works of alchemy and surgery, you have constructed yourself an artificial body to act as the vessel for your soul.</p><p><em><strong>Golem Form.</strong></em> Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 20 if they weren’t already higher, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t adamantine. Additionally, you don’t lose hit points or Hit Dice from installing or removing grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft.</p><p><em><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p><h2>Reaper</h2><p>The oblivion of death is the wellspring necromancy, a dark abyss into which all necromancers stare. Those rare necromancers that gamble with their own souls might become reapers, figures of shadow and demise that beckon others to the afterlife. For performing this deed, they strengthen their connection to the distant oblivion, until they are but tenebrous shadows: harbingers of an inevitable end.</p><h3>Reaper Spells</h3><p>When you choose this ambition at 3rd level, you learn additional spells as noted in the table below. Each of these spells counts as a necromancer spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of necromancer spells you know.

When you hit with a Charnel Touch attack and expend 5 or more points, you become invisible until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if you move 15 feet or more.</p><h3>Umbral Form</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can flatten your body into a shadow upon the floor.</p><p>As a shadow, your movement speed doubles and you gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed. You can move across difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. As a shadow, you can only move along surfaces; you can’t jump or fly.</p><p>Attacks against you have disadvantage while you are in shadow form. In darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.</p><p>As a shadow, you can’t take actions. Your equipment merges with your shadow form and has no effect until you leave the form.</p><p>You can end this effect as a bonus action or when you start your turn (no action required).</p><h3>Wraith Flight</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, spirits you command move with an unearthly speed. The flying speeds of your thralls are doubled. Additionally, when one of your thralls flies out of an enemy’s reach, opportunity attacks against it are made with disadvantage.</p><h3>Lichdom: Grim Reaper</h3><p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. You have become an embodiment of death itself, a harbinger of the ultimate end. Clad in shadows, you seem little more than a grim skeletal presence in a foreboding robe, a sight which all men fear to behold.</p><p><em><strong>Death’s Touch.</strong></em> When you use your Charnel Touch against a creature you can see and roll an 11 or higher on the d20 for the attack roll, you hit the target, regardless of its AC.</p><p><em><strong>Fell Flight.</strong></em> You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Grim Harvest.</strong></em> When you kill a Humanoid using Charnel Touch, you rip their soul from their body, which animates as a visage under your control, which counts as one of your thralls.</p><h1>Undead Thralls</h1><p>Necromancers use the following creatures as their thralls: bonebeasts, gorgers, gravetouched ghouls, skeletons, spirits, visages, and zombies.

If you’d like to throw caution to the wind and embrace the undead horde experience, use this variant rule.</p><p>Ignore the “Animate Dead” section in the Thralls feature. Animated undead from spells are separate from your thralls for the purposes of your class features, but have no other class-based limitations.</p><h2>Variant Thralls</h2><p>With the GM’s permission, Undead raised using the Animate Thralls ritual can be of types other than Humanoids. Such thralls might use existing Undead statistics (such as various <strong>skeletons</strong>, <strong>zombies</strong>, or <strong>spirits</strong>) when appropriate, or might use thrall statistics with variant weapons, AC, or traits.</p><h2>Phylactery</h2><p>A lich’s phylactery is as much a memento as it is their anchor to immortality, and as such, no two are alike. Phylacteries are often constructed from objects with sentimental value, such as family heirlooms or prized possessions, but can be fashioned from swords, pieces of armor, or even entire castles.</p><p>Furthermore, every phylactery has a weakness, a critical flaw by which it can be destroyed, allowing its lich to be slain permanently. These weaknesses, too, are unique to each phylactery. One phylactery might require a ritual to be performed around it for 24 hours, while another might call for the phylactery to be dipped in the lava of an active volcano. Discuss with your GM the form your phylactery takes and what weakness it possesses.</p><h2>Many Thralls</h2><p>When you have three or more thralls under your command of the same type, you can roll a single attack on a particular target for all your thralls, instead of rolling attacks separately. If this attack hits, you treat all your thralls as having hit; if this misses, all your thralls’ attacks miss. Thralls with different Action statistics and those that make attacks against different targets must roll separately.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Roleplaying games have a storied tradition of home rules concocted by GMs and players to mold the game to their preferences. Sometimes, these home rules are so prevalent that they become baked into later editions, whereas other times, they’re mere quality of life improvements. This chapter presents a selection of variant rules that you can introduce in your game, plucked from the most popular and functional home rules. Each addresses a common complaint by players or GMs, and all are completely optional. Feel free to use them in conjunction with any other rules modifications you desire.</p><h2>Quality of Life</h2><p>The following variant rules are employed by good and merciful GMs the world over.</p><h3>Reroll for Hit Points</h3><p>If you opt to roll for hit points when gaining a level, you can reroll 1s on Hit Dice. You can reroll again if the new roll is also a 1 until you get a different number.</p><h3>Ignore Ammunition</h3><p>You don’t have to keep track of nonmagical ammunition, such as arrows and crossbow bolts.</p><h3>Ignore Food</h3><p>Except in cases where the narrative emphasizes survival as a key element, you don’t have to keep track of food and water.</p><h3>Streamlined Treasure</h3><p>Instead of recording varying amounts of copper, silver, and platinum coinage and making exhaustive lists of nonmagical treasure, you can convert all of your treasure directly into gold pieces. You can choose to keep certain items, such as diamonds and other gemstones, in their original form to serve as material components for spells.</p><h3>Take Ten</h3><div><p>If you have the luxury of taking as long as you need to accomplish a task without being threatened or distracted, you can “take ten.” Doing so requires ten minutes longer than the ability check would normally take, but allows you to use your passive score for the ability check instead of rolling. As a reminder, your passive score equals 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check, adding 5 for advantage and subtracting 5 for disadvantage. The GM says whether you can take ten on any individual check; for example, socially interacting with a creature might not always be applicable.</p><h3>Choose to Fail</h3></div><div><div><div><p>You can choose to miss any attack roll or fail any ability check or saving throw you make without rolling.</p><h3>Summoning Initiative</h3><p>When a spell or feature says that you roll initiative for a creature under your control, you can choose for that creature to take its turn immediately after yours, instead of rolling for initiative separately.</p><h2>Alternate Spellcasters</h2><p>Many times, a character concept will come to mind that fits the features and traits of a class, but not the ability scores central to that class. For example, a bard whose inspiration stems from study and learning rather than music or charm, or a paladin whose fervor and zeal are tempered by a lifetime in service to their cause. Such characters might favor abilities contrary to those primary to their spellcasting ability score, and can use this variant rule to retrofit their mechanical elements to meet their narrative needs.</p><p>You can exchange your character’s spellcasting ability score for another one. Any class feature which uses the spellcasting ability score is similarly switched. Doing so not only influences the character’s mechanics, but also changes the class’s name into something more suited to its variant magical origins, as shown on the Alternate Spellcasters table below.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"4\">Alternate Spellcasters</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Class</td><td>Intelligence</td><td>Wisdom</td><td>Charisma</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"><em>Mage Hand Press Classes</em></td></tr><tr><td>Investigator</td><td>—</td><td>Arbiter</td><td>Factotum</td></tr><tr><td>Martyr</td><td>Apologist</td><td>—</td><td>Prophet</td></tr><tr><td>Necromancer</td><td>—</td><td>Resurrectionist</td><td>Ghoul</td></tr><tr><td>Warmage</td><td>—</td><td>Battlepriest</td><td>Firebrand</td></tr><tr><td>Witch</td><td>Maledictor</td><td>Shaman</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"><em>Core Classes</em></td></tr><tr><td>Bard</td><td>Chronicler</td><td>Skald</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric</td><td>Archivist</td><td>—</td><td>Evangelist</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>Haruspex</td><td>—</td><td>Totemist</td></tr><tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Inquisitor</td><td>Templar</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Explorer</td><td>—</td><td>Drifter</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>Magus</td><td>Mystic</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Warlock</td><td>Cultist</td><td>Medium</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Wizard</td><td>—</td><td>Oracle</td><td>Magician</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><p></p><h2>Level Zero</h2><p>Many adventures begin from the premise that the player characters are average commoners until events of the plot drive them to heroism. Despite the storytelling advantages and the popularity of this general plot, it’s quite challenging to implement. Even first level characters are assumed to already have heroic dispositions and extraordinary skills: fighters are exceptional in their fighting skills, rogues are exceptional thieves, and clerics are exceptional priests. Use this variant rule to present truly unremarkable zeroth-level characters.</p><p>Your character has a race and background, but no class levels. At 0th level, your proficiency bonus is +1 and you have a number of hit points equal to 4 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). You have no Hit Dice.</p><p>When you gain 100 experience points, you advance to 1st level. Your character’s hit points improve according to your class.</p><h2>The Coin</h2><p>Players rightfully become frustrated when their d20 rolls fall just short of meeting the number required for most of a gaming session. To remedy this common inconvenience, you can introduce this variant rule.</p><p>The players have a special coin they can choose to flip before or after they make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Any player can use the coin. On tails, add a +1 bonus to the roll. On heads, add a +4 bonus to the roll.</p><p>Once this coin is flipped, it is given to the GM, who can use it at any time to improve a roll made by a monster or NPC, passing it back to the players once it has been flipped.</p><h2>Luck Pool</h2><p>Few things are more frustrating to players than rolling terribly when their characters are in life-or-death combat with a lich, only to suddenly roll 20s when engaged in mundane History or Perception checks. Use this variant rule to “bank” good rolls for when they matter.</p><p>When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an ability check outside of combat, you can ask the GM to store the roll in your Luck Pool for later. The GM should typically approve this only if the check was trivial with a low DC. If the GM approves, you gain a point in your Luck Pool, which you can spend at any time to replace a d20 roll with a 20 instead of rolling it. Replacing an attack roll with a 20 in this way doesn’t result in a critical hit. At the end of the gaming session, all points in your Luck Pool are lost.</p><h2>Round-Table Initiative</h2><div><p>Keeping track of initiative can be tedious. Because initiative orders are basically random, players can’t easily plan their moves during the preceding turn and the GM can outright forget turns. To remedy this, in-person games can use this variant rule.</p><p>Players roll initiative as normal and the GM rolls once for each group of monsters. The character or monster with the highest initiative roll goes first, and turns proceed around the table in the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) that arrives most quickly at the player with the second highest initiative. The GM counts as a player at the table for the purposes of initiative, and monsters act when the GM takes their turn. If the GM chooses, a secondary group of monsters can act between two players at the far end of the table.</p></div><div><h2>Speed Dice</h2><p>By the time the cleric has finished rereading their prepared spell cards, figured out exactly where to move, cast two spells, and asked the GM for clarification on a trivial detail, everyone else at the table has fallen asleep in their chairs. You can encourage faster play with larger groups and foster more attentive players with this variant rule.</p><p>If a player decides on their action, bonus action, and movement, and rolls all the relevant dice in under a minute, they can add a d6 to the first damage roll they make on their turn. Time spent describing actions to the GM, as well as the GM’s responses, don’t count against this time. In-person games can pass around a 1-minute countdown timer with initiative, whereas turns in online games can be timed by the GM. An oversized d6 used for the damage roll can help remind players about the damage bonus.</p><h2>Campfire Stories</h2><p>Along their journeys, the heroes will often stop, light a campfire, and rest. Such a respite isn’t just to rest the body, but to pacify the mind. Dungeoneering is dangerous, stressful work, after all, and spending some time relaxing among friends goes a long way to keeping the heroes healthy and sane. Use this variant rule to capitalize on this time to flesh out character backstories.</p><p>When you take a long rest, the GM can call for campfire stories. You can opt to tell a story from your character’s past (told from your character’s perspective) to the other players at the table. Other players can respond with a story from their characters’ pasts. Each character who participates gains inspiration. If you already have inspiration, you regain all expended Hit Dice instead.</p><h2>Swift Potions</h2><p>Wise adventurers stock up on <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{potions of healing}</em> before heading off on a dangerous expedition, but experienced players know that such potions are mostly useless during combat unless someone is actively dying. To make potions a little more useful, use this variant rule: you can drink a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{potion of healing}</em> as a bonus action, instead of as an action. Administering a potion to another creature still requires an action.</p><h2>d6 Death Saving Throws</h2><p>A dying character is circling the drain of imminent death, yet death always arrives slowly, if at all. To ratchet up the tension around death saving throws, use this variant rule.</p><p>Instead of rolling a d20 for death saving throws, roll [[/r 3d6]]. Each 6 rolled on a die counts as a success and each 1 counts as a failure; as normal, you die if you accumulate 3 failures and you stabilize if you accumulate 3 successes. If you gain your third failure and third success at the same time, you stabilize.</p><h2>Near-Death</h2><p>Even when the narrative would demand otherwise, the dice can turn foul and brave adventurers can lie dead, long before their time. Use this variant rule to give players some additional control over death.</p><p>When you die in combat, the GM asks you whether you’d like to instead survive and continue your character’s story. If you choose to, you instead suffer a grievous, permanent wound and stabilize. The GM decides the severity and effects of the wound. For instance, your character might lose an entire leg as a minotaur rips you asunder, or you might lose one eye (or even both) to a wickedly-aimed spell. This wound can later be magically remedied through a regenerate spell, patched through the use of monstrous grafts, or simply endured through the use of aids like wheelchairs and crutches.</p><h2>Junk Economy</h2><p>This variant rule offers a convenient excuse as to why players and GMs alike can avoid the most tedious parts of adventuring. During the course of a standard adventure, the GM assumes that the characters strip the environment of all unremarkable treasure, such as the weapons of fallen enemies and particularly nice furniture. This treasure is sold to cover the characters’ lifestyle expenses, including food, accommodations, and travel. Unless something noteworthy to the story happens, these interactions and sales should go completely unstated and provide no meaningful income to the characters.</p><h2>Pets</h2><p>Some characters will spontaneously acquire one, two, or a dozen small pets throughout the course of an adventure. Use this variant rule to guide and encourage their adoption habits.</p><p>If you purchase a trained Tiny Beast or train a wild one to be friendly to you, you can adopt it as a pet. The time required and difficulty of training a pet varies by the type of Beast, as determined by the GM. With the GM’s permission, pets might also include creatures of other types, such as Monstrosities and Fey creatures.</p><p>Your pets act independently of you, but always obey your commands. When you roll initiative, you can temporarily dismiss your pets, moving them to a safe pocket dimension or a nearby but safe location. As an action, you can cause one or more of your pets to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. In combat, your pets each take a turn immediately after yours instead of rolling for initiative. A pet can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p><h2>Alternate Inspiration</h2><p>Few GMs have the bandwidth to keep track of everything, and one of the first elements to fall off their plate is giving out inspiration. Use any of the following variant rules to streamline inspiration and keep it actively used in the game.</p><h3>Free Inspiration</h3><p>You get inspiration at the start of every gaming session. The GM can still award inspiration as normal throughout the session.</p><h3>Player-Claimed Inspiration</h3><p>Write down your personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws on index cards. Whenever you do something in keeping with one of these cards, you reveal it with a flourish and claim inspiration. The GM doesn’t approve the inspiration; the claim acts on the honor system, or can be rejected by the other players with a majority vote if you make a claim in bad faith.</p><p>The GM can still award inspiration as normal throughout the session.</p><h3>Flashback Inspiration</h3><p>You can expend inspiration to recall a short scene from the past that influences the present. Perhaps you purchased the right item for this occasion, or arranged a carriage to arrive at precisely this moment. You can’t change or remove elements of a scene—for example, flashing back to poisoning a city guard’s drink, thereby killing them—but you can introduce new elements that weren’t there moments ago.</p></div>"

In the smoke and vapor above the pot, the trio can make out shapes and figures of great import, and one cackles loudly at what she sees.</p><p>A young girl sits underneath a tree, far from where the other children play. She glances about to make sure no one is watching, and snaps her fingers once to the empty air. After a moment of silence, a black cat appears around the tree’s bend and locks eyes with the girl, staring with a strange intelligence for a long moment. She gestures at one of the playing children, a heavyset boy with a permanently affixed scowl; the cat understands. It wanders close to the boy, stretches its claws, and gets very low, ready to pounce for the boy’s eyes.</p><p>A young elf intently mutters something under his breath each time he exhales. Visible only to him, a string of the foulest magic winds out from him and seizes a charging orc, which drops to its knees in agony.</p><p>Witches are stricken by magic so dark it imprints a lasting shadow upon their essence. Through force of personality alone, they can spin this darkness outward, hexing creatures, casting manipulative spells, and even commanding a familiar with their thoughts.</p><h2>Cursed</h2><p>While others are blessed with magic, witches are cursed by it. Afflicted by some hateful arcana, whether accidentally or intentionally, witches are twisted inside and out by its daily tortures. With grueling effort, they can warp this power into spells to wrack others with the same torment that plagues them.</p><h2>Pariahs and Outcasts</h2><p>Almost without exception, witches are feared and hated. They are victim to a number of misconceptions, usually relating them to hags and other evil creatures of the night. As a result, known witches are in great personal danger and can usually be found dwelling on the outskirts of civilization where townsfolk seldom tread. This does little to stop witch hunting and burnings, but provides some measure of safety from them.</p><p>In reality, very few choose to become witches, and many of them can hide adeptly in society, using their magic to fill a number of roles, from seer, to healer, to apothecary. Being accused as a witch carries grave consequences, no matter the validity of the claim, so wise witches relocate frequently, never residing in one place for too long.</p><h2>Familiar Masters</h2><p>It is rare to find a witch without their constant companion, the familiar. Though familiars might be conjured by other spellcasters as well, a witch’s familiar is ubiquitous to common folk for good reason. Witches command intuitive magic, and have a deep link to their familiars. As a result, they can conjure more exotic familiars, and command them more swiftly than other spellcasters.</p><h2>Creating a Witch</h2><p>Creating a witch necessarily involves a powerful, malicious curse in your backstory. Who cast it? Did you take a curse upon yourself for power? Was your entire lineage cursed generations ago, leading to a bloodline of witches, or did another spellcaster use sinister, forbidden magic to curse you for life? Decide on the nature of your witch’s curse and think about how you relate to it. Do you feel like the curse was secretly a blessing, or does the desire for vengeance burn in your heart?</p><p>What negative effects does the curse leverage on your personality and mind? Are you haunted by spirits, or is your mind plagued by destructive thoughts? How do you feel manipulating the power of this curse outwards into hexes and spells?</p><p>Work with your GM to determine how witches are perceived in the world. Are they feared, burned, and persecuted? Are you an openly known witch? Do the other characters in your party know of your witchhood? Some witches keep the source of their magic a secret, or claim to be wizards or sorcerers to conceal the true darkness of their magic.</p><p>@UUID[.dUlsddbxLtDnpQZh#male-and-female-witches]{Sidebar: Male and Female Witches}</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>To build a witch quickly, make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

know four cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.</p><h3>Spell Slots</h3><p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your witch spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <em>bane</em> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <em>bane</em> using either slot.</p><h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice.</p><p>Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells. Your magic originates deep within yourself, where your insidious curse stirs restlessly. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><h3>Ritual Casting</h3><p>You can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells.</p><h2>Witch's Curse</h2><p>You are wracked by a terrible curse, which infects your body and soul. At 1st level, choose the form that this curse takes from the options below.</p><p><em><strong>Burned.</strong></em> Almost all of your body has been scorched by arcane flames, leaving you with striking black scars and embers of magic that burn under the skin. As a result, you have resistance to fire damage, and you know the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eCPQuQkIabFKTl9u]{produce flame}</em> cantrip, which doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p><em><strong>Drowned.</strong></em> Water fills your lungs, and yet you do not die. You can breathe air and water. Additionally, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p><em><strong>Feral.</strong></em> Through your curse, you have forgotten the manners and customs of civilized men and gone to live among beasts in the wild. You have proficiency in the Survival skill. Additionally, while you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Hideous.</strong></em> Your appearance is ghastly to behold. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. When you roll initiative, you can choose one Humanoid you can see to scare. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Hollow.</strong></em> Your soul has been divorced from your body, trapping you in a limbo between life and death. When you or your familiar reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you drain some of its life force, gaining temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your witch level (minimum of 1).</p><p><em><strong>Infested.</strong></em> You are constantly followed by vermin, like insects and rats, which crawl on your skin and swarm in your wake. As a result, you are immune to disease.</p><p>Additionally, you can command these pests as your own. Starting at 2nd level, you can choose the form of a swarm of rats for your familiar. Starting at 7th level, you can choose a swarm of insects.</p><p><em><strong>Loveless.</strong></em> You are cursed to never find true love. Jaded and disaffected, not even magic can turn your heart; as a result, you are immune to being charmed.</p><p><em><strong>Possessed.</strong></em> Your soul is occupied by a foreign spirit that sometimes tries to wrest away your consciousness. However, while you sleep, the spirit whispers magical secrets to you. You learn an additional witch spell at a level for which you have spell slots at 1st level, and again at 4th level, 8th level, and 12th level. These spells don’t count against your number of spells known.</p><p><em><strong>Starving.</strong></em> No matter how much you eat, food turns to ash in your mouth. Your curse nourishes you, but only at the edge of starvation, and you are constantly wracked by pangs of hunger. You don’t need to eat or drink, but can still imbibe and benefit from potions. Additionally, you are immune to the poisoned condition.</p><p><em><strong>Visions.</strong></em> You are cursed to have terrible visions of the future, presaging the death of your friends, family, and yourself. Though many of these visions are cruel deceptions, they are sometimes grimly accurate. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Whispers.</strong></em> Unseen voices murmur in your ears at all times. As such, you can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathy, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</p><h2>Hexes</h2><p>You can learn a number of powerful incantations, known as hexes, derived from the same insidious magic that cursed you.</p><p>At 1st level, you gain two hexes of your choice. Your hex options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain additional hexes of your choice, as shown in the Hexes Known column of the Witch table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the hexes you know and replace it with another hex.</p><p>Unless otherwise stated, if a hex requires an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack modifier and spell save DC. All hexes require either verbal or somatic components (your choice at the time of casting the hex).</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, if a hex lasts for a duration, you concentrate on it as you would a spell. You lose your concentration on a hex if you cast another hex; however, you can concentrate on a hex and a spell at the same time, making only one Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both.</p><h2>Cackle</h2><p>At 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to cackle. Doing so extends the duration of a hex on which you are concentrating by 1 round. If the hex has one or more targets, a target must be within 60 feet of you for the hex’s duration to extend for it.</p><p>Not all witches laugh maniacally when they cackle, but all cackles require a verbal component, as if casting a spell. These range from mundane curses and insults, to the murmuring of dead languages and speaking backwards.</p><h2>Familiar</h2><p>At 2nd level, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{find familiar}</em> spell and can cast it as a ritual without expending material components. This spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. The spell is improved in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Your familiar takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice).</li><li>Once on each of your turns as an action or a bonus action, you can mentally command your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack.</li><li>You can use the <em>find familiar</em> spell to deliver spells that have ranges other than touch through your familiar.</li><li>When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: <strong>death snail</strong>,* <strong>flying book</strong>,* <strong>homunculus</strong>, <strong>mock</strong>,* <strong>moon jelly</strong>,* <strong>pet rock</strong>,* <strong>pseudodragon</strong>, <strong>rag doll</strong>,* <strong>sprite</strong>, <strong>tin soldier</strong>,* <strong>winter wolf pup</strong>,* and <strong>yarn golem</strong>.* The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk can be found in Appendix B.</li></ul><p>@UUID[.dUlsddbxLtDnpQZh#witch-familiar]{Sidebar: Witch Familiar}</p><h2>Witch's Craft</h2><p>Your skill in magic has culminated in learning a craft, an innate variety of magic that exists apart from the schools of magic. When you reach 3rd level, choose one Witch’s Craft. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p><p>If your craft grants you a hex at any level, it doesn’t count against your number of hexes known.</p><h3>Craft Spells</h3><p>Each craft is associated with a branch of arcana, represented by a number of spells that you learn. The levels of these spells are noted in the craft description. These spells count as witch spells for you but don’t count against your number of spells known.</p><h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2><p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p><h2>Insidious Spell</h2><p>Starting at 5th level, when you cast a witch spell that affects a creature that is under the effect of your hex, that creature has disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell. This feature only applies to a hostile creature that is the sole target of your hex.</p><h2>Improved Familiar</h2><p>At 7th level, your familiar’s attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Additionally, you can choose the following forms for your familiar: <strong>brass dragon wyrmling</strong> (can’t use its breath weapon), <strong>fright</strong>,* <strong>grep</strong>,* <strong>imp</strong>, or <strong>quasit</strong>. The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk can be found in Appendix B.</p><h2>Dying Curse</h2><p>Beginning at 9th level, when a creature reduces you to 0 hit points but doesn’t kill you outright, you can lay a nefarious curse upon it. The creature is cursed for up to 24 hours. While cursed, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. If you regain consciousness or the creature is targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell, the curse ends at the end of the creature’s next turn.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Grand Hex</h2><p>By 11th level, you have perfected deeply malevolent forms of magic. You learn one grand hex, and you learn another at 13th, 15th, and 18th level. Grand hexes are detailed at the end of the class description.</p><h2>Hexmaster</h2><p>By 20th level, you have mastered your foul magic. Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against your hexes and grand hexes.</p><h1>Hexes</h1><p>The hexes below are presented in alphabetical order.</p><p>@UUID[.dUlsddbxLtDnpQZh#hexes-and-magic]{Sidebar: Hexes and Magic}</p><h3>Abate</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Apathy</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, until the end of your next turn, the target becomes indifferent toward one creature of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by the creature to which it is indifferent. When the hex ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.</p><h3>Beckon Familiar</h3><p>You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{find familiar}</em> spell as an action without expending a spell slot or material components. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can’t do so again for 1 minute.</p><p>You must have the Familiar feature to choose this hex.</p><h3>Bleeding</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, each time this target takes damage, it loses an extra 1d4 hit points. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Charm</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn. When the hex ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.</p><h3>Dire Familiar</h3><p>As an action, you can bolster your familiar. For 1 minute, your familiar’s hit point maximum and current hit points are increased by an amount equal to twice your witch level, and it gains a bonus to its damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><p>You can cast other hexes while this hex is in effect. Once you cast this hex, you can’t cast it again until your familiar is dismissed, or until its duration expires.</p><p>You must have the Familiar feature to choose this hex.</p><h3>Disorient</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, whenever the target makes an attack roll before the end of your next turn, it must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll.</p><h3>Doomward</h3><p>As an action, choose one friendly creature other than yourself that you can see within 60 feet of you. If this creature is reduced to 0 hit points before the end of your next turn, but not killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. This hex then ends and can’t be used on the same creature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Duplicity</h3><p>As an action, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself composed of shadowstuff to confuse your enemies. When a creature attacks you, roll any die. On an odd number, the attack strikes the duplicate and misses, regardless of its roll, and the hex ends. On an even number, the attack targets you as normal. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Evil Eye</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Fortune</h3><p>As an action, choose one friendly creature other than yourself that you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature has advantage on saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Go Unseen</h3><p>As an action, you and your familiar become invisible (as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]{invisibility}</em> spell). The effect ends at the end of your next turn, or if you or your familiar attack or cast a spell.</p><p>Once you cast this hex, you can’t cast it again for 1 minute.</p><h3>Hobble</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s speed is reduced to 10 feet until the end of your next turn. If the creature is flying, it falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic.</p><h3>Knowing</h3><p>As an action, you open your third eye and become intuitively aware of your surroundings. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Additionally, choose one of the following pieces of information. You learn that piece of information for each creature within 30 feet of you.</p><ul><li>If a creature can speak a language</li><li>If a creature is at or below half of its hit point maximum</li><li>What a creature’s lowest ability score is</li></ul><p>You can only learn one of these things about a creature, even if you cast this hex more than once.</p><h3>Mire</h3><p>As an action, you can transform the ground in a 30-foot radius centered on the point where you cast this hex into murky swamp, which is difficult terrain. You and your familiar are immune to this hex. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Misfortune</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Until the end of your next turn, whenever this creature rolls a 20 on a d20 roll, the roll instead becomes a 1.</p><h3>Obfuscate</h3><p>As an action, you create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on yourself. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p><h3>Peacebond</h3><p>As an action, you can lock weapons to their owners. The weapons and ammunition of each creature within 30 feet of you become locked in their sheaths, quivers, or holsters until the end of your next turn. During this time, a creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing its weapon on a success.</p><h3>Pox</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 5 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Ruin</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s Armor Class decreases by 3, to a minimum of 10, until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Scurry</h3><p>As an action, a nonmagical object you choose within 30 feet of you sprouts legs and runs away. You can’t target an object that weighs more than 10 pounds, nor can you target one that is being worn as clothing or armor; however, you can target certain objects that are being carried, as long as they aren’t affixed entirely around a creature’s body or being held in a hand. For example, you can’t target a creature’s helmet or a sword it is wielding, but you can target a drawstring pouch it is wearing or a dagger that is sheathed at its side.</p><p>The object animates, wriggles free of its owner (if it has one), sprouts two legs, and moves 20 feet in a direction you choose. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose which direction the object moves. The object has an AC of 10, if its AC wasn’t already higher, and remains animated until the end of your next turn, or until it is picked up.</p><h3>Shriek</h3><p>As a bonus action, you can release a thunderous, blood-curdling screech. Each Large or smaller creature you choose within 5 feet of you is pushed 5 feet away from you.</p><h3>Slumber</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target falls unconscious until it takes damage, or until the end of your next turn. Undead, creatures that are immune to being charmed, and creatures whose current hit points are greater than five times your witch level are immune to this effect.</p><h3>Slur</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target can’t speak coherently until the end of your next turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell that requires a verbal component, it must roll a d20. On an odd roll, the casting fails.</p><h3>Tremors</h3><p>As an action, you can create a miniature earthquake. Each creature on the ground within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</p><h3>Ward</h3><p>As an action, choose one creature you can see other than yourself within 60 feet of you. Each time the creature takes damage before the end of your next turn, the damage it takes is reduced by 3.</p><h1>Grand Hexes</h1><p>The grand hexes below are presented in alphabetical order. Unless otherwise stated, if a grand hex requires an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack modifier and spell save DC. Grand hex features don’t count as hexes.</p><h3>Cauldron</h3><p>You can brew potions in a bubbling cauldron using raw components scavenged from nature. To this end, you have a pool of alchemy points equal to half your witch level, rounded down. You regain all expended alchemy points when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can spend 10 minutes and expend any number of alchemy points to brew potions. These potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they become inert. If a potion calls requires a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.</p><p>The potions available for you to brew are given on the Cauldron Potions table below.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Cauldron Potions</td></tr><tr><td>Potion</td><td>Alchemy Points</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.nXWevqtV6p484N59]{Potion of Animal Friendship}</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.gTRFQLdVD1gsKtPi]{Potion of Growth}</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of Healing}</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.CAZMwFBWp9VC0ZCg]{Potion of Water Breathing}</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.FIDyR0kZnxGy7bj8]{Oil of Slipperiness}</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.63nb14yQRJMc4bIn]{Philter of Love}</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.L887NdWEP5NqHCrQ]{Potion of Greater Healing}</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.wNKYbKYwOHbA7SH8]{Potion of Heroism}</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Potion of Resistance</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.bAyr7j5Peq9wIJTa]{Potion of Clairvoyance}</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.HY8duCwmvlXOruTG]{Potion of Diminution}</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.bqZ6NTLDCUB98YjV]{Potion of Gaseous Form}</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Coven</h3><p>You can induct others into your insidious coven. By performing a special ritual over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can intermingle your cursed magic with a willing creature that has the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature. This creature enters into your coven. You can have up to two creatures other than yourself in your coven at a time.</p><p>While two or more members of your coven are within 30 feet of one another, they gain the ability to cast additional spells, as shown on the Coven Spellcasting table. Additionally, members of your coven gain access to a shared pool of five spell slots—one of each level, from 1st to 5th level—which they can use to cast spells as normal. Expended spell slots are regained when all members of the coven finish a long rest.</p><p>Coven members use their own spellcasting ability to determine spell attack modifiers and spell save DCs. A coven member can’t cast spells of a level for which it doesn’t personally have spell slots, even if using a higher level shared spell slot. A shared spell slot can be used, for instance, to cast a lower level spell at higher levels, but it can’t be used to cast a spell normally too high-level for a spellcaster.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Coven Spellcasting</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.95K2aUhAGV9qXjnf]{bane}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BQk5Row4NymMnUQl]{hideous laughter}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]{invisibility}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ODhLKBxLnvvLOnw1]{ray of enfeeblement}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pO4zGe5LmFIYqJiL]{bestow curse}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pxpb2eOB6bv4phAf]{banishment}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.04nMsTWkIFvkbXlY]{polymorph}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.CjIq8Ed7bu3vVwT1]{contagion}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{scrying}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Dual Hex</h3><p>When you cast a hex that targets one creature other than yourself, you can target two creatures instead. While both targets are under the effect of your hex, you gain the benefits of your Insidious Spell feature against each of them.</p><h3>Forceful Personality</h3><p>Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your maximum for this score increases to 22.</p><h3>Hybrid</h3><p>As a bonus action, if your familiar is within 5 feet of you, you can meld with it, transforming into a magical hybrid. For the next minute, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You gain temporary hit points equal to your familiar’s hit points.</li><li>Your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, as long as you aren’t wielding a shield. You can use this calculation to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC.</li><li>You gain two natural melee weapons, corresponding to your familiar’s attacks. You are proficient with these weapons, and use Charisma for their attack and damage rolls. On a hit, these natural weapons deal 1d10 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice).</li><li>You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</li><li>You can use any action or movement your familiar possesses.</li></ul><p>This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it on your turn (no action required). When it ends, your familiar is dismissed, and you can’t summon it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Poison Apple</h3><p>As an action, you can produce a magical apple out of thin air. This apple can possess whatever appearance you wish, be that a ruby red coloration, a golden skin, or the appearance of crystal. You can use your action to eat the apple, granting you the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You regain hit points equal to twice your witch level + your Charisma modifier.</li><li>You regain an expended spell slot of 5th level or lower.</li><li>You can end one of the following conditions affecting you: blinded, deafened, paralyzed (if the apple is fed to you as an action), or poisoned.</li></ul><p>However, the apple is suffused with your insidious magic. If a creature other than you eats the apple, it doesn’t gain any benefits and instead must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned for up to 24 hours. For each hour the creature is poisoned, it loses 4d8 hit points. This loss can’t be reduced or avoided. If this reduction causes the creature to drop to 0 hit points, the creature instead drops to 1 hit point and falls into a catatonic sleep, remaining unconscious for up to 7 days. A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic can awaken the creature early.</p><p>The apple shrivels and becomes nonmagical if it isn’t eaten within 24 hours. Once you produce a magical apple, you can’t produce another one until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Possession</h3><p>As an action, your body becomes immaterial, and your spirit dives into a Large or smaller creature you can see within 10 feet of you in an attempt to possess it. This target must make a Charisma saving throw. A creature with a challenge rating greater than your witch level automatically succeeds on this save. On a failed save, you disappear along with your equipment and the target becomes incapacitated and possessed; you gain control of its body but don’t deprive the target of its awareness. While possessing the creature, you can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. You maintain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma and your alignment, but otherwise use the creature’s statistics. You don’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</p><p>For the purposes of spells and effects which can end possession, such as the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.TkJ8Wtg1L7TZtspm]{dispel evil and good}</em>, you are treated as an Undead spirit and can be banished from the target, returning to your own body, which rematerializes within 5 feet of the target.</p><p>This possession lasts for 1 hour, or until the body drops to 0 hit points or you are forced out by a spell or other magical effect that ends possession.</p><p>Once you use this grand hex, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>War Hex</h3><p>When you cast a hex that targets a single creature, you can use your bonus action to cast a cantrip targeting the same creature.</p><h3>Witch's Broom</h3><p>You can use your action to enchant a nonmagical object—such as a broom, cauldron, or rug—to fly for you. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet while holding this item, as long as you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armor, or wielding a shield. This object remains enchanted until you use this grand hex to enchant a different object.</p><h3>Witch's Hut</h3><p>You can perform a 24-hour ritual to enchant a structure that can fit within a 15-foot cube, animating it as a Huge object, as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ATo0Eb63TDtnu6iA]{animate objects}</em> spell. The structure rises up on a pair of magical legs and follows your commands.</p><p>The entrance to the structure is linked to an extradimensional dwelling, as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pn4SnsFDvYDiE6rC]{magnificent mansion}</em> spell. You can command the structure from inside this dwelling. If the structure is destroyed, the extradimensional dwelling is unharmed, but any creatures inside it are expelled into the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance.</p><p>As an action, you can teleport the structure to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. Once you teleport the structure, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can repeat the 24-hour ritual to end the enchantment on your previous structure and enchant a new one.</p><h1>Witch's Crafts</h1><p>A witch’s craft is distinct from a school of magic. Whereas magical schools seek to categorize spells, crafts are defined by the use of magic, and seek to capture the essence of spells. There are dozens of varieties, from those practiced by covens in secret, to those plied in marketplace potion shops.</p><p>Each craft has a number of Craft Spells. New spells are marked with an asterisk.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.LkHTZvD5XnUXwqqI#black-magic]{Black Magic}</td><td>Practices the necromantic arts and wields dark spells of suffering</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.LkHTZvD5XnUXwqqI#blood-magic]{Blood Magic}</td><td>Lays terrible curses and draws power from blood sacrifices</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.LkHTZvD5XnUXwqqI#green-magic]{Green Magic}</td><td>Practices magic associated with plants, animals, and the natural world</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.LkHTZvD5XnUXwqqI#purple-magic]{Purple Magic}</td><td>Wields illusions and enchantments in equal measure</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.LkHTZvD5XnUXwqqI#red-magic]{Red Magic}</td><td>A destructive spellcaster wielding magic that ruins and burns</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.LkHTZvD5XnUXwqqI#steel-magic]{Steel Magic}</td><td>Melds swordsmanship with wicked hexes</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.LkHTZvD5XnUXwqqI#tea-magic]{Tea Magic}</td><td>A peaceful witch that practices tea ceremonies and divination</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.LkHTZvD5XnUXwqqI#technicolor-magic]{Technicolor Magic}</td><td>Makes friends with just about everyone they meet</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.LkHTZvD5XnUXwqqI#white-magic]{White Magic}</td><td>A natural healer and practitioner of restorative magic</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Black Magic</h2><p>Black magic is associated with hexes that cause pain and suffering, and spells that give rise to undeath. Harnessing such a craft can lend you great power, but inevitably carries a cost. Darkness cannot be contained, after all; it merely seeps forth from wherever it is kept.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Black Magic Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.riBbuS70OrjanPsp]{exhume},* @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ksaaTxIbKx2sJfia]{inflict wounds}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.n4JDcFKe5ikzYmAc]{gentle repose}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Sgjrf8qqv97CCWM4]{magic weapon}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.oyE5nVppa5mde5gT]{animate dead}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.UfHQhA54M4323gVO]{vampiric touch}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pybg5MNc3lkerH4Y]{blight}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{death ward}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LkvI11Uue774QBKZ]{cloudkill}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.CjIq8Ed7bu3vVwT1]{contagion}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Hex: Decay</h3><p>When you choose this craft at 3rd level, you learn to drain the vitality from a living being. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the start of its next turn, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the hex ends. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This hex ends at the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Undeath Command</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you have intertwined the magic of your familiar with the magic you use to animate the dead. When you use your bonus action to command your familiar, you can use the same bonus action to issue a command to any Undead you control via the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.oyE5nVppa5mde5gT]{animate dead}</em> spell or similar magic.</p><h3>Life Tether</h3><p>At 10th level, as a reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see, you can transfer some of that damage to a creature that is the sole target of your hex. You take half the damage (rounded down) and the hexed creature takes the remaining damage.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Black Sacrifice</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, if your familiar is within 10 feet of you, you can use your action to command it to dissolve its magical bond to this plane, which unleashes a torrent of necromantic energy. Each creature you choose within 20 feet of your familiar must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 10d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt. A target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Once you use this feature, you can’t summon your familiar again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Blood Magic</h2><p>Forbidden by most witch covens, blood magic centers on the use of dark spells and mortal hexes that draw from the spellcaster’s very essence. It is fundamentally more perilous than other witch crafts, but its many risks come with copious rewards.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Blood Magic Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.22dPoeXfaaAv4K3h]{hellish rebuke}, @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.mc4SwssrUXv6FIm0]{hollowing curse}*</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.4H6YgYdKgnX6ZQ8M]{acid arrow}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3Lo9boi7P2ro6QV4]{hold person}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.HA5U65PzcRngRygl]{ruby-eye curse},* @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.UfHQhA54M4323gVO]{vampiric touch}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pybg5MNc3lkerH4Y]{blight}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LrPvWHBPmiMQQsKB]{dominate beast}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.91Sw6vOIaO7U8DvM]{dominate person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.l9Ju5KE7bbn3WpTm]{hold monster}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Hex: Blood Curse</h3><p>Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you can mark a creature with a sinister blood curse. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, this target is on the brink of death until the end of your next turn. If the creature at any point in this duration is missing any of its hit points and has fewer hit points than twice your witch level, it immediately drops to 0 hit points.</p><h3>Novice Hemomancy</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, when you cast a spell spell that requires material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell, you can replace the material components with a drop of blood.</p><h3>Arcane Bloodletting</h3><p>Lastly at 3rd level, you can impel your magic with a measure of your own blood. When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to lose 5 hit points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Deathseeker</h3><p>At 6th level, you can see those near death shrouded in a crimson aura. Even in heavily obscured conditions, you can detect the location of each creature within 60 feet of you that is missing any of its hit points. This sense can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p><p>Additionally, you have advantage on ability checks you make to track a creature you or your familiar has damaged within the last 24 hours.</p><h3>Hemomantic Recovery</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can perform a blood ritual to bolster your magic. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can spend Hit Dice to recover expended spell slots. The cost for each spell slot is given on the table below. You can’t use this ability to recover spell slots of 6th level or higher.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Hit Dice</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Sanguine</h3><p>By 14th level, you can wield your own blood like a vicious lash. Once per round, when you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature that is under the effect of your hex, you can choose to lose hit points to increase the amount of damage dealt. For every 5 hit points you lose, you can deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage to the creature, to a maximum of 6d8 damage. This feature only applies to a hostile creature that is the sole target of your hex.</p><h2>Green Magic</h2><p>Plants, nature, and wild animals are the domain of green magic. Normally a type of arcana championed by druids, some witches have a close tie to the powers of green magic and can coax plants and animals to do their bidding.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Green Magic Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gMrWeG8fMDPRFiVe]{entangle}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Qf6CAZkc7ms4ZY3e]{goodberry}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JPwIEfgUPVebr5AH]{barkskin}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Iv2qqSAT7OkXKPFx]{locate animals or plants}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1Drt0SHxbEAHxprN]{conjure animals}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.YWtwzp6ZnQJMEmVW]{plant growth}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.dEfSELiY1eO3cpX9]{conjure woodland beings}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ReMbjfeOKoSj3O79]{stoneskin}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MCEpGpvovcXagwQS]{awaken}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.DUBgwHPakcLDkB6W]{tree stride}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Hex: Elder Tongue</h3><p>Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you know the speech of the forest. As a bonus action, you can attune yourself to the forest, granting you the ability to speak with Beasts and Plants in a limited manner until the end of your next turn.</p><p>Most Beasts and Plants lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but could relay what they have seen or heard in the recent past. While you can speak with them, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at Beasts and Plants.</p><h3>Primal Ally</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, whenever you summon your familiar, you conjure one that is hardier than normal. Add three times your witch level, instead of twice your witch level, to your familiar’s hit point maximum.</p><h3>Twin Familiar</h3><p>By 6th level, when you summon your familiar, you can divide its spirit into two bodies. When summoned in this way, your familiar is two identical creatures that share a single pool of hit points. Your twin familiars act on subsequent turns. You can use your bonus action to command one twin to attack and your action to command the other to attack. A spell or feature that targets or dismisses your familiar affects both twins.</p><h3>Vital Nourishment</h3><p>By 10th level, you exude an aura of vitality that restores and reinvigorates life around you. When you finish a long rest, plant life within 120 feet of where you finished your long rest grows as if a month had passed with abundant food, water, and other necessities. If the plants would produce fruits, berries, or vegetables, the plants grow enough food to feed six creatures for one day.</p><p>Additionally, choose up to six creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your witch level + your Charisma modifier. You can also end one disease affecting each creature, or end one of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</p><h3>Sacrificial Familiar</h3><p>At 14th level, whenever you are targeted by an attack while your familiar is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to command it to dive in the way of the attack, causing the attack to target your familiar instead.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Purple Magic</h2><p>Purple magic holds sway over the domains of illusions and enchantments that take hold over people’s minds, as well as anything that is not quite as it seems.

As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature that is immune to being charmed automatically succeeds on this saving throw.</p><p>On a failed save, the target’s perspective of the world distorts into a horrific and alien place. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks. At the start of each of the creature’s turns while affected by this hex, this penalty increases by 1, up to a maximum penalty of −5. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>False Authority</h3><p>By 6th level, as an action, you can wrap yourself in an illusory air of expectation. Any creature that can see you perceives you as a figure of authority. A blacksmith might see you as a guild master, whereas a soldier might see you as a captain. The changes perceived by a viewer fail to hold up to physical inspection. This illusion lasts for 1 hour or until you end it on your turn (no action required).</p><p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Deceitful Transposition</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your bonus action to create an illusory disguise over two creatures within 60 feet of you, making it seem as if they have teleported and swapped places. The disguise moves the sounds, smells, and other effects caused by each creature to their appropriate points of origin. Creatures under the effect of this disguise don’t perceive any part of the illusion.</p><p>A creature can use its action to examine a magically disguised creature and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can see both illusory creatures for what they are.</p><p>This illusion lasts for 1 minute, and it ends early if one of the illusory creatures takes damage, or if one of the creatures performs any physical interaction that reveals itself to be an illusion.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Frenzied Nightmare</h3><p>By 14th level, you can warp everything a creature sees into a hellscape full of terrible creatures that wish them harm. When a creature fails its saving throw against your Hallucination hex, you can further distort its mind, causing it to become frenzied.</p><p>A frenzied creature loses the ability to distinguish between friend and foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. While frenzied, the creature chooses the targets for its attacks, spells, and abilities randomly from among the creatures it can see within range, and it must make an opportunity attack if any creature provokes one</p><p>This effect ends after 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Red Magic</h2><p>Arcane magic tied to channeling the elements is deemed red magic, and is extremely hazardous when used.

On a failed save, the target loses resistance to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn, or is treated as only having resistance, if it has immunity to that damage type.</p><h3>Convolute Energy</h3><p>At 6th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can gain resistance to that damage type until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Invulnerability</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to briefly become all but invulnerable.

You can use this calculation to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC.</li><li>When you make an attack with a melee weapon that lacks the Heavy or Special property, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for its attack and damage rolls.</li><li>Whenever you take damage from a creature you can see that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</li></ul><h3>Cackling Killer</h3><p>At 6th level, when you use your Cackle feature, you can attack twice, instead of once, if you take the Attack action on that turn.</p><h3>Soulsword Familiar</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action, you can draw the essence of your familiar into your weapon, manifesting in a cloak of green flame. Your familiar is dismissed, and can’t be resummoned until you finish a short or long rest. Until your familiar is resummoned, this weapon deals an extra 1d8 fire damage on a hit.</p><h3>Shrieking Strike</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, your accursed magic has seeped into your weapon. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can perform a shrieking strike. The target must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you for up to 1 minute. The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Tea Magic</h2><p>Tea witches are among the calmest and friendliest of witches, radiating warmth and contentment despite their hideous faces and hollow souls. At their very worst, they can be cranky (if forced to drink their tea in a hurry), or twitchy (after too much tea), but even then, they are likely to look for peaceful solutions to their problems.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Tea Magic Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BQk5Row4NymMnUQl]{hideous laughter}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{sanctuary}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.4v2H3hHb3Ph9XLNd]{augury}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3MYDjS6k9IYL0aTj]{calm emotions}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.cg50KpBkBdPK6vPL]{clairvoyance}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD]{sending}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9]{divination}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.NJgxf7pmSsBArIG7]{private sanctum}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.W4Qx5z0id6da0vqg]{legend lore}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{scrying}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Hex: Tasseography</h3><p>Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you can see glimpses of the future in your tea leaves. As an action, choose a friendly creature you can see within 60 feet of you, roll a d20, and record the number rolled. Until the end of your next turn, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by the creature with this foretelling roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. Once you replace a roll in this way, this hex ends.</p><h3>Tea Ceremony</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can magically conjure enough tea for you and your allies whenever you take a short or long rest. A creature who drinks this tea loses one additional level of exhaustion during that rest.</p><h3>Shapes and Omens</h3><p>By 6th level, you can see deeper glimpses into the future through your tea leaves. When you finish a long rest, you can examine the shape of your tea leaves. The GM tells you a shape that hints at future events. For example, if you see a tower in your tea leaves, you might encounter a wizard on the following day. If you see a serpent, you might encounter a lair or a monster.</p><h3>Herbal Remedy</h3><p>At 10th level, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}</em> spell without expending a spell slot or material components.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>Invigorate</h3><p>By 14th level, as a bonus action, you can give yourself or a friendly creature you can see within 5 feet of you a temporary rush of energy by drinking an energizing cup of tea. On the target’s next turn, the target can take one additional action.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p><h2>Technicolor Magic</h2><p>Technicolor Magic witches draw their power from the friendships they find around them. They have a penchant for collecting adorable animals of all shapes and sizes, which they will never endanger, no matter how dire the situation. Above all, these witches are defined by their relentlessly positive outlook, which empowers their arcana and spurs on their allies.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Technicolor Magic Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LWTUqKkUQdMAmOe0]{color spray}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.aL1F8fvYLtNzUbKu]{speak with animals}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X8w9EzYLGc4vQ1H2]{animal messenger}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JVhKeanAXZH62DrF]{warding bond}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.yfbK8gZqESlaoY5t]{fly}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.GtGjNjPBgUHxGYAD]{sending}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}, @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.owSZsRQvR2nsp2vM]{Mandy's marvelous dress}*</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MCEpGpvovcXagwQS]{awaken}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{teleportation circle}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Hex: Musical Interlude</h3><p>Starting when you choose this craft at 3rd level, you gain a hex that inspires your allies with an uplifting speech or an encouraging musical number. As an action, you can grant each willing creature you can see that can see you within 30 feet of you a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + half your witch level. These temporary hit points last until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Animal Friends</h3><p>At 3rd level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks you make to befriend Beasts. You can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Wisdom, for these checks if the creature is Small or smaller. If you adopt a Beast as a pet, you can temporarily dismiss it into an extradimensional space, as you would a familiar.</p><h3>Friendship Bracelet</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can weave a small bracelet of string, beads, or some other inexpensive material. You can always determine the location of a creature wearing one of these bracelets, as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can target the creature with spells and effects as if you could see it, even if the target is obscured from your view.</p><h3>Positivity</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can leverage your bonds of friendship for protection. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of friendly creatures within 5 feet of you (maximum of +10), potentially causing the attack to miss you instead.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Redemptive Arc</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can redeem your foes instead of slaying them. When a hostile creature you can see is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to protect the creature from further harm. The creature is stable but unconscious until it regains any hit points. When the creature awakens, any magical effect causing it to be charmed, cursed, frightened, or possessed ends. Furthermore, the creature loses one of its Bonds or Flaws that inspired it to be hostile toward you.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>White Magic</h2><p>White magic is fundamentally good and benevolent for all living things. Witches that adopt this craft, in spite of the hateful curse that infects them, often dedicate themselves to healing and caretaking, with the intent of bettering the world.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">White Magic Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8dzaICjGy6mTUaUr]{bless}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{cure wounds}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MOEmz9N0j0QPkKEE]{prayer of healing}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{beacon of hope}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{death ward}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{guardian of faith}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Pyzmm8R7rVsNAPsd]{mass cure wounds}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz]{raise dead}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Hex: Remedy</h3><p>At 3rd level, you learn a hex that closes wounds and eases pain. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. This target regains a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your witch level. A creature that regains hit points from this hex can’t be affected by it again until it finishes a short or long rest.</p><h3>Talisman of Protection</h3><p>At 6th level, you can craft a magical talisman that wards off harm. Creating a talisman takes 1 hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short rest. You can only have one of these talismans at a time; crafting a new talisman causes the previous one to become mundane.</p><p>Whenever the creature wearing the talisman makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add it to the saving throw.</p><h3>Benevolent Surge</h3><p>At 10th level, when you, your familiar, or an ally you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to regain a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>Witch's Gift</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, whenever you cast a spell or hex that restores a creature’s hit points, that creature gains a +3 bonus to its Armor Class until the end of your next turn.</p>"

Of course, barbarians are not all forest folk and mountain people; they can be found in every nation under every creed, adopting whatever customs come naturally to those who possess deep wells of anger. The brutish tavern-goer with a hair-trigger temper, the uncommonly fierce town guard, and the retired mercenary trying their best to live in peace are all barbarians at heart. But ultimately, the path a barbarian must walk is a creed accepted by choice. True barbarians must embrace their turmoil and control it, channeling it in those moments they fully unleash their rage.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Barbarian Subclasses</td></tr><tr><td>Primal Path</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.Fc4VBwCT4nH4r7PG#path-of-the-colossus]{Path of the Colossus}</td><td>Grows to enormous size to crush their foes</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Fc4VBwCT4nH4r7PG#path-of-the-fin]{Path of the Fin}</td><td>An adherent to oceanic totems, bearing gills and rows of razor sharp teeth</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Fc4VBwCT4nH4r7PG#path-of-heavy-metal]{Path of Heavy Metal}</td><td>Tavern-smashing warriors known for rocking out and cracking skulls</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Fc4VBwCT4nH4r7PG#path-of-the-muscle-wizard]{Path of the Muscle Wizard}</td><td>Definitely a “wizard.” A buff, angry “wizard”</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Fc4VBwCT4nH4r7PG#path-of-the-rage-mage]{Path of the Rage Mage}</td><td>An arcanist who channels explosive surges of magic through brute ferocity</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Fc4VBwCT4nH4r7PG#path-of-tranquility]{Path of Tranquility}</td><td>A serene, reactionary warrior who enters a zen-like state in conflict</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Path of the Colossus</h2><p>The colossus, sometimes known as a war-hulk, is a barbarian of the front lines, hefting massive weapons and sweeping away smaller combatants in their fury. To a war-hulk, strength is the only attribute that matters. Cunning is for the weak; faith is for the weak; speed is for the weak. Victory is for the strong alone, and rage is the purest path to strength. This path is a favorite of goliaths and giants, who step easily into crushing smaller opponents.</p><h3>Larger Than Life</h3><p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you become a titan in your anger. When you begin a rage, your size doubles in all dimensions and your weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases your size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example—and lasts for the duration of your rage. This size increase doesn’t stack with similar size increases, such as from the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WahI41a3goVUg0x1]{enlarge/reduce}</em> spell. If there isn’t enough room for you to double your size, you attain the maximum possible size in the space available. Your weapons also grow to match your new size. While these weapons are enlarged, your attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.</p><p>While raging, you can use your action to make a massive swing in a 15-foot line that fits entirely within your reach. Roll a separate attack roll for each target in the line.</p><p>@UUID[.YyHYWM1I0Gc24PKB]{Sidebar: Size}</p><h3>Imposing Presence</h3><p>At 6th level, your immense stature can block line of sight. Ranged effects drawing line of sight through your position treat targets behind you as if they have three-quarters cover. When you are raging, this becomes total cover.</p><h3>Boulder Throw</h3><p>At 10th level, you can throw massive boulders or other suitably large objects as weapons. Such weapons are considered two-handed, heavy, thrown weapons with a range of 30/60 feet. You have proficiency in such weapons. On a hit, a boulder deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage. You can only throw one boulder per turn.</p><h3>Colossal Strength</h3><p>At 14th level, your Strength score increases by 2 and your maximum for this score becomes 22. At 20th level, your Strength maximum becomes 26, rather than 24.</p><p>When you make a melee weapon attack while raging, the attack has reach if it didn’t have it before.</p><h2>Path of the Fin</h2><p>Tribal communities exist all across the realms, in all manner of locales and climes. While their customs often change, one steadfast certainty seen time and time again is the reverence for particular animals local to that tribe. These are often wildly varied; northern tribes may revere the Wolf or the Bear, those of the deserts follow the Hawk or the Jackal, and those of the jungle may aspire to the Ape or the Tiger. It is in this tradition that the Path of the Fin, island warriors capturing the bloodthirsty essence of the great Shark, arose.</p><h3>Aquatic</h3><p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you are permanently adapted to life underwater. You can breathe water as well as air and have a swim speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, if you are swimming, your rage can’t end early, unless you choose to end it.</p><h3>Feeding Frenzy</h3><p>Unlike their land-locked brothers, fin barbarians undergo drastic physical transformations when they enter a rage. At 3rd level, while raging, you sprout rows of razor-sharp shark teeth and gain a melee bite attack. Your bite is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p><p>Starting at 6th level, your bite is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p>When you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against that creature. This attack has advantage if the creature has half its hit points or fewer. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Blood Sense</h3><p>A fully grown shark can smell a single drop of blood in the water almost a mile away. At 6th level, you gain an amazing sense of smell. You have advantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks dealing with smell, and you can automatically track a single living creature whose scent you are familiar with as long as the trail is less than a week old. By spending a minute concentrating, you can detect the scents of all living creatures in a 100-foot radius, or up to a mile in the water.</p><h3>Mako</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, your bite attack damage increases to 1d10. Additionally, once per turn when you hit a creature with your bite attack, it must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone or grappled by you (your choice). The target has disadvantage on this save if you are swimming.</p><h3>Tsunami</h3><p>By 14th level, when you enter your rage, you can conjure a magical wave of salt water that rises at your feet and glides beneath you. The wave is up to 15 feet wide and 15 feet tall, and moves with you as you swim. If a creature is caught up in the wave, it is forced to swim and hold its breath until it leaves the wave’s area or the wave moves away from it. The wave extinguishes unprotected flames in its area. The wave lasts for 1 minute, after which it spreads across the ground in all directions and quickly evaporates.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Path of Heavy Metal</h2><p>The barbarians of the Path of Heavy Metal do not do things by halves. They fight the strongest foes, swing the biggest axes, and play the loudest music. For this reason, any battle they get involved in tends to be noisy, violent, and short.</p><p>Armored only in face paint and studded belts, these fearless hellions are known for screaming their enemies into submission and trashing taverns, though they can also be thoughtful and erudite when not tapping into their primal fury. Away from the battlefield, the “thunderheads” form a tight fraternity, bonded together by absolute commitment to their path and the shared recognition that the life of an adventurer—with its grueling travel, explosive violence, and unfamiliar lodgings—is essentially a never-ending tour.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three musical instruments of your choice.</p><h3>Heavy Metal Axe</h3><p>At 3rd level, your dabbling with craftsmen and bards has taught you how to build the sickest instruments possible. You can spend 8 hours of work converting a two-handed weapon into an instrument with which you are proficient. Only you can play an instrument weapon you have created, which retains all its combat capabilities. You can maintain a total number of instrument weapons equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><h3>Solo Shredding</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you play your instrument weapon even in combat, rocking out as you crack skulls. When you enter a rage, you begin ferociously playing a solo on your instrument weapon. After you deal damage to a hostile creature during your rage with your instrument weapon, you increase your Rage bonus damage by 1. You can increase your Rage damage bonus up to a maximum of twice your proficiency bonus. This increase lasts until you are incapacitated, you are no longer holding your instrument weapon, you miss an attack, or your rage ends.</p><h3>Killer Vocals</h3><p>By 6th level, as a bonus action, you can release a thunderous battle cry, blood-curdling screech, or growl. Each Large or smaller creature you choose within 5 feet of you is pushed 5 feet away from you and is deafened until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Up to Eleven</h3><p>At 10th level, you put total commitment into your music. Whenever you make a Charisma check or any check that involves playing your instrument weapon, you can treat a d20 roll of 10 or lower as an 11.</p><h3>Smash Hit</h3><p>By 14th level, you’ve learned that the best way to end a fight (and a performance) is to smash one of your instrument weapons entirely. When you hit a creature with your instrument weapon while you are raging, you can smash the weapon on the target, dealing an extra 4d12 damage. A nonmagical instrument weapon is completely destroyed, whereas a magical instrument weapon loses its musical components and no longer counts as an instrument weapon.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2>Path of the Muscle Wizard</h2><p>You’re a wizard! Perhaps you went to wizarding school on a football scholarship or just picked up a book at the gym and started reading. No matter how you got here, you’re a wizard, one that just coincidentally has massive, rippling muscles. You have the big dumb hat and the book filled with gibberish and everything!</p><p>You gently remind others, often by beating them to a pulp and cracking their bones, that your magical powers shouldn’t be questioned. You’re a good wizard, the best one, even! And only a fool would say otherwise.</p><h3>Unarguable Wizardry</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, your unquestionable legitimacy (and immense pectoral muscles) gives you advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to convince others that you are, in fact, a wizard.</p><p>Additionally, if someone questions your legitimate magical prowess, you can instantly fly into a rage for 1 round. This rage can’t be extended and doesn’t count against your number of Rages following a long rest. While in this rage, you can only attack the creature that provoked your ire and the creature’s allies.</p><h3>\"Cantrips\"</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can call upon your “magic” to cast “cantrips” in combat. You can use the following “cantrips” a number of times equal to your Strength modifier. You regain all expended uses when you take a short or long rest. While you are raging, you can cast your “cantrips” at will; using them doesn’t count against your number of uses per long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Mage Hand.</strong></em> As a bonus action when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can use your hand (you are a mage, after all) to attempt to shove the target.</p><p><em><strong>Shocking Grasp.</strong></em> As a bonus action when you make an attack on your turn, you can hit your target even harder than usual, a fact which they will find quite shocking. On a hit, the target can’t take a reaction until the start of your next turn.</p><p><em><strong>True Strike.</strong></em> As a bonus action when you make an attack on your turn, you can really, truly strike your target. On a hit, you deal an extra 1d8 damage to the target.</p><h3>\"Spells\"</h3><p>By 6th level, your “magic” is powerful enough to cast every “spell” that exists (and no one can prove otherwise without broken ribs). However, you only prepared the following “spells” today.</p><p>You can cast each of these “spells” once and recover all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Burning Hands.</strong></em> Your backhand slap is legendary. As an action on your turn, you can make an unarmed strike against each creature within your reach. On a hit, this attack deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Magic Missile.</strong></em> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make a ranged attack using a weapon you are holding. Because <em>magic missile</em> never misses, you have advantage on this attack roll.</p><p><em><strong>Shield.</strong></em> As a reaction when you’re targeted by an attack, you can quickly produce a shield to defend yourself. You gain the shield’s bonus to AC against this attack, even if you weren’t holding it before. If you are hit, you can reduce the amount of damage taken by 1d12 + your Constitution modifier.</p><h3>Magic Resistance</h3><p>By 10th level, you’re such an amazing wizard that other wizards can’t even touch you. While you’re raging, you have resistance to damage from spells.</p><h3>I Cast Fist</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can crush your enemies with your ultimate “spell,” Fist. While you’re raging, you can use your action and bonus action to punch your foe really, really hard. Make a melee attack roll, with advantage, against one creature within your reach. On a hit, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 8d8 + your Strength modifier.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you stop raging and begin a new rage.</p><h2>Path of the Rage Mage</h2><p>Most barbarians who possess the spark of arcane talent never realize it, introspection not always being a barbaric strength. Those who find this spark, however, might learn to channel their brute ferocity through magic and embark on the Path of the Rage Mage. Through their rage-fueled arcane might, such a barbarian possesses a uniquely calamitous fury, merging physical prowess with spell slinging in a warpath of fire, blades, and blood.</p><h3>Arcane Intuition</h3><p>Starting when you adopt this path at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill and can use your Constitution, instead of Intelligence, for Intelligence (Arcana) checks.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, your rage manifests as a surge of arcane power. While you are raging, you can cast and concentrate on spells. Additionally, casting a spell on your turn counts as attacking a hostile creature for the purpose of sustaining your rage.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> The Rage Mage Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level or higher. To cast one of these spells, you must be raging and expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</strong></em> You know three 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation or transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Rage Mage Spellcasting table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p><p></p><p>@UUID[.g8rp1WlXtuHVCcuo]{Rage Mage Spellcasting Table}</p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Rage Mage Spellcasting</td></tr><tr><td>Barbarian Level</td><td>Cantrips Known</td><td>Spells Known</td><td>1st</td><td>2nd</td><td>3rd</td><td>4th</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>3</td><td>13</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Arcane Rampage</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, if you take the Attack action while you are raging and attack recklessly, you can use your bonus action to cast a spell in place of one of your attacks. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action.</p><h3>Supernatural Exploits</h3><p>By 10th level, you can channel your latent magic to perform spectacular feats of daring. Even when you aren’t raging, you can cast the following spells at will, targeting yourself only, without using a spell slot or material components: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.hJ6ZiA3fpoY8v9cp]{darkvision}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pub0OWVEB71XQx1n]{feather fall}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ZrTc23tToJ0JpH2h]{jump}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.DQzlB5Y3k791W5bH]{see invisibility}</em>.</p><h3>Eldritch Explosions</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you manifest surges of arcane wrath with every strike. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to create an explosion of energy at a point you choose within 10 feet of you. Each creature other than you within a 10-foot radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 force damage for each level of the spell slot expended, or half as much on a successful save.</p><h2>Path of Tranquility</h2><p>Barbarians who follow the Path of Tranquility embrace a zen philosophy of restraint and moderation, much in contrast with their furious brethren. Embraced by the fey and called “the serene,” these barbarians are calm, tactical warriors who issue swift retaliation instead of violent assaults. At their pinnacle, the serene are one with nature and with themselves, entering flow states at will to dispatch their foes with dispassionate precision.</p><h3>Mantra</h3><p>Starting when you select this path at 3rd level, taking the Dodge action on your turn counts as attacking a hostile creature for the purposes of sustaining your rage.</p><h3>Anticipate</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, whenever you do not make an attack roll on your turn, you prepare yourself for blows. Until the start of your next turn, whenever a creature makes a melee attack against you, you can use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack against that creature.</p><h3>Battle Trance</h3><p>At 6th level, whenever you use your reaction to make an attack, you can make two attacks instead.</p><h3>Tranquility</h3><p>At 10th level, you can chant calming verses to entice, relieve, and protect those around you. You can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3MYDjS6k9IYL0aTj]{calm emotions}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.30ZgXtijJVCxQk5N]{enthrall}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{sanctuary}</em> spells once each, without expending spell slots or components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can cast these spells while you are raging. Your spell save DC for these spells is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p><h3>Zen State</h3><p>At 14th level, whenever a creature misses you with a melee attack, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class, up to a maximum of +6. This bonus resets to 0 if you take damage or at the start of your turn.</p>"

True power, the knowledge needed to harness the elemental power of magic, is woven into the writing, ready to be grasped.</p><p>There is no special trick to wizardry. Becoming a master of arcane might merely takes years of dedicated scholarship, rote memorization of esoterics, and grueling hours of practice. But the results are spectacular: summoning elementals with words and gestures, scorching foes alive with geometry from a forgotten tome, and stepping across the planes of the multiverse to see alien horizons through sheer dedication and a magic circle. Wizards are masters of an apex science, a culmination of geometry, physics, alchemy, and more.</p><p>To aid their endless education, wizards have formalized their fields of study into arcane traditions, which are branches on the larger tree of arcana. Formally, traditions are divided into the eight fundamental schools of magic, but innumerable subschools branch off therein. Some traditions eschew this scholarly rigor entirely, however, and focus on one element of magic, like a single spell or one application of evocations, to the detriment of all others. Usually, wizard towers and arcane mentors teach a blended mix of the arcane, only letting students specialize once they have demonstrated mastery over the basics.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Wizard Subclasses</td></tr><tr><td>Arcane Tradition</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.Yn96zGh2q3wuzpeU#familiar-master]{Familiar Master}</td><td>A master of the find familiar spell who can evolve their magical servant</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Yn96zGh2q3wuzpeU#magic-missile-mage]{Magic Missile Mage}</td><td>Expert and obsessive master of the staple wizard spell, magic missile</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Yn96zGh2q3wuzpeU#mystic-savant]{Mystic Savant}</td><td>Masters of arcane stratagems who have an innate pool of battle dice</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Yn96zGh2q3wuzpeU#school-of-chronomancy]{School of Chronomancy}</td><td>Practitioners of elusive and catastrophic chronomancy or “time magic”</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Yn96zGh2q3wuzpeU#school-of-gastronomy]{School of Gastronomy}</td><td>Chef-wizards of gourmet magic who eat slain monsters</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.Yn96zGh2q3wuzpeU#school-of-somnomancy]{School of Somnomancy}</td><td>So-called “pajama mages” who master sleep and trance-related magic</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Familiar Master</h2><p>Learning the <em>find familiar</em> spell is seen as a rite of passage among fledgling wizards, as the spell offers a useful, if limited, magical servant. However, a small subschool of wizards known as the “familiar masters” or “evolutionists” believe that within the humble spell lies manifold hidden powers. Indeed, their studies have unlocked the spell’s hidden potential: the ability to evolve a familiar and fluidly shift its form.</p><h3>Improved Familiar</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you always have the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.JKed6EPyQSuFN8sD]{find familiar}</em> spell prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you prepare. Additionally, you can cast the spell as an action, without expending material components. When you choose your familiar’s creature type, you can choose Aberration, Construct, Elemental, or Undead, in addition to the normal options for the spell.</p><h3>Arcane Evolution</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, you can use an action and expend a spell slot to transform your familiar. When you do, choose a Beast with a challenge rating equal to or lower than half the level of the spell slot expended, and your familiar takes on that Beast’s appearance and statistics (except that it keeps its creature type). During this time, your familiar can attack on its turn. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes, after which time you can choose which animal form it takes from those made available by the spell.</p><h3>Servitor's Gift</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, while you have a familiar, you gain a benefit based on its current form. You continue to gain this benefit when your familiar is transformed by your Arcane Evolution feature.</p><p><em><strong>Bat.</strong></em> You can use a bonus action on your turn to gain blindsight out to a distance of 15 feet while you are not deafened.</p><p><em><strong>Cat.</strong></em> When you land after jumping or falling, you can use your reaction to reduce falling damage to 0.</p><p><em><strong>Crab.</strong></em> While you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Frog.</strong></em> Your jump distances are tripled.</p><p><em><strong>Hawk.</strong></em> You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p><p><em><strong>Lizard.</strong></em> You have resistance to poison damage.</p><p><em><strong>Octopus.</strong></em> While you are grappled, you can use a bonus action to attempt to escape. When you attempt to escape from a grapple, you gain a bonus to your Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).</p><p><em><strong>Owl.</strong></em> You gain darkvision out to a distance of 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Poisonous Snake.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d4 poison damage.</p><p><em><strong>Quipper.</strong></em> You have a swim speed of 30 feet, and the length of time you can hold your breath is doubled.</p><p><em><strong>Rat.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end a disease or the poisoned condition on yourself.</p><p><em><strong>Raven.</strong></em> You add your proficiency bonus to death saving throws and know the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8zT7njvqbpXs4Cel]{spare the dying}</em> cantrip, which doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p><p><em><strong>Sea Horse.</strong></em> You add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to control a creature as a mount, and you count as one size smaller than you are for the purposes of determining creatures you can use as a mount.</p><p><em><strong>Spider.</strong></em> You have a climb speed of 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Weasel.</strong></em> Squeezing doesn’t require extra movement for you, and you can stand up from prone by spending 5 feet of movement.</p><h3>Empower Familiar</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can use a bonus action to grant your familiar a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your level in this class. When you do, you can also change the familiar’s creature type and which form it takes from the list provided in the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{find familiar}</em> spell.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>Servitor's Greater Gift</h3><p>At 14th level, while you have a familiar, you gain a benefit based on its creature type.</p><p><em><strong>Aberration.</strong></em> When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can choose to change its damage type to psychic. In addition, you have resistance to psychic damage.</p><p><em><strong>Celestial.</strong></em> When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell or use your Arcane Evolution feature, you can choose a creature within 30 feet to regain hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + the level of spell slot expended. In addition, you have resistance to radiant damage.</p><p><em><strong>Construct.</strong></em> Critical hits made against you with nonmagical attacks become normal hits. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.</p><p><em><strong>Elemental.</strong></em> When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can choose to change its damage type to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage. In addition, you can speak, read, and write Primordial.</p><p><em><strong>Fey.</strong></em> When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell or use your Arcane Evolution feature, you can teleport a number of feet equal to 5 × the level of the spell slot expended. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed or frightened conditions on yourself.</p><p><em><strong>Fiend.</strong></em> When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell or use your Arcane Evolution feature, you can choose a creature within 30 feet of you and deal cold, fire, or necrotic damage (your choice) to it equal to your Intelligence modifier + the level of spell slot expended. In addition, you have resistance to fire damage.</p><p><em><strong>Undead.</strong></em> When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can choose to change its damage type to necrotic. In addition, you have resistance to necrotic damage.</p><h2>Magic Missile Mage</h2><p><em>Magic missile</em> is a staple wizard spell, well-loved for its versatility and unerring accuracy. As a missile magician, however, your fondness for the spell borders on obsession. Your studies focus entirely on this spell, exploring every rune in the spell’s composition and analyzing every aspect of its casting, resulting in new augmentations and greater power than ever before.</p><h3>Force Missile</h3><p>Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, you learn the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.BJ1hU9rnx0F3fhLe]{magic missile}</em>, if you do not know it already. Whenever you cast this spell, it is improved in the following ways:</p><ul><li>You fire 1 additional dart whenever you cast this spell. The additional number of missiles increases by 1 at 6th level (2 additional missiles), 10th level (3 additional missiles), and 14th level (4 additional missiles).</li><li>Your missiles bypass any effect, such as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.z1mx84ONwkXKUZd7]{shield}</em> spell, that specifically blocks or reflects the <em>magic missile</em> spell.</li><li>You can cast this spell at its lowest level without using a spell slot. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Beginning at 14th level, you can use this ability an unlimited number of times.</li></ul><h3>Shield of Missiles</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.BJ1hU9rnx0F3fhLe]{magic missile}</em> in a tight orbit around you, creating a deadly aegis from your foes which lasts for up to 10 minutes. You gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of missiles orbiting you, which begins as the number of missiles fired, up to a maximum bonus of +6. When a hostile creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, a single missile strikes it, dealing damage as normal and decreasing the number of missiles orbiting you. Additionally, when you cast <em>magic missile</em>, you can add some or all of the missiles orbiting you to the spell, decreasing the missiles orbiting you by the number used.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Counter-Missile</h3><p>By 10th level, you’ve learned how to use <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.BJ1hU9rnx0F3fhLe]{magic missile}</em> to overcome your most powerful fellow wizards. When you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell, you can use your reaction to cast <em>magic missile</em>, with all missiles targeting that creature. The creature must make a single Constitution saving throw as a result of the total damage dealt to maintain concentration while casting the spell, even if the spell wouldn’t normally require concentration. The spell fails and has no effect if the creature loses concentration.</p><h3>Inescapable Missile</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, your missiles seek out targets that would otherwise somehow escape them. This grants you the following benefits:</p><ul><li>The range of the spell increases to 500 feet.</li><li>You can target creatures you can’t see within range, as long as you can hear the creatures and there is a path within range from you to the target.</li><li>You can’t be counterspelled when you cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{magic missile}</em>.</li><li>Your missiles penetrate constructs of magical force, such as those created by the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.o9ZCvuD2B1OTcubb]{wall of force}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.NXWWWgHtWb7Nv21F]{tiny hut}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1ADstb0Xec6HHRcU]{resilient sphere}</em>.</li></ul><h2>Mystic Savant</h2><p>Unlike most other arcane traditions, mystic savants do not belong to a formalized institution, instead sharing a philosophy that, to master arcana, one must master every individual aspect of it. Their contemporaries call them “universalists” or “holistics,” but they are savants by any definition. The skill of spellcasting comes naturally to them, so while other wizards refine a specific school of magic, mystic savants master an array of cross-school stratagems to help them snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p><h3>Arcane Strategist</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you learn stratagems that are fueled by special dice called battle dice.</p><p><em><strong>Battle Dice.</strong></em> You have two battle dice, which are d6s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative.</p><p>Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the table below.</p><p><em><strong>Using Battle Dice.</strong></em> Once per turn, you can expend a battle die to use a stratagem of your choice. Your stratagem options are detailed at the end of this subclass description.</p><p><em><strong>Stratagems.</strong></em> You learn three stratagems of your choice, which are detailed under “Stratagems” at the end of the subclass description. Many stratagems enhance a spell in some way. You can use only one stratagem per spell.</p><p>You learn two additional stratagems of your choice at 6th level and one additional stratagem of your choice at 10th and 14th level. Each time you learn new stratagems, you can also replace one stratagem you know with a different one.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Wizard Level</td><td>Battle Dice</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2nd</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>3d8</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3d10</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>4d10</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, or Religion.</p><h3>Versatile Memory</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to exchange one spell you have prepared for another of the same level or lower in your spellbook.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Arcanist's Assessment</h3><p>At 10th level, you can use your action to appraise the spellcasting prowess of a creature you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence check contested by the creature’s spellcasting ability check. If the creature doesn’t have a spellcasting ability, it rolls a d20 instead. If you succeed, you learn if the creature has the Spellcasting, Innate Spellcasting, or Pact Magic features, and whether the creature can cast spells of a higher level than you can cast.</p><p>Regardless of whether the target succeeds or fails, it knows you have assessed its magical capabilities. You can’t use this ability on the same target for 24 hours.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Font of Percipience</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action and expend a spell slot to regain a number of your expended battle dice up to the level of the spell slot expended. When you do, you can choose a stratagem you know and replace it with a different stratagem.</p><h3>Stratagems</h3><p>The stratagems are presented in alphabetical order.</p><p><em><strong>Arcane Warding.</strong></em> When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can expend and roll one battle die as a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to the level of spell slot expended to cast the spell + the result of the battle die. You lose any temporary hit points gained from this stratagem after 10 minutes.</p><p><em><strong>Eldritch Aegis.</strong></em> When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet takes damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to expend one battle die, reducing the damage taken by an amount equal to the roll of the battle die + your Intelligence modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Flash of Brilliance.</strong></em> When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check, you can expend one battle die to add it to the check. You can choose to use this stratagem after the ability check is rolled but before the GM says whether the result was a success or failure.</p><p><em><strong>Mystic Counsel.</strong></em> You can use a bonus action and expend one battle die to give counsel to a creature that can hear you within 30 feet of you. Once in the next minute when the creature makes a saving throw against a spell it can choose to roll the battle die and add the result to the saving throw.</p><p><em><strong>Mystic Defense.</strong></em> When you make a saving throw against a spell or other magical effect, you can use your reaction to expend and roll one battle die to add its result to the saving throw. You can choose to use this stratagem after the saving throw is rolled but before the GM says whether the result was a success or failure.</p><p><em><strong>Potent Casting.</strong></em> When you roll damage for a spell you cast, you can expend one battle die as a bonus action. When you do, you can reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) and must use the new rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Precision Spell.</strong></em> When you make a spell attack roll against a creature, you can expend one battle die to add it to the roll as a bonus action. You can use this stratagem before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the spell attack are applied.</p><p><em><strong>Quick Thinking.</strong></em> When you make an ability check to determine initiative, you can expend and roll one battle die to add its result to your initiative roll. You can choose to use this stratagem after the ability check is rolled but before the GM determines initiative order.</p><p><em><strong>Sorcerous Spread.</strong></em> When you deal damage to a creature with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your bonus action to choose another creature within 5 feet of the target, then expend and roll a battle die. That chosen creature takes damage equal to the level of spell slot expended casting the spell + the result of the battle die. The type of damage is the same as that taken by the original target of the spell.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcaster’s Sting.</strong></em> When a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see succeeds on a saving throw against a spell you cast of 1st level or higher, you can use a bonus action to expend and roll a battle die. The creature takes force damage equal to the level of spell slot expended casting the spell + the result of the battle die.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Sundering.</strong></em> When you deal damage to a creature concentrating on a spell, you can use your bonus action to expend and roll one battle die, adding its result to the damage dealt. If the creature must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, that saving throw has disadvantage.</p><p><em><strong>Unbreakable Concentration.</strong></em> When you make a saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can expend and roll one battle die to add its result to the saving throw. You can choose to use this stratagem after the saving throw is rolled but before the GM says whether the result was a success or failure.</p><h2>School of Chronomancy</h2><p>The School of Chronomancy focuses on harnessing and manipulating the energies of flowing time. It is a perilous tradition, as the practice of slowing, reversing, or diverting the flow of time can accidently tear novices to pieces, spreading them thinly across millennia, or sometimes even drop them wholesale into a new era, with no way of returning home. Masters of this school, however, walk the generations as planeshifters walk the cosmos, literally ending most conflicts before they even begin.</p><h3>Chronomancy Savant</h3><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, all spells with the @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.journals.JournalEntry.rUFpsyUhPn8R9vp2.JournalEntryPage.NFrhP9oEOWDNXg8o#chronomancy]{chronomancy tag} are added to the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.QvPDSUsAiEn3hD8s.JournalEntryPage.k7Rs5EyXeA0SFTXD]{wizard spell list} for you. Additionally, the time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 10 minutes per spell level.</p><h3>Chronoshift</h3><p>At 2nd level, you can abate time while casting your spells. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that has a casting time of 1 action, you can expend another spell slot of the same level to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Speed of Thought</h3><p>By 6th level, you can enter a state of heightened focus as an action, allowing you to perform certain tasks five times faster than normal while you concentrate on them like a spell. These tasks must be purely intellectual in nature, such as research, translation, or computation, and must be tasks you can complete alone; others can’t understand your speech or meaningfully help while you are working at increased speed. Furthermore, attempting to cast a spell, perform a ritual, or move further than 10 feet from where you began instantly returns you to the normal flow of time with a feeling of faintness which prevents you from maintaining concentration for 1 minute.</p><h3>Lag Spell</h3><p>At 10th level, when you cast a spell, you can delay its effect for one, two, or three turns. When the spell is cast, you choose the spell’s target and the number of rounds to delay the spell, and you roll any relevant attack rolls. Any effects on the spell’s targets, including saving throws, are resolved when the spell triggers at the start of your turn after the chosen number of rounds. You don’t concentrate on a delayed spell that requires concentration until it takes effect. If any conditions change between casting and when the spell takes effect that would make the spell impossible—such as the target leaving the spell’s maximum range—the spell fails.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Foreimage</h3><p>By 14th level, you have unlocked the power to turn back time and retrace your steps, correcting your most egregious errors. Whenever you finish a long rest, you are actually beginning your second attempt at the day’s events. You are accompanied by a temporal shadow, an echo of your first time experiencing the day, which you follow perfectly in order to repeat the day’s events. Acting on your foreknowledge destroys your temporal shadow until you finish a long rest, but allows you to use one of the following abilities:</p><ul><li>You gain advantage on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make.</li><li>You can cause one attack roll that doesn’t have advantage to miss you.</li><li>You can act on the knowledge of one thing that you could have known before the end of the day, such as the answer to a riddle, the location of a pit trap, the path through a labyrinth, or someone’s name.</li></ul><p>Once you use this ability, all remaining foreknowledge leaves you until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>School of Gastronomy</h2><p>Gastronomy, the oft-satirized subschool of food-related magic, is rarely taught to wizardly apprentices, for even masters of transmutation can be terrible at cuisine. However, gastronomy is a truly nourishing magic which spans all cultures and is more akin to an art than an arcane tradition. Stereotypical gastronomists are thought of as monstrously fat and held aloft by magic, like great balloons in robes, but this is mostly a myth; wizards of this school are usually healthier than their contemporaries, owing to a healthy and balanced magical diet.</p><h3>Sous Chef</h3><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with cook’s utensils and have advantage on any ability check you make to cook or prepare ingredients. Additionally, you can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BV0mpbHh29IbbIj5]{create food and water}</em> once without using a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you cast the spell using this feature, the resulting food is a mouthwatering meal of your choosing.</p><h3>Monster Dish</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, when you finish a short or long rest, you can prepare a meal using monsters that you and your allies have slain. The meal uses the entire corpse of a creature as an ingredient, which must have died within the last 24 hours or been preserved by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.n4JDcFKe5ikzYmAc]{gentle repose}</em> spell. You can’t use this ability with the corpses of Celestials, Humanoids, or Undead creatures. The meal contains enough food for a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier; this food spoils if not eaten in 24 hours. When a creature partakes of this meal at the end of a short or long rest, it rolls a number of d6s equal to the ingredient creature’s challenge rating (1d6 for creatures of CR 1/2 and lower) and gains temporary hit points equal to the total rolled. Additionally, if the ingredient creature had immunity to a damage type other than bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can choose for the meal to bestow resistance to one such damage type for 8 hours to any creature that partakes of it.</p><p>You can only prepare one meal using this ability, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Flavor Blast</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can make other creatures smell delicious! Once per turn, when a creature fails a saving throw against a spell that you cast of 1st level or higher, you can cause the target to smell and taste like delectable food for up to 1 minute or until you use this ability again. This odor carries out to 15 feet and can resemble any food of your choosing, from freshly baked bread to grilling meat. While the target smells this way, attacks made to bite the creature or attack it with teeth have advantage, and the target has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws it makes to maintain concentration.</p><p>Additionally, creatures of Intelligence 3 or lower can’t distinguish the target from the smell and react accordingly. Most creatures can distinguish the target from the odor after dealing damage to it.</p><h3>Bottomless Feast</h3><p>At 10th level, you can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.mgFqi0ev8f7Ut19y]{heroes’ feast}</em> once, creating enough food for one creature, without using a spell slot or material components. At 11th level, you can create enough food for 5 creatures.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Ravenous Magic Mouth</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to summon a Large-sized disembodied mouth of magical force filled with sharp teeth in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet. On each of your turns, you can command the mouth to float up to 30 feet (no action required), and you can use your bonus action to command it to bite a creature within 5 feet of it. The mouth uses your spell attack modifier for its melee attack roll, and on a hit, deals 4d10 force damage and grapples its target (escape DC equals your spell save DC) on a hit. The mouth can grapple only one target at a time, and can only attack the creature it is grappling.</p><p>If the mouth is grappling a target of Medium size or smaller at the start of your turn, you can use your bonus action to command it to swallow its target, depositing the creature in an extradimensional space filled with acid. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, taking 4d6 acid damage at the beginning of each of its turns. The creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC to escape. On a success, it magically reappears and falls prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mouth. The creature automatically escapes when the mouth vanishes.</p><p>The mouth disappears after 1 minute, or if you dismiss it early on your turn (no action required). Once you summon the mouth, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>School of Somnomancy</h2><p>Somnomancers are an idiosyncratic bunch, given to fancies, daydreams, and odd sartorial choices, so it is no surprise that their subschool of magic is rarely accorded any respect by mages of other schools. Although their obsession with <em>sleep</em> is occasionally useful, such as when someone needs to be hypnotized or must have their dreams interpreted, it is more often a source of humor—much to the chagrin of so-called “pajama mages”!</p><h3>Somnambulist</h3><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, your mastery over sleep magic has rendered you a persistent sleep-walker. While you are asleep, you can move around freely; you don’t fully perceive your environment while asleep, so you must navigate from memory. Additionally, you can copy spells to your spellbook while asleep.</p><h3>Deep Sleep</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, you add the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{sleep}</em> spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. Whenever you cast this spell, it is improved in the following ways:</p><ul><li>The total number of hit points that can be affected is equal to double the number rolled on the dice.</li><li>The radius of the spell is increased to 30 feet.</li><li>You can freely choose the order in which creatures are affected by a <em>sleep</em> spell you cast.</li></ul><h3>Mesmerize</h3><div><p>Beginning at 6th level, by performing a repetitive action for 1 minute, you can hypnotize a willing or unconscious creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you.</p><p>While hypnotized by you, it is semi-conscious and charmed by you. Other spells and effects that charm the creature or influence its mind have no effect while the creature is hypnotized. If you choose, you can cause a creature to repeat its saving throw against these effects, ending an effect on itself on a success.</p><p>The creature has the ability to perfectly recall its memories while hypnotized, including memories that have been magically altered or suppressed. While hypnotized, the creature will truthfully answer any question you pose to it.</p><p>Lastly, you can specify a single command word to be embedded in the creature’s subconscious for up to 24 hours. The first time the creature hears the command word while it isn’t hypnotized, it immediately performs the single action or repeats a certain phrase that you specified while the creature was hypnotized. The creature performs this action or speaks this phrase even if the effects of a spell would compel them to act otherwise.</p><p>The creature remains hypnotized by you for up to 1 hour, or until it takes damage or you end it early by snapping your fingers.</p></div><div><div><h3>Dreamspeaker</h3><p>At 10th level, you add the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.kSPRpeIx3w3nihrF]{dream}</em> to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast this spell, the messenger may jump between up to 12 creatures (each makes their saving throw against the spell separately), conversing with any or all of them. They can only appear monstrous to one of the targets, however, and the spell ends immediately after that option is utilized.</p><h3>Fitful Slumber</h3><p>When you reach 14th level, you can give creatures that you put to sleep terrible nightmares. At the start of their turn, you can choose to make any creature that is under the influence of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{sleep}</em> spell that you cast take 3d6 psychic damage. This damage can’t wake a creature up, nor can it reduce a creature below 1 hit point.</p></div></div>"

And you didn’t even bother to wipe your feet.</p><p>My name’s Valda—no relation to that <em>other</em> lich with godlike power. I might as well do you the courtesy of a tour, seeing as you’ll never leave this place alive.</p><p>I mean, really, when will you adventurers ever learn? Remote mausoleums named “Tomb of Doom” or “Mount Hell” or <em>“Spire of Secrets”</em> mean <em>keep out</em>. This whole place is a death trap! You saw the manticore swarm I put outside—nothing of value could possibly eclipse that! But you barged in <em>anyway</em>.</p><p>I suppose that means you’ll make a fine addition to my collection. See, I’ve made a habit of capturing you fools alive for a <em>museum of idiocy</em>, an exhibition of suicidal spelunkers. I think I’ve nearly got you categorized, too. Twenty-two neat little groups, organized by rank, age, and fatal ambition. Take a look around, you might even see a distant ancestor!</p><p>Welcome to my Spire! You’ll never escape.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\">–Valda</p><p></p><h2>Using this Book</h2><p>Written for both players and Game Masters, <em>Valda’s Spire of Secrets</em> builds upon the rules for 5th Edition with new rules that you can use with any setting, from published campaigns to worlds of your own creation. Think about this book like a content expansion for the core rules—it isn’t an update of the edition or a new core book. Everything within is optional, and none of it changes the game’s core mechanics or disagrees with its design principles. <em>Spire of Secrets</em> is 5th Edition to its core, but bigger and better in every way.</p><h3>Assembled Within</h3><p>Chapter 1 presents four brand new races, as well as a new and extraordinarily diverse variant race, the Near-Humans.</p><p>Chapter 2 brims with ten new classes, each complete with an array of subclasses.</p><p>Chapter 3 introduces new subclasses and occasionally new features for every class in the core rules.</p><p>Chapter 4 contains a bevy of customization options, including complete multiclassing rules for all classes, new single level classes called auxiliary levels, feats for characters of all types, and new starter feats, which allow players to create more complex characters without sacrificing core parts of their builds.</p><p>Chapter 5 explores exotic weapons and armor. It also introduces an array of firearms from throughout the ages and a collection of magic items.</p><p>Finally, Chapter 6 introduces a compendium of new spells for characters of every class.</p><p>In addition, the devious lich Valda has left his wry observations throughout the book. As someone who has faced—and killed—countless adventurers, he considers himself an expert on heroic taxonomy.</p><h2>A Letter from the Creator</h2><p>Six years of writing and game design has gone into the book before you. We never believed that we would still be writing content for 5th Edition after all these years, or that our efforts would yield such a tome, such a monument to design and careful iteration.</p><p>In truth, however, this book is a love letter to our players, to their characters, and to everyone who has brought our content to their table. We’ve written this as a gift to you, to enrich your games from afar and help you seize everything that roleplaying games have to offer. May your stories be the truest type of fiction, and may you roll 20s, just when you need them.</p><p>Your friends,</p><p style=\"text-align:right\">–Mage Hand Press </p>"

          "text": "<p>To see the furthest horizons, to set foot on new lands, to cross the breadth of continents: this is the substance of a ranger’s wanderlust. Rangers are consummate explorers, people who can survive in any environment—second only to druids in their connection to nature.</p><p>But the endless travel changes people. Rangers that rove out on long journeys seldom return the same. Their newly acquired skills and specialties manifest in an archetype, a focus of skills which sets them apart from other rangers, and indeed, all other warriors.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Ranger Subclasses</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger Archetype</td><td>Description</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.5SxxBygJ1D09Ld7k#beastborne]{Beastborne}</td><td>A type of lycanthrope, gradually transforms into a ferocious beast</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.5SxxBygJ1D09Ld7k#freerunner]{Freerunner}</td><td>An agile runner that uses their momentum to strike harder</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.5SxxBygJ1D09Ld7k#highwayman]{Highwayman}</td><td>An eagle-eyed specialist in opportunity attacks, ambushes, and heists</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.5SxxBygJ1D09Ld7k#spellbreaker]{Spellbreaker}</td><td>A witch-hunter and mage-killer with unique antimagic abilities</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.5SxxBygJ1D09Ld7k#trophy-hunter]{Trophy Hunter}</td><td>Hunts down the largest and most dangerous creatures to make trophies of the kill</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.5SxxBygJ1D09Ld7k#vigilante]{Vigilante}</td><td>Sometimes the city just needs a masked hero to punch crime in the face</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Beastborne</h2><p>Whether by infected bite or insidious curse, your blood was marked by the indelible stain of beasthood, a curse of lycanthropy. A new form, a primal, bestial self, lies just beneath your skin, awaiting the allure of blood and the thrill of a hunt to emerge in a terrible spectacle. Perhaps, if you can avoid the violence of combat or the siren call of moonlight, you can resist the lycanthropic urge. Or perhaps you see the infection as a blessing, a fearsome weapon, with claws that rend and teeth that bite.</p><h3>Shapechanger</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your body is stained by a lycanthropic curse which struggles to escape from you at all times. You gain the shapechanger subtype; your true form is a ghastly hybrid of beast and man. Additionally, you gain the following abilities:</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Keen Smell.</strong></em> You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</p><h3>Bestial Aspect</h3><p>At 3rd level, as blood is shed, you gradually lose control and slip into a beastlike form, ravenous and hungry for carnage. Whenever you take damage or deal damage to a hostile creature with an attack, add the total number together; this is your damage pool. You gain a bonus to your damage rolls, as well as additional beastlike abilities, according to your total damage pool, as shown on the Bestial Aspect table. After 1 minute of taking and dealing no damage, reset your damage pool to 0.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Bestial Aspect</td></tr><tr><td>Damage Pool</td><td>Damage Bonus</td><td>Ability</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>+2</td><td>You sprout a set of @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.peYDQZpLa8dmvZU5]{vicious claws}, which are natural weapons you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Your claws count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>+2</td><td>You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t silvered.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>+2</td><td>Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>+3</td><td>You gain blindsight with a range of 10 feet.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>+3</td><td>You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>+3</td><td>Your walking speed increases by an additional 10 feet (20 feet total).</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>+3</td><td>Your claws deal an extra 1d6 slashing damage on a hit.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Wolfbane Fury</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can whip yourself into a lycanthropic fury. As a bonus action, you can roll [[/r 4d6]] and add the total to your damage pool.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Howling Carnage</h3><p>Beginning at 11th level, whenever your damage pool exceeds 50, you attack three times with your claws, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><h3>Relentless Bloodlust</h3><p>By 15th level, not even death can hold back your transformation. When you are reduced to 0 hit points and aren’t killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Add the total damage you would have taken to your damage pool.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Freerunner</h2><p>Agile, evasive, and unmoored from the constraints that slow down other rangers, the archetypal freerunner is supremely nimble and capable of crossing terrain faster than anyone else. They accomplish this through a skilled combination of dashing, leaping, and nimbly climbing that guides them down clever paths through their environments. Moreover, an adept freerunner can convert the momentum from their gymnastics into deadly force, crushing their enemies with exceptional impact from unexpected directions.</p><p>A freerunner is most at home in a city or in the treetops of a great forest, for their unique movement requires a place that is steeped with complex geometry which reaches high into the sky. Of course, even on flat terrain, a freerunner’s agility is not to be underestimated, for they can dive through a giant’s legs or scurry up its back with ease.</p><h3>Freerunning</h3><p>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have trained extensively to move freely over and through any terrain using only the abilities of the body. You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to navigate obstacles while running and can use Dexterity in place of Strength when making a Strength (Athletics) check to climb, jump, or swing on a rope.</p><p>Additionally, you have mastered a number of techniques. You can use your freerunning techniques a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. While in your favored terrain, using a technique doesn’t count against your total number of uses.</p><p><em><strong>Slide.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can move up to 10 feet without spending movement through another creature’s space or squeeze up to 10 feet through a smaller space.</p><p><em><strong>Tumble.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can nimbly jump, dive, or roll up to 10 feet in a straight line without spending movement. During this movement, any opportunity attacks made against you have disadvantage.</p><p><em><strong>Wall Run.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can choose to run along a vertical surface as part of your movement. Until the end of your turn, you gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed. If you jump while running along a wall, you can complete the distance of your jump, even if doing so would exceed your speed.</p><h3>Momentum</h3><p>At 3rd level, if you move through a hostile creature’s space, leave a creature’s reach, or move at least 15 feet, you deal an extra 1d6 damage on the next weapon attack you make on your turn.</p><h3>Evasive Fighter</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, when you use a freerunning technique, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class until the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Hit Hard, Hit Fast</h3><p>Starting at 11th level, the extra damage from your Momentum feature increases to 2d6.</p><h3>Nimble Dodge</h3><p>At 15th level, when a spell or other effect forces you make a saving throw due to being within an area of effect, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed, potentially moving you outside the effect’s area.</p><h2>Highwayman</h2><p>For bandits, bank robbers, and green-clad folk heroes, there’s no better way to make money than robbing nobles at knifepoint, especially in caravans. None are more prosperous at roadside robbery, perhaps, than highwaymen, who leverage their stealth and superior numbers to steal anything they wish before escaping into the trees with their bounty. A team of bandits works in smooth coordination, watching each others’ backs in a choreographed theater of shouting, looting, and cutting down anyone who runs.</p><h3>Nobody Move!</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you’ve taken to working with a team of accomplices to rob lucrative, well-defended targets, such as caravans, banks, and groups of unsuspecting nobles. When a creature you can see provokes an opportunity attack from a friendly creature, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against it using a ranged or melee weapon.</p><p>This attack occurs before the provoking creature moves and before the friendly creature can make an opportunity attack.</p><h3>Merry Confederates</h3><p>At 3rd level, when you and two or more friendly creatures hide in preparation for an ambush, you and any friendly creatures hiding with you have advantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><h3>Vantage Point</h3><p>By 7th level, you can quickly scale walls to gain a perch above your foes. Climbing no longer costs you extra movement. Additionally, by climbing at half speed, you can climb up difficult surfaces (such as vertical walls) without making an ability check.</p><h3>No Seriously, Don't Move!</h3><p>Beginning at 11th level, your jumpy, shoot-them-in-the-back philosophy has started to show dividends. You can make two attacks with a ranged or melee weapon, instead of one, when you make an opportunity attack.</p><h3>Get Out of Dodge</h3><p>By 15th level, you’ll escape the long arm of the law or die trying. When you take the Disengage action on your turn, you gain two of the following benefits as a part of that action:</p><ul><li>You gain the benefits of the Dash action.</li><li>You can take the Use an Object action.</li><li>You can make one weapon attack against a creature you can see.</li><li>You can attempt to shove a creature.</li><li>You take half damage from falling and your jump distance doubles until the start of your next turn.</li></ul><h2>Spellbreaker</h2><p>When a wizard embraces forbidden, volatile magic, or a sorcerer loses control of their arcane power, a spellbreaker is not far behind. This ancient order of rangers tracks dangerous spellcasters, from rogue bards to demonic warlocks, and eliminates them before their magic can wreak havoc on an entire city or endanger the multiverse itself. They are trained in techniques to bypass magical defenses and rip small holes in the fabric of magic itself to catch unaware any spellcaster in their midst. While most spellbreakers execute their quarry or capture them for the authorities, a few still burn witches at the stake, earning all spellbreakers a grim reputation.</p><p>For this reason alone, a mage on the run has good reason to look over their shoulder and fear the spellbreaker’s arrival.</p><h3>Spellbreaker Magic</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Spellbreaker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Spellbreaker Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{detect magic}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.DQzlB5Y3k791W5bH]{see invisibility}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{scrying}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Antimagic Strike</h3><p>At 3rd level, you’ve mastered the mage-slaying technique of cutting through magic itself. Once on each of your turns, when you make an attack against a creature you can see, you can use your bonus action to deliver a small antimagic pulse. For the duration of the attack and damage rolls, the effects of spells targeting the creature, as well as the properties and powers of magic items worn or carried by the creature, are suppressed. This disrupts spells like <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.CKZTpZlxj7hjjo2H]{mage armor}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.X4c8xCkmF8U9HUMz]{mirror image}</em> which protect the creature, as well as spells like <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.22dPoeXfaaAv4K3h]{hellish rebuke}</em> which are triggered as a reaction to the attack or damage roll. On a hit, the creature takes an extra 1d6 force damage, or an extra 2d6 force damage if it was concentrating on a spell when it was attacked.</p><h3>Spell Resistance</h3><p>By 7th level, you can shake off even the most potent magic. You have advantage on saving throws you make against spells.</p><h3>Arcane Burst</h3><p>Beginning at 11th level, you’ve learned to rip at the fabric of magic itself. As an action, you can expend a spell slot to create a small arcane explosion centered on yourself in a 10-foot-radius sphere. Each creature other than you within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to half your ranger level, plus 1d8 for each level of the spell, or half as much on a successful save.</p><h3>Antimagic Curse</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, you’ve mastered the art of tearing small, persistent holes in the fabric of magic, and attaching them to unfortunate souls. As an action, you create a 5-foot diameter sphere of antimagic, centered on a point you choose within 60 feet, as per the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ]{antimagic field}</em>. If the point you choose is on a creature, the sphere moves with the creature. This <em>antimagic field</em> lasts for 1 minute, or until you choose to end it on your turn (no action required).</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Trophy Hunter</h2><p>Many rangers steal out into the wilds to slay dire beasts that encroach upon civilization, safeguarding cities and towns from their animalistic fury. But some rangers take this further, obsessing over a single kill at a time and hunting their quarry to the ends of the earth. Archetypal trophy hunters might track any creature, provided that it is as threatening as it is colossal, but are so named for the horns, claws, and teeth they bring back—trophies of a successful hunt.</p><h3>Visceral Attack</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can make the most out of a solitary strike. When you deal damage with a weapon attack, you can choose to deal maximum damage with that weapon’s damage dice. This ability doesn’t apply to additional sources of damage, such as from a rogue’s Sneak Attack or the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.0xmXiPiuYws1OGcX]{hunter’s mark}</em> spell.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Trophy</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can draw strength from your defeated enemies. Whenever you slay a Large or larger Beast, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, or Undead, you can take a body part as a trophy. You needn’t have dealt the killing blow, but you must have dealt damage to the creature during the combat that killed it. Harvesting a body part in this way is a process that takes 1 minute. Over the course of a long rest, you can apply a mixture of herbs and preservatives worth 50 gp to the body part, after which it becomes a trophy.</p><p>You can wear one trophy at a time, and when you take a short or long rest, you can change which trophy you are wearing. While wearing a trophy, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Creatures of the same type as the trophy are treated as your favored enemy.</li><li>You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls you make against creatures of the trophy’s type.</li><li>You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class and saving throws against the attacks and effects of creatures of the trophy’s type.</li></ul><p>Starting at 7th level, you can make a trophy from an Aberration, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, or Fiend you have slain.</p><h3>Clever Wrestler</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, your experience escaping from gnashing teeth, writhing tentacles, and slashing claws has made you hard to pin down. Whenever you are grappled, you can use a bonus action to end the grapple without making an ability check and move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.</p><h3>Fell The Leviathan</h3><p>At 11th level, you are a master of capitalizing on the weaknesses of larger foes. When you take the Attack action on your turn targeting a Large or larger creature, you can make an additional attack.</p><h3>Masterful Sidestep</h3><p>At 15th level, you are a blur across the field of battle, avoiding attacks that would slay others. When you are hit by an attack, you can use a reaction to immediately move half your movement without provoking opportunity attacks.</p><h2>Vigilante</h2><p>When evildoers run rampant and the city calls out for justice, vigilantes rise to the occasion. Clad in larger-than-life personas, capped off with capes, masks, pairs of tights, or some combination thereof, vigilantes embark on a crusade against villainy in all its forms. Many vigilantes are beacons of hope, dispatching foes with fighting prowess and dramatic flair, while others paint themselves as brooding anti-heroes, out for themselves and seeking some kind of vengeance against the criminal underworld.</p><h3>Heroic Magic</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Heroic Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Heroic Spells</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ZrTc23tToJ0JpH2h]{jump}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9eOZDBImVKxbeOyZ]{enhance ability}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.yfbK8gZqESlaoY5t]{fly}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.NJgxf7pmSsBArIG7]{private sanctum}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Masked Persona</h3><p>At 3rd level, you assume a costumed alter ego to conceal your identity as a crime fighter.

As a bonus action, you throw a concussive bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p><h3>Biff! Bam! Pow!</h3><p>Beginning at 11th level, you can unleash a barrage of punches in the name of justice! Whenever you make an unarmed strike on your turn, you can choose to make two unarmed strikes with disadvantage. These attacks always have disadvantage, regardless of circumstance.</p><h3>Catchphrase!</h3><p>By 15th level, your personal catchphrase has gained supernatural levels of cultural caché. You can utter your catchphrase whenever you hit a creature with an attack roll, beat a creature in an opposed Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check, or when you succeed on a saving throw. Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to all damage and can add your Wisdom modifier to damage rolls.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you score a critical hit on a hostile creature or finish a short or long rest.</p>"

        },
        "The Game": {
          "name": "The Game",
          "text": "<p>Siegeball is a game played between two teams of five players each. Each team has a tower to defend from the other team. Players can’t attack the towers directly, however. Instead, there is a single ball that can be used to knock the towers down. A team loses when their tower falls.</p><h2>The Arena</h2><p>The game is played in a walled, rectangular arena. Normally, this arena is 125 feet long by 45 feet wide (25 squares by 9 squares), though arenas of all sizes and shapes exist. Each team’s tower, a 5-foot-diameter pillar made of wood or loose stone, is set up 15 feet from each end of the arena lengthwise. Towers have 15 hit points and can only be damaged by the impact of the ball.</p><p>At higher tiers of play, the tower has more hit points, increasing by 20 hit points when the players reach 5th level (35), 11th level (55), and 17th level (75).</p><h2>The Ball</h2><p>Central to the game of siegeball is the ball, an especially dense sphere of solid rubber or wrapped leather that is pursued by the players. The ball is astoundingly heavy, and players move it by attacking it. Though some arenas have players strike the ball with their hands or feet, players are usually given specially crafted bats for the tasks. In especially dangerous arenas, players can be given warhammers or mauls.</p><p>The ball has AC 8 and is immune to poison and psychic damage. It also has a pool of momentum points (described as follows), which determines how fast it is moving.</p><h3>Attacking the Ball</h3><p>When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it in one of the eight cardinal directions. Instead of dealing damage to the ball on a hit, you give the ball a number of momentum points equal to half the damage dealt, rounded down. As the ball moves in the chosen direction, it subtracts one momentum point for every 5 feet it moves until it stops. The ball can collide with walls, players, or towers.</p><h3>Colliding With a Wall</h3><p>If the ball collides with a wall, it bounces off at an angle corresponding to its direction and continues to move until it stops.</p><h3>Colliding With a Player</h3><p>If you are not prone, you can use your reaction to hit the ball if it collides with you. To do so, make an attack roll targeting the ball. While moving, the ball has a bonus to its AC equal to its current momentum points. On a hit, roll damage as normal, remove the ball’s current momentum points, and send it in a new direction. If you miss, the ball hits you, and you take damage equal to the ball’s current momentum points and are knocked prone.</p><p>If you don’t use your reaction to stop the ball, it rolls past you.</p><h3>Colliding With a Tower</h3><p>If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to the tower equal to the ball’s current momentum points and then stops.</p><h3>Playing The Game</h3><div><p>The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the arena. One player from each team makes an attack roll against the ball. The player with the higher result successfully hits the ball. Other players begin in locations of their choice that are between 10 feet and 30 feet from the ball on their team’s side of the arena.</p><p>Players act in initiative order. If preferable, the GM can choose for the teams to take turns acting, instead of keeping track of the players individually. The game ends when a tower is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><h2>Siegeball Actions</h2><p>In addition to attacking, dodging, shoving, and dashing, (and occasionally using an item forbidden by the referees), there are a few special actions that players of a siegeball game might take.</p><h3>Block</h3><p>You dig in your heels and hold your ground. You have advantage on any ability check or saving throw you make to resist being moved against your will, and you can use your reaction to attack any ball that moves within 5 feet of you. Additionally, if the ball is within 5 feet of you, creatures you choose have disadvantage on attack rolls against it.</p><h3>Follow</h3><p>When you take this action, choose a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. When that creature moves, you attempt to follow behind it, moving up to your speed, while remaining the same distance between yourself and the lead creature for the entire duration of the movement.</p><h3>Retire</h3><p>When you take this action, you remove yourself from the field and sit out the rest of the game. This may be useful to free yourself from danger, but you can no longer help your team. You can use this action to retire an unconscious player within 5 feet of you.</p><h3>Tackle</h3><p>Performing a tackle is a special variant of shoving a creature, and can be taken in place of any attack you make with the Attack action on your turn. You make a Strength (Athletics) check with advantage contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses which check to make). If you succeed, both you and the target are knocked prone in the target’s space.</p><h3>Attack a Player (Illegally)</h3><p>In most games, an attack can only be made when the referee isn’t looking. When you make an attack against another player, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by the referee’s passive Perception score (usually 14). On a success, you attack the player without consequence. On a failure, you are removed from the game until the end of your next turn, and reenter the game on a side of the arena near your tower. Shoving, tackling, and grappling don’t count as attacks on other players.</p><p>In the cutthroat “Everything Goes” variant of siegeball, all attacks are legal and direct assaults against other players are even encouraged.</p><h3>Cast a Spell (Illegally)</h3><p>When you cast a spell in an arena that doesn’t allow magic, you can make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by the referee’s passive Perception score (usually 14). This roll has advantage if the target is within 5 feet of you, the effect of the spell doesn’t include any large audio or visual cues (like certain illusion spells or spells like <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{gust of wind}</em>), or the spell is cast without any components, such as via the sorcerer’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.fXa0DMhoVLtbBu9l]{Subtle Spell Metamagic}. It has disadvantage if the target of the spell is more than 5 feet away from you and the effect of the spell has obvious audio or visual cues. On a success, you cast the spell without consequence. On a failure, you are removed from the game until the end of your next turn, and reenter the game on a side of the arena near your tower.</p><p>Generally, magical abilities that don’t involve casting a spell, such as a paladin’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f]{Divine Smite}, don’t count as casting a spell. Inborn supernatural abilities like a dragonborn’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.KL7wx9Q8XNJQir0k]{Breath Weapon} may or may not count as casting a spell, at the referee’s discretion. Many more types of magic will be allowed in the “Limited Magic” variant of the game, and practically all spells and tactics are allowed with the lethal “Everything Goes” rules.</p><h2>Standards of Play</h2><p>Siegeball is a widely played sport and the exact rules and standards change wherever the game is played. The only universal rule of siegeball is that attacking your opponent’s tower directly is prohibited. In most arenas, using magic and attacking players directly are also considered cheating (though this doesn’t stop some witches and wizards from influencing the games anyway). However, other behaviors, like shoving opposing players or kicking dirt into their eyes, are tolerated and sometimes even encouraged.</p><p>In seedier games, siegeball is a violent, high-stakes competition with spellcasters on both sides attempting to secretly fix the game for their team, while players try to disguise outright attacks on their opponents as legitimate maneuvers. Bets on siegeball games range from a few silver pieces to bags of gold, and games are particularly cutthroat when fortunes are on the line.</p><p>The GM decides the arena’s standards of play, typically picking from among the following rules.</p><h3>Conventional</h3><p>Only conventional siegeball weapons are allowed in this game, and all magic is disallowed. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team.</p><p>This is the dominant system of rules for the game, practiced in the most prominent siegeball arenas.</p><h3>Everything Goes</h3><p>Magic, deadly weapons, direct attacks on players, and even murder are allowed in the game. Arenas that play with these rules are deemed “Blood Arenas” by spectators, and their players (who are paid handsomely for surviving) are more like gladiators than professional athletes. Expect these arenas in drow cities and other evil locales.</p><h3>Everything Goes (Limited)</h3><p>Magic and direct attacks on other players are allowed, but only conventional siegeball weapons are allowed, and outright murder disqualifies a team. These rules are typically held in run-down arenas in less prosperous cities where new siegeball teams might just get their start.</p><h3>All Weapons</h3><p>Weapons of any variety can be used in this game, up to and including massive warhammers and greatswords, but no magic of any sort is allowed. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team.</p><p>This variant of the rules is similar to the conventional rules, but allows for spectacular and dangerous weapons (and, of course, more deadly “accidents”). Particularly ravenous crowds flock to these games for the fleeting chance of watching blood being spilled.</p><h3>Limited Magic</h3><p>Some spells, specifically those which don’t directly deal damage to members of the other team, are allowed. At least one player on each team is encouraged to know the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}</em>. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team. Teleporting another player mid-game across the continent, however, is allowed.</p><p>These rules are more common where magic is viewed more favorably as a civilized art, rather than as the trickery of elves and witches. Though the spectators might seem more refined at first glance, they are just as ravenous for the blood and conflict of a good siegeball game.</p></div>"

The specifics of siegeball gear may vary, but all are designed from the same framework as conventional armor, fitting hardened leather and metal plates strategically to mitigate impact. Chiefly, however, siegeball gear places a focus on mobility, and so tends to be lighter and more flexible than conventional armor, if a bit less protective.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>One of siegeball’s biggest attractions is the bewildering variety of weapons used across the game. Some variants of the game allow any and all lethal weapons, which increases this variety (as well as the danger posed to players) tenfold.

The team’s signature strategy of fast, coordinated strikes on the tower earned them a string of Championship wins, but it has been almost a decade since their last Siegebowl appearance, causing many to think that the team is afflicted with some sort of curse.</p><h3>Manticores</h3><p>Eternal rivals of the Archons, the Manticores (two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.exoJlBD26HOPcOhV]{champions}</strong> and three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.0ZkAYb6ETfoPFGxY]{hunters}</strong>) are fierce competitors and favor extremely defensive tactics, blocking as many shots as possible and strategically locking the opposing team on the far side of the field from their tower. This team has seen quite a few scandals in their time, from dirty players to allegations of <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.VByE7G8WDrHSttHB]{jax}</em> abuse, but few of these ever amount to long-term issues for the team. Their fans are fervent supporters and will follow the team anywhere to see them win.</p><h3>Orc-A-Cola Ogres</h3><p>Sponsored by the incredibly popular drink, Orc-a-Cola, this team takes ample time before every match to promote their sponsor to the crowd. Though the Ogres are a competent team (four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.vLg1aRPtRhOm5ttl]{berserkers}</strong> and one <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.exoJlBD26HOPcOhV]{champion}</strong>, each with 14 Charisma), they are better showmen than players, and can curry ample favor from the audience and referees alike.</p><h3>Owlbearmen</h3><p>This small-town team (using the statistics of three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.exoJlBD26HOPcOhV]{champions}</strong>, one <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{commoner}</strong>, and a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.J8xjoG4Dxb8WkHtV]{veteran}</strong>) is the very definition of an underdog, having few wins under their belt until a recent streak of victories that has gained them matchups with far more seasoned teams. To their credit, they handle themselves very well, even in such tough matches. Their titular mascot is the mythical owlbearman: half-owl, half-bear, and half-man, whose iconic hoot-owl-scream has enchanted audiences everywhere they travel.</p></div><div><h3>Pinkskins</h3><p>The Pinkskins (five <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.vLg1aRPtRhOm5ttl]{berserkers}</strong>) are an orcish team, whose naked, pot-bellied human mascot is simultaneously offensive to humans and halflings alike. Despite outcry from human spectators, the orcish team has showed no sign of changing its name, and the lack of Championship Committee intervention has led many to believe that some behind-closed-doors transaction has secured the team’s identity.</p><h3>Rotters and Bone Brigade</h3><p>It’s a mystery how the necromancer Grach continues to be admitted into siegeball tournaments. Perhaps he charms the tournament runners, or perhaps he has financial leverage over numerous arena-owners. Regardless, Grach continues to enter teams in tournaments.</p><p>Grach (using <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.qkLNA1lKMMJpxuWg]{cultist}</strong> statistics) plays alongside the Rotters, his team of two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW]{zombies}</strong> and two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Hm4o2FgPZsdbXjLq]{flesh golems}</strong>. The golems, named Dr. Stein and Franklin, are 10 feet faster than the speed listed in their statistics, for they are composed of body parts salvaged from deceased professional siegeball players.</p><p>His backup team, The Bone Brigade, is a team of three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.nU8GN8La8DCt8SDb]{skeletons}</strong> and two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.Ck4LypcRIEyZ34eu]{bone beasts}</strong> fitted with siegeball gear and bats. These skeletons are surprisingly coordinated, and the bone dogs are exceptionally fast, making them a difficult matchup for most teams. But if Grach thinks the Bone Brigade might lose, he can employ one additional trick: by having the Bone Brigade carry additional bones into the arena, he can animate three additional <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.nU8GN8La8DCt8SDb]{skeletons}</strong>, as long as they aren’t already animated at the start of the match. This loophole is plainly unfair for the opposing team, but (probably for the same reason Grach is allowed to compete in the first place) the loophole has never been changed.</p><h3>Titans</h3><p>Boril and Dombd don’t need other teammates to be a legendary duo: these two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.68bAMIpe4jvDeR9G]{storm giants}</strong> love nothing more than to travel to the land of puny folk and crush them in their games. Out of the interest of fairness, they never cast spells during matches, even when it would be allowed, but have few qualms about accidentally stepping on their opponents.</p></div>"

Obstacles still abound in the street, and the hard, stone floor (as opposed to the more common grassy fields), means that the ball moves more smoothly, but so do your shoes. Players have @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb.JournalEntryPage.d3eBZOe9PUvZ7dKQ]{disadvantage} on ability checks and saving throws made against being knocked @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.y0TkcdyoZlOTmAFT]{prone}.</p><h3>Cemetery</h3><p>Despite its profound disrespect for the dead, this arena is built on an entire graveyard. Stones have been piled up between some mausoleums and large monuments to form a perimeter around the field, but dozens of headstones still pose obstacles to the ball.</p><h3>Conveyor Belts</h3><p>Dwarven innovation at its finest, this arena contains a series of hefty built-in conveyor belts. These belts move 5 feet twice every round: once on initiative count 20 and again on initiative count 10.</p><h3>Courtyard</h3><p>This cramped arena is contained within the garden of a castle keep. Of course, it is a fitting locale for the king’s private siegeball stadium, but is 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. Both towers are constructed to resemble statues of royal court attendees whom the king evidently despises.</p><h3>Dragon's Lair</h3><p>This magical arena, overseen by hundreds of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.5ngbctIMeEnuC1p1]{kobolds} and a looming @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.vFeFRlF2FOgf2HIL]{ancient red dragon}, is marked out within the dragon’s lair, directly atop its hoard. Towers are constructed of solid gold, and players will likely find the gold coin-laden slopes hazardous. Be warned: as much as the dragon enjoys his entertainment, he values his treasure more. A player that pilfers even a single coin will be devoured on sight.</p><h3>Forcefield Field</h3><p>The arena, conjured into being at the foot of a mage’s tower, is intersected by shimmering walls of force. The ball can roll freely through these walls, but players must navigate their way around them. In some games, the mage will summon a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.pOPQU4UnR27zA0jf]{minotaur} into the maze as well, just to spice things up.</p><h3>Foundry</h3><p>This arena is built above a large underground foundry. At regular intervals (at the start of every other round), two 15-foot-square grated vents on the field blast hot gas onto any creature standing atop them, dealing [[/r 3d6]] fire damage.</p><h3>Grove</h3><p>This ancient woodland grove has been converted into a siegeball arena (much to the chagrin of local druids). The immense trees, roots, and vines make for an interesting, if difficult to traverse, arena.</p><h3>Hilltop</h3><p>This arena is a field with a natural hill: there are two distinct planes and a slope between them running the arena’s length. Moving the ball up the slope costs one additional momentum point and moving the ball down the slope awards it an extra momentum point.</p><h3>Hooligans</h3><p>The rowdy crowd constantly throws refuse and obstacles at your team. If you begin your turn within 5 feet of an outermost wall, your walking speed is decreased by 5 feet until the end of your turn. If you hit the ball while in that area, you take [[/r 1d4]] bludgeoning damage from thrown bottles and rocks.</p><h3>Ice Level</h3><p>Buckets of water have been thrown on the field and left to freeze overnight (or else instantaneously frozen with magic) to create an arena of slick ice. Players have difficulty gaining speed and coming to a stop on this surface; they can only move in increments of 10 feet, and might collide with obstacles (and take [[/r 1d6]] bludgeoning damage) if they move too far. Players that take the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.6PfYpwxkdQkyS6b7.JournalEntryPage.t0XXMmv014K4vV3p#dash]{Dash} action must move the entire distance in a straight line.</p><h3>Labyrinth</h3><p>This arena contains dozens of short walls, quartering it off into three large fields connected by short mazes. Though players can bound the walls without issue, the ball can only leap over these walls at ramps located at a few strategic points. Learning the most efficient paths through these mazes is not difficult, but choosing the right direction to avoid enemies is key to winning a game.</p><h3>Low Gravity</h3><p>This entire arena is under the effects of a transmutation spell reducing the gravity within it. Players can jump twice as high and twice as far, and the ball gains an extra momentum point whenever it is hit.</p><h3>Misty Steps</h3><p>A huge fog bank (naturally or magically) blankets the entire arena. Players can only see up to half the field’s length.</p><h3>Mosaic Mayhem</h3><p>The floor of this arena is a mosaic of large, colored tiles. Depending on the game, tiles of a certain color might trigger spectacular, crowd-pleasing traps, collapse into temporary pit traps (the floor raising back up after a few moments), or launch players into the air.</p><h3>Mudball</h3><p>Pits have been dug in this field and filled with mud, which counts as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.aYmUMcQfSIqYWpKk.JournalEntryPage.vR9rCM0UXPM9zl43#difficult-terrain]{difficult terrain}. Furthermore, the ball can sink to the bottom of these mud pits; it loses 1 momentum point when it enters a pit, and if it stops within one, it takes 2 momentum points to remove it.</p><h3>Sidewinder</h3><p>This arena is designed with a horseshoe layout in mind. The towers are actually close together, but a long wall of bars running almost the length of the field separates them. The players and audience can see through the bars (and small players might be able to squeeze through them) but the ball can’t pass through.</p><h3>Underwater</h3><p>Players are bestowed with a temporary version of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.13uVuBQP6VaiSPvC]{water breathing}</em> spell to play in this completely underwater arena. The rules for underwater combat apply in full. The ball has been made perfectly buoyant, so that it neither sinks nor floats when at rest. The towers, for their part, have been constructed from floor to ceiling. When a team hits their opponent’s tower, their <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.13uVuBQP6VaiSPvC]{water breathing}</em> spells instantly wear off, forcing them to surface in order to gain the spell’s effects again.</p><h3>Warship</h3><p>This arena is actually the rolling deck of a massive warship. The audience of sailors crowds the edges, ensuring the ball doesn’t fall off the ship. At the start of each turn, the ball gains a momentum point in a random direction.</p>"

In fact, many of the characters and monsters in 5th Edition rely on magic, from clerics who acquire their spells from daily devotion, to bards who pluck magical effects on the strings of their lutes. Magic is ubiquitous to this edition, and so, therefore, are spells.</p><p>This chapter contains a compendium of new spells.

These tags are as follows:</p><h2>Chronomancy</h2><p>Chronomancy spells, marked with the (chronomancy) tag, pull at the very fabric of time and manipulate causal events. This rare and elusive magic is largely practiced by spellcasters known as chronomancers, who walk between the ages and glimpse the beginning and end of time. Sometimes the use of chronomancy is policed by organizations which lie outside the typical restrictions of time and space, which might make learning even the most rudimentary time-manipulation spells a challenge.</p><p>The spells <em>haste</em>, <em>slow</em>, and <em>time stop</em> also deserve the (chronomancy) tag, but have been familiar to spellcasters far longer than spells like <em>delay</em> and <em>paradox</em>.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Chronomancy Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.xFe9AW7zSCdaei25]{Accelerate/Decelerate}</em></td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.9FUDndISAUSBPXwC]{Evasiveness}</em></td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.fIa2fjGkmGYyQQm3]{Paradox}</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.AZZpiToGb0rComZ4]{Action}</em></td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.GiJHxLZE4w1tAC0f]{Impressions of the Past}</em></td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.QXWmlKQ6bYwjYF5Z]{Recall}</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.7HYguuqIMSQubkCh]{Delay}</em></td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.9zL5uBBCOrTQ9jGG]{Instant Replay}</em></td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.DzIsnswbtWMfiHdS]{Time Hop}</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.icNIE8yX8jXcvmZ7]{Dire Warning}</em></td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.lOKCzEGQ1zyiTrlz]{Moment to Think}</em></td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.Yeh7pyXCLJvhBNQ7]{Time’s Arrow}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><table border=\"1\"><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Chronomancy Spells By Level</td></tr><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spell</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cantrip</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.lOKCzEGQ1zyiTrlz]{Moment to Think}</em></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.xFe9AW7zSCdaei25]{Accelerate/Decelerate}</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.AZZpiToGb0rComZ4]{Action}</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.9zL5uBBCOrTQ9jGG]{Instant Replay}</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.DzIsnswbtWMfiHdS]{Time Hop}</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.Yeh7pyXCLJvhBNQ7]{Time’s Arrow}</em></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.7HYguuqIMSQubkCh]{Delay}</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.QXWmlKQ6bYwjYF5Z]{Recall}</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.icNIE8yX8jXcvmZ7]{Dire Warning}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.9FUDndISAUSBPXwC]{Evasiveness}</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.GiJHxLZE4w1tAC0f]{Impressions of the Past}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.fIa2fjGkmGYyQQm3]{Paradox}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Renaissance</h2><p>The renaissance age saw dramatic revolutions in logic and science, which magic subsequently learned to harness. Spells from the renaissance age are marked with the (renaissance) tag, but might apply to much later ages as well. Spells which affect or emulate firearms, for example, are relevant even in modern and futuristic settings. As such, GMs might choose to exclude or focus on spells with this tag, depending on the campaign setting.</p><p>Renaissance-era spells represent a magical arms race with the rise of newly-created firearms, such that trained mages can disable firearms with spells such as <em>jam weapon</em> or enhance them with spells such as <em>chromatic bullet</em>.

Choose a creature within range that is known to you as the target of this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Charisma saving throw to resist this effect. The target is placed at a location of your choice within 30 feet of you. You choose if the target is sitting, standing, prone, or bound with nearby restraints. At the end of the spell’s duration, you can choose whether the target remains at your location or is teleported back to the location from which it was abducted.</p><h2>Aberrate</h2><p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p><p>This spell causes your anatomy to become fluid, constantly refreshing into new and more terrible shapes. For the duration, you do not take extra damage from critical hits.</p><p>Additionally, your body adapts to threats as it warps. Immediately after you take damage while this spell is active, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to that damage type until this spell ends or until you use this ability again to gain resistance to a different damage type. This resistance doesn’t apply to the triggering damage.</p><h2>Accelerate/ Decelerate</h2><p><em>1st-level transmutation (chronomancy)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 reaction, which you take when a creature you can see within 60 feet is hit with an attack</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of oil or a drop of molasses)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>This spell speeds up or slows down an attack the instant before it strikes, lessening or multiplying its force.</p><p><em><strong>Accelerate.</strong></em> Increase the damage the target takes by 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Decelerate.</strong></em> Reduce the damage the target takes by 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier (to a minimum of 0 damage).</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the change in damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p><h2>Accursed Act</h2><p><em>1st-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense or a black candle)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>Lighting a candle, you speak dark curses in a lost tongue, directed at one creature you can see within range. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While cursed, the creature takes psychic damage once per turn equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier whenever it attacks or casts a spell. If the target doesn’t attack or cast a spell on its turn, it can repeat its saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell ends this curse early.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you deal an additional 1d8 psychic damage for each slot level above 1st.</p><h2>Action</h2><p><em>1st-level transmutation (chronomancy)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p><p>Choose a willing creature that you can see within range.

That creature gains the following benefits for the duration:</p><ul><li>The target can take the Dash action as a bonus action.</li><li>The target can hover.</li><li>The target has advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.</li><li>The target doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.</li></ul><h2>After Image</h2><p><em>3rd-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a silver hand mirror worth 50 gp)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p><p>You create an illusory duplicate of yourself which follows your every movement. When you are hit by an attack during the spell’s duration, roll any die. On an odd roll, the attack targets and hits the duplicate instead of you. The duplicate vanishes, reappearing after you move 10 feet or more or take the Dodge action. On an even roll, the attack targets you as normal.</p><h2>Antiballistics Field</h2><p><em>6th-level abjuration (renaissance)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (40-foot-radius sphere)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pinch of wet gunpowder)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>An invisible 40-foot-radius field of magic extends from you, disrupting bullets and causing firearms to malfunction. Within the sphere, attacks with firearms fail, and firearms used to make an attack immediately jam. A jammed firearm can’t be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.</p><p>Firearms outside the sphere which are fired into it have disadvantage on attack rolls, and deal only half damage on a hit.</p><h2>Arc Blade</h2><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (5-foot radius)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a melee weapon)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, except that any damage dealt by the attack is lightning damage instead of its normal type. Additionally, an arc of lightning jumps to a creature you choose within 5 feet of the target, dealing 1d6 lightning damage.</p><p>This spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage, and the secondary damage deals an additional 1d6 lightning damage to their targets. Both damage rolls increase by one die at 11th level (2d8 and 3d6) and 17th level (3d8 and 4d6).</p><h2>Arcane Anomaly</h2><p><em>1st-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (30-foot radius)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a broken mirror)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You spread cracks in the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. For the duration, whenever a spell is cast within range, roll a d6. On a 1, the spell casting fails, expending a spell slot as normal, but not consuming expensive material components.</p><h2>Arcane Capacitor</h2><div><p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a potato)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>You channel a wave of arcane power into your fingertips, recycling the leftover energy into a new spell slot. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 force damage. Whether you hit or miss, you then regain one expended 1st-level spell slot.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you instead regain an expended 2nd-level spell slot. If you cast it using a 9th-level spell slot, you instead regain an expended 3rd-level spell slot.</p><h2>Benign Dismemberment</h2><p><em>3rd-level necromancy (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p><p>For the duration, a willing target’s body parts (fingers, legs, tail, and even its head) can be harmlessly severed from its body. It takes no damage from such dismemberment, as long as the cut removing the body part is swift and leaves a clean cut. The target’s head remains alive and conscious, and parts connected to it also remain alive. All severed body parts become inanimate, but do not begin decomposition for the spell’s duration. Any of the target’s severed body parts that are removed during this spell’s duration can be held back to the stump, which instantly causes the part to knit to the stump, restoring the body part.</p><p>At the end of the duration, severed body parts become permanently severed. The target dies if vital organs have not been reattached to its head.</p><h2>Blood Print</h2><p><em>1st-level necromancy (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an ounce or more of blood)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>At your touch, wet blood on a surface shifts and reforms into a pattern of crimson blotches. This blood print is unique to the particular creature to whom the blood belongs, but you can determine the creature’s kind (such as human, gnoll, deer, or fire giant) by examining the general shape. A print can be preserved by pressing a sheet of paper against it. If this spell is cast twice, it is possible to match samples of blood originating from the same creature by comparing the prints.</p><h2>Boomering</h2><p><em>1st-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>A dizzying ring of sparks launches from your outstretched hand and ricochets back to you moments later. Make a ranged spell attack roll against a creature within range. On a hit, you deal 3d6 radiant damage. If this attack misses, you can repeat the attack roll against the same target once.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p><p>If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, after the ring hits the first target, it ricochets to a second target of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the first target, dealing damage as normal on a hit. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the ring can ricochet to a third target of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the second target. No matter how many creatures the ring ricochets to, you can only repeat the attack roll against one of the spell’s targets.</p><h2>Burning Blade</h2><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (5-foot radius)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a melee weapon)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p><p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, except that any damage dealt by the attack is fire damage instead of its normal type. Additionally, embers whirl in the target’s space. Until the start of your next turn, when a creature enters the space for the first time or ends its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 fire damage to the creature, ending the spell.</p></div><div><p>This spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an additional 1d6 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the secondary damage deals an additional 1d6 fire damage to its target. Both damage rolls increase by one die at 11th level (2d6 and 3d6) and 17th level (3d6 and 4d6).</p><h2>Burnt Offering</h2><p><em>1st-level abjuration (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pyre and slain animal)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p><p>By constructing a pyre and burning an animal’s corpse, you court the favor of the gods. For the duration, while you are wearing armor, you can add your Wisdom modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, to your Armor Class.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can also reroll one saving throw you make during the duration. You can choose to reroll the saving throw after you roll the die, but must decide before the outcome is determined and must use the new roll.</p><h2>Candy Blast</h2><p><em>Conjuration cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>You summon a handful of hard candy—boiled sweets, mints, jelly beans, etc.—and hurl them at a target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, and the space it is standing in, up to a 5-foot square, becomes difficult terrain until a creature uses an action to gather up the fallen candy. The candy produced by this spell is edible, but has no nutritional value.</p><p>This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p><h2>Card Trick</h2><p><em>Transmutation cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a deck of playing cards)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>With a flash of your hands, you fling a playing or tarot card charged with energy at your opponents. Choose whether you make a ranged spell attack roll or for the target to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a hit or a failed saving throw, the target takes 1d6 force damage.</p><p>This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p><h2>Caustic Blade</h2><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (5-foot radius)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a melee weapon)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, except that any damage dealt by the attack is acid damage instead of its normal type. If you miss by 3 or less, acid splashes on the target, and you instead deal 1d8 acid damage.</p><p>This spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an additional 1d8 acid damage to the target on a hit, and the acid damage dealt on a miss increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by one die at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).</p><h2>Cheat</h2><p><em>Divination cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> S, M (a weighted die)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p></div><div><p>You subtly twist your fingers, and fate seems to follow suit. For the duration, you can reroll any ability check you make to play nonmagical games of chance. Therefore, this spell could influence a game of poker, but not the result of a <em>deck of many things</em>.</p><h2>Chromatic Bullet</h2><p><em>1st-level evocation (renaissance)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a firearm)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack using a firearm during the spell’s duration, your bullet sparks with elemental energy. The attack deals an extra 2d4 damage to the target. You choose whether this additional damage is acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, and you can choose to change the firearm’s damage to one of these damage types. You do not need to pick the same damage type for both.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.</p><h2>Clue</h2><p><em>1st-level divination (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a magnifying glass and pipe)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p><p>When you cast this spell, all footprints and fingerprints within a 45-foot radius of a point you touch become highlighted and glow faintly for the duration. At the time of casting, choose any period of time up to the last 10 days to the present; only footprints and fingerprints left within that time will be highlighted. Each creature whose footprints or fingerprints are detected by the spell is assigned a unique color, but are not otherwise identified. Any creature that moves or touches objects in the area will also leave colorful footprints and fingerprints, which might reveal invisible creatures in the area.</p><h2>Concealed Shot</h2><p><em>Illusion cantrip (renaissance)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> S, M (a ranged weapon)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make an attack with a ranged weapon, otherwise the spell fails. The attack’s projectile is invisible while in flight, and the weapon itself is silent. If the weapon is a firearm, this spell suppresses the smoke and light the weapon produces, making it impossible to see or hear where the shot came from.</p><p>This spell only conceals the first shot you make; any additional shots aren’t concealed.</p><h2>Conjure Cannonball</h2><p><em>3rd level conjuration (renaissance)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 600 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small replica cannon)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>You summon a cannonball, mid-flight and at full velocity, which explodes on impact. Make a spell attack roll against a target you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage, and each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot above 3rd.</p><h2>Conjure Cover</h2><p><em>1st-level conjuration (ritual) (renaissance)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a duck figurine)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p><p>You conjure a low cobblestone wall along the ground, a perfect source of cover, at a point you can see within range. The wall is 18 inches thick and is composed of three 5-foot long by 3-foot high segments. Each segment must be contiguous with at least one other segment.</p><p>A Medium creature that hunkers behind the wall has half cover from ranged attacks, and a Small creature that hunkers behind it has three-quarters cover from ranged attacks. A prone creature has total cover behind the wall. The wall can be leapt over without using any additional movement.</p><p>Each segment has AC 10 and 60 hit points. Reducing a segment of the wall to 0 hit points causes it to crumble, destroying it. The wall disappears when all the segments are destroyed or the spell ends.</p><h2>Consecrated Armor</h2><p><em>1st-level abjuration (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of blessed oil)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p><p>You trace a holy symbol on your chest, and an invisible barrier protects you until the spell ends. Your base AC becomes 12 + your Dexterity modifier. If you are attacked by a Fiend or Undead, your AC becomes 15 + your Dexterity modifier against that attack. You can use your consecrated armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your consecrated armor.</p><h2>Corruption Curse</h2><p><em>6th-level necromancy</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>With a piercing glare and a sinister gesture, you send a ribbon of dark magic into a target’s body. A creature you can see within range is cursed for the duration and suffers from one of the following effects of your choice while cursed:</p><p><em><strong>Dull Reflexes.</strong></em> The target has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws.</p><p><em><strong>Feeble Fortitude.</strong></em> The target has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and can’t regain hit points.</p><p><em><strong>Weak Will.</strong></em> The target has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws as well as spell attack rolls.</p><p>A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell cast using a spell slot of 6th level or higher ends this curse early.</p><h2>Cryptogram</h2><p><em>Conjuration cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Unlimited</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small written message)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>You send a small scroll with a short message to a creature of your choice. The recipient must be a creature known to you and also be on the same plane of existence as you. This scroll will hover in front of the recipient, drop into their pocket, or appear sitting on something nearby. The scroll’s message can be up to 8 characters long (spaces count as characters). You can send only one scroll to a single target each day.</p><h2>Curse of Binding</h2><p><em>7th-level enchantment (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a body part from the intended target, such as a fingernail, a lock of hair, or a drop of blood)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p><p>You bind one creature or object to a location, cursing it so that it may never leave. Choose a target and a location within range, both of which you must be able to see. If the target is a creature, it must make a Charisma saving throw (a willing creature may choose to fail this save), or be cursed to be permanently bound to the chosen location. While cursed, the target can act and move around freely, as long as it remains within 20 feet of the point it is bound to. If the target begins its turn outside of this area, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be dragged 60 feet toward the point it was bound to.</p><p>Additionally, if the creature tries to use extraplanar travel, it must make another Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the travel attempt fails and any resources used are wasted. On a success, the curse is suppressed until the creature returns to the plane on which it was bound, at which point the dragging effect resumes.</p><p>A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher ends this curse early.</p><h2>Curse of Blades</h2><p><em>3rd-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>Unholy bands of black energy tie a creature to its weapon.

Choose two creatures you can see within range of the spell, and within 30 feet of each other, to each make a Constitution saving throw. A willing creature can choose to fail this saving throw. On a failed save, a target is cursed for the duration. If only one target is cursed by this spell, you can use your action or bonus action on a subsequent turn to choose another target within 30 feet of the cursed creature to make a saving throw. While two creatures are cursed by this spell, they are unable to willingly move further away from each other.</p><p>A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell ends this curse early.</p><h2>Curse Ward</h2><p><em>2nd-level abjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p><p>You reach out your hand and touch a willing creature within your reach, raising a smoke-like barrier around it.

The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration, or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can empower it with your own life essence by losing 10, 15, or 20 hit points when you cast it. When you do so, treat the spell slot used to cast the spell as being one level higher if you lost 10 hit points, two levels higher if you lost 15 hit points, and three levels higher if you lost 20 hit points, up to a maximum of 9th level.</p><p>When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save.</p><p>Additionally, when a creature tries to leave the sphere of fog, you can choose for the fog to grasp the creature with misty tendrils.

The skeletons can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature.</p><p>The manor contains a 15-foot cube vault, which is an extradimensional space.

A creature has disadvantage on this saving throw if the scythe comes to rest in the creature’s space.</p><p>If you are within 120 feet of the scythe at the start of your next turn, it returns to you in a 10-foot wide line, forcing creatures within its area of travel to make saving throws against the scythe’s damage.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p><h2>Game of Fate</h2><p><em>6th-level enchantment</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a gaming set)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p><p>You magically compel a creature within range to a nonmagical game with vital consequences.

The target has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws it makes to maintain concentration on a spell due to this damage. Additionally, on a failed save, the target is poisoned until the start of your next turn.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><h2>Heart of Darkness</h2><p><em>9th-level necromancy</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self (1-mile radius)</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (A Humanoid heart prepared with onyx and diamond dust worth at least 10,000 gp)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p><p>When you cast this spell, you stab a black, ritualistically prepared Humanoid heart. The ichor from the heart infects the land with foul necromantic energies, causing up to one hundred piles of bones or corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids within a 1-mile radius to rise from the dead, becoming skeletons or zombies (the GM has the creatures’ game statistics). The Undead dig their way out of graves, smash their way out of mausoleums, and tear down cemetery gates.</p><p>The creature that is holding the heart can use its action to issue a general command to all Undead created by the spell, such as to destroy a town or hunt down a particular creature. Only one general command can be issued to the Undead every 24 hours. If not issued a command, the Undead indiscriminately attack living creatures, other than the creature that is holding the heart and creatures designated by it. Once given an order, the Undead continue to follow it to the best of their ability until the task is complete.</p><p>Even while you hold the heart, the Undead aren’t directly under your control, and therefore don’t count against any limitations of Undead you can command.</p><p>The Undead remain animated until the spell ends. The spell ends if the heart is destroyed (AC 20, HP 10, immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage) or targeted by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}</em> spell cast as a 9th-level spell.

Choose a creature you can see within range to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes [[/r 2d6]] necrotic damage and is cursed for up to one minute. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and is not cursed. While the target is cursed, you can use your action to deal [[/r 1d6]] necrotic damage to it automatically. The curse ends early if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is ever outside the spell’s range, or if the target has total cover from you.

A Small or smaller creature fully sinks into the ground after 2 rounds of sinking, a Medium creature fully sinks after 3 rounds, and a Large creature fully sinks after 4 rounds.

Make a melee spell attack using your own spell attack modifier. On a hit, the target takes [[/r 3d8]] slashing or cold damage (your choice).</p><p><em><strong>Imprison.</strong></em> The claw grabs a Large or smaller creature within 10 feet of itself.

On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand, but on a failure it takes 1d8 cold damage. While a creature is restrained by the hand, the hand can’t imprison or slash another creature. The claw can slash a creature it has restrained.</p><p><em><strong>Release.</strong></em> The claw releases an imprisoned target, which is no longer restrained.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of the Slash and Imprison options increases by 1d8 for each spell slot above 3rd.</p><h2>Icicle Javelin</h2><p><em>1st-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time</strong><em><strong>:</strong></em> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a small icicle)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>You fling a massive icicle toward a target of your choice within range.

Choose one creature you can touch to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour and is cursed to forget its identity. When the target awakens, it loses all its personal memories, though the target retains all of its general knowledge, proficiencies, and other statistics. The target won’t realize it has any class features or special abilities, and so doesn’t willingly make use of them. If left to its own devices, the target will quickly adopt a new name and begin to build a new identity.</p><p>A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell cast using a 9th-level spell slot ends this curse.

The boulder also crushes nonmagical objects smaller than itself in its path. If the boulder reaches its target, it rolls over it and continues on, completing its 60-foot movement. The boulder continues to pursue its target for the duration, rolling over it more than once if possible.</p><p>After the spell ends, the boulder continues to pursue its target for up to 24 hours. Once the boulder strikes its target after the spell ends, it immediately vanishes.</p><h2>Inexorable Sarcophagus</h2><p><em>6th-level necromancy</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a finely made miniature sarcophagus worth at least 1,000 gp)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You toss a palm-sized sarcophagus at an unoccupied point you can see within range, where it grows to full size in an instant and attempts to ensnare a Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of it with grimy gauze.

If it successfully saves against this spell three times, it twists free of the gauze, ending the spell. If it fails three times, the sarcophagus slams shut and sinks deep into the earth. The creature is wrapped head to toe by the gauze and becomes incapacitated. The spell ends, but the sarcophagus remains buried in the earth. The sarcophagus has 1 minute of air, and the creature begins to suffocate after this time.</p><p>If a Humanoid dies within the sarcophagus, they rise 24 hours later as a mummy under your control, as per the spell create undead.

If an object leaves your hand, it also becomes frozen in time.</p><h2>Nondescript</h2><p><em>2nd-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>This spell makes you seem ordinary and nondescript to others, though it doesn’t change your actual appearance. Creatures who see you while you are under the influence of this spell are unable to recall specific details of your appearance upon being asked if they had seen you or someone matching your description, though their memory of actions you undertook or events they experienced is unaffected.</p><h2>Paradox</h2><p><em>9th-level transmutation (chronomancy)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>By twisting the flow of time into knots, you cause one action of your choice taken within range within the last round to be undone. Reality then reasserts itself, recoiling from the damage caused by removing an event from time. The direct effects of that action, such as damage dealt by an attack or spell, are undone, but the indirect effects, such as creatures choosing to move to different locations, are not. The creature that took the action takes [[/r 10d8]] psychic damage, as it copes with its history being modified.</p><h2>Perforating Smite</h2><p><em>2nd-level evocation (renaissance)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>The next time you make an attack with a firearm before this spell ends, the shot is charged with an incredible amount of power. Instead of making an attack roll against a single target, the shot becomes a 5-foot-wide line that extends from you out to the weapon’s normal range. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes the weapon’s normal damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><h2>Petal Storm</h2><p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a handful of flower petals)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>Choose an unoccupied 15-foot cube of air that you can see within range. An elemental force of swirling winds appears in the cube and lasts for the spell’s duration. The cloud heavily obscures its area.</p><p>Any creature that enters the storm for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/r 3d4]] slashing damage. As a bonus action, you can move the storm up to 30 feet in any direction. The first time storm’s area contains leaf litter, flowers, bushes, or trees, it sucks up extra material and the damage the spell deals increases by 2d4.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.</p><h2>Phantasmal Beauty</h2><p><em>3rd-level illusion</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You tap into the dreams of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest desires, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes incapacitated and unable to move for the duration. In addition, it has disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks it makes. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.</p><h2>Phantom Grapnel</h2><p><em>Evocation cantrip</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>You conjure a chain and hook made of magical force, which you propel at a creature or unoccupied space you can see within range. When you target a space or a creature of Huge size or larger, your grapnel pulls you to that target in a straight line. You provoke opportunity attacks for this movement as normal. When you target a creature of Large size or smaller, you pull the target up to 10 feet toward you. A creature can make a Strength saving throw to resist this movement.</p><h2>Pharaoh's Curse</h2><p><em>5th-level necromancy</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p><p>Opening your palm, you release a puff of dust, the pestilence of mummy rot. Choose one creature within range to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by [[/r 3d6]] for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust.</p><p>The curse lasts until removed by a spell or magical effect that cures mummy rot. A <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell cast using a spell slot of 5th level or higher also ends this spell.</p><h2>Pillar of Salt</h2><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of lantern oil and a pinch of sulfur)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>You deliver a mote of divine wrath to a point you can see within range. Each creature you choose in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw.

These arms are fully functional and can be used to hold weapons and shields (allowing the target to hold 2 two-handed weapons, or 4 one-handed weapons), perform somatic components of spells, and perform other actions, though the arms themselves don’t grant the target additional actions. For the duration, the target has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made using the additional arms. Also, if the arms are used to carry weapons, the target can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack using the arms.</p><h2>Prehensile Hair</h2><p><em>1st-level transmutation (ritual)</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a braided rope)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p><p>You grow unduly long and tough hair (even from your eyebrows) which you can manipulate at will.

Any creature within range that is near three or more other creatures which speak the same language as them believes that they hear the rumor being repeated by someone nearby.

Generally, creatures won’t be outright hostile upon hearing even the most vicious rumors, but hearing a rumor can affect their disposition positively or negatively.</p><h2>Rusting Grasp</h2><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p><p>You conjure a potent acid at your fingertips, which can corrode metal and burn flesh. Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object within your reach. On a hit, a creature takes [[/r 6d4]] acid damage and, if it is wearing nonmagical metal armor or wielding a nonmagical metal shield, you can corrode either its armor or shield. Corroded armor takes a permanent and cumulative -3 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed. A corroded shield is destroyed.</p><p>If you target a nonmagical metal object with this spell that isn’t being worn or carried, you corrode and destroy parts of the object you choose that can fit within a 1-foot cube.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

The specter knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the specter is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. There is a 5% chance that this spell contacts the wrong spirit, one which will answer questions untruthfully or ambiguously.</p><h2>Skirmish</h2><p><em>3rd-level transmutation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a branch from a tree)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p><p>You enhance the mobility of one willing creature you touch, enabling them to move easily through enemy formations.

Once the corpse attacks, it once again crumples into a heap. A corpse targeted by this spell doesn’t become an Undead creature.</p><p>This spell’s damage increases as you gain levels.

At that time, the missile moves suddenly, as if it was just fired or thrown with a range of 120 feet. If a creature is in the line of fire, the missile makes an attack using your spell attack modifier.

The accountant can perform intellectual tasks that a human clerk could do, such as assessing prices, updating accounts, managing inventories, or computing interest.

The accountant can perform no physical labor, and is not able to lift any object heavier than 1 pound.</p><p>If you command the accountant to perform a task that would move it more than 300 feet away from you, the spell ends.</p><h2>Watery Tentacles</h2><p><em>4th-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (an octopus tentacle)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>When you cast this spell, three tentacles made of water appear around your body for the duration.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use a bonus action to expand the area of the fire by up to ten additional 5-foot cubes that each have a face adjacent to the face of another cube of fire. The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.</p><p>When a creature moves into the area of fire for the first time or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes [[/r 8d8]] fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.</p><h2>Winter Flower</h2><p><em>6th-level evocation</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a crystal flower)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p><p>You cause a Tiny white flower to sprout at a point on the ground you can see within range. The flower has an AC of 15, 1 hit point, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold damage. During the spell’s duration, you can use a bonus action to command it to explode in a shower of ice. Alternatively, the flower will explode if it is reduced to 0 hit points. When the flower explodes, each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/r 10d8]] cold damage, or half as much on a successful one. The flower withers and dies if it doesn’t explode within 24 hours.</p><p>If you cast this spell again while it is active, you can maintain the flower’s existence for another 24 hours. You can create a permanent flower by casting this spell on the same flower for seven days.</p><h2>Zephyr's Feather</h2><p><em>1st-level conjuration</em></p><p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> Self</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a dove’s feather)</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p><p>You wave your hand and three alabaster feathers, magically sharpened to a razor’s edge, appear and orbit around you. When you cast this spell, make a ranged spell attack using one of your feathers against a creature within 120 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes [[/r 2d8]] slashing damage. Until the spell ends, while you have feathers remaining, you can make an attack using a feather on each of your turns as an action.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st, up to a maximum of 6d8. You gain an additional two feathers when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher (5 feathers), and two more when you cast it using a spell slot of 5th level or higher (7 feathers).</p></div>"

          "text": "<p>Adopting the fearsome claws of a monstrosity or the scorching breath of a dragon is an unusual but surefire way to gain an advantage over one’s foes. However, many find the practice of Xenoalchemy, or Graftworking—which involves surgically attaching monstrous parts onto a humanoid body—distasteful, if not outright revolting. This fringe science, obsessed with the appendages and organs of monsters, can replace the limbs of amputees, grant adventurers the uncanny ability to see in the dark, and empower them with unconventional weapons and senses.</p><h3>Harvesting a Graft</h3><p>Grafts are harvested from the fresh corpses of monsters, slain within the last 48 hours or preserved by <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.n4JDcFKe5ikzYmAc]{gentle repose}</em> or a similar spell. Harvesting a graft from a corpse takes 10 minutes. Only one graft can be harvested from each corpse. If the graft is too large or too small for the target creature, it is alchemically enlarged or reduced to fit. You can’t harvest grafts from Tiny creatures or from Gargantuan creatures.</p><p>Different types of monstrous grafts can only be harvested from monsters with specific properties, as specified in the graft’s Donor section.</p><h3>Attaching a Graft</h3><p>Attaching a graft for the first time is a laborious surgical procedure, normally removing an original body part. This procedure takes one hour and requires a healer’s kit, alchemist’s supplies, and a knife (or a facility with access to such tools), as well as someone with proficiencies in these tools or with the Medicine skill to perform the operation. A monstrous graft is permanent until replaced with another graft.</p><p>This surgery is intensive and necessitates recovery time. When you finish installing a monstrous graft into your body, you lose half your current hit points and all of your Hit Dice. For 24 hours after installation, you can’t use the graft’s abilities, as you adjust to its presence. Replacing a graft or adding a new graft in its body slot takes only 30 minutes. You still lose half your hit points when replacing a graft, but you don’t lose Hit Dice.</p><h3>Body Slots</h3><p>Each graft takes up one of the following slots: Arms, External, Head, Internal, or Legs. You can’t have more than one graft in the same slot. For instance, if you already have an arm graft, you must remove it before you can attach a different arm graft.</p><blockquote><p>Foundry Note: There's no way to track this, the player is going to have to keep track of this manually. The player and GM will have to work together to make sure the player follows this. Use the biography section in the character sheet to link to each of the graphs…</p></blockquote><h3>Cost</h3><p>Not all grafts can be easily obtained, but when grafts can be purchased, suggested prices are shown on the Graft Cost table below. Most of these can be acquired at even cheaper rates if one is willing to track down a disreputable establishment specializing in dealing grafts and accept the risks inherent to an unsanitary operation.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Graft Cost</td></tr><tr><td>Graft</td><td>Cost</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#amphibious-adaptation]{Amphibious Adaption}</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#arcane-synapses]{Arcane Synapses}</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#beasts-hide]{Beast's Hide}</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#bestial-weapons]{Bestial Weapons}</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#charging-hooves]{Charging Hooves}</td><td>350 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#climbing-apparatus]{Climbing Apparatus}</td><td>1,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#darkvision]{Darkvision}</td><td>300 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#doppel-blooded]{Doppel-Blooded}</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#draconis-fundamentum]{Draconis Fundamentum}</td><td>1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#dragons-hide]{Dragon's Hide}</td><td>2,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#energetic-suture]{Energetic Suture}</td><td>500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#fiends-hide]{Fiend's Hide}</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#heart-of-steel]{Heart of Steel}</td><td>2,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#horns]{Horns}</td><td>350 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#indiscernible-anatomy]{Indiscernible Anatomy}</td><td>1,250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#leaping-legs]{Leaping Legs}</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#olfactory-implants]{Olfactory Implants}</td><td>200 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#oversized-arms]{Oversized Arms}</td><td>1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#prehensile-tail]{Prehensile Tail}</td><td>350 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#regenerating-marrow]{Regenerating Marrow}</td><td>500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#replacement]{Replacement}</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#stench]{Stench}</td><td>400 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#tentacles]{Tentacles}</td><td>500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#venom-sac]{Venom Sac}</td><td>350 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#voice-box]{Voice Box}</td><td>150 gp</td></tr><tr><td>@UUID[.FeMbL8cCYtFgIVoL#webspinner-apparatus]{Webspinner Apparatus}</td><td>500 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Grafts</h2><p>The following monstrous grafts are listed alphabetically.</p><h3>Amphibious Adaptation</h3><p><em><strong>Donor:</strong></em> Any creature with the Amphibious trait</p><p><em><strong>Slot:</strong></em> Head</p><p>You have grafted the gills of an aquatic creature to your neck, allowing you to breathe both air and water.

By harvesting a second creature, you can improve this graft to gain both the claws and teeth.</p><p>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your unarmed strikes made using your teeth or claws. If you hit with them, you deal damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (as appropriate to the attack roll), instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Your claws deal slashing damage and take up the Arms slot, whereas your teeth deal piercing damage and take up the Head slot.</p><h3>Charging Hooves</h3><p><em><strong>Donor:</strong></em> Any creature with a Charge trait or a Gore or Hooves attack</p><p><em><strong>Slot:</strong></em> Legs</p><p>You have replaced your legs with those of a creature known for running down its foes.

You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this ability to become quadrupedal, for instance.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p></div><div><h3>Draconis Fundamentum</h3><p><em><strong>Donor:</strong></em> Dragon, Humanoid, or Monstrosity with a Breath Weapon</p><p><em><strong>Slot:</strong></em> Internal</p><p>You have installed the mighty source of breath weapons into yourself, and as an action on your turn, you can exhale a wave of energy. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 damage for each point of your proficiency bonus, or half as much damage on a successful one. The breath weapon’s damage type is the same as the donor’s breath weapon.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Dragon's Hide</h3><p><em><strong>Donor:</strong></em> Dragon of Large size or larger</p><p><em><strong>Slot:</strong></em> External</p><p>You’ve transplanted the scaly, diamond-like hide of a Dragon onto your body. While you aren’t wearing armor, this natural armor provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p><p>You also gain resistance to one of the following damage types to which the donor dragon was immune: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage. You can only install this graft if you are proficient with heavy armor.</p><h3>Energetic Suture</h3><p><em><strong>Donor:</strong></em> Celestial, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, or Fiend with immunity or resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage</p><p><em><strong>Slot:</strong></em> External</p><p>You have managed to capture the essence of extraplanar resistance to magic.

If you hit with them, you deal damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

If you succeed, the creature is knocked prone.</p><h3>Indiscernible Anatomy</h3><p><em><strong>Donor:</strong></em> Aberration of Medium size or larger</p><p><em><strong>Slot:</strong></em> Internal</p><p>You have spliced aberrant genetics into your body, which have subsequently altered the placement and composition of your internal organs.

You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your unarmed strikes made using your tail. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (as appropriate to the attack roll), instead of the damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p><p>Additionally, you can hold and manipulate objects and weapons with your tail, but you can’t make attacks with weapons held by your tail or wield a shield with your tail and gain its benefits.</p><h3>Regenerating Marrow</h3><p><em><strong>Donor:</strong></em> Any creature with the Regeneration trait</p><p><em><strong>Slot:</strong></em> Internal</p><p>You have replaced your bone marrow with that of a regenerating creature.

In the breach, a single knight holds back the horde, eviscerating all comers, and allowing none to pass.</p><p>Blood dripping from his blade, a scarred half-orc gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint, his eyes alight with bestial fury.</p><p>Advancing slowly, an elf brandishing a green scimitar emerges from the foliage before two poachers. Startled, they turn to run, but find their feet bound fast by leaves and vines.</p><p>Wardens are vigilant guardians that adopt a charge—be it a kingdom, a forest, or an individual—and safeguard it from harm. Through both their fortitude and shields, they are immovable bulwarks on the field of battle.</p><h2>Guardian's Call</h2><p>Every warden feels a gravitational pull to defend the helpless. Sometimes, they are directly called, such as when a village or tribe selects their mightiest member to defend them, or when the spirits of a sacred grove beckon a new champion to protect their forest. Other times, the warden is compelled by more subtle means, such as witnessing uncontested injustice, or feeling the weight of responsibility when tragedy occurs. The result is the same: wardens that conclude their minds and pick up their shields to answer the call.</p><p>Wherever wardens travel, new calls make themselves evident. There is never a shortage of those in need, whereas those with strength and conscience are perpetually in short supply.</p><h2>Primal Strength</h2><p>Wardens are like mighty trees in a gale storm or the rocks along the shore, constantly battered by waves. They demonstrate almost supernatural resilience to hardship, and can’t be easily broken or slain.</p><p>Most wardens draw their might from the wild—the strength of the earth beneath their feet and the vitality of the air in their lungs—though some attribute their resiliency to an inward resolve or the absolute belief in a deity. Regardless of its source, a warden’s power is intuitive and forceful, allowing them to stop foes dead in their tracks, mark those standing in their way, and shug off otherwise deadly conditions. Only those wardens who choose to defend an obviously magical charge appear to be supernatural; others simply possess a daunting force of will and bottomless tolerance for punishment.</p><h2>Creating a Warden</h2><p>When creating a warden, consider what drives you. What brought you to raise up your shield for others? Do you fight to protect an individual or a particular location? A threat to your homeland or loved ones might have been your catalyst, but you also might have risen to combat a menace to the natural world. What was your call, and how do you honor it? What motivates you to keep fighting, even when you’re at death’s door?</p><p>Most wardens have been recognized as exemplary defenders. Perhaps, you are known as a wandering knight of the northern provinces, or perhaps you were beckoned by spirits of the forest to protect them from invaders. Who has called you, and how did you respond?</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>You can build a warden quickly with these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Strength and Dexterity. Then, choose the Primal Toughness option for Sentinel’s Stand.

Because you share in the beast’s ferocity, tenacity, and animal instinct, you can summon an animalistic strength from within yourself, and slay your enemies in a feral trance.</p><p>While entranced, you can sense a connection to a greater being: the Primal Beast, the first predator, from which all hunters are descended. As your commitment to defending the wilds from corruption grows, you grow closer to the Primal Beast, until you can at last adopt its ancient form yourself, and allow it to hunt once again.</p><h3>Feral Trance</h3><p>Starting when you hear this call at 3rd level, you can fall into a primal battle trance as a bonus action. While in your trance, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li><li>Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li><li>You have advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls using Strength against a creature you have marked.</li><li>Attacks against you have advantage.</li></ul><p>Your trance lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your trance on your turn as a bonus action.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Predator's Scent</h3><p>By 6th level, you hunt like an animal.

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h3>Form of the Primal Beast</h3><p>At 20th level, as an action, you can transform into a hunched thing of fur and shadow, an echo of the Primal Beast.

A creature loses 1d8 hit points at the start of each of its turns for each of its bleeding wounds, unless it uses an action to staunch the bleeding of all of its wounds.

A creature can have a number of bleeding wounds up to your proficiency bonus.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Grey Watchman</h2><p>Ever-vigilant and unceasing in your duties, you are a watcher of the realms of men, called to keep guard over a fortress or wall. As a grey watchman, trained in the arts of combat, you have honed your skills to a razor’s edge to repel any invaders that might challenge your land. You need not keep watch over the same castle your entire life, but wherever you travel, you are dedicated to keeping your land safe from invading armies, marauding monsters, and other external threats.</p><h3>Battle Tactics</h3><p>When you hear this call at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called battle dice.</p><p><em><strong>Battle Dice.</strong></em> You have two battle dice, which are d8s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative.</p><p>Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the following table.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Warden Level</td><td>Battle Dice</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>3d8</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3d10</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>4d10</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p><em><strong>Using Battle Dice.</strong></em> Once per turn, you can expend a battle die to perform a maneuver of your choice. Your maneuver options are detailed at the end of the subclass description.</p><p><em><strong>Saving Throws.</strong></em> Some of your maneuvers require the target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p><h3>Hold the Line</h3><p>At 3rd level, when you use your Warden’s Grasp, one creature you choose other than yourself within the effect’s area gains a +1 bonus to its Armor Class and saving throws until the start of your next turn while it remains in the effect’s area.</p><h3>Fortification Expert</h3><p>By 6th level, your experience manning battlements and blockades has given you insight into how to raise and reinforce them. You have advantage on any ability check you make to erect defensive fortifications, examine walls and other defenses for weak points and entryways, or climb constructed walls. Additionally, whenever you have three-quarters cover, you are treated as having total cover.</p><h3>Mettle</h3><p>Also at 13th level, your determination allows you to shrug off effects that would otherwise harm you. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h3>Unbreakable Sentinel</h3><p>Starting at 20th level, you can use your action to transform into a paragon of battle, an unstoppable sentinel, channeling the strength of every man, woman, and child under your charge. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You have a +2 bonus to your Armor Class.</li><li>Whenever you hit a creature you have marked with an attack, you regain an expended battle die.</li><li>You can take one additional reaction during each round of combat. You can’t take more than one reaction during a single turn.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Maneuvers</h3><p>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.</p><p><em><strong>Bull Rush.</strong></em> When you move at least 10 feet in a straight line and immediately make a melee weapon attack against a creature, you can use a bonus action and expend a battle die to shove the target after the attack. Add the battle die to the Strength (Athletics) check you make to shove the target. On a success, you can choose to either knock the target prone or push it up to 10 feet away from you.</p><p><em><strong>Bulwark.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend a battle die as a bonus action to brace yourself for its counterattack. The next time you take damage from that creature before the start of your next turn, you can roll the battle die and reduce the damage you take by the number rolled.</p><p><em><strong>Cleave.</strong></em> Once on each of your turns, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can spend a battle die to move up to 15 feet and make another melee weapon attack as part of the same action. On a hit, you add the battle die to the attack’s damage roll.</p><p><em><strong>Heel-Cutter.</strong></em> When you make an opportunity attack against a creature, you can expend one battle die to knock the creature off balance, preventing it from escaping. You add the battle die to the attack roll, and on a hit, the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its turn.</p><p><em><strong>Reckless Assault.</strong></em> When you make an attack against a creature, you can expend a battle die to make a wild, desperate strike, leaving you vulnerable. You have advantage on the attack roll. Until the start of your next turn, however, attack rolls against you have advantage.</p><p><em><strong>Staggering Strike.</strong></em> As a bonus action when you make a weapon attack against a Large or smaller creature, you can expend a battle die to attempt to daze the target. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Nightgaunt</h2><p>Blood-drinkers, undead, and other creatures of the night are often feared and hunted, and few stand in their defense; except, of course, the grim and terrible nightgaunt. Tales of the nightgaunt are whispered of in fairy tales, casting them as a things to be feared: hunters of clerics and goodly vampire slayers. Their appearance always presages long nights and great rises in hungry undead.</p><p>You felt the calling of the moon bringing you to the graveside of living corpses. Though vampires, zombies, and skeletons are mighty, they are always outnumbered, hunted, and turned by clerics—never given a fair chance to live peacefully. They require an ally among the living to continue their ceaseless lives, and you have risen by moonlight to the task.</p><h3>Darkvision</h3><p>Starting when you hear this call at 3rd level, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p><p>Starting at 13th level, you can see through magical, as well as nonmagical, darkness.</p><h3>Marked for Death</h3><p>At 3rd level, your mark leaves a shadow of undeath on your target, beckoning it to die. If you deal damage to a creature you have marked with a melee weapon attack and its remaining hit points are lower than the damage you dealt to it with that attack, the marked creature instead drops to 0 hit points.</p><h3>Undead Empathy</h3><p>By 6th level, you are a friend even to mindless Undead. Whenever an Undead creature targets you with an attack, it must first make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, its attack misses and, if its Intelligence is 4 or lower, it becomes friendly to you and your allies for 1 minute.</p><h3>Evasion</h3><p>Beginning at 13th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an <em>ice storm</em> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h3>Gravelord</h3><p>At 20th level, you can use your action to invite the necromantic energies of true undeath into your body, divorcing yourself from life for 1 minute and gaining the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</li><li>You can use your Undying feature up to three times without expending one of the feature’s uses.</li><li>Once per turn, when you deal damage to a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an extra 4d6 necrotic damage and gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt, which last until the start of your next turn.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h2>Soulblood Shaman</h2><p>The ancestral spirits called you by starlight to enact their will on the world, to protect their descendants, and to safeguard their resting places. You are a Soulblood Shaman, a manipulator of soul and ascetic of primal magic. Your community looks to you as a leader as well as a vital connection to the afterlife, for if you play your role, they too will join their ancestors in the great beyond.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Starting when you hear this call at 3rd level, you can channel your ancient insights into magic.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> The Soulblood Shaman Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</strong></em> You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation or transmutation spells on the druid spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Soulblood Shaman Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p><p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the druid spells you know with another spell of your choice from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since you channel your magic through a connection to the great beyond. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p></p><p>@UUID[.SWVFCchXKDCp3tdZ]{Soulblood Shaman Spellcasting Table}</p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"7\">Soulblood Shaman Spellcasting</td></tr><tr><td>Warden Level</td><td>Cantrips Known</td><td>Spells Known</td><td>1st</td><td>2nd</td><td>3rd</td><td>4th</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>3</td><td>13</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Soulblood</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, as a reaction when a creature within 5 feet of you deals damage to you, you can mark that creature.</p><h3>Whispers of Beyond</h3><p>At 6th level, you can hear the small voices of ancient spirits when you need guidance. If you spend 1 minute in contemplation when you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check, you can consult a host of ancestor spirits to gain advantage on the roll. You can’t use this ability when your ancestors wouldn’t have appropriate knowledge or guidance, such as if you try to understand cutting-edge alchemy.</p><h3>Spell Resistance</h3><p>Beginning at 13th level, you have advantage on saving throws you make against spells.</p><h3>Ethereal Watcher</h3><p>At 20th level, as an action, you can shrug off your mortal form for a short time to become something spiritual and immaterial, an ethereal watcher.

The stones called to you, beckoning for a protector to defend the mountains from those that would despoil them, from both within and without. You might be a watchman of old dwarven walls or a sentinel patrolling the lookouts of high mountain peaks. Regardless of where you stand, you are unmovable: a mountain in the shape of a man. You draw your power from the earth beneath your feet and can crush your enemies with the strength of stone.</p><h3>Roots of Rock</h3><p>Starting when you hear this call at 3rd level, when you use your Warden’s Grasp ability, rocky roots sprout from your feet, anchoring you securely.

In their infinite wisdom, The Primordial Gods, whose names have been forgotten by the march of ages, contrived the works of nature as their foremost and most perfect creation.

These few become druids, adherents to nature’s laws and champions of its unyielding majesty.</p><p>Invisible to all, druids form a society that transcends nations, races, and cultures. Those indoctrinated into the society learn Druidic, the secret language of the druids, and join a circle dedicated to a specific aspect of nature. Each circle acts in concert with one another, but each holds different perspectives on the works of nature and the role of druids in the world.

Its skin is of walls and towering stone structures, its breath of chimneys and rivers. While the city exists, it lives in harmony with its people, a delicate balance mediated by the urban druids. These urban druids belong to the Circle of the City and are a direct antithesis to the conventional idea of a druid; whereas a normal druid lives among majestic forests or breathtaking mountains and dresses in the greenery of the forest, an urban druid wears unassuming clothes and wanders the back alleys of a well-trodden city. But their powers are not to be underestimated. Druids of this circle can channel their natural powers to twist the streets into knots, uproot towers, and animate the cobblestones. Their charge might be unorthodox, but their authority over the cityscape matches any other druid’s power over the forest.</p><h3>Urban Arcana</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this circle at 2nd level, your druid spells lose the aesthetic trappings of nature and instead appear inspired by the jungles of buildings, columns, and cobblestones. For example, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gMrWeG8fMDPRFiVe]{entangle}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9gYGkrL6qFTsE6fw]{spike growth}</em> might cause growths of metal wires and twisting pipes. <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JPwIEfgUPVebr5AH]{Barkskin}</em> might grant you the appearance of pitted iron or brick.</p><p>Additionally, you can wear armor and wield shields made of metal.</p><h3>Streettalk</h3><p>At 2nd level, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to gather rumors or find a creature or location within an urban environment.</p><p>Additionally, you learn thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p><h3>City Shape</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to warp the city around you. Choose one of the following effects:</p><p><em><strong>Cobbleshift.</strong></em> You magically manipulate the components of a constructed floor—bricks, cobblestones, planks, and similar objects—within 60 feet. Each component can move up to 1 foot and doesn’t cause instabilities in their structures. When you use this effect, you can cause any sections of floor that you choose within the area to become difficult terrain, and can cause any creature standing in one of those sections to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone. You are unaffected by this difficult terrain.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your action on each of your turns to raise up to three low walls from the floor, each 2 and 1/2 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 1 foot deep. Such a wall can generally provide half cover for a Medium creature. These walls provide no instability in surrounding structures.</p><p>This ability lasts for 1 minute. After this time, all components and walls magically revert to their original positions.</p><p><em><strong>Passwall.</strong></em> You cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}</em> without expending a spell slot or material components.</p><p><em><strong>Wall Warp.</strong></em> A wall that you can see within 30 feet magically shifts, grows, shrinks, or rotates. This wall must be a contiguous surface without corners, at most 1 foot thick, and must be either made out of wood, plaster, or stone, or not be naturally occurring. The wall must remain vertical, but you can move it into any position you choose within a 60-foot radius of its previous position. Its new position can’t include spaces occupied by creatures or objects. If you cause the wall to grow or shrink, you can only change its dimensions vertically. These changes to the wall create no instability in their structures. After 1 minute, the wall reverts to its original size and position.</p><h3>Whispers of Walls</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, the walls speak to you in a quiet tremor. You can use your action to touch a constructed part of a building, such as a wall, pillar, ceiling, or floor. You learn how many Humanoid creatures are within that building and how many are within each room. If there are more than fifty Humanoids in a building, you only detect the closest fifty.</p><h3>Breath of Smog</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can exhale a 10-foot-radius sphere of toxic smoke, centered on yourself, as a reaction whenever you take damage. This area is heavily obscured. If a creature other than you is completely within the smog at the start of its turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned until the start of its next turn, as it coughs uncontrollably.</p><p>This smog dissipates after 1 minute. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you use your City Shape feature or you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Twisting Architecture</h3><p>By 14th level, you command total mastery of the city’s architecture, warping it to any shape you might imagine. You can expend two uses of your Wild Shape feature to activate any and all effects of your City Shape ability at one time.</p><p>Additionally, when you use your City Shape feature, you can warp the gravity along any surfaces you choose within a 60-foot radius. For the next minute, creatures and objects within 15 feet of one of these surfaces fall toward it as if it were the ground. A creature can walk on this surface as if it were level ground, even if the surface is perpendicular to the ground or upside down. At the end of this duration, all creatures and objects fall from the affected surfaces.</p><h2>Circle of the Deep</h2><p>The druids that maintain and protect the land are deluded to think that they keep dominion over the natural world, for they stand guard over only a small fraction of it; far greater, and far wilder, is the deep. Druids of the Deep are fewer in number, but greater in task, vowing to stand guard over the world’s oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers, and to safeguard their inhabitants from the fools that walk the surface.</p><p>The crushing depths have hardened these druids, and taught them to battle with every weapon underneath the waves. After all, the ocean is an unforgiving place; you can’t survive by just talking to fish.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>To join the Circle of the Deep, you must learn the weapons of underwater combat. When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the use of fishhooks, harpoons, nets, and tridents.</p><p>In addition, while druids of the deep won’t use weapons made of metal, they will use coral weapons, just as merfolk do. Coral weapons function as regular weapons, but cost twice as much if purchased on land.</p><h3>Aquatic</h3><p>By 2nd level, you are permanently adapted to life underwater. You can breathe water as well as air and have a swim speed equal to your walking speed. These benefits also apply while you’re transformed using Wild Shape: if you transform into a creature that doesn’t have a swim speed, your form gains a swim speed equal to the form’s speed.</p><h3>Vortex Attack</h3><p>At 6th level, you’ve mastered the omnidirectional fighting style of deep sea creatures. You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn with a weapon you are holding.</p><p>If you are in water, or have fewer than half your maximum hit points, you can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, making a separate attack roll for each target.</p><h3>Ocean's Ally</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, the beasts of the deep mark you as one of their own. You can speak to fish and other aquatic creatures at will, as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.aL1F8fvYLtNzUbKu]{speak with animals}</em> spell.</p><p>Additionally, if you are underwater, you can use your action to call an Beast of CR 3 or lower that has a swimming speed from the environment to your aid, which arrives at the start of your next turn. The Beast rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn, but is friendly to you and your companions and follows your commands. After 1 hour passes, or if you or one of your companions harms the Beast, the effect ends and the Beast returns to the wild.</p><p>Once you use this ability to call an aquatic Beast, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Davy Jones' Locker</h3><p>At 14th level, you consign your enemies to a watery grave. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an extra 1d8 damage to the target. Additionally, your attacks ignore resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, ignore the damage threshold of ships, and deal double damage to ships.</p><h2>Circle of the Fist</h2><p>The defenders of the forests and champions of the trees, druids who join the Circle of the Fist take their charge as natural protectors seriously. Traditionally, all druid circles strive to protect the natural realm and maintain the world’s balance, but only druids of this circle guard the woodlands with the vigilance and fervor of a territorial beast. Fists of the Forest, as they are called, stave off intruders to their realms with flurries of bare-fisted strikes, empowered by the natural world, before disappearing into the treetops. At the height of their expertise, these druids fight more like beasts of the forests than men, and are twice as deadly.</p><p>Often, this druidic order safeguards sacred groves and permanent fey bridges, but sometimes its members adopt quests of vengeance for misdeeds done to the forest, or quests of intervention to ensure that a prophesied disaster doesn’t come to pass.</p><h3>Untamed Fury</h3><p>At 2nd level, you fight with the might of a feral beast. While you are unarmed and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</li><li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.</li></ul><ul><li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. This die changes as you gain druid levels, as shown in the Untamed Strike table below. If the weapon die of your Beast form is less than your Untamed Strike die, you can use this die instead while in your Beast form.</li><li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. If you also expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can make 2 unarmed strikes as a bonus action. If you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you make 3 unarmed strikes.</li></ul><p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Untamed Strike</td></tr><tr><td>Druid Level</td><td>Damage</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2nd</td><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>1d8</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Primal Infusion</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action and expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to draw the raw power of nature into your body. You gain temporary hit points equal to 4 × your druid level + your Wisdom modifier. While you have these temporary hit points, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn with an unarmed strike.</p><h3>Savage Instinct</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can muster the power of nature in an instant. Whenever you roll initiative, you can choose to immediately expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to use your Primal Infusion ability. If you do so, you also gain one of the following benefits of your choice for up to 1 minute, while the hit points from your Primal Infusion ability remain:</p><p><em><strong>Feral Agility.</strong></em> Whenever you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can move 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.</p><p><em><strong>Mountain’s Might.</strong></em> You have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and you have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.</p><p><em><strong>Trees’ Resilience.</strong></em> When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage taken by your Wisdom modifier.</p><h3>Nature's Wrath</h3><p>By 14th level, you can use your reaction when you lose all your temporary hit points from your Primal Infusion feature to either make two unarmed strikes against a creature you can see within your reach, or expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to use your Primal Infusion ability again.</p><h2>Circle of Stones</h2><p>Age-old monuments crafted in forgotten times attest to a simple truth: there is power in stones. Druids who join the ancient Circle of Stones carry on the tradition of raising stone henges in places of great power, where leylines intersect and magic strengthens. Such locations are marked as nexuses of power, where the Forgotten Laws of the Old Gods are still heeded—but such things are known only to a few druids today. Others merely see the looming stone monuments as enigmatic circles, grim reminders of the enormity of time.</p><h3>Raise Henge</h3><p>When you select this circle at 2nd level, you learn to create patterns of stones which strengthen magic. You can expend a use of your Wild Shape as an action to magically create a henge, a set of standing stones, around a point you can see within 60 feet. A henge is composed of six stones, each 5 feet high, 3 feet wide, and 1 foot deep, arranged evenly in a 10-foot-radius circle. Such a stone can generally grant three-quarters cover from ranged attacks for a Medium creature. You can only create a henge in a location which can support the stones’ weight.</p><p>When you begin your turn in your henge, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your druid level (rounded down). Additionally, you can choose any number of allies to also be affected by the henge. A creature you choose gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier when it begins its turn within the henge. Temporary hit points granted by the henge last only while the creature is within the henge.</p><p>Your henge maintains its magical properties for 8 hours. After this duration, you can expend another use of your Wild Shape ability to render the stones permanent, though they no longer grant temporary hit points; otherwise, they vanish.</p><p>As you gain higher levels in this class, you can raise larger henges. At 10th-level, you can create a 15-foot-radius henge consisting of 10 stones, and at 14th-level, you can create a 20-foot-radius henge consisting of 20 stones. You choose the henge’s radius when you create it.</p><h3>Warding Stones</h3><p>At 6th level, your henges can hold great threats at bay. While within a henge, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.y8A4HfTwd93ypdEz]{magic circle}</em> spell as an action, without expending a spell slot or material components. The spell is centered on the henge and its radius and height matches that of the henge. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Ley Passage</h3><p>By 10th level, you can use your henges to travel through the leylines that connect the world. By spending 1 minute concentrating as if on a spell while within a henge, you can create a magical link between that henge and another henge on the same plane of existence, as per the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{teleportation circle}</em>. You must have seen or touched the destination henge at least once before. For the next minute, any creature can use an action to step into the target henge and exit from the destination henge.</p><h3>Great Henge</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, when you cast a druid spell that requires concentration while you are within a henge, you can transfer the spell to the henge, which manifests as a series of burning runes on the stones. You can only use this ability on a spell of 5th level or lower whose effect is entirely contained within the henge. If the spell’s area of effect would be larger than the area of the henge, you can limit the spell’s area to the henge’s boundary. The henge maintains concentration on the spell instead of you for the spell’s duration, allowing you to maintain two spells which require concentration at once. The spell ends early if any part of its effect leaves the area of the henge or if you use this feature to transfer another spell to a henge.</p><h2>Circle of Vermin</h2><p>Druids of the Circle of Vermin, sometimes known as Vermin Lords, find their source of power in the lowliest of creatures: insects, rats, spiders, and other pests. Unmistakably, your coming is signaled by the scrambling of little claws and the cawing of the crows. You hold legions of these creatures at your command, ready to swarm, bite, and claw, and you can become one of them, to walk among your innumerable children.</p><h3>Lord of the Low</h3><p>Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature as an action to magically summon a swarm of rats in your space. The swarm vanishes after a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down), if it drops to 0 hit points, or if you use this ability to summon a new swarm.</p><p>The summoned swarm is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned swarm, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.</p><p>While the swarm is in your space, you have a +2 bonus to AC and, when you take damage, you can choose for the swarm to take damage instead of you.</p><p>Starting at 6th level, you can summon a swarm of bats, swarm of insects, or swarm of ravens, and starting at 14th level, you can summon a swarm of poisonous snakes.</p><h3>Infested</h3><p>At 2nd level, insects and rodents inhabit every nook and cranny of your clothes and gear. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, these vermin retaliate, dealing 1d4 piercing damage to the attacker. Additionally, the creature subtracts the piercing damage dealt from the next attack roll it makes before the end of its turn.</p><h3>Tremorsense</h3><p>By 6th level, vibrations in the ground echo through its ants and earthworms, and by extension, you can sense them. You gain tremorsense, the ability to detect and pinpoint vibrations, with a range of 10 feet. To use this sense, you and the source of the vibrations must be in contact with the same ground or substance. This sense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.</p><h3>Plague Carrier</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, your constant close proximity to disease-carrying creatures has not only inoculated you to their diseases, but also allowed you to act as a vector of plague. You are immune to diseases and the poisoned condition. Whenever you would normally make a Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting a disease or the poisoned condition, you can instead become a carrier of that disease or poison. You can only be a carrier of one disease or poison at a time, and you can only carry it for up to seven days.</p><p>As a reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, you can transfer a disease or poison you are carrying to that creature, which must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature contracts the disease or poison, and you are no longer a carrier of it.</p><h3>Swarm Master</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, whenever you use your @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.omWEFuWMvD8um64n]{Lord of the Low} feature to summon a swarm, you can summon two swarms instead of one.</p><h2>Circle of the Wyrm</h2><p>Druids who join the Circle of the Wyrm hold dragons in higher esteem than all other works of creation. These druids believe, as many dragons do, that wyrms are perfect creatures: the pinnacle of all life brought into existence by the antediluvian gods. Likewise, these druids aspire to perfect wyrmhood, and gradually become like dragonkind.</p><h3>Dragonkin</h3><p>Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn Draconic. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and effects of Dragons.</p><h3>Draconic Wild Shape</h3><p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, instead of as an action. Furthermore, your beast shapes resemble dragon hybrids, replete with scales and fangs, and gain the following traits while you are transformed:</p><p><em><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong></em> You can use your action and expend one spell slot to exhale draconic energy from your mouth. Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 damage of the chosen type, plus 1d10 for each spell level higher than 1st. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p><p><em><strong>Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.</p><h3>Fangs and Flight</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, your Beast form sprouts scaled wings, and its attacks carry the energetic fury of a dragon’s swipes. You gain the following traits while transformed:</p><p><em><strong>Dragon Wings.</strong></em> You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed, if you don’t already have a flying speed that would be higher.</p><p><em><strong>Infused Strikes.</strong></em> When you transform using your Wild Shape, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a hit with a melee attack, you deal an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type.</p><h3>Primordial Aura</h3><p>At 10th level, you can use your bonus action to create a 30-foot aura of elemental magic. Choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. For the next minute, you and each creature you choose within the aura have resistance against the chosen damage type. Additionally, once on each of your turns for the duration, when you deal damage of the chosen type to a hostile creature, you can choose a creature within the aura to regain hit points equal to 1d10 plus your Wisdom modifier.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Wyrm Perfection</h3><p>By 14th level, you have achieved the majesty of a dragon. Even when not transformed, you gain the Breath Weapon and Dragon Wings traits.</p>"

It also organizes weapons by the proficiencies necessary to use them: simple, martial, and exotic.</p><p>@UUID[.yN0f9raHoHMIVEi0]{Sidebar: Two-Weapon Fighting}</p><h2>Exotic Weapon Proficiencies</h2><p>Exotic weapons and armor require an incredible level of skill to wield or wear properly, as they are often unusually heavy, oddly balanced, or bizarre in construction. As such, no class (other than the craftsman) gains proficiency with the exotic weapons and armor presented in this chapter. For a member of another class to gain proficiency with exotic weapons and armor, they must take the Exotic Mastery feat (see Chapter 4).</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Simple Melee

In many campaign settings, firearms supplant the traditional scheme of weapons, forcing arrows, swords, and battleaxes into obsolescence. They might even be commonplace, a staple tool for hunting and defense.</p><p>Firearms follow slightly different rules to conventional ranged weapons, and also generally use two or more damage dice. Blasters used in futuristic settings are considered firearms and use these rules as well.</p><h3>Firearm Damage Rolls</h3><p>Unlike other weapons, you don’t add your ability modifier to the damage roll of a firearm unless otherwise stated.</p><h3>Two-Weapon Fighting with Firearms</h3><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting with two light firearms, you subtract 2 from the damage roll of the bonus attack, to a minimum of 1 damage.</p><h3>Firearm Ammunition</h3><p>All firearms require special ammunition. Most firearms use bullets, but some require even more specialized projectiles.

Therefore, in addition to being organized into simple, martial, and exotic categories, the firearms presented in this book are organized by eras, the periods of time in which they might be encountered. Some firearms might appear in multiple eras, especially if the story demands an unusual weapon, but many are best suited to campaign settings that echo their level of technology.</p><p><span style=\"font-family:Calibri, sans-serif\"><em><strong>Renaissance-era</strong></em></span> firearms, such as flintlocks and muskets, are weapons that have taken the first steps away from heavy cannons and into portable rifles, making them the progenitors of all modern firearms. Weapons from this era use musket balls and loose black powder, and are therefore slow to reload and more prone to malfunction. Importantly, these weapons exist comfortably in many fantasy settings alongside bows, swords, and axes, especially where pirates are at play.</p><p><em><strong>Industrial Age</strong></em> firearms, such as revolvers and double-barrel shotguns, stem from advancements in machinery and assembly lines, granting them more interchangeable parts and cartridged bullets. These guns lacked the clean assembly-line consistency of modern firearms, but laid down the bedrock for designs that have not changed much since: a classic six-shot revolver is as timeless as it is effective. While the heyday of Industrial Age firearms was in the Wild West, their simple and reliable construction means they are still commonplace in the modern day.</p><p><em><strong>Modern</strong></em> firearms have embraced automatic fire, ammunition magazines, and lighter caliber bullets (which can travel at much higher speeds). For these guns, form begets function: weapons are designed for a specific role, such as sniper rifles for long range and shotguns for close quarters, and every aspect of their design supports this role. Moreover, weapons that enjoyed success in the West, such as the double-barrel shotgun, can still be found in use today.</p><h2>Switch Weapons</h2><p>Easily the most unorthodox category of exotic weapons, switch weapons are compound inventions that merge two seperate weapons into a single flexible platform. From the relatively tame bowblade—a bladed, folding longbow contraption—to the overly designed crossbow axe, these weapons allow for rapid changes in combat style for any situation that arises.</p><p>Weapons on the Switch Weapons table have the Switch property.</p><h3>Switch Weapon Proficiencies</h3><p>All switch weapons are exotic, so only craftsmen natively gain proficiency in their use. However, a switch weapon’s individual forms might strongly resemble weapons a character is already familiar with, so it may be easier to learn than other exotic weapons.</p><p>The GM can allow a character to gain proficiency with a switch weapon by practicing with it for seven days, assisted by a tutor that already has proficiency. The character must have proficiency with weapons that exactly match the statistics of each of the weapon’s forms.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Switch Weapons</td></tr><tr><td>Name</td><td>Damage</td><td>Properties</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Bowblade</strong> <em>(cost: 115gp, weight 3 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>[<em>Ranged Weapon</em>] Ammunition (range 150/600), heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Brass Knuckle Revolver</strong> <em>(cost: 150gp, weight 2 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Fist</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>2d6 piercing</td><td>[<em>Ranged Weapon (Firearm)</em>] Ammunition (range 30/120), reload (6)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Crossbow, Axe</strong> <em>(cost: 130gp, weight 18 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d12 slashing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>1d10 piercing</td><td>[<em>Ranged Weapon</em>] Ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Deckhammer</strong> <em>(cost: 80gp, weight 10 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] —</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>1d12 bludgeoning</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] heavy, reach, superheavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Gunsword</strong> <em>(cost: 165gp, weight 4 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Finesse, versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>2d6 piercing</td><td>[<em>Ranged Weapon (Firearm)</em>] Ammunition (range 30/120), reload (6)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Hinge Spear</strong> <em>(cost: 160gp, weight 15 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Double, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>1d12 piercing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Kusarigama</strong> <em>(cost: 85gp, weight 10 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Finesse, light</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Reach, trip, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Rifle Spear</strong> <em>(cost: 235gp, weight 12 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Finesse, versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>2d8 piercing</td><td>[<em>Ranged Weapon (Firearm)</em>] Ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Shotgun Axe</strong> <em>(cost: 280gp, weight 15 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d12 slashing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>2d6 piercing</td><td>[<em>Ranged Weapon (Firearm)</em>] Ammunition (range 30/90), heavy, reload (10), scatter (2d8), two-handed</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Split Staff</strong> <em>(cost: 50gp, weight 4 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>[<em>Two Melee Weapons</em>] Light</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Double, versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Split Swords</strong> <em>(cost: 185gp, weight 5 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>[<em>Two Melee Weapons</em>] Light, finesse</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Double, versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Whip Sword</strong> <em>(cost: 70gp, weight 6 lb.)</em></td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 1:</em></td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Finesse, reach</td></tr><tr><td><em>Form 2:</em></td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>[<em>Melee Weapon</em>] Finesse, versatile (1d10)</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2>Weapon Properties</h2><p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the weapons tables.</p><p><em><strong>Ammunition.</strong></em> You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p><p><em><strong>Automatic.</strong></em> When you make an attack with this weapon on your turn, you can choose to make two attacks instead. These attacks are always made with disadvantage, regardless of circumstance. These attacks use twice the normal amount of ammunition.</p><p><em><strong>Concealable.</strong></em> While stowed, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to conceal this weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Double.</strong></em> This weapon has two damage-dealing ends. When you take the Attack action and make an attack with this weapon, you can use your bonus action to make an additional attack with it; you do not add your ability modifier to the damage roll of this bonus attack.</p><p><em><strong>Dry.</strong></em> If this weapon is ever submerged in water or doused with a significant quantity of water, it jams. A jammed firearm can’t be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.</p><p><em><strong>Elegant.</strong></em> This weapon requires exceptional skill to use. You must have a Dexterity score of 16 or higher to wield an elegant weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> When this weapon’s projectile hits a target, it explodes in a 15-foot diameter sphere. The projectile can target an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save or no damage on a successful one.</p><p><em><strong>Finesse.</strong></em> When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Fist.</strong></em> Attacks made with this weapon are treated as unarmed strikes.</p><p><em><strong>Foregrip.</strong></em> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. If used in two hands, its normal range increases by 50 feet and its long range increases by 200 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Heat.</strong></em> This weapon gains 1 heat point whenever an attack is made with it, and it loses 1 heat point at the start of each of your turns. If the weapon has 3 heat points, it overheats and loses all heat points. An overheated weapon can’t be used to make an attack again until the end of your next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Heavy.</strong></em> Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p><p><em><strong>Light.</strong></em> A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Loading.</strong></em> Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><em><strong>Massive.</strong></em> You can only make an attack with this weapon when you take the Attack action, and only as the first attack you make on your turn. Once you make an attack with this weapon, you can’t attack again until the start of your next turn. If you would be able to attack more than once when you take the Attack action on your turn, you deal an extra two dice of damage for each attack you forgo when using this weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, it jams. A jammed weapon can’t be used to make an attack until a creature uses its action to clear the weapon malfunction.</p><p><em><strong>Mounted.</strong></em> This weapon is normally used while attached to a tripod, vehicle, or other bracing mount. You can mount or unmount this weapon as an action. While it is mounted, it can’t be moved. It can only be used to make an attack while unmounted if held by a Medium or larger creature with a Strength score of at least 15.</p><p><em><strong>Parrying.</strong></em> While wielding this weapon and not wielding a shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.</p><p><em><strong>Reach.</strong></em> This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.</p><p><em><strong>Reload.</strong></em> This weapon can be used to make a number of attacks before it must be reloaded. If you are proficient with the weapon, reloading it takes a bonus action; otherwise, reloading it takes an action. Some weapons require an action or longer to reload, even if you have proficiency, which is specified in the Reload property. If reloading a weapon requires longer than one action, the weapon can’t be used to make attacks until reloading is finished.</p><p><em><strong>Returning.</strong></em> After being thrown, this weapon returns to your hand at the end of your turn.</p><p><em><strong>Rocket.</strong></em> This weapon has a small propulsive engine attached to it or its projectiles. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can deal an extra 1d4 damage to the target.</p><p><em><strong>Scatter.</strong></em> If you make an attack against a target that is within half this weapon’s normal range, you deal the damage value listed in parentheses instead of the weapon’s normal damage dice.</p><p><em><strong>Sighted.</strong></em> This weapon has disadvantage on attack rolls made against targets within 20 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Special.</strong></em> A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons”).</p><p><em><strong>Superheavy.</strong></em> This weapon is unusually large for its type. You must have a Strength score of 16 or higher to wield a superheavy weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Switch.</strong></em> This weapon has two forms. You can swap between which weapon is being used at any time, even between attacks.</p><p><em><strong>Tension.</strong></em> When making a ranged weapon attack with a tension weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Thrown.</strong></em> If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.</p><div><p><em><strong>Trip.</strong></em> You can make a shove attempt against any creature within this weapon’s reach. Furthermore, you have advantage on ability checks you make to shove a creature using this weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Twinshot.</strong></em> Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with this weapon, you can make another attack with it against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within this weapon's range.</p><p><em><strong>Two-Handed.</strong></em> This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p><p><em><strong>Versatile.</strong></em> This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p><h2>Special Weapons</h2><p>Weapons with special properties are described here.</p><p><em><strong>Bayonet.</strong></em> As an action, a bayonet can be mounted to any two-handed ranged weapon or removed from it. While mounted, you can use the bayonet to make a two-handed melee weapon attack, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit.</p><p><em><strong>Bolas.</strong></em> A creature hit by a bolas falls prone until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the bolas (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the bolas. You can only throw one bolas on your turn.</p><p><em><strong>Bomb.</strong></em> When a bomb hits a target, it explodes in a 15-foot diameter sphere and is destroyed. The bomb can be thrown at an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one.</p><p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can empty some of the bomb’s explosive material to permanently remove the blast radius from this bomb, dealing damage only to the bomb’s target.</p><p><em><strong>Catchpole.</strong></em> This weapon is used to immobilize creatures at a distance. When you hit a creature of Large size or smaller with this weapon, you can attempt to grapple the creature instead of dealing damage. When you do so, you use your attack roll for the grapple check, rather than making a Strength (Athletics) check. While grappling a creature with this weapon, you can’t use the weapon on another target.</p><p><em><strong>Harpoon.</strong></em> You can use an action to tie a rope to the end of a harpoon before it is thrown. If a rope-tied harpoon hits a target, it becomes embedded in the target, and you can use an action on subsequent turns to hold fast to the rope and make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against the target to pull it up to 10 feet closer to you. Additionally, when the target moves, you can use your reaction to make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against it, preventing its movement on a success. If you use your action to do anything else, you lose your grip on the rope. If the target has hands, it can remove the harpoon as an action.</p><p><em><strong>Hook Hand.</strong></em> This is a one-handed weapon, usable only if you are missing a hand or have a special cuff designed to fit over your hand. Any Humanoid that is missing a hand and regularly wears a hook has proficiency with this weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Light Cannon.</strong></em> This weapon deals double damage to objects and structures.</p><p><em><strong>Machete.</strong></em> This weapon deals double damage to Plants and vegetation.</p><p><em><strong>Rocket Launcher.</strong></em> This weapon deals double damage to objects and structures.</p></div>"

          "text": "<p>No arsenal is complete without a <em>bag of holding</em>, a handful of +1 arrows, and a trusty <em>wand of wonder</em>. For as long as adventurers have claimed the hoards of conquered monsters or delved into long-lost vaults, they have sought a bevy of magic items first and foremost. Such items grant rare capabilities or complement their owner’s talents in wondrous ways. Among seasoned adventurers, enchanted rings and fearsome magic weapons are a mark of status, signifying adventuring experience, as well as insurance against the sudden death that often accompanies the adventuring profession.</p><h2>Magic Item Descriptions</h2><p>Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item’s description gives the item’s name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties.</p><h3>Adamantine Polish</h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>This abrasive paste can be applied as an action to the claws, fangs, tusks, or spines of a creature to make them sharper, harder, or cleaner. For 8 hours after application, that creature gains a +1 to attack and damage rolls with its natural weapons, which count as being made of adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance and immunity.</p><h3>Alchemical Anesthetic</h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>This clear, odorless potion is housed in a wicked-looking syringe that contains 4 doses. You can administer the anesthetic to a willing creature as an action, dulling its nerves and making it impossible for it to feel pain for one hour. An anesthetized creature has advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws and can’t be incapacitated or have disadvantage on rolls due to being in pain. However, the creature is unaware of how much pain it is in or how many levels of exhaustion it has. If a player character is anesthetized, the GM tracks the character’s hit points and levels of exhaustion instead of the player for the duration.</p><p>If you administer a dose over the course of a minute to a willing or unconscious creature, you can render the creature unconscious for one hour. If you continue to slowly administer anesthetic (one dose every eight hours), you can keep a creature unconscious for up to 24 hours; keeping a creature unconscious longer than this results in death.</p><h3>Alchemical Reactor</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by an alchemist)</em></p><p>This stupendously complex vessel the size of a cask is festooned with valves and dials. While attuned to the reactor, you can use an action to adjust its settings and begin producing any of the following potions: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.eTNc8XPtvZNe3yQs]{potion of flying}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.mhFBTY0egW8AeCHe]{potion of hill giant strength}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.rTn4p9nJr4Aq2GPB]{potion of invisibility}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.5m9ErO9In8Uc5yyf]{potion of superior healing}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.zJ5LhDvTxYKzPIx4]{sovereign glue (1 ounce)}</em>, or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.MAwoj2suj6cvb9Ti]{universal solvent}</em>.</p><p>The reactor rumbles and whirs for the next 12 hours as it produces the specified potion. Once it is finished, you can use your action to pour the potion from the top of the reactor. This potion loses its potency and becomes nonmagical if it is not consumed within 24 hours.</p><p>Additionally, while attuned to the reactor, you can regain 2 expended reagent dice whenever you finish a short rest.</p><h3>Ankh of Anubis</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a martyr)</em></p><p>While attuned to this wrought iron holy symbol, you have advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while you have 10 hit points or less.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you take damage, record the damage you take in a damage pool, which resets to 0 at the end of your turn. When you lose hit points to cast a martyr spell, you subtract the number in the damage pool from the spell’s hit point cost, to a minimum of 0 hit points lost.</p><h3>Antimagic Bell</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, common</em></p><p>This round bell is enchanted to be perfectly silent. It only rings when its magic is disrupted, such as within an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Eon0jzGzQRNluTPQ]{antimagic field}</em>.</p><h3>Aqua Fortis</h3><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p>This transparent acid constantly bubbles within its sealed vial. As an action, you can throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack, treating the vial as an improvised weapon.</p><p>If the target is an object that isn’t being worn or carried, the acid dissolves a 1-foot cube of the object. If splashed on a suit of armor or a shield, the object takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. A suit of armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If splashed on a weapon, it takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. A weapon reduced to a −5 penalty is destroyed. It has no effect on magic items and objects made of gold, glass, stone, or adamantine.</p><p>If the target is a creature, it takes [[/r 3d6]] acid damage, followed by an extra [[/r 2d6]] acid damage at the end of its next turn and another [[/r 1d6]] acid damage at the end of the turn after that. The acid can be washed off with one gallon of water, ending the effect early.</p><h3>Arrow of Explosions</h3><p><em>Weapon (arrow), very rare</em></p><p>When this arrow strikes a solid surface, be it a creature, object, wall, or floor, it explodes with a fiery blast. Each creature within 20 feet of the point of impact must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [[/r 8d6]] fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The arrow is destroyed in the blast.</p><h3>Arrow of Glue</h3><p><em>Weapon (arrow), uncommon</em></p><p>An <em>arrow of glue</em> is one of a few arrows known as trick arrows. When you fire an arrow of glue, the arrow’s shaft becomes pliant on impact and hardens immediately after. You can fire this arrow at any point you can see within range to cover a 1-foot square area with hardened glue. The GM may rule that especially challenging shots are made with disadvantage. A creature hit by this arrow must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be glued to a nearby surface, unable to move. It can break free with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.</p><h3>Arrow of Piercing</h3><p><em>Weapon (arrow), rare</em></p><p>An <em>arrow of piercing</em> is one of a few arrows known as trick arrows. When you make an attack with this arrow, it becomes a 5-foot-wide line of magical energy that extends out from you to the weapon’s normal range. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes the weapon’s normal damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The arrow is then destroyed.</p><h3>Arrow of Teleportation</h3><p><em>Weapon (arrow), uncommon</em></p><p>An <em>arrow of teleportation</em> is one of a few arrows known as trick arrows. When this arrow is fired from a bow at an unoccupied space within 100 feet of the archer, the archer immediately teleports to its location. The arrow is destroyed on impact.</p><h3>Aura Lenses</h3><p>Wondrous items, uncommon (incomplete) or rare (complete)</p><p>A set of these large glass lenses is contained in a single cylindrical case. Each is four inches across, tinted in a different hue, and associated with a particular school of magic, as shown on the following table. When you hold a lens up to your eye and look through it, the world appears to be tinted in the len’s color, except for creatures and objects which are under the effect of a spell from the lens’s associated school of magic, which appear normal.</p><p>A complete set of <em>aura lenses</em> contains all 8 individual lenses, but most are found as an incomplete set, containing only [[/r 1d8]] of them.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>School of Magic</td><td>Color</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Abjuration</td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td>Conjuration</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Divination</td><td>Yellow</td></tr><tr><td>Enchantment</td><td>Pink</td></tr><tr><td>Evocation</td><td>Red</td></tr><tr><td>Illusion</td><td>Purple</td></tr><tr><td>Necromancy</td><td>Grey</td></tr><tr><td>Transmutation</td><td>Green</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Bag of Cheer</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p><p>This large sack, which weighs 30 pounds and is made from red velvet, appears to be full of presents in colorful wrapping. As an action, you can pull a present from the bag and give it to another creature. The gift is tailored specifically to the recipient; the GM determines its nature or rolls on the table on the following page. The value of the gift can’t exceed 100 gp.</p><p>Once three presents have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn. Any additional presents removed from the bag are empty but well-decorated boxes.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>d10</td><td>Gift</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>A weapon or shield</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Gold</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>An art object</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>A clothing item</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>A tool or musical instrument</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>A <em>potion of healing</em></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Gems</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>An exotic food</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>A book</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>A toy or gaming set</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Bedroll of Rest</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This enchanted, silken bedroll is immensely comfortable. Sleeping in it during a long rest removes all levels of exhaustion and restores all expended Hit Dice. After sleeping in it, you don’t require rest for 48 hours, though you can still choose to take a long rest during that time.</p><h3>Bells of Due Alarm</h3><p>Wondrous item, uncommon</p><p>This trio of bells warns you of intruders. You can arrange the bells up to 500 feet apart from each other, and can use your action to speak a command word to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7p9IuWrSWFgfyQo2]{alarm}</em> spell, warding the area between the bells.</p><h3>Blindfold of True Darkness</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You have @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ.JournalEntryPage.I6ABWHBYwGl55dLY]{blindsight} with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</p><p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This blindfold is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. While cursed, you are @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.0b8N4FymGGfbZGpJ]{blinded}, whether you are wearing the blindfold or not.</p><h3>Bonze's Bokken</h3><p><em>Weapon (katana), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This magic weapon deals bludgeoning damage instead of its normal slashing damage. As an action, you can use the bokken to blow a strong wind, dispersing any gases within a 15-foot cube adjacent to you.</p><p>When you take the Attack action while holding this weapon, you can replace one or more of your attacks with concussive waves of sound. Make a ranged spell attack roll with a range of 30/60 feet and a +7 bonus to hit. On a hit, the target takes [[/r 1d10]] + 3 thunder damage, and on a critical hit, the target is @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.6G8JSjhn701cBITY]{deafened}. This attack is audible out to 100 feet.</p><h3>Boots of the Hare</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While attuned to these boots, whenever you use your action to Dash, you gain 90 feet of extra movement instead of the usual amount.</p><p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> These boots are cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{identify}</em> spell is cast on the boots or you attune to them. Attuning to the boots curses you until you are targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. While cursed, your speed is 15 feet and can’t be increased by any means other than taking the Dash action.</p><h3>Boots of the Trail</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>Until they are worn, the boots of the trail appear to be in grave disrepair. When you lace them up, the illusion fades: they are immaculate hiking boots with gold clasps and silk laces. While wearing these boots, you leave behind no tracks or other traces of your passage, and can’t be tracked except by magical means. You can march for twice as long before suffering levels of exhaustion.</p><p>Additionally, you can remove the boots and speak a command word as an action to cause the boots to walk alone, leaving a false trail in any direction for up to one mile. The boots then teleport back to your feet.</p><h3>Brawling Gloves</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a barbarian, captain, craftsman, fighter, rogue, or warden)</em></p><p>While attuned to these fingerless magical gloves, you have proficiency with all improvised weapons and gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls made using them. The bonus is determined by the gloves’ rarity.</p><h3>Burning Knuckles</h3><p><em>Weapon (cestus), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While attuned to these magical gauntlets, your unarmed strikes deal [[/r 2d6]] fire damage instead of their usual damage.</p><h3>Cane of Youth</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While attuned to this cane, you suffer none of the frailty of old age and can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however.</p><h3>Chameleon Concoction</h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, your skin camouflages to match the color and texture of your surroundings, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make to avoid being seen for 1 hour. This liquid’s hue rapidly shifts to match whatever material it is nearest to.</p><h3>Coil of Strength Storing</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This metallic coil is usually worn on an arm or leg. While attuned to it, whenever you make a melee weapon attack against a hostile creature that exceeds the target’s AC by 5 or more, the coil gains 1 stored charge. It can hold up to 5 charges at a time.</p><p>When you make an attack with a melee weapon, you can expend any number of stored charges to gain a bonus on the attack roll equal to the number of charges expended. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to expend charges, but must decide before the GM says whether the attack hits. Unused charges disappear 1 minute after being stored.</p><h3>Cure-All</h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>A bottle of cure-all contains [[/r 1d4]] + 1 doses of potent medicine. As an action, you can drink a dose, curing you of any disease, ending your poisoning, and causing you to be immune to the poisoned condition for 1 hour. A complex swirl of red liquid in the potion’s center resembles a snake on a pole. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the potion’s contents.</p><h3>Dowsing Rod</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>This forked stick is used to discover water. It has 3 charges and regains [[/r 1d3]] expended charges daily at dawn. While holding this rod, you can use your action and expend a charge to cause the rod to point to the largest source of water in a 10-mile radius. The rod doesn’t indicate the distance or quantity of water. If there is little to no water to be found, the rod indicates vaguely downward, for there is always some amount of water underground.</p><h3>Drum of Blasted Beats</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This drum has 6 charges. While attuned to it, you can use an action to strike it and expend one charge to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WTbOQBsarsL1LuXJ]{thunderwave}</em> spell, or two charges to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.wJKpSvSTbSkTjqyb]{shatter}</em> spell (save DC 15).</p><p>The drum regains [[/r 1d6]] expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the drum’s last charge, roll [[/r 1d20]]. On a 1, the drum ruptures and loses its magic.</p><h3>Émigré Manuscript</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This ancient tome is shaped like a skull and smells either of violets or tiger lilies. While holding the tome, you can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO]{resurrection}</em> without using material components. Once the manuscript is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> The <em>émigré manuscript</em> is cursed to bring nothing but misery to those who use it. Whenever you use it to raise the dead, roll [[/r 1d20]] to determine the result according to the following table.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>d20</td><td>Effect</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-2</td><td>The spell fails and the caster immediately dies.</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>The target is resurrected as a revenant, seeing revenge against the caster.</td></tr><tr><td>5-6</td><td>The target is resurrected as a ghost, but otherwise retains its memories and personality.</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>The spell works, but the 100 Humanoids nearest to the target (excluding the caster) immediately die.</td></tr><tr><td>9-10</td><td>The spell works, but the caster must roll twice on the Indefinite Madness table, suffering both results. If the same result is rolled twice, the caster immediately dies.</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>The spell works, but the target loses all of its memories, class levels, proficiencies (including languages), and personality traits.</td></tr><tr><td>13-14</td><td>The spell appears to work, but the target dies again after 1d10 minutes. No magic short of a <em>wish</em> can revive it from this death.</td></tr><tr><td>15-20</td><td>The spell works as normal.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Exploding Armor</h3><p><em>Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While wearing this armor, you can use your action to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{fireball}</em> (save DC 15), centered on yourself. You take no damage from this spell. The armor can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><h3>Flutterby Rob</h3><p><em>Rod, uncommon</em></p><div><p>This rod has 7 charges and regains [[/r 1d6]] + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use it to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Bnn9Nzajixvow9xi]{light}</em> cantrip targeting the rod.</p><p>As an action, you can expend a charge to shoot a shimmering, green, butterfly-shaped flutterbolt at a target within 60 feet. Make a ranged spell attack with a +5 attack bonus. On a hit, the target takes [[/r 1d4]] + 1 force damage and is outlined in sparkling green butterflies. The next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, and the target can’t benefit from being invisible until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Folding Ladder</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>This item appears as two short wooden rods, 12 inches long and 1 inch in diameter, connected side by side. It weighs four pounds. It has three command words.</p><p>When you speak the ladder’s first command word, it expands into a ladder, 2 feet wide and 20 feet long. If you speak the second command word, it extends into a freestanding stepladder, 30 feet high with a base that is 5 feet by 10 feet. The third command word causes the ladder to collapse back into its folded form.</p><p>The ladder can support 500 pounds of weight in either of its extended configurations.</p><h3>Frog Prince Statuette</h3><p>Wondrous item, rare</p><p>This clay statuette of a crown-wearing frog transforms into a Humanoid if you speak its command word and kiss it as an action. It gains the statistics of a commoner, as per the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.bcdv8wznx3Kanahl]{Mandy’s feral follower}</em>, except that the Humanoid can speak the languages you speak and is adorned in fine clothes. Furthermore, the Humanoid created by the statuette retains the memories of each time it is transformed, no matter what appearance you ascribe to it.</p><p>The transformation lasts until the twelfth stroke of midnight, unless cast in a location where time doesn’t pass normally, in which case it lasts for 24 hours. The Humanoid then reverts back to its statuette form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you speak the command word again while touching it.</p><p>Once it has been used, the statuette can’t transform again until 5 days have passed.</p><h3>Gambler's Coin</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This ordinary looking gold piece has deep scratches on one side. It has 3 charges. When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw while holding it, you can expend 1 charge to replace the d20 roll with a coin flip. On heads, the roll is treated as a 20 (though you don’t score a critical hit with an attack roll or activate any other effects which trigger on the roll of a 20). On tails, the roll is treated as a 1. The coin regains all expended charges at dawn.</p><h3>Gaol Net</h3><p><em>Weapon (net), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>When a Large or smaller creature is restrained with this magical net, you can use your bonus action to speak its command word, causing the net to transform into a Large iron cage that encloses the target. The enclosed creature is no longer restrained.</p><p>The cage weighs 500 pounds and is fitted with a locked door (DC 15 to pick the lock). A creature, including the one enclosed in the cage, can use an action to make a DC 25 Strength check to bend the bars enough to let a creature out. If the cage is empty, you can use an action to speak a command word, causing it to transform back into a net.</p><p>Once the net transforms into a cage, it can’t do so again until the next dawn.</p><h3>Gauntlet of the Grandmaster</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a warmage)</em></p><p>While wearing this gauntlet, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warmage spells, and you gain a bonus to spell attack and damage rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your warmage spells. This bonus is determined by the gauntlet’s rarity. This gauntlet counts as a specially prepared gauntlet for cantrips such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.5BXHZiaNeDZNCCb1]{force buckler}</em>.</p><p>In addition, you gain one of the following cantrips of your choice: <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.5BXHZiaNeDZNCCb1]{force buckler}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.azLLSylqxURWV6ih]{force dart}</em>, or <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.zfwEl9lWgU2SGM8q]{force weapon}</em>. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can change your selection.</p><h3>Glimmerbolt</h3><p><em>Weapon (any crossbow), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>This weapon has 10 charges and regains [[/r 1d6]] + 4 charges daily at dawn. As part of your Attack action, you can expend a charge to create and load a piece of radiant ammunition into the crossbow. This bolt deals an extra [[/r 1d6]] damage on a hit and deals radiant damage, instead of its normal piercing damage.</p><p>Additionally, as an action, you can expend 3 charges to load a blinding bolt of light into the crossbow and fire it at a point you can see within 60 feet, where it detonates in a flash. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. Motes of light hang in the air around that point for the next minute, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p><h3>Gloves of Skill</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While attuned to these gloves, you have proficiency with one tool or instrument. The GM chooses the proficiency or determines it randomly from the options below.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>d10</td><td>Proficiency</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Drum</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Flute</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Horn</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Lute</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Lyre</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Carpenter’s Tools</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Cobbler’s Tools</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Jeweler’s Tools</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Mason’s Tools</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Smith’s Tools</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Graverobber's Spade</h3><p><em>Weapon (shovel), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a necromancer)</em></p><p>You can use this magic weapon as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells. While holding this magic weapon, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your necromancer spells. The bonus is determined by the weapon’s rarity.</p><p>Additionally, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.riBbuS70OrjanPsp]{exhume}</em> spell at will without using a spell slot or material components.</p><h3>Hand of Glory</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This mummified hand is worn around the neck with a leather cord. While attuned to the hand, you can attune to two additional magic items beyond the normal limit, which must be magic rings worn on the hand’s digits. If your attunement with the hand ends, your attunement with the magic rings worn on it also ends.</p><h3>Invisible Ink</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>Anything written in this ink is invisible. A DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that there is writing present, but not what it says. Only creatures that have truesight or are under the effect of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.DQzlB5Y3k791W5bH]{see invisibility}</em> spell can read text written in this ink, though the invisibility effect can be removed using <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}</em>. One pot is sufficient to write 250 words or draw one picture or diagram.</p><h3>Jax</h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>Rather than drinking this vial of orange, brackish liquid, you inject into your body as an action. Once injected, for 1 hour, your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores each increase by 4, and the maximum for these scores is increased to 24. However, your hit point maximum is permanently reduced by [[/r 1d12]]. No means short of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{wish}</em> spell can restore hit points lost in this way.</p><p>You can use more than one dose of <em>jax</em> at once, and its ability score increases stack for the 1-hour duration. However, you still suffer the reduction to your maximum hit points each time you take an additional dose, and you must succeed a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or suffer an overdose. When you overdose, you are reduced to 0 hit points and can’t regain hit points for 1 hour.</p><h3>Khaliber's Iron</h3><p><em>Weapon (any one-handed firearm), uncommon (+1, DC 13), rare (+2, DC 15), or very rare (+3, DC 17) (requires attunement by a gunslinger)</em></p><p>This magic weapon, which is blessed by Khaliber, the goddess of gunpowder, magically produces its own ammunition immediately after it is fired. You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the weapon’s rarity.</p><p>When you score a critical hit with this weapon, the bullet explodes on impact. Each creature you choose other than the target within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to half the damage dealt on a failure. The DC for this saving throw is determined by the weapon’s rarity.</p><h3>Lady and Lord Rings</h3><p><em>Rings, very rare (require attunement by two creatures)</em></p><p>These two rings, one engraved with the image of a mighty lord and the other with a stately lady, are part of a matched set. Two creatures can attune to the rings, each wearing one of the rings. While within 30 feet of each other, both attuned creatures have resistance to all damage. Additionally, while both creatures are within 30 feet of each other, whenever an attuned creature takes damage, the other creature loses the same number of hit points. Attunement to these rings breaks if either attuned creature dies or breaks attunement.</p><h3>Leaden Manacles</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>These manacles behave the same as normal manacles with the following addition: a creature that attempts to cast a spell while wearing the manacles must make a DC 12 ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a failure, the spell fails and has no effect; the spell slot is expended, the action is wasted, and the manacled creature takes [[/r 1d6]] fire damage per level of the spell slot expended. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and the spell is cast successfully.</p><h3>Leonora's Throne of Indolence</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This high-backed armchair made of oak and gold weighs 100 pounds and functions like an ordinary chair until you sit in it and speak its command word as an action. It then hovers beneath you and can fly through the air. The throne has a flying speed of 50 feet and can carry up to 400 pounds. The throne stops hovering when you speak its command word again.</p><p>By speaking another command word, you can use your action to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ccduLIvutyNqvkgv]{unseen servant}</em> spell using the throne. The servant can conjure a spectral trumpet to announce your arrival, in addition to its usual tasks.</p><p>Lastly, while attuned to the throne, you can speak a third command word to magically create up to 10 pounds of delicious food of your choice and up to four bottles of wine. Only you can partake of this meal and drink; it instantly becomes stale and sickening in another creature’s mouth. Once you have spoken this command word, you can’t do so again until the next dawn.</p><h3>Locket of Remembrance</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, common</em></p><p>When a <em>locket of remembrance</em> is created, it is engraved with the name and likeness of a creature that has died. It is then dedicated to this creature. As long as the locket is worn by a living creature, the remembered creature’s remains can’t become Undead, and its soul can’t linger as an Undead creature.</p><h3>Loincloth of Oni Magic</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a barbarian)</em></p><p>While attuned to this blood-red loincloth, you can cast and concentrate on any spells you know, even while you are raging.</p><p>Furthermore, the loincloth has 6 charges. While attuned to it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eS7XnnApoxRxYXPs]{charm person}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{sleep}</em> (1 charge), <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.S7VbUetIfVT7B6Eq]{darkness}</em> (2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]{invisibility}</em> (2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.2IWiZAJtOGDoKjiz]{gaseous form}</em> (3 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.RpKjTlYASrfqUPVA]{cone of cold}</em> (4 charges). The loincloth regains [[/r 1d6]] expended charges daily at dusk.</p><h3>Magehunter Blade</h3><p><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>If you use this weapon to hit a creature that is under the effect of a spell, one spell of your choice affecting the target is dispelled if it is 5th-level or lower, and the target takes an extra [[/r 1d8]] force damage for the level of the dispelled spell (dispelled cantrips deal no extra damage). Once a spell is dispelled, roll [[/r 1d6]]. If the number is less than or equal to the level of dispelled spell, the sword loses this trait until the following dawn.</p><h3>Magehunter Plate</h3><p><em>Armor (breastplate, half plate, or full plate), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This magical armor has 3 charges. When you are subjected to a magical effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you can expend a charge to instead take no damage on a success and only half as much damage on a failure. The armor regains all expended charges at dusk.</p><p>Additionally, while you are attuned to this armor and wearing it, acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage you take from magical sources, as well as magical healing you receive, is reduced by 3. When you take damage from a magical melee weapon, the attacker must roll [[/r 1d20]]. On a 10 or lower, the weapon’s magic is suppressed for 1 hour, causing it to temporarily become nonmagical.</p><h3>Marvelous Painted World</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p><p>This masterful painting, at least a 5-foot square in area, was crafted by a master painter using at least ten pots of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.e3XQygrXkzNvkDGF]{marvelous pigments}</em>. It depicts a serene painted world. The painting itself acts as a portal to a demiplane in which the painted world exists, and is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. Inside the painted world, a misty archway is a portal to the real world. If the painting is rolled up or faced toward a solid surface, the portal disappears inside the painted world.</p><p>The location, objects, and creatures depicted within the painted world are determined by the painting’s creator, but such objects and creatures can’t leave the painted world, as they can’t pass through the portal, and disappear into smoke if removed from the demiplane by other means. Time passes at half speed within the painted world, and you don’t need to eat or drink while within it.</p><h3>Memento Mori</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This sealed letter, infused with chronomancy magic, contains a written description of how the creature that reads it shall die. The letter always contains specific descriptions, such as “The red-eyed orc drove its scimitar through Faizon the Blue’s heart,” but may also use cryptic or vague language. It never specifies an exact time. Once a creature has read the letter, it has advantage on death saving throws, and dies only after gaining five death saving throw failures, instead of three. However, when the creature arrives at the moment of its death described in the letter, it dies without making death saving throws if it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>Once a <em>memento mori</em> is opened and read, it becomes an ordinary letter. Its effects end only if the creature that read it dies and is later restored to life.</p><h3>Morbid Makeup</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>This makeup kit contains only red, white, and black paint. It functions as a disguise kit which lets you convincingly appear as a Fey, Fiend, or Undead creature. While wearing the makeup, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks you make against Humanoids.</p><p>The kit contains enough makeup for 10 applications. Each application lasts up to 8 hours, and can be washed off as an action.</p><h3>Mouse of Cowardice</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This wind-up clockwork mouse terrifies even the largest beasts. When you speak its command word and set it rolling toward a Large or larger creature within 15 feet of you as an action, you cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BYNvBJzHcF5VJhXw]{phantasmal killer}</em> (save DC 15) using the mouse. The mouse can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><h3>Necromantic Draught</h3><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p>You can pour this potion on a Medium or Small Humanoid corpse as an action to animate it, as per the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.oyE5nVppa5mde5gT]{animate dead}</em> spell for 24 hours. You command Undead animated in this way. This brightly glowing neon-yellow goo retreats from living things that touch its container.</p><h3>Ooze Bottle</h3><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p>As an action, you can throw this vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact and releasing a gray ooze. This ooze is friendly to you and your allies, and will otherwise attack the nearest creature it can detect. If there is no creature to attack, the ooze will follow you. However, the biochemistry of this ooze is unstable, and the ooze dissolves into a lifeless sludge after 1 hour. The charcoal-colored liquid inside this bottle seems to lunge about with unnatural momentum.</p><h3>Parchment of Sending</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>This parchment can hold a message of twenty-five words or less; additional text is magically erased. When addressed with the name of a creature with which you are familiar, the parchment folds itself into the shape of a glider and flutters on the wind, magically seeking out the creature within 24 hours if the recipient is on the same plane of existence as you. The recipient can write an additional twenty-five word message, and cause the parchment to fold itself and return to you by addressing it to your name. The parchment can make four such trips, and then becomes nonmagical parchment.</p><h3>Peacekeeper</h3><p><em>Weapon (any firearm), uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>As an action, you launch a radiant, magical bolas from the weapon, directed at a creature within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and restrained by the bolas. A Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A restrained creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, breaking the bolas and freeing itself on a success. Each time a creature fails this check, the bolas tightens, dealing [[/r 1d8]] radiant damage to the restrained creature.</p><p>When you launch a bolas, roll [[/r 1d6]]. On a 1 or 2, it can’t be used to do so again until the following dawn.</p><h3>Pentacle of Woe</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a witch)</em></p><p>While attuned to this medallion, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your hexes and witch spells. This bonus is determined by the pentacle’s rarity.</p><p>Additionally, this pentacle has 3 charges. You can expend a charge as a bonus action to cast a hex that usually takes an action. The pentacle regains all expended charges daily at dusk.</p><h3>Phase Arrow</h3><p><em>Weapon (arrow), uncommon</em></p><p>This ethereal arrow passes through all matter except the intended target. You ignore all cover, including total cover, when making an attack with this arrow. This arrow can target creatures on the Ethereal Plane as if they were on the Material Plane, and vice versa. Once it hits a target, the arrow is no longer magical.</p><h3>Polymorph Potion</h3><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, which is a purple liquid derived from mimic blood, you gain the effects of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.04nMsTWkIFvkbXlY]{polymorph}</em> spell for 1 hour. Roll [[/r 1d20]] and consult the following table to determine the form you are transformed into.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>d20</td><td>New Form</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Rat</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Lizard</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Cat</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Octopus</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Weasel</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Goat</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Owl</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Draft Horse</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Eagle</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Mastiff</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Constrictor Snake</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Wolf</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Ape</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Crocodile</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Giant Toad</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Commoner (random appearance)</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Brown Bear</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Tiger</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Elephant</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Tyrannosaurus Rex</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Portable Cannonballs</h3><p><em>Weapon (cannonballs), uncommon</em></p><p>This bag contains twenty iron balls, each one inch in diameter and weighing 1/4 of a pound. As a bonus action, you can speak the command word, which causes any number of the balls to expand into full-size cannonballs weighing 10 pounds each, suitable for firing from a cannon.</p><p>The bag can be poured out on the ground as an action, in which case it functions exactly as a bag of ball bearings. If the command word is spoken after the bag is poured out, all the balls expand at once. If a bag full of expanded balls is set to rolling, such as by being poured down a hill, any creature in the path of the balls must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage.</p><p>Individual iron balls can be fired from a sling or firearm and expanded in midair, dealing [[/r 2d12]] bludgeoning damage on a hit, though any attacks made in this fashion have disadvantage.</p><h3>Portal Chalk</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em></p><p>Each of these two pieces of chalk radiate a different luminescent aura: one orange, the other blue. Each piece of chalk has 10 uses. As an action, you can expend one use of a piece of chalk to draw a circular or rectangular portal on a solid stone surface large enough for a Medium creature. This portal instantly becomes linked to the most recent portal drawn with the other color of chalk, unlinking any portals created by these pieces of chalk other than these two. A linked portal is a glowing ring or rectangle filled with opaque mist; an unlinked portal is simply mundane chalk. A pair of linked portals acts as a magical gate. Any creature or object entering a linked portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other.</p><h3>Potion of Mirrored Eyes</h3><p><em>Potion, uncommon</em></p><p>For 1 minute after you drink this potion, you gain immunity to any effect which can normally be avoided by averting your gaze from it, such as a medusa’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsterfeatures.wkIN7WTeX8ebbjtv]{petrifying gaze}. While under the influence of this potion, you can safely look at such creatures without being subjected to their abilities.</p><h3>Puzzle Box</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>Though a magic item in and of itself, this cubic box often contains far more powerful and destructive items. The puzzle box can hold one cubic foot of contents, which can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.</p><p>Once the box is closed, it can only be opened by solving the box’s puzzle. You can attempt to solve it by spending 24 hours working on the puzzle mechanism, after which you must succeed a DC 23 Intelligence check to open the box. You can close the box as an action, automatically scrambling the puzzle.</p><h3>Reaper's Bullet</h3><p><em>Weapon (any firearm ammunition), legendary</em></p><p>This bullet, forged by the reaper and engraved with insidious runes, brings inevitable death on its target. A creature hit by this bullet dies.</p><h3>Replacement Man</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>If damage would reduce you to 0 hit points while you are attuned to this human-shaped figurine, you drop to 1 hit point instead and the figurine fades away with a sad smile on his face.</p><h3>Replica Clay</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>When you touch this lump of clay to an object that can fit within a 5-foot cube, the clay shifts and molds into an exact replica with the same color and texture. The replica even mimics visual magical elements, such as glowing runes. Touching the replica reveals it to be made of clay, as it yields under any significant force, but it is impossible to distinguish with a visual inspection. Once the clay is shaped into a replica, it becomes nonmagical.</p><h3>Reverberating Shield</h3></div><div><p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While holding this shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. Whenever a creature misses you with a melee weapon attack while you are holding this shield, it must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops its weapon, which is thrown 15 feet away from you. If the weapon can’t be dropped, such as a dragon’s bite or claws, the attacker instead has disadvantage on all weapon attacks until the end of its turn.</p><h3>Ring of Barrels</h3><p><em>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This ring has 6 charges and regains [[/r 1d6]] expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action and expend 1 to 3 of its charges to summon a number of empty barrels in spaces adjacent to you equal to the number of charges expended. The barrels are large, fully 6-feet high and 4-feet in diameter, occupying the same space as a Medium creature and providing three-quarters cover from ranged attacks. Barrels weigh 150 pounds and can be moved with an action.</p><p>You can summon a barrel around an incapacitated Medium creature, restraining it, or around a Small or smaller creature, trapping it inside. A creature can break free of a barrel by making a DC 22 Strength check.</p><h3>Ring of Icebergs</h3><p><em>Ring, very rare</em></p><p>As a bonus action, or a reaction to being hit by an attacker you can see, you can spin the ring’s jewel, causing it to expand into a hollow block of clear ice that completely surrounds you. This iceberg occupies your space and pushes creatures within your space to the nearest unoccupied area, ending any grapple in which you are involved. There is enough room within the iceberg to move around, but you can’t move more than 6 inches in any direction. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the iceberg or be cast through it.</p><p>The iceberg is an object with AC 10 and 100 HP. If it was activated as a reaction, it takes as much of the triggering damage as possible. The iceberg has immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. The iceberg lasts for up to 1 minute, until it is destroyed, or until you use a bonus action to cease the jewel’s spinning.</p><p>Once you spin the ring to create an iceberg, you can’t do so again until the following dawn.</p><h3>Ring of Salvation</h3><p><em>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>If you fail a saving throw while attuned to this ring, you can choose to succeed it instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until the next dawn.</p><h3>Sandstone Solution</h3><p><em>Potion, rare</em></p><p>You can pour this substance on the ground as an action. If poured onto stone, a 10-foot deep, 10-foot radius portion of the stone becomes mud for 1 hour.</p><p>When poured into mud, sand, or quicksand, a 10-foot deep, 10-foot radius region of the material become solid stone for 1 hour. The stone has AC 17, 75 HP, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Any creature inside it when it becomes stone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. The restrained creature can break free by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing 25 damage to the stone. This sandlike substance flows about its container like a fluid.</p><h3>Scroll of Duplication</h3><p><em>Scroll, common</em></p><p>This blank scroll is imbued with enchantments that enable it to copy text from another source. As an action, you can touch the <em>scroll of duplication</em> to an object that contains writing. The scroll instantaneously copies up to 500 consecutive words from the source material (you can choose which section if the source material is longer than this), creating a perfect duplicate of the original text. The scroll only copies nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the contents of a spellbook or a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{glyph of warding}</em>). If the source contains a mixture of magical writing, illustrations, and nonmagical text, only the nonmagical text is copied, leaving blank space where illustrations and magical writing would be expected. Using the scroll doesn’t activate magical traps that trigger upon reading the source material.</p><h3>Skitterlegs</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>Worn like a backpack, these brass and mithral legs deploy when you’re knocked out or paralyzed. A series of switches allows you to program the legs with either the “Defend” or “Eliminate” setting, as well as a list of friendly creatures in order of priority.</p><p>Whenever you are paralyzed or knocked unconscious (except when unconscious due to nonmagical sleep), the skitterlegs deploy, lifting your body from the ground. While the legs are deployed, you don’t count as being prone. Attacks made against you while the legs are deployed aren’t critical hits, even though you are paralyzed or unconscious. The legs make Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws with a +5 modifier.</p><p>The legs have a walking speed of 30 feet. On each of your turns while you are paralyzed or unconscious, the legs behave according to their settings:</p><p><em><strong>Defend.</strong></em> The legs take the Dodge or Disengage action (your choice when you program the legs) and move toward the highest-priority friendly creature that is still conscious.</p><p><em><strong>Eliminate.</strong></em> The legs move toward the nearest hostile creature and make two melee attacks with an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the legs deal [[/r 1d8]] + 2 piercing damage.</p><p>If you regain consciousness or recover from paralysis, the legs set you back on your feet before retracting. The legs can function for one cumulative hour each day. If this duration is exceeded, the legs collapse and drop you prone.</p><h3>Smoking Pipe of Dragon's Breath</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This pipe has 2 charges and regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the pipe is full of one ounce of smoking herb, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to inhale deeply from it and exhale dragon’s flame. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take [[/r 8d6]] fire damage, or half as much on a successful one.</p><h3>Sorting Beast</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>The <em>sorting beast</em> is a six-legged machine with eyes, legs, and antennae at both ends, as well as an array of measuring devices near its center. It can manipulate and hold objects up to 30 pounds in weight.</p><p>When activated as an action, the <em>sorting beast</em> sets about collecting and sorting all loose valuable items within 100 feet. It sorts all gold pieces, silver pieces, and copper pieces into neat stacks of 10. For material goods, such as precious stones, the <em>sorting beast</em> can appraise value by weight and quality, before sorting the goods appropriately and printing the results on a fine paper strip. The <em>sorting beast</em> continues sorting until finished or deactivated as an action.</p><p>Additionally, the <em>sorting beast</em> can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{identify}</em>, without using material components, on one object you designate each day.</p><h3>Switch Amalgam</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a craftsman)</em></p><p>This mixture of mithral, quicksilver, and platinum molds easily and adheres to steel, allowing a trained craftsman to make unique compound weapons. While attuned to the amalgam, you can spend a minute heating the amalgam and carefully attaching it to a weapon or removing it from one. The amalgam can be attached to two weapons at a time. Once attached to two weapons, the weapons become magical, and each gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.</p><p>Additionally, each weapon gains the [Switch] property. A switch weapon has two forms; you can swap between which weapon is being used at any time, even between attacks. Unlike other switch weapons, weapons unified with the amalgam do not become exotic weapons.</p><h3>Thornbow</h3><p><em>Weapon (any bow), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This magic weapon has 6 charges and regains [[/r 1d4]] + 2 charges daily at dawn. As a bonus action, you can expend a charge to cause a thorny arrow to grow from the bow, choosing whether it is a Bramblestrike or Splinterstrike arrow. You can also spend three charges as an action to fire an Overgrowth Volley.</p><p><em><strong>Bramblestrike.</strong></em> On a hit, this magic arrow deals the weapon’s normal damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become restrained by magical vines for up to 1 minute. A restrained creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success.</p><p><em><strong>Splinterstrike.</strong></em> On a hit, this magic arrow deals the weapon’s normal damage, and then erupts in a storm of splinters and thorns. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take [[/r 1d10]] piercing damage.</p><p><em><strong>Overgrowth Volley.</strong></em> Three thick-limbed, thorny arrows grow from the bow and fire at a point you choose that you can see within 120 feet of you. Where the arrows land, a mass of sylkthorn brambles grow, creating an effect identical to the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.AQsBc94ES7W7s7iG]{wall of thorns}</em> spell, dealing [[/r 4d8]] damage instead of 7d8.</p><h3>Tome of Tongues</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>This book contains grammar and vocabulary for a specific language, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 8 hours over a period of 2 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, you learn to read, write, and speak whatever language it concerns. The tome then loses its magic forever.</p><h3>Totem of Enmity</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p><p>This wooden rod is engraved with evil symbols and hateful curses in all languages. As an action, you can break the rod while speaking the name of a creature you are familiar with to swear vengeance against that creature. You indefinitely have advantage on attack rolls against the named creature. This effect ends if you break another <em>totem of enmity</em> or the creature dies.</p><h3>Treant's Bane</h3><p><em>Weapon (any axe or sword), rare</em></p><p>If you hit a Plant with this weapon, the Plant takes an extra [[/r 2d6]] damage of the weapon’s type. This weapon ignores the damage threshold of objects made of wood, vines, or other naturally grown materials.</p><h3>Troll Rod</h3><p><em>Weapon (mace), uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This uncouth pommel has a troll’s arm attached—still living—to one end. As a bonus action, you can issue it commands in the troll dialect of Giant to pick up items, drop them, or make a fist (typical command words include “grabbit,” “leggo,” and “maik’a’fist.”) If closed into a fist, the rod acts as a magic mace, and you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using it.</p><h3>Universal Knocker</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p><p>You can use your action to hold this brass door knocker against an object to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1nhIxh0DsJsntCfj]{knock}</em> spell targeting the object. The knocker can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><h3>Weapon Charms</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, varies</em></p><p>A weapon charm is a small ornament fixed on a loop of string or chain. You can use your action to attach the charm on a weapon, usually on the weapon’s pommel, causing the weapon to become a magic weapon that requires attunement. Even if the weapon was already magical, you must attune to it again to gain the charm’s magical benefits, which are listed in the charm’s description. A weapon can only have one charm attached at a time.</p><p><em><strong>Bat (Uncommon).</strong></em> This obsidian charm appears like a shrieking bat. While attached, when you deal damage to a creature with this weapon, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p><p><em><strong>Blade (Uncommon).</strong></em> This adamantine charm is shaped like a miniature longsword. While attached, you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus doesn’t apply to magic weapons that already have a bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Die (Uncommon).</strong></em> This silver charm depicts a six-sided die. While attached, the weapon deals more potent critical hits. When you score a critical hit, if you roll the maximum number on any damage die, you can roll an extra damage die and add its damage to the total, rolling again if this die is also the maximum number, and so on. You can roll a total number of damage dice for this critical hit equal to twice the number of damage dice you initially rolled.</p><p><em><strong>Feather (Common).</strong></em> This gold charm of a feather feels unusually light. While attached, this weapon weighs half as much as usual. Small creatures can effectively use the weapon, even if it has the Heavy property.</p><p><em><strong>Ghost (Common).</strong></em> This crystal charm is carved into the shape of a wispy spirit. While attached, the weapon can affect creatures on the Ethereal Plane as if they were on the Material Plane, and vice versa.</p><p><em><strong>Hook (Common).</strong></em> This bronze charm is shaped like a fishing hook. When attached, if the weapon is on the same plane of existence, you can use your bonus action to teleport it to your hand.</p><p><em><strong>Lance (Uncommon).</strong></em> This copper charm depicts a short lance. While attached, once on each of your turns when you make a melee attack with this weapon against a creature you can see, you can lunge up to 15 feet toward your target before making the attack. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. You can perform this movement even if it causes you to travel through the air, though you fall after making the attack if you have nothing holding you aloft.</p><p><em><strong>Lightning Bolt (Uncommon).</strong></em> This mithral charm depicts a wild lightning bolt. While attached, this weapon deals an extra [[/r 1d6]] lightning damage to any target it hits.</p><p><em><strong>Mirror (Rare).</strong></em> This shiny platinum charm depicts an elegant hand mirror. This charm can only be attached to a weapon with the Light property. When attached, when you draw the weapon with one hand, a spectral duplicate of the weapon appears in your other hand. This spectral duplicate has identical statistics to the original weapon, including its magical effects, but doesn’t include ammunition. When the attached weapon or its spectral duplicate leaves your hand, the duplicate vanishes.</p><h3>Weapon for Dummies</h3><p><em>Weapon (any martial weapon), uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While attuned to this magic weapon, you have proficiency in it. This weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you miss an attack with this weapon, you can expend a charge to gain a +5 bonus to the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to hit. The weapon congratulates you when you hit an enemy, and condescendingly berates you when you miss.</p><h3>Wooden Coin of Lies</h3><p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While attuned to this coin, you are constantly under the effect of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1RzxKZzkQOoioxPj]{glibness}</em> spell.</p><p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This coin is cursed; attuning to it extends its curse to you. You can only break attunement to the coin with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. While attuned to the coin, you can’t deliberately speak the truth. You can be evasive in your wording, lie by omission, or speak half-truths, as long as your words remain within the boundaries of deception.</p></div>"
