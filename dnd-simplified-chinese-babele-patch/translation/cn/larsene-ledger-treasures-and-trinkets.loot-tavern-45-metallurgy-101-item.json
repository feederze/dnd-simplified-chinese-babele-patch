The shackles typically fasten themselves around a creature's wrists and neck, but can change their form to accommodate different sizes and anatomies.</p><p>These shackles function similarly to a mundane pair of manacles, but have 50 hit points instead of 15 and move with the <span id=\"was-tagged\">restrained</span> creature if it teleports. The <span id=\"was-tagged\">restrained</span> creature can also attempt a DC 15 Charisma check to escape them, teleporting them back to the original wielder on a success. Breaking out of the shackles with a successful Strength check only forces them open and doesn't destroy them. In addition, every time the <span id=\"was-tagged\">restrained</span> creature takes an action, bonus action, or reaction, the shackles deal [[/r 1d4]] force damage to it. If any of those are taken to cast a spell, the shackles deal [[/r 2d4]] damage instead.</p><p>This property of the shackles can be used twice, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.</p>",

Under this mass grave, the metal that the dwarves had been extracting was changed, speckled with crimson veins from soaking in the blood of the workers. This was the first discovery of blood mithral.</p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armour. While you are below half of your hit point maximum, this bonus increases to a +2. If the armour normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (<span id=\"was-tagged\">Stealth</span>) checks or has a Strength requirement, the blood mithral version doesn't.</p><p><em><strong>Aegis of Agony.</strong></em> As an action while wearing this armour, you can take [[/r 1d6]] necrotic damage and gain twice as many temporary hit points, which last for 1 hour. Damage you take from this property ignores temporary hit points and can't be reduced or prevented in any way. If you are below half of your hit point maximum when you use this property, you can do so as a bonus action instead of an action, and you gain an extra [[/r 1d6]] temporary hit points.</p>"
