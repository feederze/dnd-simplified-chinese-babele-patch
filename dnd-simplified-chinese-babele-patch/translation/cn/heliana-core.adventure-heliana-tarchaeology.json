      "description": "<p>Greetings, hunter! What you have here is a monster hunt from <em>Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting</em>. Heliana's hunts require your players to find the monster, picking up clues along the way, and then defeat it in an epic multi-wave boss battle. Be<strong> really obvious</strong> with the clues; make sure to give out the associated handouts. After the clues have been collected, but before the boss fight begins, the players should always have a chance to long rest and use what they've learned to prepare for the fight ahead.</p><p></p><p>This hunt makes full use of the Tracking, Harvesting, Crafting, and Cooking rules from Heliana's—be sure to read up on those! Using the Cooking rules to prepare magical meals is a great way the players can monopolise on the clues! Each of these Foundry Adventures comes with:</p><ul><li><p>PDF of the hunt.</p></li><li><p>Three clue handouts to be given to the players before they meet the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Handouts of the fantastical things the players might see along the way.</p></li><li><p>Walled and lit scenes, with each wave's monsters separated by level.</p></li><li><p>Actors with original tokens.</p></li><li><p>Lair actions given their own actor (be sure to put it at initiative count 20!).</p></li><li><p>Magic items that can be found during the hunt, as well as those that can be crafted from the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Spells that the monsters and magic items use.</p></li></ul><h3>About This Hunt</h3><p>This hunt, <em>Tarchaeology</em>, is intended for 3 to 7 characters and is optimised for a party of 4 with an average party level (APL) of <strong>9</strong>, <strong>14</strong>, or <strong>20</strong>. Characters who complete this hunt should earn enough experience to progress one-third of the way to 10th level or two-thirds of the way to 15th level. The adventurers must travel to the tar flats of the Great Airy Plain and tackle a strange plague of oily menaces.</p><p>While travelling to the tar flats, where Baron Bodrum Businesses Inc.’s mining works are located, the party finds a small research outpost studying tar elementals. The party can use the clues found in the outpost, as well as those discerned from an encounter with a minor tar elemental, to prepare for the battle ahead. After arriving at the mining works, increasingly violent earthquakes herald the arrival of a swarm of tar elementals that become empowered when in proximity to arcane power sources. The party can kill these possessed creatures or find a way to disable them. Subsequently, the bones of increasingly dangerous creatures are animated by the tar, culminating in a battle against the main monster: the tar-rasque.</p><h3>Credits</h3><p><strong>Lead Designers</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Lead Writer</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Rule Development</strong>: Max Wartelle, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih</p><p><strong>Additional Writing</strong>: João Araújo, Mage Armoire, Tony Casper, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Jethro Mellors, Duncan Watson</p><p><strong>Editing</strong>: Phylea, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Formatting</strong>: Sally Kay Clark, Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Proofing</strong>: João Araújo, Sally Kay Clark, Jessic Gombart, Victor Matyiku</p><p><strong>Art Directors</strong>: Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Layout</strong>: Max Wartelle</p><p><strong>Cover Illustrator</strong>: Jesse Jackdaw Burns</p><p><strong>Interior Illustrators</strong>: Diogo Assunçao, Hannah Elizabeth Baker, Mohamed “Aggi” Bellafquih, Jesse Jackdaw Burns, Luciano Javier Carreira, Ivy Dolamore, Aleksa Drageljevic, Sam Jumisko, Michelle Mueller, Derek Murphy, Mikhail Palamarchuk, Joris Sanchez, Ognjen Sporin, Bryan Syme, Chaouki ‘’Ciao’” Titouhi, Denis Zhbankov</p><p><strong>Cartographers</strong>: Cze &amp; Peku, Mad Cartographer</p><p><strong>Cacophonics the Bard</strong>: Jack Patchett</p><p><strong>Ambience</strong>: Michaël Ghelfi Studios</p><p><strong>Marketing Consultant</strong>: Ricardo Evangelho</p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong>: Ethen Adams, Sally Kay Clark, Ricardo Evangelho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Piotr “Narb” Wiśnios</p><p><strong>Playtesters:</strong> A11star, Adam Bohkari, Addy, aj, alpha_spark, Alzebub, Balbowa, Blanket, Buront, Catbath, Constantine, cypheur, Danger7778, Derpy, Douglas, Erunas, Feria, Ghost, GremlinRemy, GrimOptimist, Igris, Jambo Kaka, jasoncelic, Jesse Marek, JonDemand, junkdroid, Kaniki, Kensho, Kevin “Smood” McDonnell, Kobe Montour, Korren, Kristjan the Necrom, luke4495, Megan Pisarik, MementoMorrie, MonoXideAtWork, MrMonneypenny, Naming Fae, narnia3756, NeK0z, Neldu, NickWolf8 , One True Doge, Osirusblue, Phillip , PulsarCologne, RabidAmazonian, Relle, Rohdry, RutledgeHusband, SendHelp, Shadowpaine, Siggy, Sir Mk, SleepySpartan, Solo, Stevie Friesth, Taoko, teepea298, TheNewBadHombre, TinyKitty, Toria, Truwolf, Ulysses, victorcree, Victor Matyiku, vivacia, Watermelon, wyvernvalet, Zachary Nix</p>",

After arriving at the mining works, increasingly violent earthquakes herald the arrival of a swarm of tar elementals that become empowered when in proximity to arcane power sources. The party can kill these possessed creatures or find a way to disable them. Subsequently, the bones of increasingly dangerous creatures are animated by the tar, culminating in a battle against the main monster: the tar-rasque.</p><h5 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-5--Table-\">Variable Lair Action Statistics</h5><table id=\"level-select\" class=\"Basic-Table\"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Hunt Level</strong></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><strong class=\"Bold\">VDC</strong></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Vdam</strong></p></td></tr><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures level-selector\" data-level=\"9\"><span class=\"None\">9th</span></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"Left-Align\">15</span></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"Left-Align\">10 (</span><strong class=\"Bold\">3d6</strong><span class=\"Left-Align\">)</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures level-selector\" data-level=\"14\"><span class=\"None\">14th</span></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"Left-Align\">16</span></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"Left-Align\">14 (</span><strong class=\"Bold\">4d6</strong><span class=\"Left-Align\">)</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures level-selector\" data-level=\"20\"><span class=\"None\">20th</span></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"Left-Align\">18</span></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"None\">28 (</span><strong class=\"Bold\">8d6</strong><span class=\"None\">)</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>"

The tar extraction is less profitable than previously estimated and he now seeks to destroy both the miners and archaeologists in an attempt to defraud his insurance company. In addition, he is using his accomplice, Branton Quark, to test a new type of technology: a fusion of elemental tar and arcane power sources.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\">Weeks ago, Branton Quark planted a large arcane power source within the head of the tarrasque skeleton being unearthed by the archaeologists. Controlling the arcane crystal from his research station, Quark has managed to channel bursts of arcane, primordial energy that animates the nearby tar, causing it to erupt from the ground and attack with undirected rage. It is these disturbances that caused Archdruid Xyxl, a patron of the ASSES, to contact Heliana for assistance in protecting the workers.</p>"

explore. However, the really inspiring places are where those planes meet. Where water meets fire, living steam abounds; earth and air forms dunes of swirling dust; and where earth meets water, you get mud. Throw in some hydrocarbons, several atmospheres of pressure, and let it bake for 100 to 500 million years. Voilà: you have tar.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\">Necromantic energy abounds in tar and, if properly activated, can result in some unique reanimative properties.
