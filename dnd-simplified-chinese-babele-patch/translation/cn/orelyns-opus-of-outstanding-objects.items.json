Accepting the challenge, the Technurge opened his timeless vault and bestowed fabled weapons upon the Underking's defenders, and then toiled over his enchanted anvil to create the <em>Divider</em>, a new artifact of mythical power for the Underking's mightiest champion.</p><p>Yet it was treachery that brought about the kingdom's downfall as the champion turned the <em>Divider</em> against the Underking and seized the crown, plunging the realm into chaos. The Technurge watched in horror as his creations became instruments of betrayal and even sought to intervene, violating ancient pacts that forbade him from taking sides in wars between mortals. But not even a demigod could alter the kingdom's fate.

As long as it remains within 5 feet of a moonblade that accepts it, <em>Serpentis</em> can communicate telepathically with it.</p>",
