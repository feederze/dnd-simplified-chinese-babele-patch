They have no concept of ‘murder’ or ‘theft’; everything is simply ‘useful’ or ‘waste’. This simplified outlook on life often brings hyphan colonies into conflict with other races.</p><p>Some colonies employ a plan of rapid relocation, moving themselves to new locations as soon as their existence is discovered. Others act hyper-aggresively, consuming any creature the moment it steps within their borders. Some colonies, in particular those that are in close proximity to other races, have developed a humanoid-like persona to interact with those peoples: a veiled lady.</p><p>The landscape of hyphan foreign policy is constantly changing as strategies that result in extermination fail to propogate, and colonies develop new, unique schemes.</p><p><em><strong>Appearance.</strong></em> In the dim light of an underground cavern, a veiled lady appears as a huge, gowned silhouette, faintly feminine in shape. Closer inspection reveals a hollow where one might expect a cranium, and skin formed of constantly shifting threads of ultra-fine mycelia. A veiled lady appears to drift across the floor, gliding up unclimbable walls and squeezing through minute gaps without apparent effort.</p>",

If the target is alive, it must succeed on a <strong>DC 14 Constitution saving throw</strong> or automatically fail one death saving throw. On a failure, or if the target is a corpse, the Veiled Lady regains 14 (<strong>4d6</strong>) hit points. Once a corpse has been targeted by this feature, it becomes desiccated and can’t be targeted again.</p>"
