Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.</p><p>A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p><p>Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <em>dispel magic</em>.</p><p>In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.</p><p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.</p><p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.</p><p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.</p>",

The skeletons go first because they got the highest Initiative: 20. <span class=\"footnote\">10</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Attack Rolls.</strong> When a creature attacks, whether swinging a sword or firing an arrow from a bow, its player makes an attack roll. If the total is equal to or higher than the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. <span class=\"footnote\">11</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Spells and Reactions.</strong> Mirabella casts the <em>Shield</em> spell. It’s a special property of this spell that it can be cast even when it’s not the caster’s turn, using her Reaction (see “Actions” earlier in this chapter). <span class=\"footnote\">12</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> Auro’s Sneak Attack lets him deal extra damage to the skeletons, and his Cunning Action lets him Disengage as a Bonus Action. These are examples of class features (described in chapter 3) that let characters bend the rules. <span class=\"footnote\">13</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Vulnerability.</strong> An attack that deals Bludgeoning damage is deadly to skeletons. Shreeve knows this from past experience, which is why she drops her sword and switches to a Bludgeoning weapon. She rolls only 7 damage, but the DM knows the skeleton actually takes 14 damage. <span class=\"footnote\">14</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Areas of Effect.</strong> Spells and many other effects in the game fill a specific area that is defined by the rules, like the 15-foot Cube of the <em>Thunderwave</em> spell. See the rules glossary for more on areas of effect. <span class=\"footnote\">15</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Saving Throws.</strong> The skeletons make Constitution saving throws to resist the <em>Thunderwave</em> spell. When they fail those saves, they take damage and are pushed, as defined in that spell’s description. <span class=\"footnote\">16</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Damage and Hit Points.</strong> The skeletons have 13 Hit Points each, so the spells and attacks in this example deal enough damage to destroy them. If a spell or an attack dealt less than 13 damage, the DM would keep track of the damage each skeleton has taken until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and is destroyed.</p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Saving Throws.</strong> Gareth’s Sear Undead is a class feature (see chapter 3). As with Mira­bella’s <em>Thunderwave</em> spell, Sear Undead forces the skeletons to make a saving throw. <span class=\"footnote\">17</span></p></aside></section></div>",

Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a class (such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbFighter000000]{Fighter} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbWizard0000000]{Wizard}), a background (such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbBackgroundDes.JournalEntryPage.APL7pJ7446etLuQN]{Sailor} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbBackgroundDes.JournalEntryPage.7DAvTQlrw7OTsgpX]{Acolyte}), and a species (such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri.JournalEntryPage.8t4u8CWYbxubXflR]{Human} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri.JournalEntryPage.h9oGyt2Wh9mp0xbg]{Elf}. You also invent the personality and appearance of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your avatar in the D&amp;D multiverse.</p><h2>Get Ready</h2><p>Before you dive into character creation, there are a few things to do to get ready, as explained below.</p><h2>Talk with Your DM</h2><p>Start by talking with your Dungeon Master about the type of D&amp;D game they plan to run. If the DM draws inspiration from Greek myth, for example, you might choose a different direction for your character than if the DM is planning for swashbuckling on the high seas. Think about the kind of adventurer you want to play in this game. If you don’t know where to begin, look at the character illustrations in this book for inspiration.</p><h2>Choose a Character Sheet</h2><p>You’ll record the main details of your character on a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use the term “character sheet” to mean whatever you use to track your character’s details, whether it’s a printed character sheet (like the one shown on the following pages), a digital character sheet like the one on D&amp;D Beyond, or plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works for you, and then embark on creating a character!</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Session Zero</h3><p>Some Dungeon Masters start a campaign with a “session zero,” an initial gathering focused on creating characters and setting expectations, including topics to avoid as well as those to embrace. A session zero provides a great opportunity to talk to the other players and the DM and decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake together.</p></aside>",

Note your armor training on your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of armor means you can wear that armor effectively, gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of armor are described in chapter 6.</p><h2>Hold That Thought</h2><p>You’ll fill in more details about your class later.

If so, with whom?</li><li>Did you join an organization, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?</li><li>What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?</li></ul><h2>Choose Languages</h2><p>Your character knows at least three languages: Common plus two languages you roll or choose from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features might also give you languages.</p><p>The Standard Languages table lists languages that are widespread on D&amp;D worlds.

Do this five more times, so you have six numbers.</p><p><em><strong>Point Cost.</strong></em> You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 of your 27 points.</p><h2>Assign Ability Scores</h2><p>Once you’ve generated six scores, assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class’s primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.</p><p>If you’re using the Standard Array option, consult the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions on where to assign scores for your character’s class.

Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they aren’t evil; they are unaligned.</p></aside><h2>The Nine Alignments</h2><p>A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).</p><p>The summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behavior.</p><p><em><strong>Lawful Good (LG).</strong></em> Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.</p><p><em><strong>Neutral Good (NG).</strong></em> Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.</p><p><em><strong>Chaotic Good (CG).</strong></em> Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron’s tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good.</p><p><em><strong>Lawful Neutral (LN).</strong></em> Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life—and isn’t swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil—is probably Lawful Neutral.</p><p><em><strong>Neutral (N).</strong></em> Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Someone who’s bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.</p><p><em><strong>Chaotic Neutral (CN).</strong></em> Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.</p><p><em><strong>Lawful Evil (LE).</strong></em> Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil.</p><p><em><strong>Neutral Evil (NE).</strong></em> Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.</p><p><em><strong>Chaotic Evil (CE).</strong></em> Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCh2ArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.eYCtlrpgpc2R0T5p]</p><h4>Alignment and Personality</h4><p>Alignment can shape a character’s personality, goals, and core beliefs.

Some players also like to note the modifier for saving throws they’re not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Skills.</strong></em> For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you’re not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Passive Perception.</strong></em> Sometimes your DM will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; the DM uses your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general awareness of your surroundings when you’re not actively looking for something.

At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space to note how many Hit Dice you’ve spent.</p><p><em><strong>Initiative.</strong></em> Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative on your character sheet.</p><p><em><strong>Armor Class.</strong></em> Without armor or a shield, your base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in chapter 6. A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.</p><p><em><strong>Attacks.</strong></em> In the Weapons &amp; Damage Cantrips section of the character sheet, write your starting weapons.

    "original": "<p>With each new level, characters acquire new capabilities that equip them to handle greater challenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of the game also changes, and the stakes of the campaign get higher. It’s helpful to think of a character’s (and a campaign’s) arc in terms of four tiers of play, describing the journey from a level 1 character just beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights of level 20. These tiers don’t have any rules associated with them; they point to the fact that the play experience evolves as characters gain levels.</p><h2>Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)</h2><p>In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers, though they are already set apart from the broader populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities. They learn their starting class features and choose a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a danger to local farmsteads or villages.</p><h2>Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)</h2><p>In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers. Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplFireball00]{Fireball}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplLightningB]{Lightning Bolt}, and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplRaiseDead0]{Raise Dead}. Most weapon-focused classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in a round. The characters now face dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.</p><h2>Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)</h2><p>In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power that makes them special among adventurers. At level 11, many spell­casters learn reality-altering spells. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or to do more impressive things with those attacks. These adventurers often confront threats to whole regions.</p><h2>Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)</h2><p>At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.</p>",

    "original": "<p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level instead of gaining a level in your current class. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in a single class.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher, since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.</p><h2>Experience Points</h2><p>The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table in this chapter. For example, if you are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a Cleric.</p><h2>Hit Points and Hit Point Dice</h2><p>You gain the Hit Points from your new class as described for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit Points for a class only when your total character level is 1.</p><p>Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice are the same die type, you can pool them together. For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5 Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, track them separately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin, for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10 Hit Dice.</p><h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2><p>Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table. For example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue, you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 character, which is +3.</p><h2>Proficiencies</h2><p>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of the new class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each class’s description in chapter 3.</p><h2>Class Features</h2><p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the information about multiclassing included in each of your classes’ descriptions.</p><p>Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.</p><h3>Armor Class</h3><p>If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor Class, you can benefit from only one at a time. For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Draconic Resilience feature must choose only one of those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless you have a feature that says you can (such as the Fighter’s Two Extra Attacks feature).</p><p>Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invocation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCh2ArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.rSPWZt1If4YqQSGR classes=\"right three blend-multiply\"]</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class.</p><p><em><strong>Spells Prepared.</strong></em> You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips).</p><p>Each spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, unless the spell says otherwise.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots. </strong></em>You determine your available spell slots by adding together the following:</p><ul><li>All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes</li><li>Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and Ranger classes</li><li>One third of your Fighter or Rogue levels (round down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or Arcane Trickster subclass.</li></ul><p>Then look up this total level in the Level column of the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.</p><p>This table might give you spell slots of a higher level than the spells you prepare. You can use those slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplBurningHan]{Burning Hands}, has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level, you can use the enhanced effect as normal.</p><p>For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when determining your spell slots, counting all your levels as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3 slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells, nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance their effects.</p><p><em><strong>Pact Magic.</strong></em> If you have the Pact Magic feature from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic to cast spells you have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast Warlock spells you have prepared.</p><table><caption><p>Multiclass Spellcaster: <br />Spell Slots per Spell Level</p></caption><thead><tr><th><p>Level</p></th><th><p>1</p></th><th><p>2</p></th><th><p>3</p></th><th><p>4</p></th><th><p>5</p></th><th><p>6</p></th><th><p>7</p></th><th><p>8</p></th><th><p>9</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

If the roll has &amp;Reference[advantage] or &amp;Reference[disadvantage], you roll two d20s, but you use the number from only one of them—the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower one if you have Disadvantage.</li><li><p><strong>2: Add Modifiers.</strong> Add these modifiers to the number rolled on the d20:</p><ul><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-2\"><strong>The Relevant Ability Modifier.</strong> This chapter and the rules glossary explain which ability modifiers to use for various D20 Tests.</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-2\"><strong>Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant. </strong>Each creature has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added when making a D20 Test that uses something, such as a skill, in which the creature has proficiency. See @UUID[.zU9fgQbLaVbJvPRX]{Proficiency} later in this chapter.</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-2\"><strong>Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties.</strong> A class feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus or penalty to the die roll.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Compare the Total to a Target Number.</strong> If the total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. The Dungeon Master determines target numbers and tells players whether their rolls are successful. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a &amp;Reference[difficultyclass] (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an &amp;Reference[armorclass] (AC), which appears on a character sheet or in a stat block.</li></ol>",

    "original": "<p>Characters and monsters are good at various things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while others can use only a few. Some are better at understanding people’s motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature’s capabilities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels (described in @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCreatingAChar.JournalEntryPage.iHbj5aJvc1T7i5YI]{chapter 2}). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based on its &amp;Reference[challengerating]. The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined.</p><p>This bonus is applied to a &amp;Reference[d20test] when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.</p><table><caption>Proficiency Bonus</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Level or CR</p></th><th><p>Bonus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Up to 4</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5–8</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9–12</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13–16</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17–20</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>21–24</p></td><td><p>+7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>25–28</p></td><td><p>+8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>29–30</p></td><td><p>+9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>The Bonus Doesn’t Stack</h2><p>Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t add it twice if you’re proficient in both skills.</p><p>Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the &amp;Reference[expertise] feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.</p><h2>Skill Proficiencies</h2><p>Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbActions000000]{Actions} later in this chapter) specify which skill applies if you make an ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The DM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.</p><p>If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks involving that skill but doesn’t add its Proficiency Bonus. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the character adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.</p><table><caption>Skills</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Skill</p></th><th><p>Ability</p></th><th><p>Example Uses</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Acrobatics</p></td><td><p>Dexterity</p></td><td><p>Stay on your feet in a tricky situation, or perform an acrobatic stunt.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Animal Handling</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Calm or train an animal, or get an animal to behave in a certain way.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Arcana</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Recall lore about spells, magic items, and the planes of existence.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Athletics</p></td><td><p>Strength</p></td><td><p>Jump farther than normal, stay afloat in rough water, or break something.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Deception</p></td><td><p>Charisma</p></td><td><p>Tell a convincing lie, or wear a disguise convincingly.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>History</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Recall lore about historical events, people, nations, and cultures.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Insight</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Discern a person’s mood and intentions.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intimidation</p></td><td><p>Charisma</p></td><td><p>Awe or threaten someone into doing what you want.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Investigation</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Find obscure information in books, or deduce how something works.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medicine</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Diagnose an illness, or determine what killed the recently slain.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nature</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, and weather.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Perception</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Using a combination of senses, notice something that’s easy to miss.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Performance</p></td><td><p>Charisma</p></td><td><p>Act, tell a story, perform music, or dance.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Persuasion</p></td><td><p>Charisma</p></td><td><p>Honestly and graciously convince someone of something.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Religion</p></td><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Recall lore about gods, religious rituals, and holy symbols.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sleight of Hand</p></td><td><p>Dexterity</p></td><td><p>Pick a pocket, conceal a handheld object, or perform legerdemain.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stealth</p></td><td><p>Dexterity</p></td><td><p>Escape notice by moving quietly and hiding behind things.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Survival</p></td><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Follow tracks, forage, find a trail, or avoid natural hazards.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><aside class=\"notable three right\"><h3>Skills with Different Abilities</h3><p>Each skill proficiency is associated with an ability check. For example, the Intimidation skill is associated with Charisma. In some situations, the DM might allow you to apply your skill proficiency to a different ability check. For example, if a character tries to intimidate someone through a show of physical strength, the DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check rather than a Charisma (Intimidation) check. That character would make a Strength check and add their Proficiency Bonus if they have Intimidation proficiency.</p></aside><h3>Skill List</h3><p>The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes example uses for each skill proficiency as well as the ability check the skill most often applies to.</p><h3>Determining Skills</h3><p>A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in its stat block.</p><h2>Saving Throw Proficiencies</h2><p>Proficiency in a &amp;Reference[savingthrow] lets a character add their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a particular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.</p><p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws, representing that class’s training in evading or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example, are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves; they train to resist mental assault.</p><h2>Equipment Proficiencies</h2><p>A character gains proficiency with various weapons and tools from their class and background. There are two categories of equipment proficiency:</p><p><strong>Weapons.</strong> Anyone can wield a weapon, but proficiency makes you better at wielding it. If you have proficiency with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.</p><p><strong>Tools.</strong> If you have proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have Proficiency in the skill that’s also used with that check, you have &amp;Reference[advantage] on the check too. This means you can benefit from both skill proficiency and tool proficiency on the same ability check.</p>",

If it takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature’s Resistance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for its Vulnerability (to 22).</p>",

    "original": "<p>When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.</p><h3>Instant Death</h3><p>Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly.</p><p><em><strong>Monster Death.</strong></em> A monster dies the instant it drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Dungeon Master can ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat it like a character.</p><p><em><strong>Hit Point Maximum of 0.</strong></em> A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life energy, reducing a creature’s Hit Point maximum.</p><p><em><strong>Massive Damage.</strong></em> When damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the character dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to 0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.</p><h3>Character Demise</h3><p>If your character dies, others might find a magical way to revive your character, such as with the <em>Raise Dead</em> spell. Or talk with the DM about making a new character to join the group. The rules glossary has more information on being dead.</p><h3>Falling Unconscious</h3><p>If you reach 0 Hit Points and don’t die instantly, you have the &amp;Reference[Unconscious] condition until you regain any Hit Points, and you now face making Death Saving Throws (see below).</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Knocking Out a Creature</h3><p>When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condition. It then starts a Short Rest, at the end of which that condition ends on it. The condition ends early if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone takes an action to administer first aid to it, making a successful [[/check 10 skill=med]] check.</p></aside><h3>Death Saving Throws</h3><p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an ability score. You’re in the hands of fate now.</p><p><em><strong>Three Successes/Failures.</strong></em> Roll 1d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become Stable (see “Stabilizing a Character” below). On your third failure, you die.</p><p>The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.</p><p><em><strong>Rolling a 1 or 20.</strong></em> When you roll a 1 on the d20 for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point.</p><p><em><strong>Damage at 0 Hit Points.</strong></em> If you take any damage while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Saving Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.</p><h3>Stabilizing a Character</h3><p>You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p><p>A Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes damage, it stops being Stable and starts making Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.</p>",

    "original": "<p>The @UUID[.adlJqek4sIyJePKO]{Armor table} lists the game’s main armor. The table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well as the following details:</p><p><strong>Category.</strong> Every type of armor falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as shown in the table).</p><p><strong>Armor Class (AC).</strong> The table’s Armor Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.</p><p><strong>Strength.</strong> If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armor type, that armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p><p><strong>Stealth.</strong> If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Variant: Equipment Sizes</h3><p>In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, an orc adventurer won’t fit in a halfling’s Leather Armor, and a cloud giant’s robe would be far too large for a gnome.</p><p>The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of Plate Armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.</p><p>Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit a smith, a tailor, a leatherworker, or a similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work is 1d4 × 10 percent of the market price of the item.</p></aside><h2>Armor Training</h2><p>Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character’s class and other features determine the character’s armor training. A monster has training with any armor in its stat block.</p><h3>Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor</h3><p>If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.</p><h3>Shield</h3><p>You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.</p><h2>One at a Time</h2><p>A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time and wield only one Shield at a time.</p>",

    "original": "<p>Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.</p><h3>Ammunition</h3><p>You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.</p><h3>Finesse</h3><p>When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><h3>Heavy</h3><p>You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Improvised Weapons</h3><p>If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised Weapons” in the rules glossary. Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.</p></aside><h3>Light</h3><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.</p><h3>Loading</h3><p>You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><h3>Range</h3><p>A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the long range.</p><h3>Reach</h3><p>A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.</p><h3>Thrown</h3><p>If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.</p><h3>Two-Handed</h3><p>A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p><h3>Versatile</h3><p>A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>",

In a Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with &amp;Reference[Dim Light], patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have &amp;Reference[Disadvantage] on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p><p>A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with &amp;Reference[Darkness], heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque.

Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p><p><em><strong>Dim Light.</strong></em> Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a &amp;Reference[Lightly Obscured] area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might bathe the land in Dim Light.</p><p><em><strong>Darkness.</strong></em> Darkness creates a &amp;Reference[Heavily Obscured] area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.</p><h2>Special Senses</h2><p>Some creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations. The rules glossary defines the following special senses:</p><ul><li><p>&amp;Reference[Blindsight]</p></li><li><p>&amp;Reference[Darkvision]</p></li><li><p>&amp;Reference[Tremorsense]</p></li><li><p>&amp;Reference[Truesight]</p></li></ul>",

    "original": "<p>Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve. The player tells the DM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the DM describes what happens. Sometimes, however, rules govern what you can do with an object, as detailed in the following sections.</p><h2>What Is an Object?</h2><p>For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone. It isn’t a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects.</p><h2>Time-Limited Object Interactions</h2><p>When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature’s movement or action. Any additional interactions require the &amp;Reference[Utilize] action, as explained in @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCombat0000000]{Combat} later in this chapter.</p><h2>Finding Hidden Objects</h2><p>When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both.</p><p>If you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.</p><h2>Carrying Objects</h2><p>You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the DM might require you to abide by the rules for &amp;Reference[carrying capacity].</p><h2>Breaking Objects</h2><p>As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to damage something more resilient, the DM might use the rules on &amp;Reference[breaking objects] in the rules glossary.</p>",

Firelight glints off a poker beside the fireplace, and the walls are lined with ancient books. A huge painting hangs above the mantelpiece in a gilded frame. The firelight illuminates the portrait—an exact likeness of Ireena Kolyana.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (as Gareth):</span> How old does the painting look?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve (as Mirabella):</span> I’m going to check the books!</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> OK, I’ll get to those in a second. Russell and Amy, what are your characters doing?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell (as Shreeve):</span> I stand near the door, sword drawn, ready for danger. This place is creepy!</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy (as Auro):</span> I go near the fireplace. A warm fire sounds nice. But I’m also alert for danger.</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"footnote\">3</span></p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Got it. OK, Phillip, please make an Intelligence (History) check as Gareth looks at the painting.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip: </span>I don’t have proficiency in History, but here goes. I got—oh! A 20! For a total of … 20.</p></section><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Two things leap out at Gareth about the painting. First, the woman’s clothes look old-<span class=\"No-Break\">fashioned</span>. Second, the paint is flaking in places, and the whole thing is covered by a thin layer of soot. You’d say this painting is a few centuries old.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> So maybe an ancestor of Ireena’s? Unless she’s already a vampire and this “bitten by Strahd” thing is a ruse.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Who knows? Now, Mirabella’s looking at the books?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve</span><strong>:</strong> Yeah, I pull one off the shelf at random.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> It’s a book written in Common called <em>On the Habitations of the Divine in the Celestial and Infernal Realms</em>.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell: </span>Did you just make that up?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> I’ll never tell. As you flip through the book, you notice it’s very academic, almost impenetrable.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve:</span> OK, I put that one back and pull out another.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Are Shreeve and Auro doing anything else?</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"footnote\">4</span></p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> I grab the poker and poke at logs in the fire.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> As soon as you lift the poker, you hear a grinding sound, and the back of the fireplace slides to the side, revealing a room behind it!</p></section><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> “Uh, folks? I found something!” Can I see anything in the room beyond?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Past the flames and smoke, you see a glimmering pile of coins heaped near a chest.</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"footnote\">5</span></p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy: </span>Anybody have a quick way to put out a fire?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> And you laughed at me for preparing <em>Create or Destroy Water</em>! I clutch my Holy Symbol and cast the spell, drenching the fireplace.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> What does the spell’s description say?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip: </span>It causes 10 gallons of water to rain down in a 30-foot Cube, extinguishing flames there.</p></section><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"footnote\">6</span></p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Great! That puts out the fire. Without the light from the hearth, you’re back to the magic glow of Shreeve’s sword, which casts your shadows into the room beyond. But you can see, through clouds of lingering smoke, a closed chest on the floor, surrounded by piles of coins. There are two torch sconces on the far wall—one holding an unlit torch with an intricate metal base, the other empty. A skeleton in broken plate armor is lying against that wall, with one hand at its throat and the other holding the matching torch from the empty sconce.</p></section><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy: </span>I check out the chest!</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> And the rest of you?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Gareth enters and looks at the skeleton.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve:</span> I keep watch on this side of the fireplace.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> I’m still back by the first door.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Amy, the chest seems expertly made, with elegant fittings and clawed feet.</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"footnote\">7</span></p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> I try to open it. Is it locked?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>It’s not locked and opens easily—and it releases a cloud of sweet-smelling gas.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy: </span>Oh, no.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>Oh, yes. I need Auro and Gareth to make Constitution saving throws.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy: </span>Sorry, Phillip! I got an 8.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip: </span>And a 5 for Gareth.</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> As you draw this gas into your lungs, you feel a chill grip you, and your bodies stiffen. You both have the Paralyzed condition!</p></section></section><section class=\"social-callouts\"><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Everyone Is Accounted For.</strong> Exploration is open-ended; the players don’t take turns moving around the dungeon the way they do in combat. But the DM frequently checks in to make sure it’s clear where everyone is and what they’re doing.</p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Teamwork Matters.</strong> The player characters are working toward a common goal. They move together through the dungeon and cooperate to overcome its challenges. When the characters enter the room, they explore different parts of the room. When Auro finds a secret door behind the fireplace later in the example, they come together again to examine it, and Gareth figures out how to bypass the fire. It might seem like Russell’s character wasn’t doing much, but Shreeve was protecting the group by guarding the door.</p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Worth Rolling with or without Proficiency.</strong> You usually have a chance of success on an ability check even if you don’t have proficiency in a relevant skill. In the example, Phillip gets a 20 without proficiency. The d20 brings many surprises to the game—surprises that the DM then interprets. <span class=\"footnote\">3</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Finding Hidden Objects.</strong> Adventure environments are full of secrets: traps, concealed doors, loose floorboards, and hidden treasures. Characters often use Wisdom checks to find things—see the Search action in the rules glossary—but sometimes they stumble on them accidentally, as Auro did here. <span class=\"footnote\">4</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Casting Spells.</strong> Many characters have the ability to cast spells, which have a huge variety of effects. Some spells are mostly useful in combat, by dealing damage or imposing conditions. Other spells have utility in exploration. If you’re playing a spellcaster, look for a mix of combat-effective and utilitarian spells to help deal with varied challenges. <span class=\"footnote\">5</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Know Your Spells!</strong> Have your <em>Player’s Handbook</em> open to the description of a spell before you cast it. Don’t expect the DM to know how your spell works, and be ready to answer any questions about it.</p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Vision and Light.</strong> The DM determines what the adventurers can perceive, which means being aware of light sources—like the leaping flames in the fireplace and Shreeve’s glowing sword—as well as obscuring factors like smoke and fog. See “Vision and Light” earlier in this chapter for more information. <span class=\"footnote\">6</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Saving Throws.</strong> A saving throw is used to see whether a creature avoids or resists something. When the chest releases toxic gas, Phillip’s and Amy’s characters make Constitution saving throws. Constitution is one of the six abilities that measure creatures’ capabilities, and it has to do with health and stamina. When they fail their saves, the gas causes them to have the Paralyzed condition. See “Conditions” later in this chapter for more information. <span class=\"footnote\">7</span></p></aside></section></div>",

The following notes apply.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships can’t move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 100 pounds.</p><h2>Crew</h2><p>A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbServices00000.JournalEntryPage.6JpV8RWOi2AG8BdK]{hirelings} to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship, as shown in the table.</p><h2>Passengers</h2><p>The table lists the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.</p><h2>Damage Threshold</h2><p>If a vehicle has a &amp;Reference[damage threshold]{Damage Threshold}, it’s noted in the table.</p><h2>Ship Repair</h2><p>Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor.

Here’s a glimpse at what that looks like:</p><section class=\"social-example\"><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared (as Dungeon Master):</span> After your long journey, Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone—perhaps abandoned guard­houses—loom over the approach. Beyond them, you see a gaping chasm disappearing into deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, its chains creaking in the wind. Stone gargoyles stare down at you from the high walls, and a pale light spills into the courtyard from the open castle doors beyond.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (as Gareth):</span> I examine the gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues!</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve (as Mirabella):</span> I want to see how sturdy the drawbridge is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> All right, one at a time. Phillip, Gareth’s looking at the gargoyles?</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not just decorations?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Make an Intelligence check.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Does my Investigation skill apply?</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Sure!</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (rolling a d20):</span> Ugh.

    "original": "<p>The three main pillars of D&amp;D play are social interaction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one you’re experiencing, the game unfolds according to this basic pattern:</p><ol><li><strong>The Dungeon Master Describes a Scene.</strong> The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what’s on a table, and so on).</li><li><strong>The Players Describe What Their Characters Do.</strong> Typically, the characters stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the DM ensures that every character has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take turns.</li><li><strong>The DM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers’ Actions.</strong> Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to open a door, the DM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1.</li></ol><p>This pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&amp;D), whether the adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations—particularly combat—the action is more structured, and everyone takes turns.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Exceptions Supersede General Rules</h3><p>General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn’t explicitly say otherwise.</p><p>The game also includes elements—class features, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.</p></aside>",

In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, such as an underground dungeon, a wondrous wilderness, or a magic-filled city.

A short adventure might present only a few challenges and take only one session to complete. A long adventure might involve many combats, interactions, and other challenges and take dozens of sessions.</p><h2>Campaigns</h2><p>A campaign is a series of adventures with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative.</p><p>Some campaigns are episodic, where each adventure is its own tale and not much besides the player characters links it to the next one. Other campaigns involve long-running plots, a cast of recurring NPCs, and themes that span multiple adventures, leading toward a climactic conclusion.</p><p>As with adventures, a DM might create a campaign from scratch, assemble a campaign from published adventures, or mix homemade material with published material.

For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the cube that many games use). The illustration on this page shows what each die looks like.</p><p>When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, along with any numbers to add or subtract. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCh1ArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.HEU9IiUlNzn0ab4c cite=false]</p><h3>Percentile Dice</h3><p>The rules sometimes refer to a d100. While such dice exist, the common way to roll 1d100 uses a pair of ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9, known as percentile dice. One die—that you designate before rolling—gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 for the tens digit and a 1 for the ones digit, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.</p><p>Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p><h3>D3</h3><p>The same <em>d</em> notation appears in the expression “1d3,” even though it’s rare to find dice with only three sides. To simulate rolling 1d3, roll 1d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up).</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Rolling Dice in Foundry Virtual Tabletop</h3><p>You can use the dice notation described above to create inline rolls which can be clicked to roll right away no matter how many sides it has. For example, 1d3 can be represented as an inline roll like so [[/r 1d3]] that can be clicked and rolled automatically. You can learn more about how dice work in Foundry in our <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice/\">Dice article</a>.</p></article></section><h2>What Are Dice For?</h2><aside class=\"notable three right\"><h3>Interpreting Die Rolls in the Story</h3><p>Part of the fun of D&amp;D is interpreting what die rolls mean in the story. The randomness that dice bring often introduces the unexpected: an expert fails, a novice succeeds, or any number of other twists. When a D20 Test or another roll produces a surprise, the Dungeon Master often gives a fun description of what happened. If you’re a player, look for opportunities to interpret your character’s die rolls and describe why things unfolded unexpectedly or even humorously.</p></aside><p>Here are the most common uses of dice in D&amp;D.</p><h3>D20 Test</h3><p>The 20-sided die (d20) is the most important die you’ll use in the game. It’s central to the core mechanic—called &amp;Reference[d20test]{D20 Tests}—the game uses to determine whether creatures succeed or fail at the things they attempt during the game (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbD20Tests00000]{D20 Tests}). You roll a d20 whenever your character tries to do something that the DM decides has a chance of both success and failure. The higher your roll, the more likely it is that you succeed.</p><h3>Damage</h3><p>The most common use for dice other than the d20 is to determine damage. When you make a successful attack roll (one kind of D20 Test), you roll damage to see how effective the attack is. When you cast a spell, you might also roll damage. Different weapons and spells use different dice for damage. For example, a Dagger uses 1d4, a Greataxe uses 1d12, and a <em>Fireball</em> spell uses 8d6.</p><h3>Random Tables</h3><p>Occasionally, you’ll see a table that uses a die roll to generate a random result. On these tables, you’ll see a die expression, such as d10 or d100, in the header of the leftmost column. Roll that die, and find the number you rolled (or a range containing that number) in that column. Read across that row for the result. For example, the Trinkets table in chapter 2 uses a d100.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Roll Tables</h3><p>Random tables in Foundry are implemented as <a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/roll-tables/\">Roll Tables</a> which can be rolled directly and the result will be sent to the chat. You can check out the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.tables.RollTable.phbStartingTrink]{Trinkets} roll table as an example.</p><p>When a roll table is embedded directly in a journal entry you can click on the die icon in the top-left to roll it.</p></article></section><h3>Percentage Chances</h3><p>Sometimes you might see a rule describing a percentage chance of something happening. For example, a rule might say there is a 5 percent chance of something happening. You can determine whether that thing happens by rolling percentile dice; if the roll is equal to or less than the percentage chance (a 01 to 05, in this example), it happens.</p>",

You and your group determine how similar scenes play out in your adventures.</p><div class=\"space-between top\"><section class=\"social-example\"><p><em>Four adventurers—Shreeve, Mirabella, Auro, and Gareth—have traveled to the Blood on the Vine tavern in the grim village of Barovia.</em></p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared (as DM):</span> This tavern might have been finely appointed once, but it has grown shoddy with the passage of years. A blazing fire in the hearth barely gives any warmth to the room. You see a man behind the counter, methodically cleaning glasses. Three older women huddle together at one table. And a handsome young man sits by himself at a corner table, sipping a glass of wine. He looks up as you enter, but the other people ignore you. “Welcome to Barovia,” he says. He holds a coin toward the bartender: “A pitcher for the visitors.” The glint of silver catches the server’s attention.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve (as Mirabella): </span>“Thank you, friend. May we know to whom we’re indebted?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>“I am Ismark Kolyanovich, though around here, I am often called Ismark the Lesser.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell (as Shreeve):</span> “That’s unfortunate.”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>“Indeed. I hope one day to live up to my father’s example and rid myself of that title. And so, my new friends, who are you?”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy (as Auro):</span> “I’m Auro.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “Shreeve.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip (as Gareth):</span> “My name is Gareth.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve (as Mirabella):</span> “I’m called Mirabella. You said your name was Kolyanovich. Are you related to Kolyan Indirovich, the burgomaster of this town?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> He looks a little surprised. He says, “Kolyan Indirovich is my esteemed father, yes.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve:</span> “Then he’s the one who summoned us!” I show him the letter that drew us here.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> I watch his reaction as he reads it.</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> He reaches for the letter but pulls back before touching it. “That seal—it’s not my father’s.” , make a Wisdom (Insight) check. <span class=\"footnote\">1</span></p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Gareth got 18.</p></section><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> You notice that Ismark is trying to conceal his terror. He’s afraid to even touch the letter’s seal.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip: </span>I ask him what’s frightening him.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “Yeah, whose seal is it?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “The Devil Strahd.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> “Sounds like a pleasant fellow.”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “No! He is the vampire lord of Castle Ravenloft and a plague to my sister. You must help her!”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> “So Strahd wrote this letter, pretending to be the burgomaster, imploring us to come to Barovia and rescue Ireena Kolyana from a deadly affliction … which is him? Why would he do that?”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell: </span>“Why would he want us to come here?”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve:</span> “Clearly, he doesn’t think we’re a threat.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Amy:</span> “Well, he hasn’t met us yet!”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “He’s toying with you. He delights in the destruction of all things good, like my dear sister.”</p><section class=\"highlighted\"><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip:</span> Gareth draws closer and compassionately asks Ismark whether his sister has been bitten by the vampire. <span class=\"footnote\">2</span></p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>Please make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to see how well he responds to your pastoral manner. You have Advantage because he’s Friendly.</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Phillip: </span>Oh, good thing. My first roll was a 7, but with Advantage … ugh, not much better. Well, 10 plus 5 is 15.</p></section><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> Ismark leans toward you, Gareth, with a suspicious glance at the other people in the tavern, like he’s worried they’re eavesdropping. He whispers, “The Devil Strahd desires to make Ireena his latest plaything. Twice he has visited her in the night, using his devilry to secure an invitation into the house—for he can’t enter where he isn’t invited. Twice he has bitten her, yet she clings to life. But I fear she won’t survive another visit!”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “All right, Ismark. You bought us drinks and told us about the Devil Strahd and your sister. How can we help?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “You are too kind! First, I need your help transporting Ireena to the town of Vallaki.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve:</span> “Where’s Vallaki?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “It lies to the northwest, in the heart of the valley. As the raven flies, it is less than ten miles, but the road winds among the hills and woods, and the journey takes at least five hours at speed.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “And why there?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “The town lies beyond the view of Castle Ravenloft, so I hope it’s beyond Strahd’s spies. And I have heard that Vallaki is well defended, with a wooden palisade and iron gates.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell:</span> “As if such defenses would stop a vampire.”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared: </span>“Indeed. But if moving her there can keep him away from her for even a few days, we have time for the second part of our task.”</p><p><span class=\"player-entry\">Russell: </span>“A part where you help us?”</p><p><span class=\"dm-entry\">Jared:</span> “Yes, when I help you face the vampire!”</p></section><section class=\"social-callouts\"><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Active Roleplaying.</strong> Notice throughout the example how Russell and Amy actively roleplay their characters’ behavior. In this active approach, they speak with their characters’ voices, like an actor taking on a role. The players might even echo their characters’ body language. They still need to describe things that can’t reasonably be acted out.</p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Descriptive Roleplaying.</strong> Notice how Phillip describes his character’s words and action. Drawing on his mental image of his character, he says what his character does and how the character does it. If this approach is most comfortable for you, keep these things in mind:</p><ul><li>Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.</li><li>Focus on your character’s intent and how others might perceive it.</li><li>Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.</li></ul></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Ability Checks.</strong> Phillip’s character, Gareth, makes a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether he reads Ismark’s unspoken cues. Wisdom is the ability that measures perceptiveness and intuition. Insight reflects a character’s skill at reading other people’s moods and intentions. The DM set the DC at 15, which Gareth beats. With a successful Wisdom (Insight) check, Gareth gleans information that wasn’t obvious, so it wasn’t part of the DM’s earlier narration. For more information, see “Ability Scores” and “Proficiency” earlier in this chapter and the Search action in the rules glossary. <span class=\"footnote\">1</span></p></aside><aside class=\"callout-border\"><p><strong>Influencing NPCs.</strong> Gareth takes the Influence action (see the rules glossary), which characters can take to influence an NPC. It’s easier to influence an NPC who’s already disposed to help you, as Ismark is here. Ismark’s Friendly attitude gives Phillip Advantage on the roll. In this case, Advantage made the difference between success and failure. <span class=\"footnote\">2</span></p></aside></section></div>",

这家酒馆可能曾经布置得很精致，但随着岁月的流逝已经变得破旧。壁炉里的火焰熊熊燃烧，但几乎无法给房间带来温暖。你看到一个男人站在柜台后面，有条不紊地清洗着杯子。三个老年妇女挤在一张桌子旁。一个英俊的年轻人独自坐在角落的桌子旁，抿着一杯葡萄酒。他抬头看着你们进来，但其他人都忽视了你们。“欢迎来到 巴洛维亚，”他说。他向酒保示意了一枚硬币：“给客人们来一壶酒。”银币的闪光引起了服务员的注意。</p>\\n        <p><span class=\"player-entry\">Maeve</span>（饰演 Mirabella）：“谢谢你，朋友。我们能知道欠了谁的情吗？”</p>\\n        <p><span

They lost this ability when Corellon cursed them for plotting with the deity Lolth, who tried and failed to usurp Corellon’s dominion. When Lolth was cast into the Abyss, most elves renounced her and earned Corellon’s forgiveness, but that which Corellon had taken from them was lost forever.</p><p>No longer able to shape-shift at will, the elves retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow was deepened by that plane’s influence. Over time, curiosity led many of them to explore other planes of existence, including worlds in the Material Plane.</p><p>Elves have pointed ears and lack facial and body hair. They live for around 750 years, and they don’t sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to rest. In that state, they remain aware of their surroundings while immersing themselves in memories and meditations.</p><p>An environment subtly transforms elves after they inhabit it for a millennium or more, and it grants them certain kinds of magic. Drow, high elves, and wood elves are examples of elves who have been transformed thus.</p><h3>Drow</h3><p>Drow typically dwell in the Underdark and have been shaped by it. Some drow individuals and societies avoid the Underdark altogether yet carry its magic. In the Eberron setting, for example, drow dwell in rainforests and cyclopean ruins on the continent of Xen’drik.</p><h3>High Elves</h3><p>High elves have been infused with the magic of crossings between the Feywild and the Material Plane. On some worlds, high elves refer to themselves by other names. For example, they call themselves sun or moon elves in the Forgotten Realms setting, Silvanesti and Qualinesti in the Dragonlance setting, and Aereni in the Eberron setting.</p><h3>Wood Elves</h3><p>Wood elves carry the magic of primeval forests within themselves. They are known by many other names, including wild elves, green elves, and forest elves. Grugach are reclusive wood elves of the Greyhawk setting, while the Kagonesti and the Tairnadal are wood elves of the Dragonlance and Eberron settings, respectively.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbCh4ArtHandout.JournalEntryPage.TtvnRE5XYEc7Udiq]</p><h2>Elf Traits</h2><p><strong>Creature Type: </strong>Humanoid</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>Medium (about 5–6 feet tall)</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</p><p>As an Elf, you have these special traits.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision. </strong></em>You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Elven Lineage. </strong></em>You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities.

The earliest gnomes were seldom seen by other folk due to the gnomes’ secretive nature and their propensity for living in forests and burrows. What they lacked in size, they made up for in cleverness. They confounded predators with traps and labyrinthine tunnels. They also learned magic from gods like Garl Glittergold, Baervan Wildwanderer, and Baravar Cloakshadow, who visited them in disguise. That magic eventually created the lineages of forest gnomes and rock gnomes.</p><p>Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes and pointed ears, who live around 425 years. Many gnomes like the feeling of a roof over their head, even if that “roof” is nothing more than a hat.</p><h2>Gnome Traits</h2><p><strong>Creature Type: </strong>Humanoid</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>Small (about 3–4 feet tall)</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</p><p>As a Gnome, you have these special traits.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision. </strong></em>You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Gnomish Cunning.</strong></em> You have Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.</p><p><em><strong>Gnomish Lineage.</strong></em> You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities.

In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting Prestidigitation to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from <em>Prestidigitation</em>; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell’s ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn’t do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a Utilize action.</p>",

Cantrips—simple spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.</p><h3>Spell Slots</h3><p>Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster’s magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.</p><p>When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that’s at least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplMagicMissi]{Magic Missile}, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining.</p><p>Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell slots.</p><h3>Casting without Slots</h3><p>There are several ways to cast a spell without a spell slot:</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.</p><p><strong>Rituals.</strong> Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.</p><p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.</p><p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.equipment.Item.phbagSpellScroll]{Spell Scrolls} and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.</p><h3>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</h3><p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplMagicMissi]{Magic Missile} using a level 2 slot, that Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p><p>Some spells, such as Magic Missile and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplCureWounds]{Cure Wounds}, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.</p>",

The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is gagged or in an area of magical silence can’t cast a spell with a Verbal component.</p><h3>Somatic (S)</h3><p>A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must use at least one of their hands to perform these movements.</p><h3>Material (M)</h3><p>A Material component is a particular material used in a spell’s casting, as specified in parentheses in the Components entry.

A spell’s description says whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or something else.</p><p><em><strong>A Clear Path to the Target.</strong></em> To target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind Total Cover.</p><p><em><strong>Targeting Yourself.</strong></em> If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature other than you.</p><p><em><strong>Areas of Effect.</strong></em> Some spells, such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplThunderwav]{Thunderwave}, cover an area called an area of effect, which is defined in the rules glossary. The area determines what the spell targets. The description of a spell specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Emanation, Line, or Sphere.</p><p><em><strong>Awareness of Being Targeted.</strong></em> Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature doesn’t know it was targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell’s says otherwise.</p><p><em><strong>Invalid Targets.</strong></em> If you cast a spell on someone or something that can’t be affected by it, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended.</p><p>If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn’t attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>Many spells specify that a target makes a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

Here’s how to calculate the attack modifier for your spells:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your spellcasting ability + your Proficiency Bonus</p><h3>Combining Spell Effects</h3><p>The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplBless00000]{Bless} on the same target, that target gains the spell’s benefit only once; the target doesn’t receive two bonus dice.

There’d never been anything like it: a game in which each player made their own fantasy character and teamed up with their friends to go on quests. One person served as the narrator and referee—the Dungeon Master—and did everything they could to challenge and delight the other players. That game was, of course, the fi rst version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and you’re now reading its latest version.</p><p>Over the decades, millions of people have played D&amp;D, and scores of writers, game designers, and artists have made their mark on it through its various editions. When our team released the current edition in 2014, we were humbled by how many of you loved it. This revised ver- sion of it is a salute to all of you—those of you who’ve been playing D&amp;D for years, those of you who’ve contributed to the game through your feedback, and those of you who are about to experience the joy of playing it for the first time.</p><p>As a teenager, I met both Gary and Dave. I even spent an entire day with Gary, and we did what all D&amp;D fans do: share stories about our adventures in the D&amp;D multiverse. I invite you to embark on such adventures anew. Share as much laughter as you can with your friends. Use only the rules that serve your fun, and always follow your group’s bliss. So many people have been enjoying the magic of D&amp;D for half a century. Let’s keep it blazing for another 50 years!</p><p><cite>Jeremy Crawford</cite></p></blockquote>",

Together you and friends create an exciting story of adventurers who confront perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a tragic end.

    "original": "<p>Here’s what you need to play D&amp;D with one or more friends (a typical group has five people):</p><p><strong>Dungeon Master.</strong> One person takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the players’ characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM also narrates what they experience and plays the friends and foes they meet along the way. Even though the DM challenges the adventurers, the DM always strives to delight the whole group.</p><p><strong>Players.</strong> Each player creates an adventurer who teams up with the other players’ adventurers. Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple, a lava-filled mountain, or another location described by the DM. The adventurers also solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover magic items and other treasure—all while supporting each other's fun.</p><p>You also need these resources, either in physical form or on DnDBeyond.com:</p><p><em><strong>Player's Handbook.</strong></em> This book is your essential reference for the game's rules, and it guides you through making an adventurer of your own.</p><p><em><strong>Dungeon Master's</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Monster Manual</strong></em><strong>.</strong> The first of these books guides the DM through creating and running adventures, and the second holds hundreds of monsters to fill those adventures.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Learn by Watching</h3><p>A great way to learn the basics of D&amp;D is to watch people play it. The Internet offers videos of D&amp;D play that show off the tremendous range of possibilities the game offers. As you watch, pay attention to the ways that some players help make the game fun for everyone in their group. The only audience you need to entertain when you're playing D&amp;D is yourself and your group.</p></aside><p><strong>Dice.</strong> You need a set of polyhedral dice (shown in chapter 1). You can find dice like these in game stores and from online retailers. Dice-rolling apps are also available.</p><p><strong>Character Sheet.</strong> To keep track of important information about your character, you need a character sheet, which can be as simple as a piece of paper you write notes on or as feature-rich as a digital record.</p><p>The DM might also find these accessories useful:</p><p><strong>DM Screen.</strong> Many DMs like to use a screen to shield their notes and dice rolls from players. It's bad manners to peek over the screen!</p><p>Miniatures and Battle Grid. Some DMs use a battle grid and miniatures to run combat encounters, since they help everyone visualize the action. A battle grid can be anything marked out in 1-inch squares, from disposable sheets of paper to poster maps. And miniatures range from simple tokens to detailed figurines. Online maps and miniatures are also available, including on DnDBeyond.com.</p>",

If you’ve read the 2014 version, much of this book will feel familiar, since the fundamental rules of the game are the same. But the book contains many new or redesigned elements, and the versions of things in this book replace versions from older books. Here are highlights:</p><p><strong>Streamlined Rules.</strong> The game’s rules have been streamlined and are now supported by a rules glossary.</p><p><strong>Easier Character Creation.</strong> Using chapter 2, making a character is easier than ever before.</p><p><strong>Enhanced Classes.</strong> In chapter 3, every class and subclass has been enhanced with new options. Reimagined Origins. Explored in chapter 4, a character’s origin is now defined by background and species, each of which has been redesigned.</p><p><strong>Expanded Feats.</strong> In chapter 5, feats have been redesigned, with many feats added.</p><p><strong>Upgraded Weapons, Tools, and Crafting.</strong> Mastery properties transform how weapon wielders use their weapons, and every character can enjoy new tool and crafting rules in chapter 6.</p><p><strong>Dazzling Spells.</strong> Chapter 7 bursts with new spells and old ones that have been enhanced.</p><p>If you can’t find a rule, check the index. If a rule’s name has changed from what was printed in the 2014 Player’s Handbook, the index points you to the new name. For example, if you look up Inspiration in the index, it points you to the rules for Heroic Inspiration in the rules glossary.</p></aside>",

They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p><p>Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.</p><p>The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p><p>But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p><h2>Becoming a Wizard …</h2><h3>As a Level 1 Character</h3><ul><li><p>Gain all the traits in the Core Wizard Traits table.</p></li><li><p>Gain the Wizard’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Wizard Features table.</p></li></ul><h3>As a Multiclass Character</h3><ul><li><p>Gain the Hit Point Die from the Core Wizard Traits table.</p></li><li><p>Gain the Wizard’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Wizard Features table.

You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.</p><p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong> When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.</p><p><strong>Copying the Book.</strong> You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.</p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.</p></aside>",
