The creature must make a <strong>DC 17 Strength saving throw</strong>. On a failure, the creature is knocked <span id=\"was-tagged\">prone</span>, and is disarmed of the weapon with which it made the attack, or of its spellcasting focus or component if it was a melee spell attack. The item flies <strong>15 feet</strong> away in a random direction (roll a [[/r d8]] to determine the direction where a 1 = North, 2 = Northeast, etc.)</p><p><em><strong>Starfield Bulwark.</strong></em> As an action, you can twist the handle of the shield, expending <strong>3 charges</strong> and causing it to deploy in a <strong>5-foot-high</strong> barrier of force energy up to <strong>25 feet long</strong>. Nothing can physically pass through the wall; a creature that attempts to run through or climb over the barrier takes <strong>[[/r 2d6]]</strong> force damage and must succeed on a <strong>DC 17 Strength saving throw</strong> or be knocked <span id=\"was-tagged\"><strong>prone</strong></span>. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is also <span id=\"was-tagged\"><strong>paralysed</strong></span> until the start of its next turn.</p><p>Creatures directly behind the barrier have three-quarters cover against attacks that originate from the other side of the barrier. Any attack that misses a creature directly behind the barrier automatically hits the barrier, which has 100 hit points. The barrier remains in place until <strong>1 minute</strong> elapses, a creature uses its bonus action to pick up the barrier on the side from which it was deployed, it is hit by the <span id=\"was-tagged\">@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.HBHbOGKNVVprSlwn]{Disintegrate} </span>spell, or it loses all its hit points.</p>"

A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><i><b>Range.</b></i> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><i><b>Thrown.</b></i> If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p>"
