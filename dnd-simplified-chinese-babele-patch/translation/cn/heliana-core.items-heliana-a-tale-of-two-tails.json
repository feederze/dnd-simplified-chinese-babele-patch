Instead of the normal attack against a single target, make separate attack rolls against two creatures within <strong>5 feet</strong> of each other. On a hit, a creature takes piercing damage equal to <strong>2d4</strong> (plus any modifiers normally added).</p><p><strong>Reload (3).</strong> After you make three attacks with this weapon, you must reload it using an action.</p><p><em><strong>Range.</strong></em> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon.
