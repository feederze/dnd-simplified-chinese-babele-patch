Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, a god of creation, he first crafted four mighty tools: the <span class=\"no-break\">Starmetal</span> Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With these tools, he forged the <em>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</em>.</p><p>Armed with the Artifact, the prince brought peace to the dwarf clans, ending grudges and answering slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.</p><p>Later, in an era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Magic Weapon.</strong> The <em>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</em> is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p><p>When you attack a creature with the axe and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the axe deals an extra 20 Slashing damage.</p><p>The axe has the Thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is a creature of the <span class=\"no-break\">Giant</span> type.

Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 Radiant damage.</p><p><em><strong>Fire Opal Flames.</strong></em> As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames.

It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p><p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it.</p><p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.</p><p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p><p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p><p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate.</p><p>In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.</p><p>Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a <em>Bag of Holding</em>, <em>Portable Hole</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.

In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such weapon. Over the centuries, some of these weapons have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Others have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</p></blockquote><p>Every <em>Moonblade</em> longs for a bearer whose disposition and goals are compatible with its own. If you try to attune to a <em>Moonblade</em> that doesn’t want you as its bearer, the weapon not only rejects you but also places a curse on you, causing you to make D20 Tests with Disadvantage for 24 hours or until the curse is ended by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplRemoveCurs]{Remove Curse}</em> spell or similar magic. If you’re accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune appears on it. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A <em>Moonblade</em> functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen bearer.</p><p>A <em>Moonblade</em> has one rune on it for each bearer it has willingly served (typically [[/r 1d6 + 1]]). The @UUID[.ActiveEffect.o2IcKz2aAooQr7EK]{first rune} grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <em>Moonblade</em> an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly by rolling on the Moonblade Properties table.</p><details><summary><strong>Minor Property.</strong></summary><p>In addition to its aforementioned properties, each <em>Moonblade</em> has a minor property determined by rolling on the Magic Item’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.tables.RollTable.dmgMagicItemsMin]{Minor Property} table.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Sentience.</strong></summary><p>A <em>Moonblade</em> is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet. Its alignment matches that of its creator.</p><p>The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder’s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate through visions or dreams when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Personality.</strong></summary><p>A <em>Moonblade</em> has a personality similar to that of its creator.

    "original": "<p><em>Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)</em></p><p>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p><p>Buttons. You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form:</p><details><summary>Button Effects</summary><p><strong>Button 1.</strong> A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head. The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.</p><p><strong>Button 2.</strong> The rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p><p><strong>Button 3.</strong> The rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p><p><strong>Button 4.</strong> The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p><p><strong>Button 5.</strong> The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p><p><strong>Button 6.</strong> The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.</p></details><p><strong>Drain Life.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><strong>Paralyze.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the &amp;Reference[Paralyzed apply=false] condition for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><strong>Terrify.</strong> While holding the rod, you can take a Magic action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the &amp;Reference[Frightened apply=false] condition for 1 minute. A Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-o1BCgF1HX5lyWN4U\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>An activity has been added for each usable button that implements the attack with the relevant bonuses.</p><p>The properties are also implemented as activities and track their own uses per dawn.</p></section>",
