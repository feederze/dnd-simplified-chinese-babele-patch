So long as your groups can be arranged in a logical order (like the gems being arranged alphabetically in this puzzle), all you must do is adjust the number of items to correspond to a particular letter of the alphabet. Alternatively, perhaps another organizing principle orders your groups. For example, tombstones that feature varying numbers of skulls might be arranged by dates, while stacks of books might be ordered by shared page-counts. These details can be easy to miss, though, so make sure you present a riddle or other signpost to make sure your players notice there’s a puzzle at hand.</p><h2>Lowering the Difficulty</h2><p>To make the puzzle easier to solve, a spirit can provide a hint in addition to giving its name. Coaxing a hint from a spirit requires a successful [[/check skill=per dc=15]] or [[/check skill=itm dc=15]] check. Consider hints like “A is the first letter in the alphabet” and “The gemstones, in order, will help for a spell.”</p><h2>Releasing the Spirits</h2><p>If the characters don’t attempt to remove gems from the room, or if they spend too long deliberating, create a new trigger to release the spirits. For example, perhaps a spirit is released if a character places a gem near the statue or if it’s held for too long.</p>"

Making and sticking to these rules can help ensure that the game is a fun experience for everyone involved.</p><p>Often a session zero includes building characters together.

          "text": "<p>Each player has options when it comes to choosing a character race, class, and background, though you may restrict certain options that are deemed unsuitable for the campaign. If there are multiple players in the group, you should encourage them to choose different classes so that the adventuring party has a range of abilities. It’s less important that the party include multiple backgrounds, as sometimes it’s fun to play an all-soldier party or a troupe of adventuring entertainers. The backgrounds they choose define who their characters were before becoming adventurers and also include roleplaying hooks in the form of ideals, bonds, and flaws—things you ought to know. For example, if a player chooses the criminal background, one of the options for the character’s bond is, “I’m trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.” If that’s the character’s bond, you should work with the player to decide who that generous benefactor is and build relevant story lines into the larger campaign.</p><h2>Party Formation</h2><p>During session zero, your role is to let the players build the characters they want and to help them come up with explanations for how their characters came together to form an adventuring party. It can be helpful to assume that the characters know each other and have some sort of history together, however brief that history might be. Here are some questions you can ask the players as they create characters to get a sense of the party’s relationships:</p><ul><li>Are any of the characters related to each other?</li><li>What keeps the characters together as a party?</li><li>What does each character like most about every other member of the adventuring party?</li><li>Does the group have a patron? See @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-content.JournalEntry.tcoeGroupPatrons]{Group Patrons} for patron examples.</li></ul><p>If the players are having trouble coming up with a story for how their characters met, they may choose an option from the Party Origin table or let a d6 roll choose it for them. You should spend part of session zero helping the players flesh out the details. For example, if the characters came together to overcome a common foe, the identity of this enemy needs to be determined. If a funeral gathered the group, the identity of the deceased and each character’s relationship to them will need to be fleshed out.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-tables.RollTable.tcoePartyOrigin0]</p><h2>Running a Game for One Player</h2><p>A DM running a game for one player should spend part of session zero working with that player to come up with their character’s backstory, then let the player decide if they want the character to have a sidekick (see the “<a>Sidekicks</a>” section in this chapter).</p><p>You might need to help the player run the sidekick for the first few sessions and should make sure the player understands the functions and limitations of sidekicks:</p><ul><li>Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, including things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.</li><li>Ideally, a sidekick’s abilities should complement those of the main character.

          "text": "<p>D&amp;D is first and foremost meant to be a fun-for-all experience. If one or more participants aren’t having fun, the game won’t last long. Session zero is the perfect time for you and the players to discuss the experience they’re hoping for, as well as topics, themes, and behavior they deem inappropriate. Out of this discussion, a social contract begins to form.</p><p>Sometimes a social contract takes shape organically, but it’s good practice to have a direct conversation during session zero to establish boundaries and expectations. A typical social contract in a D&amp;D group includes implicit or explicit commitments to the following points:</p><ul><li>You will respect the players by running a game that is fun, fair, and tailored for them. You will allow every player to contribute to the ongoing story and give every character moments to shine. When a player is talking, you are listening.</li><li>The players will respect you and the effort it takes to create a fun game for everyone. The players will allow you to direct the campaign, arbitrate the rules, and settle arguments. When you are talking, the players are listening.</li><li>The players will respect one another, listen to one another, support one another, and do their utmost to preserve the cohesion of the adventuring party.</li><li>Should you or a player disrespect each other or violate the social contract in some other way, the group may dismiss that person from the table.</li></ul><p>This social contract covers the basics, but individual groups might require additional agreed-upon terms to guarantee a fun play experience for all. And a social contract typically evolves as a group’s members learn more about one another.</p><h2>Hard and Soft Limits</h2><p>Once you and the players have acknowledged the terms of the game’s social contract and agreed to uphold them, the conversation can segue into a discussion about soft and hard limits. There are many ways to mediate this discussion, and you might want to do some research to find an approach that might work well for your group. For purposes of this explanation, these terms are described as follows:</p><p>A <strong>soft limit</strong> is a threshold that one should think twice about crossing, as it is likely to create genuine anxiety, fear, and discomfort.</p><p>A <strong>hard limit</strong> is a threshold that should never be crossed.</p><p>Every member of the group has soft and hard limits, and it behooves everyone in the group to know what they are. Make sure everyone at the table is comfortable with how this discussion takes place. Players might not want to discuss their limits aloud around the table, especially if they’re new to roleplaying games or haven’t spent a lot of time with certain other members of the group. One way to alleviate such discomfort is to encourage the players to share their limits privately with you and allow you to present them without attribution to the whole group. For example, the players could write their limits on index cards for you to read aloud. However these limits are presented, it would be useful for you or one of the players to compile the limits into one list that can be shared with the whole group. Keep in mind that any discussion about limits should be treated with care—even sharing a person’s limits can be a very painful experience, and this conversation should be handled with respect.</p><p>Common in-game limits include—but are not limited to—themes or scenes of sex, exploitation, racial profiling, slavery, violence toward children and animals, gratuitous swearing, and intra-party romance. Common out-of-game limits include unwanted physical contact, dice-sharing, dice-throwing, shouting, vulgarity, rules lawyering, distracting use of cell phones, and generally disrespectful behavior.</p><p>The discussion of limits is important because DMs and players can have phobias or triggers that others might not be aware of. Any in-game topic or theme that makes a member of the gaming group feel unsafe or uncomfortable should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporating it should be handled with care, and you must be ready to veer away from such topics and themes quickly.</p><p>While session zero is the perfect place to start this discussion, it might not be the only time limits are addressed. Someone might cross a line and need to be reminded of a limit, or someone might not think to include some of their limits in the initial discussion. Players can also discover new limits as the campaign unfolds. Make a plan to check in with the group to make sure the list of hard and soft limits is up to date, and remind everyone to revisit this list often in case it changes.</p>"

If you plan to use any house rules, session zero is a good time to discuss those rules with the players and solicit their input.</p><p>House rules are best presented as experiments, and time will tell if they’re good for your game. If you introduce a house rule in session zero that turns out to have an adverse effect on people’s enjoyment of the game, you may jettison or revise the house rule to create a better gaming experience for everyone. Don’t feel bad if a house rule doesn’t end up working as well as you expected it to. Remember: the goal is to ensure everyone is having fun.</p>"

A verse scratched into the back wall of each alcove is made visible by the candlelight. Each verse is presented below, accompanied by a parenthetical explanation that shouldn’t be shared with the players or their characters:</p><p><strong>Verse 1.</strong> “Not his keeper, nor he mine; loved and hated at the same time.” (This refers to Dolora’s brother, whose name was Sam.)</p><p><strong>Verse 2.</strong> “My first vision: her hazel eyes. My first sound: her lullabies.” (This refers to Dolora’s mother, whose name was Delia.)</p><p><strong>Verse 3.</strong> “Her lives she lost, all three by three, and through the dark this hunter sees.” (This refers to Dolora’s cat, whose name was Fifi.)</p><p><strong>Verse 4.</strong> “Lines in his face of life lived long; stories were his paternal song.” (This refers to Dolora’s grandfather, whose name was Tobias.)</p><p><strong>Verse 5.</strong> “Mentor and guide, her lessons learned. Knowledge measured by letters I earned.” (This refers to Dolora’s teacher, whose name was Johana.)</p><p><strong>Verse 6.</strong> “Loved to eat hay, just as her friends did; lived in one room with a shoat and a kid.” (This refers to Dolora’s horse, whose name was Alexia.)</p><p>Each verse describes someone who was close to Dolora. Once the characters determine who a verse is talking about, they may ask Dolora to provide the correct name. For example, “What is your cat’s name?” is a valid question for verse 3.

Three deadbolts secure the door, which is also barred from the inside, so there are no locks that can be picked from the outside.</p><h2>Guard</h2><p>A guard stands on the other side of the door around the clock, and the only way to speak with the guard is through the door’s slide window. The guard can be any sort of talking creature, such as an assassin, a cult fanatic, or a thug. More monstrous options include a bugbear, wereboar, or nycaloth.</p><p>If a character knocks on the door, the guard slides open the window and gruffly gives a number, expecting the proper response. The guard gives a different number each time someone knocks. Any proper response grants a single character entry, and the guard only allows one member to enter at a time.</p><p>Characters who provide incorrect answers and attempt to enter again must disguise themselves in some way or be refused entry. The guard only willingly opens the door for someone who speaks the correct password. The guard raises the alarm if unauthorized people try to open or bypass the door, calling six more guards to help defend the entrance.</p><h2>Members</h2><p>If the characters continue watching the door, they see up to four more visitors approach it. To eavesdrop on each exchange, the characters must succeed on a [[/check skill=stealth dc=12]] group check to remain hidden; if the group check fails, the visitor notices they’re being observed and speaks quietly enough that their answer can’t be overheard.</p><p><strong>Second Visitor.</strong> The guard opens the window and says, “Twelve.” The visitor responds with “Six” and is allowed inside.</p><p><strong>Third Visitor.</strong> The guard opens the window and says, “Ten.” The visitor responds with “Five” and is turned away.</p><p><strong>Fourth Visitor.</strong> The guard opens the window and says, “Seven.” The visitor responds with “Five” and is allowed inside.</p><p><strong>Fifth Visitor.</strong> The guard opens the window and says, “Zero.” The visitor responds with “One” and is turned away.</p>"

That creature must also make a [[/save constitution dc=15]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 2d10 type=force average=true]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Divination.</strong> The creature that triggered the trap must succeed on a [[/save intelligence dc=15]] saving throw or be unable to perceive any of the letters on the tiles by sight or touch. Any magic that ends a curse ends this effect on the character. A player whose character is affected by this trap should not be allowed to reference the accompanying player handout until the effect on that character ends.</p><p><strong>Enchantment.</strong> The trap casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4]{suggestion} ([[/save wisdom dc=15]]) on the creature that triggered it. On a failed save, a gentle voice only the creature can hear tells it to move 5 feet in a random direction. This movement might cause it to trigger another trap.</p><p><strong>Evocation.</strong> Magical fire erupts from the trapped tile. The creature that triggered this trap must succeed on a [[/save dexterity dc=15]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 2d10 type=fire]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Illusion.</strong> A suit of @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-actors.Actor.eORmAXuV5v3nWsQL]{Animated Armor} appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature that set off this trap. The armor attacks only the creature that summoned it and can’t leave the room. It doesn’t set off any of the room’s traps and disappears if it takes any damage. Otherwise, it lasts for 1 minute.</p><p><strong>Necromancy.</strong> Any creature that triggers this trap hears a banshee’s wail in its mind. Unless the creature is a construct or undead, it must make a [[/save constitution dc=13]] saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, it takes [[/damage 3d6 type=psychic]] damage.</p><p><strong>Transmutation.</strong> The trap casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.04nMsTWkIFvkbXlY]{polymorph} ([[/save wisdom dc=15]]) on the creature that triggered it.

To determine the amount of the increase, roll the Hit Die (the type of die appears in the sidekick’s stat block), and add its Constitution modifier. It gains a minimum of 1 hit point per level.</p><p>If the sidekick drops to 0 hit points and isn’t killed outright, it falls &amp;Reference[unconscious] and subsequently makes death saving throws, just like a player character.</p><h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2><p>The sidekick’s proficiency bonus is determined by its level in its class, as shown in the class’s table.</p><p>Whenever the sidekick’s proficiency bonus increases by 1, add 1 to the to-hit modifier of all the attacks in its stat block, and increase the DCs in its stat block by 1.</p><h2>Ability Score Increases</h2><p>Whenever the sidekick gains the Ability Score Improvement feature, adjust anything in its stat block that relies on an ability modifier that you increase.
