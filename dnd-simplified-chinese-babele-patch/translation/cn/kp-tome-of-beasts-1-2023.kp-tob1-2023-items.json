A creature that can see through illusions sees the hat as a golden, bejeweled coronet. </p><p>While wearing this hat, you can use an action to speak its command word to become invisible and gain a flying speed of 40 feet for up to 1 minute. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you.</p><p>You remain invisible and capable of flying until you repeat the command word as an action or until you attack or cast a spell. </p><p>Once used, the hat can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>",
