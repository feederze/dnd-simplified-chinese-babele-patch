      "description": "<blockquote><p>“Don’t. Break. The. Coral. No souvenirs, no trinkets, no keepsakes. That’s someone’s grandparent.”</p><p>Jack Kusto, Oceanographer</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Cnidaran.webp\" height=\"600\"><p>From nomadic, floating cities whose coral exoskeletons stretch down into the dark ocean depths to mile-long reefs and small atolls, cnidaran (NI-da-ran) settlements can be found wherever salt meets water. Their unique, bipartite lifecycle sets them apart from most other humanoids and fosters a zealous loyalty between cnidaran and home.</p><h3>Disperse and Deploy</h3><p>Cnidarans have two distinct phases to their lifecycle: the medusozoa and the polyp. An adventuring cnidaran—one that can speak, has a vaguely humanoid shape, and can manipulate tools—is a medusozoa. These individuals are responsible for interacting with the outside world (in other words, anything beyond their home reef).</p><p>When medusozoa mate, an event that can involve dozens of individuals, the thousands of larvae that are conceived settle on the nearest substrate, often the cnidarans’ own coral home. Once rooted, the larvae develop into polyps with two tasks. The first is to grow a single new medusozoa over a single moon’s cycle and then birth this inch-long, instinct-driven youngster into the waters surrounding its home. The second is to secrete a calcareous exoskeleton, fusing their body with the reef and growing the cnidarans’ coral home.</p><p>Life for a young medusozoa is tenuous; it must fend for itself, drifting in open waters and feeding on plankton and other medusozoa until it reaches at least a foot in length, usually by the end of its third year. During this juvenile stage, a time known as the uko’ulush (the ‘wild time’), a medusozoa is largely ignored by other cnidarans, who believe that “trial by ocean makes the hardest pearls.” Once a cnidaran completes this juvenile stage, it is brought into the reef, a utilitarian and communal space where the customs, culture, and values of that reef are passed on, the uko’malang (the ‘time of waiting’).</p><h3>Commune and Community</h3><p>Cnidarans live communally. With the practices of mass mating and random dispersal, no single medusozoa knows which individuals are their parents. In fact, the entire concept of ‘parentage’, ‘hereditary titles’, and ‘inheritance’ is foreign to most cnidarans.</p><p>When a cnidaran medusozoa reaches maturity, it is given the choice to leave the reef with the blessing of the whole community, a once-in-a-lifetime event known as the uko’fa (the ‘time of exploration’). Individuals that start on the uko’fa do so for a multitude of reasons. Some seek to bring back treasures from the world beyond and enhance their own community. Others feel a need to disperse, finding other reefs to join or even forming new reefs with like-minded medusozoa met on their travels. A very few become enraptured by wanderlust and spend the rest of their days among winding ocean currents, delving into damp dungeons, and cavorting in ports with other seadogs.</p><h3>No Place Like Home</h3><p>Cnidaran settlements are alive. Made of the bodies of millions of calcified polyps—cnidaran ancestors—a reef is more than just a home; it is the collective memory of a thousand generations, a traceable web of genealogical history, and an esteemed and holy sanctuary. Intentionally damaging a reef carries grave consequences: death, exile, or declarations of war are all sanctions a cnidaran colony might employ. It isn’t unusual for trade unions to pay handsome reparations if a ship damages a cnidaran reef when blown off course by wild winds. To do otherwise might result in ships foundering even in fair and pleasant conditions, such is the whim of an enraged cnidaran reef.</p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Cnidaran Traits</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">As a cnidaran, you have the following racial traits.</span></p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> A cnidaran medusozoa reaches maturity at around 20 years of age and can live up to 200 years.</p><p class=\"p1\">Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> A cnidaran stands between 5 and 7 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> </span>Your base walking speed is <span class=\"s1\"><strong>30 feet</strong> </span>and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Amphibious</strong></em>. You can breathe air and water.</p><p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Subrace.</strong></em> When a polyp produces a medusozoa, it can birth one of two morphs: a nematocyst or a shimmerskin. The former is adapted for confrontation, combat, and conflict; and carries with it an innately toxic weapon. The latter relies on diplomacy, subterfuge, and enchantment to charm antagonists and avoid conflict. Together, these two morphs are capable of pursuing two very different strategies in interspecies interactions. Choose one of these subraces.</p><h3><strong>Nematocyst</strong></h3><p>Named after their whip-like appendage which can secrete a potent neurotoxin, such individuals form the warriors of a cnidaran reef.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Dexterity and Constitution scores both increase by 1.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.VOhgdpM8MHfLDqG9]{Nematocyst.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.VOhgdpM8MHfLDqG9 cite=false caption=false]{Nematocyst}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.xMudQQ09MXgGVk7f]{Neurotoxin.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.xMudQQ09MXgGVk7f cite=false caption=false]{Neurotoxin}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.jpnEGbnZvQu0FDCE]{Toxic Adaptation.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.jpnEGbnZvQu0FDCE cite=false caption=false]{Toxic Adaptation}</p>",

It don’t get shadier than this.”</p><p>Plens Donsu’us, Barista, Wizards of the Roast</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Ombrask.webp\"><p>Those who wander the Shadow Plane are doomed to twisted fates and mired minds. These fading, lost souls begin to manifest monstrous forms, although some especially resilient individuals manage to pull themselves from this dark path before their essence is wiped clean. Known as ombrasks (OM-brask), these translucent creatures hail from a variety of heritages; from elf to dwarf, dragonborn to lotol, and rakin to goblin. All struggle to recall even the simplest memory, such as their former name, and all have a ghostly, colourless appearance.</p><h3>Shadow Memories</h3><p>One of the first things an ombrask forgets is its voice. Though it knows and can understand the meaning of words, its cadence, pitch, and patterns of speech fade from lack of use; the dreary, joyless experience of the Shadow Plane leaves little to talk about. However, ombrasks become especially sensitive to the psychic burst of emotion that accompanies death, the freeing of a soul from its shadow-numbed body. Ombrasks can latch onto the shreds of this psyche and adopt its speech patterns, learning to mimic them perfectly.</p><p>Next lost is the ability to feel, love, and smile; any emotion associated with joy or excitement is nullified. With prolonged distance from the Shadow Plane, or exposure to realms of strong emotion, such as the Plane of Fey or Springarden, these sensations can make a slow return for a lucky few. What is never lost is the memory of mundane tasks, such as ploughing, chopping wood, or polishing armour. Muscle memory is scarred into the minds of ombrasks, making them particularly deft at tiny, detailed work.</p><h3>Almost Unseen</h3><p>If an ombrask doesn’t find a way to exit the Shadow Plane or isn’t summoned by some novice wizard, it can fade entirely, becoming an invisible, skulking creature bent only on survival. In fact, there is strong evidence to suggest that the creature summoned by the unseen servant spell is one of these invisible creatures, temporarily pulled from the Shadow Plane. The fate of those too far gone is enough to stop most explorers from staying long in that dull and lifeless expanse.</p><h3>Momento</h3><p>A sense of adventure, a magical mishap, or a cruel curse, there are a multitude of reasons why a native of the Material Plane might find itself shunned to the Shadow Plane. Discovering who they used to be is a motivator for many ombrasks. Do they have parents? Cultural traditions? What is their history? On the other hand, some ombrasks, perhaps those with a foreboding sense of their past misdeeds, choose to ignore what might have come before and focus on living life anew. That is, if their previous life doesn’t come calling…</p><h3>Ombrask Traits</h3><p>As an ombrask, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and one other ability score based on your former race increases by 1, as described in the table below.</p><h4>Ombrask Former Race Boons</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=\"text-align:center\">Former Race</th><th style=\"text-align:left\">Ability Increased</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Cnidaran</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Con</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Cyclopian</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Int</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Dwarf</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Con</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Elf</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Int, Wis, or Cha</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Dragonborn</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Str</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Gnome</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Int</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Gobboc</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Wis or Cha</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Golynn</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Con</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Half-Elf</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Cha</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Half-Orc</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Str</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Halfling</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Cha</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Human</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 any ability except Dex</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Oozekin</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Con</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Opteran</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Cha</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Rakin</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Con, Int, Wis, or Cha*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">Tiefling</td><td style=\"text-align:left\">+1 Cha</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>*Choose one that the rakin subrace had a choice of.</em></p><p><em><strong>Age</strong>.</em> Ombrasks live as long as the race from which they originated.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>.

A distraction!”</p><p>Harried Houdinky, Voleur Extraordinaire</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Rakin_Posskin.webp\"><p>Yells and chuckles are common sounds around the home of any rakin (RACK-in) thanks to their shared love language: pranks. From sewer-side burrows to palatial penthouses, wattle-and-daub huts to intricate treetop villages, rakin can be found at all levels of society, a product of their ingeniousness and habit of getting into trouble. One is rarely bored around a rakin.</p><h3>Deific Origins</h3><p>The mistaken spawn of a passionate tryst between deities of trickery and nature, rakin hold a deep affinity for both domains. Since their creation, they have had little contact with either god, learning to rely on their own wits to survive.</p><p><em><strong>Trickery</strong>.</em> As rakin society progressed, their culture grew to value trickery and subterfuge. Good-natured pranks sprang from their paws as instinctively as breathing. Honed against the fearsome beasts of the forest, this innate talent to deceive helped the rakin bloom as a civilisation. Tales are still told of how Mack Gyver fought off a rampaging owlboar with nought but a goodberry, a silver needle, and a pig’s bladder.</p><p><em><strong>Pranks</strong>.</em> Rakin politics, religion, and interpersonal relationships revolve around the idea of practical jokes. An atmosphere of one-up-manship and lighthearted merriment suffuses all of their wheelings and dealings. Even when faced with the most horrid of circumstances, a rakin’s first instinct is to crack a joke.</p><h3>Ideological Chasm</h3><p>After centuries of living in chaotic mirth, an ideological battle split rakin culture in two when they first made contact with other humanoids. Many of the rakin were intrigued by cities—forests of stone and steel; organized, yet unpredictable, and full of opportunity. The elders forbade them to interact, alleging such civilization to be directly counter to the chaos that nature intended, the principle upon which rakin culture was built.</p><p>The debacle spiralled into a full-on feud between the opposing rakin factions, sundering the once united race. The urkin broke with tradition and followed their ambition into the cities, whilst the tanukin remained in their indigenous forests, adhering to their ancestral ways.</p><h3>Rakin Traits</h3><p>Rakin share a number of traits in common with each other.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Rakin age slightly quicker than humans, reaching adulthood by 14. They live to be around 70 years old.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Rakin are between 3 and a half to 4 feet tall. They have light gaits but sturdy frames, weighing between 50 and 90 pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision</strong></em>. You can see in dim light within <strong>60 feet</strong> of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p><p><em><strong>Deft Climber</strong></em>. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p><em><strong>Subraces</strong></em>. The physical and cultural differences that arose after the rakin’s schism produced three subraces: the urkin, the posskin, and the tanukin. Choose one of these subraces: <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>the urkin, the posskin, and the tanukin.</p><h3>Posskin</h3><p>While the tanukin and urkin found homes in forests and cities, a third, smaller contingent embraced their wanderlust and a life of vagabondry. With the road as their home, posskin never settle in one place for long and are well adapted to the harsh conditions associated with constantly sleeping outdoors. Their ability to withstand disease enables them to act as scavengers, feasting on the left-to-rot remains of other carnivores. Should they ever find themselves the target of a territorial creature, their innate ability to play dead can often trick such aggressors into believing they are no longer a threat and leaving them alone, if a little bloodied.</p><p>Posskin might find employ in a variety of walks of life. From hedge knights to circus performers, travelling snake oil salesmen to chronic dumpster divers, so long as the job keeps moving, a posskin stays happy.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.lQeDc3QHY55MA2LP]{Bite.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.lQeDc3QHY55MA2LP caption=false cite=false]{Bite}</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.Y2zzAxoBR21pyqxn]{Scavenger.}</strong></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.Y2zzAxoBR21pyqxn cite=false caption=false]{Scavenger}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.gt6QKYJG11aFrAOA]{Play Dead.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.gt6QKYJG11aFrAOA cite=false caption=false]{Play Dead}</p><p><em><strong>Posskin Names</strong>.</em></p><p>The words used to name a posskin are more than just sounds; they are a story.

Sure they left a generous helping of gold, but I wasn’t gonna till my garden for another week!“</p><p>Pottleberry Tom, Garden Gnome Extraordinaire</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Golynn.webp\"><p>The rich scent of freshly-turned earth may be a sure indicator that a group of nomadic golynn (GO-lin) is in the area. Vivacious wanderers, golynn are creatures of nature and have little use for the trappings of modern society. Their shovel-like hands, scaly exterior, and insect-devouring constitution ensure their survival wherever the earth is soft and the soil is fertile.</p><h2>Hearth and Heartbeat</h2><p>Golynn adore rhythm. They find joy in the thrum of a lightning-rail, the clip-clop of a riding goat’s hooves, and the heartbeats of their kith and kin. From these everyday occurrences, golynn make wonderfully complex polyrhythms, music whose restorative vibrations can reinvigorate the melancholy and afraid. Indeed, the lead percussionist for the legendary opteran band, Wings of a Butterfly, was Hopo Aman, a golynn maestro of the dwarven tablah.</p><p>Golynn legend tells of a single, pulsing rhythm that drives all life in the world, the <em>golo’apa</em>, or ‘Heartbeat of the World’. Many golynn’s nomadic existence is a singular quest to explore all the nooks and crannies of the world, searching for this rhythm. In their never-ending pilgrimage, golynn leave a plethora of hidden burrows—warm, safe spaces whose locations are passed on by word of mouth.</p><h2>Dig a Hole Lotta’ Trouble</h2><p>This constant burrowing can sometimes bring golynn into conflict with the <em>uto monké</em>, or ‘those that live under the sky’. Golynn have ruined many a quality murderbowl pitch and have even inadvertently undermined castles while searching for the rhythmic clanking of a prisoner’s chains. Conversely, some farmers, recognising their natural aptitude for digging, engage passing golynn as farmhands whenever possible, promising them all the grubs they can eat in exchange for a day’s work.</p><h2>Happenstance</h2><p>Not all golynn are raised by their own kin. Rumours of the magical healing properties of golynn scales still abound, leading unsavoury and desperate individuals to hunt them for these entirely-mundane components. Fortunately, orphaned golynn have been taken in by all manner of parents, from halflings, dwarves, and gnomes to lotol and kobolds, who regard them as huge, scaled, dragon-kin.</p><p>With their fondness for exploration, golynn make natural adventurers. A burrowing golynn might accidentally fall into an underground sepulchre, find a long-buried artifact, or stumble upon the machinations of an evil necromancer bent on raising an army of the undead.</p><h2>Golynn Traits</h2><p>As a golynn, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong>.</em> Golynn grow rapidly and reach maturity at 10 years of age. On average, they live about 150 years.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong>.</em> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong>.</em> Golynn stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and average between 300 and 400 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong>.</em> Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.gHcRYlYVPrhD2NjE]{Natrual Armour.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.gHcRYlYVPrhD2NjE cite=false caption=false]{Natural Armour}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.Ilrkte3M4Jjm45tT]{Powerful Build.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.Ilrkte3M4Jjm45tT cite=false caption=false]{Powerful Build (Golynn)}</p><p><em><strong>Shovel Talons</strong>.</em></p><p>Your wide, powerful claws are perfect for creating tunnels and burrows.

A distraction!”</p><p>Harried Houdinky, Voleur Extraordinaire</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Rakin_Tanukin.webp\"><p>Yells and chuckles are common sounds around the home of any rakin (RACK-in) thanks to their shared love language: pranks. From sewer-side burrows to palatial penthouses, wattle-and-daub huts to intricate treetop villages, rakin can be found at all levels of society, a product of their ingeniousness and habit of getting into trouble. One is rarely bored around a rakin.</p><h3>Deific Origins</h3><p>The mistaken spawn of a passionate tryst between deities of trickery and nature, rakin hold a deep affinity for both domains. Since their creation, they have had little contact with either god, learning to rely on their own wits to survive.</p><p><em><strong>Trickery</strong>.</em> As rakin society progressed, their culture grew to value trickery and subterfuge. Good-natured pranks sprang from their paws as instinctively as breathing. Honed against the fearsome beasts of the forest, this innate talent to deceive helped the rakin bloom as a civilisation. Tales are still told of how Mack Gyver fought off a rampaging owlboar with nought but a goodberry, a silver needle, and a pig’s bladder.</p><p><em><strong>Pranks</strong>.</em> Rakin politics, religion, and interpersonal relationships revolve around the idea of practical jokes. An atmosphere of one-up-manship and lighthearted merriment suffuses all of their wheelings and dealings. Even when faced with the most horrid of circumstances, a rakin’s first instinct is to crack a joke.</p><h3>Ideological Chasm</h3><p>After centuries of living in chaotic mirth, an ideological battle split rakin culture in two when they first made contact with other humanoids. Many of the rakin were intrigued by cities—forests of stone and steel; organized, yet unpredictable, and full of opportunity. The elders forbade them to interact, alleging such civilization to be directly counter to the chaos that nature intended, the principle upon which rakin culture was built.</p><p>The debacle spiralled into a full-on feud between the opposing rakin factions, sundering the once united race. The urkin broke with tradition and followed their ambition into the cities, whilst the tanukin remained in their indigenous forests, adhering to their ancestral ways.</p><h3>Rakin Traits</h3><p>Rakin share a number of traits in common with each other.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Rakin age slightly quicker than humans, reaching adulthood by 14. They live to be around 70 years old.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Rakin are between 3 and a half to 4 feet tall. They have light gaits but sturdy frames, weighing between 50 and 90 pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision</strong></em>. You can see in dim light within <strong>60 feet</strong> of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p><p><em><strong>Deft Climber</strong></em>. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p><em><strong>Subraces</strong></em>. The physical and cultural differences that arose after the rakin’s schism produced three subraces: the urkin, the posskin, and the tanukin. Choose one of these subraces: <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>the urkin, the posskin, and the tanukin.</p><h3>Tanukin</h3><p>Tanukin believe that civilization is a sacrilegious destruction of the beautiful chaos of nature. So rarely do tanukin venture into humanoid settlements that they are often mistaken for racoons, or worse, urkin. The times they do deign to enter the ‘stone forests’, it is to use their illusion magic to evoke the divine chaos and confusion that they associate with the natural world.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Charisma or Wisdom score increases by 1 (your choice).</p><p><em><strong>Adept Trickster</strong>.</em> You gain proficiency in your choice of the Deception or Persuasion skills.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.J9LWFm0igRZcpTeI]{Wild Speech}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.J9LWFm0igRZcpTeI cite=false caption=false]{Wild Speech}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.igEqzwnJ8SxVeC2m]{Tanukin Magic.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.igEqzwnJ8SxVeC2m caption=false cite=false]{Tanukin Magic.}</p><p><em><strong>Tanukin Names</strong>.</em></p><p>With deeper ties to their ancestry, tanukin stick to one name over the course of their lifetime.

Just wish he would stop running into the glowglobe.”</p><p>Lux Lumin, half-elf Wizard Adventurer</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Opteran.webp\"><p>A sedentary life among the birds and insects of their treetop dwellings is the most adventurous goal of many opterans’ lives. In shades of green and brown, these larval opterans (OP-ter-an) are happy to avoid conflict, camouflaging into the canopy from which they acquire sustenance. But, with a brilliant flash of colour, an adult opteran injects this placid scene with a vivacious zest for life. Frantic flaps of its broad, multicoloured wings usher this metamorphosed form to and fro, a sparkling rainbow that nary takes a moment to rest.</p><h3>Live Fast, Die Young</h3><p>Opterans can, in theory, live forever. So long as they are never stressed (and have no goals for reproduction), a larval opteran doesn’t age and can enjoy an indefinite life of sedentary bliss. However, should the need arise, such as during times of environmental catastrophe, war, or fits of passion, a larval opteran enters a chrysalis in which it metamorphoses into its winged, adult form. Once it emerges, the clock begins ticking; it lives no more than 2 or 3 years in this form, just long enough to find a mate and produce a new batch of larvae elsewhere in the world.</p><p>Because of this, larval opterans are extremely conflict-averse. If a predator comes a-calling, a larval opteran prefers to deploy its sticky ‘string shot’ and retreat to the safety of its tree-home, rather than potentially become overstimulated. Conversely, adult, winged opterans often lose this sense of self-preservation, a behaviour change that the uneducated might describe as ‘disturbing’.</p><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Opteran_extra.webp\"><h3>Natural Performers</h3><p>Due to their brilliant colouration and short lives, opterans make some of the most renowned performers. Tales are told of the bard group Wings of a Butterfly’s first and final world tour. So in-demand were tickets to this once-in-their-lifetime show, that monarchs even traded small earldoms in order to purchase a show for their courts.</p><p>Opterans that choose to venture into the wider world are often old, tired of the sedentary life, and ready for adventure. However, the destruction of an opteran’s home, the search for a loved one, or the desire to be the next Wings of a Butterfly could all be worthy motivators to risk undergoing the change.</p><h3>Opteran Traits</h3><p>As an opteran, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Charisma score increases by 2.</p><p><strong>Age</strong>. Opterans age based on their environment. They can live for centuries in their larval forms, but under great stress, they pupate and hatch into their adult forms. Tragically, they only live for 2 to 3 years after emerging as adults.</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type</strong>.</em> You are a humanoid. You are also considered a fey for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a fey.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong>.</em> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong>.</em> Larval opterans stand between 2 and 3 feet tall, while adult opterans are between 5 to 6 feet. Your size begins as Small. When you become an adult opteran, you grow to Medium size. See the Metamorphosis trait for details.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed as a larval opteran is <strong>25 feet</strong>. Your base walking speed as an adult opteran is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.ct76v9w6tYEYTCuw]{Metamorphosis.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.ct76v9w6tYEYTCuw cite=false caption=false]{Metamorphosis}</p>",

      "description": "<blockquote><p>“Okay, ready? Left eye. Right eye. Left eye. Righoh I do beg your pardon.”</p><p>Sia Lotta’ize, Opthamolagist</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Cyclopian.webp\"><p>The pursuit of knowledge, the acquisition of secrets, and the hoarding of trinkets with storied histories are common practices among any creature raised by cyclopians (sy-CLO-pee-ans). From dog tags to tapestries, musical manuscripts to carved tablets, and magical memory orbs to worthless heirlooms, their ‘libraries’ (as cyclopians refer to their homes) are filled with knowledge. With their physical adaptation to climbing, cyclopian homes are often found high up in cliffsides, within abandoned wizards’ towers, or deep in The Low.</p><h2>Monocular and Myopic</h2><p>A cyclopian’s singular eye is the perfect metaphor for this race’s almost-myopic tendency to focus on one thing to the exclusion of all others. When a cyclopian finds a topic that interests them, little can stop their manic and feverish efforts to acquire any relevant documents, information, or answers. Indeed, the famed cyclopian researcher Roza “Thanks” Thanklinds is rumoured to have forgone sleep for more than two months while analysing the crystallised mut-x from the former laboratory of Dr Frank N. Stein. Of course, this feat was made all the easier thanks to cyclopians’ ability to metabolise knowledge into actual, physical, nutritional value.</p><h2>Arcanists Analogue</h2><p>Cyclopians are often mistaken for shadowy aberrations of the Shadow Plane known as nothings. While both cyclopian and nothings share a hulking monocular physiology and a hunger for knowledge, a brief observation yields one significant difference: the skulking simulacra leave a trail of rot and necrosis wherever they travel, while no true cyclopian would ever risk damaging a book in this way.</p><h2>Pilgrimage of Huge Discovery</h2><p>Cyclopians of a certain age often embark on a Pilgrimage of Huge Discovery, or PHD. During this time, they venture out into the world, seeking to bring new and significant knowledge back to their library. For some individuals, the natural compulsion to explore is all the impetus they need to leave the comfort of their homes. On the other hand, more reticent cyclopians might have to be forced out by their family, fulfilling this rite of passage based on a sense of duty. Cyclopians who fixate on the acquisition of artifacts, rather than the joy of studying them, are regarded as rare and valuable assets to any family; cyclopian adventurers are always warmly welcomed back to their library.</p><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Cyclopian_Extras.webp\"><h2>Sharing is Caring</h2><p>Cyclopians have an unusual lifecycle. Though they can reproduce sexually, cyclopians are also capable of a form of asexual budding. When a cyclopian is beyond inundated by the volume of knowledge awaiting its analysis (such as after it gains entry into an abandoned, book-filled wizard’s tower), it can spontaneously and unexpectedly undergo entire body mitosis. This produces a smaller, similar, genetically distinct, individual—an assistant with whom the research can be more manageably catalogued.</p><h2>Cyclopian Traits</h2><p>As a cyclopian, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and either your Dexterity score or Wisdom score increases by 1 (your choice).</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Cyclopians reach maturity in their early teens and typically live as long as humans.</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type</strong>.</em> You are a humanoid. You are also considered an aberration for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an aberration.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong>.</em> You can speak, read, and write Common, Undercommon, and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong>.</em> With their crouched and hulking posture, Cyclopians typically appear smaller than they are. At full stretch, a cyclopian stands between 5 and 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong>.</em> Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision</strong>.</em> Accustomed to life in dimly-lit libraries, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within <strong>60 feet</strong> of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p><p><em><strong>Knowledge Seeker</strong>.</em></p><p>Learning is an almost irresistible compulsion amongst cyclopians and often leads them to dangerous locations. You have proficiency in your choice of two of the following skills: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, Religion, and Stealth.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.itKdQScivLSCuGqg]{Savant of Secrets.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.itKdQScivLSCuGqg cite=false caption=false]{Savant of Secrets}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.zlB1zH3dm9IxfBo9]{Thought for Food.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.zlB1zH3dm9IxfBo9 cite=false caption=false]{Thought for Food}</p><p><em><strong>Top Shelf</strong>.</em></p><p>Generations spent climbing to the top shelves of tall libraries have led to a selective pressure on the ability to climb within cyclopians.

Survival is a gobboc’s watchword; their own survival is their number one goal on expedition—treasure, glory, and saving the world be damned.</p><h2>Brave Cowards</h2><p>You’ll likely recognise the back of a gobboc’s head more than the front, given their propensity to run away at the first sign of danger. While this is the epitome of cowardice, it is a specifically brave kind of cowardice; life is scary and living another day is the bravest thing you can do. At least, this is what is taught to gobboc from the moment they can walk, a few hours after they’re born.</p><p>A typical gobboc is never the first to enter a room nor the last in a line of dungeon delvers. They aim to keep bodies firmly before and behind them, a tactical meat shield to ward off harm. Indeed, gobbocs are the ultimate hit-and-run fighters, retreating from a foe before it can retaliate against their precise and lightning-quick attacks. This method of fighting, taught to all gobbocs, is known as the Klucking Fighting Creed.</p><h2>Fit and Sit</h2><p>Gobbocs have a peculiar tendency to sit on things. The pinnacle of this innate desire is the Festival of Brooding, sometimes known as the Eggstravaganza. This annual event finds all the gobbocs in a town creating the most comfortable thrones, bean bag chairs, and bundles of straw possible before sitting on them around a huge bonfire. There are no fireworks; sudden, loud noises are frowned upon in gobboc society.</p><h2>Avian Ascendency</h2><p>Gobbocs worship other birds. The bigger the bird, the more holy it is. In fact, similarly to kobolds, gobboc belief is innately magical. It is so potent that gobboc belief causes birds to become more intelligent. In times of war, gobboc hosts are often accompanied by flocks of birds: razor-clawed and quick-witted cassowaries form cavalry divisions, while flying contingents are composed of super-intelligent hippogriffs. It is widely posited that the famous gobboc playwright Owlfred Hatchcluck based his play, The Birds, on this uniquely gobboc occurrence.</p><h2>Gobboc Traits</h2><p>As a gobboc, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and either your Charisma score or Wisdom score increases by 1 (your choice).</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Gobbocs grow quickly and die young. They walk hours after hatching, reach adulthood by age 7, and live around 30 years.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Gobbocs are a diminutive race and stand on average 2 to 3 feet tall. Your size is Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is <strong>25 feet</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.kUpNgUI6h3L0arDK]{Commune with Fowl Folk.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.kUpNgUI6h3L0arDK cite=false caption=false]{Commune with Fowl Folk}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.FeNBjabLpTE0kVMX]{Coward's Creed.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.FeNBjabLpTE0kVMX cite=false caption=false]</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.mUpB6sms1POiOQ32]{Feathered.&nbsp;}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.mUpB6sms1POiOQ32 cite=false caption=false]{Feathered}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.XDejwMDneJCCEnH0]{Gallus Domesticus.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.XDejwMDneJCCEnH0 cite=false caption=false]{Gallus Domesticus}</p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.actors.Actor.KQsUY2UV0zDoALxe statblock caption=false statblock caption=false]</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.j9QHUPYJhjfEuzPT]{Headless Chicken.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.j9QHUPYJhjfEuzPT cite=false caption=false]{Headless Chicken}</p>",

After a physical trap activates, its materials are consumed and the trap can’t be used again. However, over the course of <strong>10 minutes</strong>, you can salvage half the trap-making materials used in the physical trap’s construction if it hasn’t activated yet.</p><p><em><strong>Magical Traps</strong>.</em> Immediately after you finish a long rest, you can create magical traps—up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1)—choosing from the options in the Ranger Traps section. Some of these traps require you to expend spell slots in their creation. When you finish a long rest, all undeployed magical traps lose their effects.</p><p>While a physical trap’s description specifies how it is activated, you have flexibility in activating your magical traps. When you deploy a magical trap, you can choose a size of creature and a distance of up to <strong>30 feet</strong>. When a creature of that size or larger comes within the specified distance, the trap activates. As another option, you can intentionally activate a magical trap within <strong>150 feet</strong> of you using a bonus action or a reaction (with no specific trigger).</p><p><em><strong>Deploying a Trap</strong>.</em> As an action, you can throw a trap you have created to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground within <strong>30 feet</strong> of you, where it arms itself at the start of your next turn. A trap deployed in this way is plainly visible to all creatures. Over the course of <strong>1 minute</strong>, you can conceal a trap. A concealed trap can be noticed by a creature that uses its action to make a <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\"><strong>[[/check Wisdom Perception]]</strong></span> check against your <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\">ranger save DC</span> and succeeds.</p><p><em><strong>Disarming a Trap</strong></em>. Attempting to move an armed trap causes it to activate, unleashing its effects. A creature within reach of a trap can use its action to make a <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\"><strong>[[/tool dex thief]]</strong></span> check (for physical traps) or a <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\"><strong>[[/check wis arcana]]</strong></span> check (for magical traps) against your <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\">ranger save DC</span>. On a success, the trap is disarmed. On a failure, the trap activates and the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes to resist the trap’s effects. As an action, you can remotely disarm one of your traps that is within <strong>150 feet</strong> of you.</p><p><em><strong>Trap Effects</strong>.</em> Spell effects created by a trap don’t require concentration. When a trap calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\">ranger spell save DC</span>. You can have multiple traps deployed, but any attempt to deploy a magical trap whose centre is within <strong>40 feet</strong> of the centre of another magical trap fails. Creatures with truesight or that are under the influence of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{Detect Magic}</em> spell can notice a magical trap’s presence, even if it has been concealed.</p><section class=\"sidebar right\"><h4><em><strong>Trap-Making Materials</strong></em></h4><p>1 gp worth of trap-making materials weighs 1 lb.</p></section>",

Stuff of nightmares, this kid.”</p><p>Grenkogg the Barricade, Barbarian Adventurer</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Lotol.webp\"><p>Creatures of swamp, river, and lake, these salamander-kin go with the flow—literally. Where the water wends, lotol (LOT-ol) make their home. Despite their shorter lives, lotol rarely rush; they have little to prove and trust in the currents of fate to take them where they need to be. Masters of adaptation, it is the lotol’s propensity to find joy in all things that sets them apart from other races: the croak of a bullfrog, the death of an elder, or the sweet scent of petrichor after a long hot summer; all are accepted with an open, wholesome grace.</p><h2>Lizard Legend</h2><p>In lotol legend, the first lotol ancestor, Ablon the Stoney, had magnificently hard scales but was a stoic and unfeeling creature. To teach him a lesson, the great Platinum Dragon cursed him to be more sensitive. Ablon’s scales fell from his body, and his kin would forever bear this soft-skinned nature as a reminder to always be aware of how your actions might affect the world around you. In their own tongue, lotol are known as the ‘lizards without scales’.</p><p>Consequently, lotol often remark when they meet humanoids that do have scales, such as dragonborn, lizardfolk, or golynn. This reaction varies, from awe to envy, or from open infatuation to a fearful expectation of insensitivity or brutishness (stereotypes some lotol individuals hold). A sect of lotol, The Platinum Apology, dedicate their lives to ending this curse and restoring themselves as scale-wearing reptiles. Whether or not this curse is real, let alone possible, is unknown.</p><h2>Water Waders</h2><p>The few times lotol ever come into conflict with neighbours, it is almost always to do with water. A growing lotol population creates new wetlands by damming up rivers, sometimes to the chagrin of local trappers and woodsfolk. Following floods, whole pods of lotol can find themselves washed downstream into an entirely new (and often recently-drowned) habitat. Fortunately for those that may be reconstructing their lives following such an inundation, lotol are more than keen to help. Lotol with innate aqueous adaptations can prove a blessing to washed-out villages and offset the enmity villagers may feel towards this newly-arrived population of semi-nomadic salamander-folk.</p><p>With their supple, permeable skin, lotol are extremely sensitive to pollutants. If a black dragon poisons the water upstream or heavy metals from a dwarven mine begin to leech into the groundwater, lotol are often the first to know. The only record of lotol going to war is recorded in the oral chant <em>The Cleansing Tide</em>. With the help of a bronze dragon, Chionthan the Forgetful, lotol of the Chion Valley snuck upon the cruel and pernicious Ulvik the Black. There they delivered a mighty electric current into his lair, causing him to flee in fear. Lotol believe that their ability to generate electric currents through their skin is a blessing from the great Chionthan.</p><h2>Adaptive and Atypical</h2><p>To call lotol adaptive is an understatement. When required, lotol can change their very physiology, growing gills, improving their eyesight, or even developing long, elastic tongues. Adapting quickly to different environments allows them to explore a gamut of potential habitats, despite their sensitive skin. Some lotol even embark on quests, seeking to put themselves in the most unusual and atypical situations imaginable in order to unlock as-yet-undiscovered adaptations.</p><h2>Lotol Traits</h2><p>As a lotol, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong>.</em> Newborn lotol metamorphose into their adult form in 1 year and reach full maturity after 10 years. They typically live between 40 and 50 years.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong>.</em> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong>.</em> Lotol never stop growing; the larger the lotol, the older it probably is! Lotol typically range from 4 feet to 5 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong>.</em> Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.aGbQsDlEQi7MFJIl]{Oblivious.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.aGbQsDlEQi7MFJIl cite=false caption=false]{Oblivious}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.akvQexQIUqujTDyy]{Slippery Skin.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.akvQexQIUqujTDyy cite=false caption=false]{Slippery Skin}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.9XMdMTl8ZkzJxmjY]{Adaptive Polymorphism.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.9XMdMTl8ZkzJxmjY cite=false caption=false]{Adaptive Polymorphism}</p>",

A distraction!”</p><p>Harried Houdinky, Voleur Extraordinaire</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Rakin_Urkin.webp\"><p>Yells and chuckles are common sounds around the home of any rakin (RACK-in) thanks to their shared love language: pranks. From sewer-side burrows to palatial penthouses, wattle-and-daub huts to intricate treetop villages, rakin can be found at all levels of society, a product of their ingeniousness and habit of getting into trouble. One is rarely bored around a rakin.</p><h3>Deific Origins</h3><p>The mistaken spawn of a passionate tryst between deities of trickery and nature, rakin hold a deep affinity for both domains. Since their creation, they have had little contact with either god, learning to rely on their own wits to survive.</p><p><em><strong>Trickery</strong>.</em> As rakin society progressed, their culture grew to value trickery and subterfuge. Good-natured pranks sprang from their paws as instinctively as breathing. Honed against the fearsome beasts of the forest, this innate talent to deceive helped the rakin bloom as a civilisation. Tales are still told of how Mack Gyver fought off a rampaging owlboar with nought but a goodberry, a silver needle, and a pig’s bladder.</p><p><em><strong>Pranks</strong>.</em> Rakin politics, religion, and interpersonal relationships revolve around the idea of practical jokes. An atmosphere of one-up-manship and lighthearted merriment suffuses all of their wheelings and dealings. Even when faced with the most horrid of circumstances, a rakin’s first instinct is to crack a joke.</p><h3>Ideological Chasm</h3><p>After centuries of living in chaotic mirth, an ideological battle split rakin culture in two when they first made contact with other humanoids. Many of the rakin were intrigued by cities—forests of stone and steel; organized, yet unpredictable, and full of opportunity. The elders forbade them to interact, alleging such civilization to be directly counter to the chaos that nature intended, the principle upon which rakin culture was built.</p><p>The debacle spiralled into a full-on feud between the opposing rakin factions, sundering the once united race. The urkin broke with tradition and followed their ambition into the cities, whilst the tanukin remained in their indigenous forests, adhering to their ancestral ways.</p><h3>Rakin Traits</h3><p>Rakin share a number of traits in common with each other.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. Rakin age slightly quicker than humans, reaching adulthood by 14. They live to be around 70 years old.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong></em>. Rakin are between 3 and a half to 4 feet tall. They have light gaits but sturdy frames, weighing between 50 and 90 pounds. Your size is Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision</strong></em>. You can see in dim light within <strong>60 feet</strong> of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p><p><em><strong>Deft Climber</strong></em>. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p><em><strong>Subraces</strong></em>. The physical and cultural differences that arose after the rakin’s schism produced three subraces: the urkin, the posskin, and the tanukin. Choose one of these subraces: <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>the urkin, the posskin, and the tanukin.</p><h3>Urkin</h3><p>Urkin society values cunning, savvy, and—above all—the thrill of the heist. This leaves the urkin with a bit of a nasty reputation, a fact that utterly fails to curb their ambitions. Adaptable and resourceful, urkin excel as confidence tricksters and pickpockets.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Charisma or Intelligence score increases by 1 (your choice).</p><h4><em><strong>Streetwise</strong>.</em></h4><p>You gain proficiency in your choice of the Sleight of Hand or Stealth skills. Additionally, you know thieves’ cant.</p><h4><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.sXLjWtjdZyXD7Wmw]{Nimble Dodge.}</strong></em></h4><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.sXLjWtjdZyXD7Wmw cite=false caption=false]{Nimble Dodge}</p><h4><em><strong>Urkin Names</strong>.</em></h4><p>Eager to fit in, urkin have adopted the first and last name format of other humanoid races. Typically, an urkin will name themselves, taking the name of a well-known figure and wringing from it the most humorous pun imaginable. Urkin pride themselves on having the cleverest name they know and will go through dozens in their lifetime.</p>",

      "description": "<blockquote><p>“Don’t. Break. The. Coral. No souvenirs, no trinkets, no keepsakes. That’s someone’s grandparent.”</p><p>Jack Kusto, Oceanographer</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Cnidaran.webp\" height=\"600\"><p>From nomadic, floating cities whose coral exoskeletons stretch down into the dark ocean depths to mile-long reefs and small atolls, cnidaran (NI-da-ran) settlements can be found wherever salt meets water. Their unique, bipartite lifecycle sets them apart from most other humanoids and fosters a zealous loyalty between cnidaran and home.</p><h3>Disperse and Deploy</h3><p>Cnidarans have two distinct phases to their lifecycle: the medusozoa and the polyp. An adventuring cnidaran—one that can speak, has a vaguely humanoid shape, and can manipulate tools—is a medusozoa. These individuals are responsible for interacting with the outside world (in other words, anything beyond their home reef).</p><p>When medusozoa mate, an event that can involve dozens of individuals, the thousands of larvae that are conceived settle on the nearest substrate, often the cnidarans’ own coral home. Once rooted, the larvae develop into polyps with two tasks. The first is to grow a single new medusozoa over a single moon’s cycle and then birth this inch-long, instinct-driven youngster into the waters surrounding its home. The second is to secrete a calcareous exoskeleton, fusing their body with the reef and growing the cnidarans’ coral home.</p><p>Life for a young medusozoa is tenuous; it must fend for itself, drifting in open waters and feeding on plankton and other medusozoa until it reaches at least a foot in length, usually by the end of its third year. During this juvenile stage, a time known as the uko’ulush (the ‘wild time’), a medusozoa is largely ignored by other cnidarans, who believe that “trial by ocean makes the hardest pearls.” Once a cnidaran completes this juvenile stage, it is brought into the reef, a utilitarian and communal space where the customs, culture, and values of that reef are passed on, the uko’malang (the ‘time of waiting’).</p><h3>Commune and Community</h3><p>Cnidarans live communally. With the practices of mass mating and random dispersal, no single medusozoa knows which individuals are their parents. In fact, the entire concept of ‘parentage’, ‘hereditary titles’, and ‘inheritance’ is foreign to most cnidarans.</p><p>When a cnidaran medusozoa reaches maturity, it is given the choice to leave the reef with the blessing of the whole community, a once-in-a-lifetime event known as the uko’fa (the ‘time of exploration’). Individuals that start on the uko’fa do so for a multitude of reasons. Some seek to bring back treasures from the world beyond and enhance their own community. Others feel a need to disperse, finding other reefs to join or even forming new reefs with like-minded medusozoa met on their travels. A very few become enraptured by wanderlust and spend the rest of their days among winding ocean currents, delving into damp dungeons, and cavorting in ports with other seadogs.</p><h3>No Place Like Home</h3><p>Cnidaran settlements are alive. Made of the bodies of millions of calcified polyps—cnidaran ancestors—a reef is more than just a home; it is the collective memory of a thousand generations, a traceable web of genealogical history, and an esteemed and holy sanctuary. Intentionally damaging a reef carries grave consequences: death, exile, or declarations of war are all sanctions a cnidaran colony might employ. It isn’t unusual for trade unions to pay handsome reparations if a ship damages a cnidaran reef when blown off course by wild winds. To do otherwise might result in ships foundering even in fair and pleasant conditions, such is the whim of an enraged cnidaran reef.</p><h3><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Cnidaran Traits</span></h3><p>As a cnidaran, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> A cnidaran medusozoa reaches maturity at around 20 years of age and can live up to 200 years.</p><p class=\"p1\">Languages.

The former is adapted for confrontation, combat, and conflict; and carries with it an innately toxic weapon. The latter relies on diplomacy, subterfuge, and enchantment to charm antagonists and avoid conflict. Together, these two morphs are capable of pursuing two very different strategies in interspecies interactions. Choose one of these subraces.</p><h3><strong>Shimmerskin</strong></h3><p>Diplomats and traders of a cnidaran reef are often shimmerskin morphs; their propensity to mesmerise makes them skilled negotiators.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Charisma score increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Shimmerskin.</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.yUIU9qTBTMD0hmww cite=false caption=false]{Shimmerskin}</p><p><em><strong>Hynotic Phosphorescence.</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.qxDiQWaYilTBMSEm cite=false caption=false]{Hypnotic Phosphorescence}</p>",

That’s been happening more and more ever since the mycelians moved into town.”</p><p>Roul Todogh, Baker</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Mycelian.webp\"><p>Reusing and recycling are key tenets in the life of any mycelian (my-SEE-lee-an). Nothing is waste; rotten food can fatten a pig, a ruined shirt is a bandage waiting to happen, and corpses are new homes in need of a little bit of reinvigoration. Marginalised and persecuted by most societies, mycelians’ propensity to recycle the recently deceased often brings them into conflict with other humanoids. That being said, graverobbers and less scrupulous grey market traders have been known to make a pretty penny out of selling ageing mycelians their next vessels.</p><h2>Reuse and Recycle</h2><p>Mycelians reanimate the bodies of the recently deceased. Understandably, many more ‘civilised’ races disagree with this practice—it’s difficult to meet your uncle again a few hours after interring him. Moreover, mycelians don’t have the same regenerative abilities as the body’s original inhabitant; wounds are patched over with a web of hyphae, the skin takes on a pale pallor, and the body wears out fairly quickly, lasting six to seven years.</p><p>Much like hermit crabs wear shells, mycelians inoculate corpses with microscopic spores, before growing a web of hyphae through the body. Nerves are co-opted, muscles are repaired, and fungal organs replace the internal viscera of the host. The process is entirely biological, but less tolerant denizens of the world often believe these reanimated bodies to be the work of necromancers, treating mycelians as infectious, living dead.</p><p>The key to distinguishing a mycelian from a zombie, of course, is the smell. Mycelians carry a hearty, musky aroma like that of a vivacious forest floor. Undead, on the other hand, carry the putrid-sweet scent of decay. After several unfortunate interactions with necromancer-hunters, the Sisters of Mercy began employing dogs, with their keen sense of smell, to help differentiate between innocent mycelians and undead artifice.</p><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Mycelian_extra.webp\"><h2>Ancestors and Aging</h2><p>With each new host, a mycelian’s psyche changes a little, moulded by the brain, body, and abilities of the host it co-opts. In moving from one host to another, a mycelian also leaves behind some of its own memories, forever lost to the decay of time. Despite being potentially thousands of years old, the longest-living communities of mycelians often have memories stretching back only a few decades. For this reason, mycelians conduct a ritual shortly before death, where they recant a rhythmic history of their exploits in this host, adding it to the oral history of their community. These oral histories can be days long, and minor word changes (or ‘linguistic decay’ as scholars refer to it) have resulted in tales becoming more and more outlandish the further back in time they occurred.</p><h2>Legend of the Mothershroom</h2><p>Every mycelian oral history has one thing in common: its beginning. These stories all start with the ‘Mothershroom’, a behemoth fungal organism and progenitor to all mycelians. In some stories, the Mothershroom takes the form of a giant, multi-coloured tree. In others, it is a miles-wide web of interconnecting, pulsing hyphae that thrum with thought and feeling. Despite their best efforts, no mycelian, explorer, or scholar has ever found the Mothershroom. Any knowledge of its location—if it even exists—has been lost to the grinding wheel of time.</p><p>Many mycelians have embarked on quests to find their ancient ancestor. For some such adventurers, the desire to find this holy figure is the only memory they retain between bodies.</p><h2>Mycelian Traits</h2><p>As a mycelian, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong>.</em> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1 (which is typically indicative of your host corpse).</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong>.</em> In the right conditions, a corpse inoculated with mycelial spores can rise as a newly-formed, adult mycelian in under a month. Mycelians tend to wear out a host in less than 7 years, and periodically redeploy their personal spores to animate a new, fresher corpse. Theoretically, a mycelian can live on indefinitely, their minds and personalities changing with each rebirth.</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type</strong>.</em> You are a humanoid. You are also considered a plant for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a plant.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong>.</em> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size</strong>.</em> Mycelians run the full gamut of humanoid races, from 2-foot-tall gnomes to 8-foot-tall golynns. Your height, weight, and size are determined by the race to which your host corpse belonged in life. It is typically Small or Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed</strong></em>. Your base walking speed is dictated by the race to which your host corpse belonged in life. It is typically <strong>25</strong> or <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.vV7ok9XDdv8vASJr]{Symbiotic Assimilation.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.vV7ok9XDdv8vASJr caption=false cite=false]{Symbiotic Assimilation}</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.wpoLWHhvOJ9dAJjE]{Spore Spray.}</strong></em></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.wpoLWHhvOJ9dAJjE caption=false cite=false]{Spore Spray}</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.KsNNYP2M1N1ejcXV]{Insporeation.}</strong></p><p>@embed[Compendium.heliana-core.items.Item.KsNNYP2M1N1ejcXV cite=false caption=false]{Insporeation}</p>",

I should really watch what I drink.”</p><p>Dr. Stein, Data Log 0290</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/races/Races-Oozekin.webp\"><p>Naturally curious, oozekin (OOZE-kin) do not have a culture of their own; instead, they tend to assimilate with whoever is ready to accept their slimy, invertebrate form. From the bodyguards of mighty, stone-willed nobles, to adopted playmates of excitable halflings, oozekin are found everywhere, though in small numbers. Taking on the values of those that surround them, oozekin are hard to pigeonhole and have but one thing in common: a delight in immersing their new-found consciousness in the habits and customs of other sapient creatures.</p><h2>Biomantic Origins</h2><p>Oozekin are the odd by-products of Dr Stein’s biomancy experiments—biomantic oozes that gained consciousness and self-replicate through asexual reproduction. When the time is right, an oozekin produces a larval sludge: a juvenile, biomantically-altered ooze not dissimilar to those one might find in a dungeon. After this larva consumes enough sentient grey matter, it exhibits a sudden cognitive and physiological metamorphosis, rising as a humanoid-shaped oozekin.</p><p>These unmoulded, newly-formed consciousnesses are extremely susceptible to the psyches of creatures near them both in space and time. An oozekin that develops in the former lair of a red dragon might take on its avaricious and arrogant personality traits, while one that forms near a sleeping adventurer might be filled with wanderlust and risk-taking qualities. Indeed, the grey matter that a biomantic ooze consumes can have a significant influence on the subsequent oozekin’s values, habits, and memories. Tales abound of oozey doppelgangers, facsimiles of fallen adventurers that believe themselves to be the deceased creature reborn.</p><h2>Oozey Re-birth</h2><p>If a player character dies in an area rich with biomancy, you can consider allowing their character to be reborn as an oozekin. A biomantic ooze may well consume the grey matter of their brain and adopt a plethora of their personality traits, memories, and class levels.</p><h2>Willing and Able</h2><p>Relatively new to the world, oozekin are keen to prove themselves the equal of any other race. Though most oozekin exist within the framework of other, established civilisations, pods of oozekin settlements have arisen in corners of The Low. These conglomerations mix the various assimilated cultures and traditions each oozekin has experienced or formed with, often with unpredictable consequences. Luckily, oozekin’s propensity to get along with one another has resulted in the reconciliation of schisms between historically antagonistic races, such as grey dwarves and dark elves, even if only vicariously through their oozekin adoptees.</p><p>Most oozekin are more than happy to fulfil their role as helpful and productive citizens, contributing to society in any way they can. Others, perhaps those that accidentally harmed friends with their acidic skin, go to obscene lengths to disguise their true form, covering themselves head to toe in scraps of clothing, never staying in one place too long. An especially curious and introspective few live to discover the reason for their existence. How come they have no parents? Where is their history? Why do they exist?</p><h2>Oozekin Traits</h2><p>As an oozekin, you have the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></em>. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Age</strong></em>. An oozekin’s age is nearly impossible to discern. However, the compounds that sustain them appear to deteriorate quickly after 70 years.</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type</strong></em>. You are a humanoid. You are also considered an ooze for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an ooze.</p><p><em><strong>Languages</strong></em>.
