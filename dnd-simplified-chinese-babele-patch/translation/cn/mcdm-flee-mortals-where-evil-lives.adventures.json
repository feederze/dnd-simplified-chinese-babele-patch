If you or any players in your group don't enjoy descriptions of skittering spiders, you don't need to go into detail while narrating scenes with the creature. You could also turn the war spider into another creature, like a war lizard with sticky saliva. A bucket of spiders also serves as a trap in area G9. You can similarly reflavor this trap.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe10.JournalEntryPage.00adventure00001 inline]</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Goblins</h3>\n  <p>You can find more information about goblins in the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00best01.JournalEntryPage.00goblins0000000] chapter.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Hideaway Story Hooks</h2>\n<p>You can use one of the following story hooks to integrate this lair into an adventure:</p>\n<p><strong>Bandit Attack.</strong> While the characters traverse the High Road, a group of Jagged Edge Bandits, consisting of ten @UUID[Actor.8k195iODDFY93un8]{Goblin Lackeys}, a @UUID[Actor.jBhLSg5xVXMNCwid], and a @UUID[Actor.QsmOl4vcCEc3zLp8], attacks. If the characters defeat the bandits, the party can track the goblins back to the hideaway without an ability check.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends of Toblobb.</strong> One of the characters is friends with Toblobb (see area @UUID[.TMOTCfV9ilFCVOnH]{G7}). Toblobb's mother, Morba, reaches out to the character. Morba knows Toblobb went to confront the Jagged Edge Bandits and the young goblin never returned. The mother begs the characters to find her child, offering them a <em>potion of gaseous form</em> as a reward for bringing Toblobb back to her.</p>\n<p><strong>Merchant's Request.</strong> Fenrir Whipp, a human cooper and the leader of the High Road Guild of Merchants, puts out a bounty on Queen Bargnot. The merchant offers 500 gp to any band of adventurers who can capture or kill the bandit queen.</p>\n<h2>Hideaway Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of Jagged Edge Hideaway has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The dirt ceilings are 15 feet high, and creatures with a climbing speed can climb upside down on them without needing to make an ability check.</p>\n<p><strong>Dirt Walls.</strong> A creature without a climbing speed or climbing equipment can climb the packed-dirt walls of the hideaway with a successful [[/skill athletics 12]] check. If a creature fails this check by 5 or more, they fall while attempting to climb, taking [[/damage 1d6 bludgeoning]] damage per 10 feet fallen. A creature can use a shovel or other digging equipment to dig out a 5-foot-cube section of a wall with 5 minutes of work. Multiple creatures working together decrease the time proportionally.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors.</strong> Heavy oak doors stand in doorways 8 feet high. The doors have no locks.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Lanterns hang from the ceilings of all areas. The bandits keep the lanterns burning low, shedding only dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Noise.</strong> The hideaway's solid doors and dirt walls muffle sound. Creatures in an enclosed area can't hear creatures outside that area.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Doors.</strong> Each bandit knows the location of the secret doors in the hideaway. Any creature who has a [[/skill perception 14 passive format=long]] spots the outline of these doors, as does a creature who searches the area and succeeds on a [[/skill investigation 14]] check.</p>\n<h2>Bandits</h2>\n<p>Bandits in the Jagged Edge hideout attack intruders as soon as the bandits notice them. The goblins make use of their Crafty trait to engage in hit-and-run tactics and escape melee confrontations with dangerous foes. Goblins who are clearly losing flee for their lives and escape the lair by the most direct route.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Bandits.</strong></em> A character who succeeds on a [[/skill skill=deception/intimidation/persuasion 13]] check convinces a captured or cornered bandit to give up one of the following pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The location of one of the secret passages connecting area @UUID[.kU95uUq3ZZRyfkwl]{G4} to @UUID[.TMOTCfV9ilFCVOnH]{G7} or area @UUID[.TMOTCfV9ilFCVOnH]{G7} to @UUID[.mwVpllnQsTTzAY2R]{G9}.</li>\n  <li>The location of a trap in area @UUID[.Hka7bcMdhftcpk6H]{G2}.</li>\n  <li>The existence of the war spider in area @UUID[.kU95uUq3ZZRyfkwl]{G4}.</li>\n  <li>The location of the treasure in area @UUID[.TMOTCfV9ilFCVOnH]{G7}.</li>\n  <li>The location of Queen Bargnot in area @UUID[.mwVpllnQsTTzAY2R]{G9}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> If the bandits defeat the characters, the Jagged Edges don't kill them. Instead, the bandits lock them in cages and store their equipment in area @UUID[.TMOTCfV9ilFCVOnH]{G7}.\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Hideaway</h2>\n<p>Provided the characters first deal with any enemies in that area, they can safely take short rests in areas @UUID[.wzsbuVqGKy35RHmN]{G1}, @UUID[.wyWx3bHbx8m0WvYX]{G3}, @UUID[.kU95uUq3ZZRyfkwl]{G4}, @UUID[.SD3dopnrQOUciDtX]{G6}, and @UUID[.TMOTCfV9ilFCVOnH]{G7}, and long rests in areas @UUID[.wzsbuVqGKy35RHmN]{G1}, @UUID[.wyWx3bHbx8m0WvYX]{G3}, and @UUID[.kU95uUq3ZZRyfkwl]{G4}. Otherwise, if the characters attempt to rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} four @UUID[Actor.QsmOl4vcCEc3zLp8]{Goblin Warriors} interrupt them halfway through their rest.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Hideaway</h2>\n<p>If the characters search the High Road for entrances to the lair, a successful [[/skill investigation 12]] check reveals one of the seven hidden, moss-covered trapdoors leading to area @UUID[.Hka7bcMdhftcpk6H]{G2} or @UUID[.wyWx3bHbx8m0WvYX]{G3}. Alternatively, a character who succeeds on a [[/skill survival 12]] check finds goblin footprints that lead to and reveal one of these trapdoors.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>False Entrance.</strong></em> The goblins have placed a decoy trapdoor leading to a dead-end trap in area @UUID[.wzsbuVqGKy35RHmN]{G1}. This trapdoor is purposefully easy to find. A character who searches the High Road and succeeds on a [[/skill investigation 8]] check notices this poorly hidden trapdoor. If the party also noticed the other trapdoors, they observe that this one isn't hidden nearly as well as the others, and it has very few goblin tracks around it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Scouting Party.</strong></em> If the party fails to find a real entrance to the lair and they don't learn about one from any goblins who investigate the collapsed tunnel in area @UUID[.wzsbuVqGKy35RHmN]{G1}, the character with the highest [[/skill perception passive]] spots three @UUID[Actor.QsmOl4vcCEc3zLp8]{Goblin Warriors} and one @UUID[Actor.jBhLSg5xVXMNCwid] leaving the hideaway via a trapdoor from area @UUID[.Hka7bcMdhftcpk6H]{G2}. These goblins are heading out to scout for merchants to rob.\n</p>"

The crest lies within the Hanging Tree in Raskovar's treasure vault (area @UUID[.gcF2VFglaXZ1iDyp]{O9}).</p>\n<p><strong>Shadowy Patron.</strong> A mysterious patron contacts the characters through the mail, offering to give them a <em>+1 longsword</em> if they kill or force Raskovar to relinquish the title of Dohma of the Ivory Throne. The patron is Orvakar, a former orc dohma of the throne who wishes to reclaim her station.</p>\n<p><strong>Unearned Debt.</strong> A dead human mercenary's son, Torvend, was forced to join the Ivory Throne to pay for his father's debts. Yearning for freedom, he begs the characters to find and destroy his father's contract, which is locked away in the Hanging Tree's vault (area @UUID[.gcF2VFglaXZ1iDyp]{O9}).</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Orcs</h3>\n  <p>See the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00best01.JournalEntryPage.00orcs0000000000] entry for general details on orcs.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Hanging Tree Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the headquarters beneath the Hanging Tree has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The stone ceilings are 15 feet high. Old and broken blades are wedged between the ceiling stones. If a creature attacks the ceiling, the blades fall directly down in a 10-foot-diameter cylinder centered on the point that was attacked. If this debris passes through a creature's space, they must succeed on a [[/save dexterity 12]] saving throw or take [[/damage 2d4 slashing average]] damage. Each area's ceiling can only drop blades once.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Waist-high ivory lanterns stand in the corners of every area and fill the place with bright white light. All lights can simultaneously be turned off, turned red, or turned back to white by using an action to speak aloud a command word known to all members of the Ivory Throne: <em>nict</em> (dark), <em>orr</em> (red), and <em>ior</em> (white). Turning the lights red alerts the entire complex to intruders (see @UUID[.abonmVURv1nLswCf#ivory-throne-mercenaries]{Ivory Throne Mercenaries}) and prompts Dohma Raskovar to use the magic shaker in the tavern (area O1) to teleport to the Dohmain (area @UUID[.g86Yt6xK9Cn2RPWH]{O8}).</p>\n<p><strong>Nothing Bolted Down.</strong> A creature can flip a table or lantern within reach or shove it up to 10 feet in a horizontal line as a bonus action. A flipped table provides half cover to Medium and smaller creatures. A Medium or smaller creature in the path of a shoved object must succeed on a [[/save dexterity 12]] saving throw or be knocked &amp;reference[prone].</p>\n<aside class=\"help\">\n  <p>The @UUID[Macro.GudUgeQ544rYv6Zh]{Illumination} macro can be used to change the state of the illumination throughout the lair as described above. It will change the color of the lighting as well as the environmental hue.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Ivory Throne Mercenaries</h2>\n<p>While Raskovar conducts most Ivory Throne business in the tavern, his mercenaries attend to more covert matters at the headquarters below. Unless otherwise noted, mercenaries act in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If the lights in the headquarters are white, the mercenaries question intruders who aren't engaged in suspicious activity. Characters who succeed on a [[/skill deception 14]] check convince an area's mercenaries they have a legitimate reason to be in the lair. Otherwise, the mercenaries attack intruders and raise the alarm by turning the lights red.</li>\n  <li>If the lights in the headquarters are dark or red, or if the mercenaries catch intruders performing a suspicious act (such as picking a lock or stealing), the mercenaries attack the intruders as soon as they notice them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During combat, the mercenaries use the environment to their advantage (see @UUID[.abonmVURv1nLswCf#hanging-tree-features]{Hanging Tree Features}), creating cover, knocking weapons from the ceiling, and bowling over any intruders before engaging them head-on.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Sharing Information.</strong></em> A character who succeeds on a [[/skill skill=intimidation/persuasion 16]] check convinces a captured mercenary or a mercenary who believes the characters are welcome in the lair to divulge one of the following pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The location of the keys to the Dohmain by the holding cell (area @UUID[.9v0UpaO1FBHqpBcs]{O4}).</li>\n  <li>The fact that the green-banded key by the holding cell (area @UUID[.9v0UpaO1FBHqpBcs]{O4}) is a mimic.</li>\n  <li>The location of the hidden orcs in the wall of the narrow hallway (area @UUID[.jSqwFm2GZ10A6vi9]{O3}) and the fountain at the dohma's door (area @UUID[.ukGRVyiEsBbLTT0e]{O7}).</li>\n  <li>The trigger for the trap in the feed room (area @UUID[.IrNqS0mYCX0sLuGO]{O6}).</li>\n  <li>The command words for the lanterns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> If the mercenaries defeat the characters, they try to keep them alive for interrogation and ransom. All but one character wakes up in the holding cell in area @UUID[.9v0UpaO1FBHqpBcs]{O4}. The remaining character wakes up at the bar in area @UUID[.BvJBBAGiV0A9ycHQ]{O1}, face-to-face with Raskovar, ready to discuss his terms for their safety. All the characters' equipment is held in the storage unit in area @UUID[.3wyh0dpsnPAkhy7C]{O5}.\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Hanging Tree</h2>\n<p>If the Hanging Tree isn't on alert, the characters can take a short rest in any area without incident provided they deal with any enemies in the area. They can also take a short or long rest in the storeroom without incident. Otherwise, if the characters attempt to rest, there's an [[/r 1d100cs&gt;20]]{80 percent chance} two @UUID[Actor.iUqkgehiBIYuL6qz]{Orc Bloodrunners} and two @UUID[Actor.nItUYQIKjxtLj7KG]{Orc Furies} working for Raskovar find them 5 minutes into the rest.</p>\n<h2>Boiling Oil</h2>\n<p>If the characters know the Hanging Tree is the Ivory Throne's headquarters, they can question members of the mercenary band or their clients and learn that ordering a boiling oil (a type of drink) at the bar gets you a meeting with Dohma Raskovar.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Hanging Tree</h2>\n<p>The Hanging Tree is open at all hours. The characters can enter through the front door into the tavern (area @UUID[.BvJBBAGiV0A9ycHQ]{O1}).</p>"

If you don't want cannibalism in your games, Shtriga Nonna could capture humanoids and force them to make bad deals for their freedom instead of killing and eating her victims.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.books.JournalEntry.mcdmfmwl00refe10.JournalEntryPage.00adventure00003 inline]</p>\n\n<h2>Hut Story Hooks</h2>\n<p>You can use one of the following story hooks to integrate this lair into an adventure:</p>\n<p><strong>Cat Maiden.</strong> The characters encounter Radlena, a tabby cat who transforms into a halfling woman every full moon. Radlena is a victim of one of Shtriga Nonna's powerful hexes, and only the hag's death can reverse the curse.</p>\n<p><strong>Promise of Vengeance.</strong> A @UUID[Actor.lPZ13jTTNwfSr1eq] named Diedre confides in the party that as children, she and her friend Valyr were kidnapped by Shtriga Nonna, but only Diedre managed to escape. Racked with guilt over abandoning her friend, Diedre asks the characters to join her in taking revenge on the hag, offering that the characters can keep any treasure in the lair.</p>\n<p><strong>Sweet Scent.</strong> A delicious, sweet scent has been wafting across the mountains, driving the local fauna into a frenzy and making them attack travelers. A tiefling ranger named Zerphe has tracked the scent to Shtriga Nonna's wandering hut, but he is too scared to enter. He offers the characters 1,250 gp to investigate it.</p>\n\n<h2>Hut Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of Shtriga Nonna's hut has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Cursed Food.</strong> A <em>detect magic</em> spell reveals that the food and cooking ingredients in the lair radiate auras of necromancy. If a creature who doesn't live in the hut eats any of the food found within, they must succeed on a [[/save wisdom 15]] saving throw or be cursed. While cursed in this way, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws. A <em>cure ailment</em> power or a <em>remove curse</em> or <em>greater restoration</em> spell can remove the curse.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors.</strong> The doors in Shtriga Nonna's hut are made of rough-hewn wood. Each door has AC 15, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If a door is locked, it can be unlocked with a successful [[/skill thief 15]] check, or forced open with a successful [[/check strength 16]] check. Shtriga Nonna (see area H8) has the key to all the doors in the hut.</p>\n<p><strong>Fireplaces.</strong> A creature who touches a lit fireplace for the first time on a turn or starts their turn touching it takes [[/damage 2d4 fire average]] damage.</p>\n<p><strong>High Ceilings.</strong> Rough-hewn wooden beams cross overhead at a height of 20 feet, but the ceiling's peak is 30 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Fireplaces and low-burning lamps fill each room with dim light to the rafters. The areas above the rafters are dark.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"help\">\n  <p>If a player or other creature that does not live in this hut eats any of the food and fails a saving throw, as per “Cursed Food” above, you can use the @UUID[Macro.Roawzmfd8EQms8Mz]{Cursed Food} macro to apply the curse to any tokens you have selected.</p>\n</aside>\n\n<h2>Chimera, Trolls, and Cats</h2>\n<p>Shtriga Nonna's hut is also home to her servants and pets. A young chimera, a troll, and the troll's whelps serve as her guardians in return for the hag's special meals. These creatures attack intruders and fight to the death.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Spectral Cats.</strong></em> Shtriga Nonna's spectral cats are Tiny noncombatant Constructs with climbing and walking speeds of 30 feet. Each wears a collar with a name tag. Though the cats and their collars look solid, they are incorporeal — they can walk through walls and furniture, they can't be harmed, and they can communicate telepathically with Shtriga Nonna if they can see her. Unless attacked, they observe the characters. Once the characters attack the cats or move to a different area, a cat heads to Shtriga Nonna to report the intruders' actions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> If the characters are defeated in combat while in the hut, Shtriga Nonna retrieves and stabilizes any survivors, puts them in cages in the kitchen (area H8), and tosses their gear in the kitchen's debris pile.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Trolls do make the most delightful lackeys. My beauties require so little maintenance. Their wounds get better without any care from me, and the trollies work for food! Oh, they're not fussy when it comes to payment — as long as it's meat, dearies. If you're really clever, you can carve off a piece of one troll to feed another and save the rarer meats for yourself.</p>\n  <p>— <cite>Shtriga Nonna</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Resting in the Hut</h2>\n<p>The characters can take a short rest in any area without incident, provided they deal with any enemies in the area. If the characters try to take a long rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} ten @UUID[Actor.79okH7SIZfkc3Liq]{Troll Whelps} find them halfway through their rest.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Hut</h2>\n<p>While stationary, entering Shtriga Nonna's hut is as simple as climbing the front steps. If the characters chase the hut while it is moving, the hut has a walking speed of 30 feet, and climbing onto the porch requires a successful [[/skill skill=athletics/acrobatics 12]] check.</p>"

If the characters free Kira and either return her equipment to her or succeed on a [[/skill skill=intimidation/persuasion 15]] check, she battles Shtriga Nonna with them. Otherwise, if the characters release the kobold, she flees the hut.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Cauldron.</strong></em> The Medium cauldron bubbles with onions, herbs, and spices as Shtriga Nonna prepares to cook Kira in a stew. A creature who touches the cauldron or fire for the first time on a turn, or who starts their turn touching it, takes [[/damage 1d4 fire average]] damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Ovens.</strong></em> Each oven has a 5-foot-square opening. A creature who touches or enters an oven for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there takes [[/damage 2d6 fire average]] damage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Shelves.</strong></em> These shelves are filled with spices and ingredients for Shtriga Nonna's meals (see “Cursed Food” in the @UUID[.JOmWnCzLxPpkT6rf#hut-features]{Hut Features} section).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Shtriga Nonna carries a ring of keys. The keys unlock the cages and doors in the hut.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Honestly, it is a lot of work.

Vigue offers the characters a <em>+1 shield</em> as a reward for infiltrating Burnock Mill and recovering her stolen sword from Uthrak's hoard (area @UUID[.zneKNe7rzRvTe4ye]{U7}).</p>\n<p><strong>Rising Rebellion.</strong> Duke Rodrik, the human ruler of lands where Baron Uthrak once led a rebellion, offers the characters 2,000 gp to infiltrate Burnock Mill and capture or kill Uthrak before the baron can incite another uprising.</p>\n<p><strong>Toll Concerns.</strong> Merchants and caravans have complained to local authorities about the exorbitant bridge toll demanded by Baron Uthrak and his crew. Countess Irna, a human, offers a 2,000 gp reward to the characters if they can stop these unauthorized “tolls.”</p>\n<h2>Mill Features</h2>\n<p>Areas U5, U6, and U7 comprise the interior of Burnock Mill. These areas have the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The mill's ceilings are 10 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> During the day, bright sunlight fills the mill's second floor (area @UUID[.8d3VxIr8e4NjZ4EG]{U6}) and third floor (area @UUID[.zneKNe7rzRvTe4ye]{U7}). The mill's first floor (area @UUID[.4MqMen8Yd1ZvQsbg]{U5}) has no windows and is dimly lit by lanterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Machinery.</strong> Toothed shafts and large wooden gears cluster at the center of the mill's first floor (area @UUID[.4MqMen8Yd1ZvQsbg]{U5}) and second floor (area @UUID[.8d3VxIr8e4NjZ4EG]{U6}). If the water wheel is turning, the shafts and gears spin. A creature pushed into the spinning machinery must succeed on a [[/save strength 13]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[restrained] by the machinery. A creature restrained in this way takes [[/damage 3d6 bludgeoning average]] damage at the start of each of their turns as long as the machinery is spinning. As an action, a creature can make a [[/check strength 13]] check, freeing themself or another creature within their reach on a success. The machinery on each floor has AC 15, 40 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying the machinery on one floor stops it on all floors.</p>\n<p><strong>Trapdoors.</strong> Heavy trapdoors connect each floor of the mill. Opening a trapdoor requires an action. The trapdoors muffle sound, and creatures on an enclosed floor can't hear noise made on others.</p>\n<h2>Uthrak's Henchmen</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, named NPCs are Baron Uthrak's officers. They are loyal to him and fight to the death. Interrogating them yields no information. If no officers are nearby to command the baron's other forces, they surrender or flee when they are clearly losing. Fleeing henchmen try to reach the mill or open the sluice gate (see area @UUID[.jJKgQw5w5no3jXni]{U2}) to alert Baron Uthrak (see @UUID[.jDT78YBLCd6zeyLF#alerting-the-mill]{Alerting the Mill}).</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Henchmen.</strong></em> A captured or cornered henchman who isn't an officer offers any knowledge or items they can to save their own life. When questioned, they can provide any of the following pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A wicked creature lives in the mill pond (area @UUID[.jJKgQw5w5no3jXni]{U2}) and tried to drown a bandit who got too close.</li>\n  <li>Baron Uthrak bullies a bandit named Dogface (see area @UUID[.8d3VxIr8e4NjZ4EG]{U6}) for being soft and showing mercy to the travelers they rob.</li>\n  <li>Gray Walter (see area @UUID[.dJOoK4695R9HIWHv]{U1}) says the millstone at the top of the mill (area @UUID[.zneKNe7rzRvTe4ye]{U7}) is magic, but he hasn't told Baron Uthrak yet.</li>\n  <li>Brother John (see area @UUID[.4MqMen8Yd1ZvQsbg]{U5}) keeps winning money in sparring matches against other bandits. Some say he cheats!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> If Baron Uthrak's forces defeat the characters, the henchmen disarm them and take them to meet the baron in area U7. The baron searches the captive characters, politely confiscates their weapons and half their coin, then frees them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>New Recruits.</strong></em> A character who approaches one of Uthrak's officers while the mill isn't on alert (see @UUID[.jDT78YBLCd6zeyLF#alerting-the-mill]{Alerting the Mill}) and asks to join the bandits can convince the officer with a successful [[/skill skill=deception/persuasion 17]] check. If convinced, the officer escorts the party to Baron Uthrak on the mill's third floor (area U7). Before allowing the characters to join his forces, the baron tests their loyalty with two requests: that they give him a tribute worth at least 500 gp, and that they seize and bring back the carts of a merchant caravan.\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Mill</h2>\n<p>Provided the characters first deal with any enemies in that area, they can safely take short rests in areas @UUID[.dJOoK4695R9HIWHv]{U1} and @UUID[.jJKgQw5w5no3jXni]{U2}. Otherwise, if the characters attempt to rest, there is an [[/r 1d100cs&gt;20]]{80 percent chance} two @UUID[Actor.yC28PFwjA3Prx5Vp]{Human Knaves} and one @UUID[Actor.IlRmliBawWkapeyz] interrupt them halfway through their rest.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Mill</h2>\n<p>Truss Bridge (area @UUID[.dJOoK4695R9HIWHv]{U1}) can be approached from either the north or south on the main road. If the characters search for another crossing, they find the mill pond (area @UUID[.jJKgQw5w5no3jXni]{U2}). Burnock Mill is visible from both areas, but the building's limited windows prevent the inhabitants from seeing either area.</p>\n<p>The characters can enter the mill through the door or window near the water wheel (area @UUID[.TUIhmIH5xrQI1dEr]{U3}). A character who can climb or fly can enter through the crane bay or the roof near the mill's top floor (area @UUID[.zneKNe7rzRvTe4ye]{U7}). A creature without a climbing speed or climbing equipment can climb the mill's outside wall with a successful [[/skill athletics 15]] check.</p>\n<h2>Alerting the Mill</h2>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, the inhabitants of the mill aren't particularly attentive. However, if an enemy escapes to warn Baron Uthrak of intruders or if someone activates the machinery inside the mill, the inhabitants go on high alert.</p>\n<p>While the mill is on alert, Barrelhouse Jill (a @UUID[Actor.nB1twTPs4eqf58xf]) and six @UUID[Actor.yLQHIi2aOytHcoVS]{Human Guards} exit the mill's first floor (area @UUID[.4MqMen8Yd1ZvQsbg]{U5}) and patrol clockwise around the outside of the mill. Baron Uthrak sends the two @UUID[Actor.IlRmliBawWkapeyz]{Human Trickshots} on the third floor (area @UUID[.zneKNe7rzRvTe4ye]{U7}) to the roof to fire crossbows at strangers within 100 feet of the mill. While on the steeply slanted roof, the trickshots have half cover from attacks on the ground. A @UUID[Actor.QlEsf9uhy2BP3FF0] readies the loading crane to attack creatures in the crane loading zone (area @UUID[.frZo8PIvMSqhxGP1]{U4}).</p>"

Feeling jealous and betrayed, Velthor approaches the characters. Pretending to be a scholar concerned by the destruction wrought by the hobgoblin's warband, he asks them to disrupt Varrox's operations. Velthor attempts to appeal to the party's sense of justice, but if they ask for a reward, the warlock offers four diamonds (worth 500 gp each).</p>\n<p><strong>Hobgoblin Defector.</strong> A @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.TqPcWFgx8IBu2JI2] named Kerg defects from Bloodlord Varrox's tyrannical rule, but his family is captured by Bloodlord Varrox and held in the great hall (area C6). Kerg asks for the characters' help rescuing his family.</p>\n<p><strong>Scourge of War.</strong> Bloodlord Varrox's war campaign causes an unprecedented surge of refugees into nearby towns and cities. A local hobgoblin noble, Lady Yanil, offers the characters 2,500 gp to infiltrate Camp Firefield and put a stop to the army's advance.</p>\n<h2>Camp Firefield Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of Camp Firefield has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Gates.</strong> Each level of Camp Firefield beyond the first can be reached through a magic gate. The first time a creature moves through a gate, it requires a password, key, or special action to open; a <em>detect magic</em> spell reveals an aura of conjuration around objects that create or open gates. Varrox has left clues for new recruits on how to open these gates. An open gate acts as a two-way portal and remains open for 1 minute upon activation. Any creature peering into an open gate can see the other side as though looking through an open doorway. Once a creature passes through any given gate, they can open that gate in the future by standing within 10 feet of it and activating it with a thought (no action required).</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Perpetual twilight hangs in the sky, filling outdoor areas with dim light. Campfires provide bright light in a 20-foot radius. The interior of tents and other structures are filled with bright light from hanging lanterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Outdoor Areas.</strong> Most areas of the camp are outdoors. Grass and dirt cover the ground of these areas.</p>\n<p><strong>Spherical Levels.</strong> The camp has eight spherical levels, which Varrox and his troops refer to as circles. However, from the perspective of a creature walking on the ground or flying above it, the circle magically appears flat. Every circle is self-contained and wraps around because of its spherical nature.</p>\n<aside class=\"help\"><p>This adventure has several portals scattered throughout that are initially disabled. You can enable them by using the @UUID[Macro.zcjWY9SOjmNXNcOE] macro, and selecting which portal to activate or deactivate.</p></aside>\n<h2>Soldiers-at-Arms</h2>\n<p>Camp Firefield is protected by hardened hobgoblin troops. Unless otherwise noted, they attack intruders and fight to the death.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Troops.</strong></em> If the characters capture one of Varrox's troops, a successful [[/skill skill=intimidation/persuasion 17]] check convinces the hobgoblin to reveal one of the following pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>How to open the gate in the area where the characters are.</li>\n  <li>The existence of the summoning altar in area @UUID[.NjQiirftLh6iUEac]{C7}.</li>\n  <li>The location of Varrox in area @UUID[.y3EBqWuSKjJWyqgE]{C8}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> Varrox is willing to deal with defeated characters who beg for their lives and have magic items, particularly weapons and armor, to offer in exchange. His soldiers attempt to keep defeated intruders alive, bind the prisoners in manacles, and drag them to Varrox for judgment in the camp's war room (area @UUID[.y3EBqWuSKjJWyqgE]{C8}).\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in Camp Firefield</h2>\n<p>Once the characters clear the enemies from an area of the camp, they can take a short rest there without interruption. If they take a long rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;80]]{20 percent chance} that eight @UUID[Actor.gH1DBfitnFYlKtH8]{Hobgoblin Troopers} find them halfway through their rest.</p>\n<h2>Entering Camp Firefield</h2>\n<p>By all outward appearances, Varrox's lair is a general's military tent. Made of goatskin leather, it measures 10 feet wide on each side. The walls are 9 feet tall, rising to a peak of 12 feet in the middle. Varrox typically pitches the tent on an elevation facing a settlement, and a squad of eight @UUID[Actor.gH1DBfitnFYlKtH8]{Hobgoblin Troopers} led by a @UUID[Actor.W4BXXPtkwSs99AUA] stand guard outside the tent. The characters can sneak by them unnoticed with a successful group [[/skill stealth 14]] check.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Enchanted Entrance.</strong></em> The tent-flap entrance to Camp Firefield is enchanted. When a creature opens the flap, they are instantly teleported to the nowhere gate (area @UUID[.SrKd0UeKwNynoOhN]{C1}).\n</p>"

Her trusted sages have tracked down a rare incantation to finally free Banara and her descendants from the curse, but the incantation is inscribed on a scroll in the Shifting Library's scroll room (area @UUID[.aOZqlYFTvPu8QXJ5]{K6}). Banara offers the characters 3,000 gp to recover the scroll.</p>\n<p><strong>Missing Mages.</strong> Just before their disappearance, human arcanists Brada and Micus wrote a controversial thesis on the nature of death, based on recorded fragments from the <em>Codex Mortis</em>. They left behind a note hinting that they seek to verify their thesis at the tome's last known location — the Shifting Library. In exchange for bringing back the arcanists or proof of their demise, the mages of Brada and Micus's order offer ten <em>spell scrolls</em> of the characters' choice. Each scroll must contain a wizard spell of 4th level or lower that requires no costly material components.</p>\n<p><strong>Spectral Librarian.</strong> A @UUID[Actor.hrVw12w0NP9V85be] has been spotted stealing tomes from a university library, and the characters are offered 3,000 gp to stop the thefts. When confronted, the undead vanishes, leaving behind an unstable portal to the Shifting Library.</p>\n<h2>Library Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the Shifting Library has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Academic Luxury.</strong> The library's floors and walls are made of glittering, white-veined black marble inlaid with brass.</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The library's ceilings are 10 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Chill of the Grave.</strong> The chill of the grave permeates the library. When a creature who isn't Undead takes a short or long rest within the library, they must succeed on a [[/save constitution 12]] saving throw to gain the benefits of that rest. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if they are wearing cold weather gear or are resistant or immune to cold damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Gas lamps on wrought iron stands are placed at regular intervals, filling each area of the library with dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Private Collection.</strong> The library is a demiplane under Kiona's control. If a character carries a book out of the library, the book crumbles to dust then reappears on the shelf it was taken from. At the GM's discretion, supernatural tomes kept in the library aren't subject to this effect.</p>\n<h2>Librarians</h2>\n<p>When the <em>Codex Mortis</em> shattered Kiona's soul, pieces of her essence became separate phantoms whom Kiona dubbed librarians. Each librarian resembles Kiona, a half-orc sage, at a different point in her life between the ages of twenty and forty. Their attire varies between adventuring gear, academic dress, high society formalwear, and casual slacks and tunics. The Dread Lord surrounds herself with these spectral undead, who gather and catalog fragments of lore about the <em>Codex Mortis</em>.</p>\n<p>The librarians ignore intruders who leave them be. If a creature speaks to or otherwise disturbs the librarians, or if the librarians notice a creature attempting to damage or take take anything from the library or touch any of the books, the librarians attack. If a creature attacks a librarian, any nearby librarians rush to their ally's defense. The librarians take advantage of their incorporeal nature to move through the bookshelves to attack then disappear.</p>\n<p>Once they start fighting, the librarians battle until destroyed. Interrogating them yields no information. When a librarian is destroyed in the library, they leave behind a glowing blue ectoplasm.</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Library</h2>\n<p>Provided the characters first deal with any enemies in an area, they can take a short or long rest in any area without incident.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Library</h2>\n<p>There are two ways to enter the Shifting Library.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>In the Shadows.</strong></em> The librarians frequently move in and out of the Mundane World, searching for new lore to add to Kiona's collection. A librarian can use an action to leave the Shifting Library and arrive at a destination they know of in the Mundane World, or vice versa.

She lacks only one, an ornate crystal flute stored in a display case in Lady Emer's grand salon (area @UUID[.qmf3RqAMs07hGBAm]{E4}). Alira offers the characters 5,000 gp to collect the flute.</p>\n<p><strong>Blight Cure.</strong> Tahir Zuljali, a human druid, seeks to halt a blight killing a nearby forest. They ask the characters to retrieve a rare plant called the petrified tear, which can save the forest—but this plant only grows in a medusa's stone garden. The druid hopes the characters can find a specimen in Cloud Fang Keep's garden (area @UUID[.w2PeGosFjNOTrSQw]{E5}).</p>\n<p><strong>Dreamwalker's Plea.</strong> A hobgoblin adventurer, Varnes Dwell, appears to the characters in their dreams. He begs the characters for rescue, as his physical body lies petrified within Cloud Fang Keep's garden (area @UUID[.w2PeGosFjNOTrSQw]{E5}).</p>\n<h2>Keep Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of Cloud Fang Keep has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The stone ceilings are 60 feet high. The ceilings in each chamber have been patched up, but the halls still have holes that allow snow into the keep.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors.</strong> Lady Emer has removed all the keep's interior doors and replaced them with heavy velvet curtains that muffle sound. Stone doors lead into the entrance hall (area @UUID[.xq5hcTZRMuuR9Tod]{E1}) from outside, and every area adjoining the stone garden (area @UUID[.w2PeGosFjNOTrSQw]{E5}) has stone doors leading to it. Doors and doorways are 10 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Low-burning lanterns fill the halls with dim light. Chandeliers enchanted with permanent @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.CAxSzHWizrafT033] spells provide colorful dim light in each chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>Walls.</strong> Climbing the walls of the keep without equipment requires a successful [[/skill athletics 14]] check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the wall crumbles when the creature is halfway to their destination and they fall.</p>\n<h2>Guardians</h2>\n<p>Lady Emer cares for several creatures who serve as her guards and pets. They are trained to attack intruders and to alert her to invited guests.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Guardians.</strong></em> Unless otherwise noted, if the keep's guardians are clearly losing a battle to intruders, they flee to warn Lady Emer in the library (area @UUID[.xLQFyJB06EpvdqGU]{E6}). If she has been warned of intruders, Lady Emer moves to the stone garden (area @UUID[.w2PeGosFjNOTrSQw]{E5}) and sends the guardians who warned her to patrol the perimeter of the keep.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> Lady Emer's guardians try to keep defeated characters alive and bring them to Lady Emer, who petrifies her prisoners and displays them in the stone garden (area E5).\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in Cloud Fang Keep</h2>\n<p>Once an area is clear of enemies, the characters can take a short rest there uninterrupted. If the characters take a long rest in the lair while <strong>Lady Emer</strong> is alive, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} she finds them 1 hour into the long rest.</p>\n<h2>Entering Cloud Fang Keep</h2>\n<p>Perched atop Frigid Summit, Cloud Fang Keep is 23,421 feet above sea level. The area outside the lair is a high altitude and extreme cold environment. You can find rules for these adventure environments in the game's core rules.</p>\n<p>The crumbling castle's stone double doors are flanked by two trained @UUID[Actor.mxFy5n1YfSOcBYjE]{Owlbears} disguised as statues thanks to an illusion created by the castle. If the characters observe the castle from a distance for at least 5 minutes before entering, they notice that another four owlbears patrol the castle's perimeter, while four @UUID[Actor.UH4dEEInp5AKVnSS]{Griffons} patrol the skies and occasionally visit a nest atop the ruined tower.</p>\n<p>As the party approaches the castle, characters who succeed on a [[/skill perception 15]] check notice the owlbear statues twitching and breathing; otherwise, they are &amp;reference[surprise]{surprised} when the owlbears attack. When the characters come within 30 feet of the owlbears, the owlbears attack and the statue illusion ends. At the start of the second round of combat, the four owlbears on patrol join the fray. A @UUID[Actor.0ABqZTorYS1zAcqU] emerges from the first two owlbears to die.</p>\n<p>At the start of the fourth round of combat, a griffon from the roost (area @UUID[.vCtbbfIltBcyM8gJ]{E2}) swoops down and joins the fray. The griffon tries to capture a character and bring them back to the roost.</p>\n<aside class=\"help\"><p>The owlbear statues have the Secret disposition and cannot be interacted with by players. You can use the @UUID[Macro.c4LKyfasVo84TpfB] macro to toggle their illusion on or off, which will change their visuals and their disposition.</p></aside>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Owlbears make spectacular guardians, and they're always a good topic of conversation for guests. Everyone wants to know how I trained them, what their names are, and if they do tricks. Well, they don't, and they smell atrocious. You probably would too if your diet consisted mainly of monster hunters and thieves.</p>\n  <p>— <cite>Lady Emer</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Blood-Borne Oozes</h3>\n  <p>For convenience, the blood-borne oozes simply emerge from the owlbears when they die. However, for more unpredictability, you can have each ooze make a [[/save constitution]] saving throw whenever an owlbear takes 5 or more damage, per their Pseudopod attack.</p>\n</aside>"

The oracle claims the coal will help them witness a possible future calamity. They offer the characters a <em>belt of dwarvenkind</em> in exchange for the coal.</p>\n<p><strong>Giant Rivalry.</strong> Unable to raise arms against the Sunlight Legion without risking a political disaster, the fire giant Princess Karith asks for the characters to drive Zenith Aastrika and her followers away from the Molten Enclave. Karith plans to gain the same enlightenment Aastrika found there. The princess rewards the party with a <em>ring of resistance</em> (fire) if they succeed in the task.</p>\n<p><strong>Rumbling Mountain.</strong> Ever since the Sunlight Legion moved into Roaring Peak, the volcano has become increasingly active, threatening to erupt and devastate the surrounding area. Local leaders offer the characters 5,000 gp to travel into the Molten Enclave and find a way to calm the mountain. Zenith Aastrika's constant communing with the Crater of the Core (area @UUID[.KsTA7bfBNq74yYdL]{Z9}) has caused the disruption.</p>\n<h2>Enclave Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the Molten Enclave has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> Corridors and rooms have arched ceilings at least 25 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>High Heat.</strong> Creatures who don't have access to drinkable water must succeed on a [[/save constitution 10]] saving throw at the end of each hour they spend in the enclave or gain 1 level of exhaustion. Creatures in medium or heavy armor or heavy clothing have disadvantage on this saving throw, and creatures who have resistance or immunity to fire damage succeed automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Veins of molten rock in the walls fill each area with dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Iron Portcullises.</strong> Many passages in the lair are closed off by iron portcullises operated with heavy winches. Medium or smaller creatures can squeeze through these gates with a successful [[/skill acrobatics 13]] check. Small creatures have advantage on this check, and Tiny creatures succeed automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Lava Pool.</strong> Bubbling pools of lava dot the lair. Each sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The Sunlight Legion can also use the pools to teleport around the lair (see @UUID[.WPSLlYQrqUmInu7m#sunlight-legion-giants]{Sunlight Legion Giants}). Creatures who touch the lava for the first time on a turn or who end their turn in it take [[/damage 6d10 fire average]] damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Noisy.</strong> The noises of bubbling lava, smithing, and fire giants training and talking fill the enclave. Creatures in one area don't hear combat or cries for help in another area.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Everything in the lair is sized for Huge creatures, except for magic items, which adjust to the size of their bearer.</p>\n<p><strong>Winches.</strong> Gates and traps in the lair are operated by gigantic winches. A creature can turn a winch as an action by making a [[/check strength 24]] check. On a success, the winch turns. On a failure, the winch doesn't turn, but the creature can choose to gain 1 level of exhaustion and succeed instead. Large creatures have advantage on this check, and Huge and Gargantuan creatures automatically succeed on this check.</p>\n<h2>Sunlight Legion Giants</h2>\n<p>The Sunlight Legion fire giants in this lair fight with military discipline, immediately attacking any intruders they notice. A fire giant who is losing a battle retreats further into the lair and seeks reinforcements. If cornered, they fight to the death.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Magma Transport.</strong></em> Giants blessed by Zenith Aastrika can teleport through the lava pools in the lair. A fire giant touching one of these pools can use an action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of any other lava pool in the lair. A character who eavesdrops on the giants and succeeds on a [[/skill perception 18]] check overhears one of them mention the Zenith's secret sanctum (area @UUID[.GgnKkKD7bh2KhJGv]{Z10}), which can only be accessed via lava pool.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeat.</strong></em> If the characters are defeated but put up a respectable fight, the Sunlight Legion captures them, takes their equipment, and brings them before Aastrika in the Crater of the Core (area @UUID[.KsTA7bfBNq74yYdL]{Z9}). She offers the characters a choice: If one of them willingly sacrifices themself to the Core, the remaining characters are free to leave with their equipment, provided they never return.\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Enclave</h2>\n<p>The characters can safely take a short rest in any area, provided they deal with any enemies in the area. If the characters try to take a long rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} a @UUID[Actor.bfWVYKI388DkKUb7] interrupts them halfway through their rest.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Enclave</h2>\n<p>The Molten Enclave sits in the deepest labyrinthine tunnels beneath Roaring Peak. The fire giants find their way by following wall carvings of a rising sun over a mountain peak. A character who succeeds on a [[/skill history 17]] check identifies the symbol as the emblem of the Sunlight Legion and can plot a course to the lair using the symbols. Alternatively, a character who succeeds on a [[/skill survival 15]] check can follow the gigantic sooty footprints back to the lair.</p>\n<p>If all the characters fail their ability check to find the lair's entrance, they still make it to the lair but spend extra time searching in the sweltering tunnels. Each character must succeed on a [[/save constitution 15]] saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. Characters who have resistance or immunity to fire damage succeed automatically.</p>\n<p>When the characters find the lair, they arrive at the entrance stairs (area @UUID[.3k7REOoIv7HwcA7U]{Z1}).</p>"

Zenith Aastrika fights to the death, and when she falls, the other giants flee.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Stone Block Trap.</strong></em> A winch near the Core lowers or raises the stone block when turned. When the trap triggers, the stone block in the ceiling falls. Each creature in the block's path when it falls must make a [[/save dexterity 15]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 10d10 bludgeoning average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Their stat block contains strong elements of body horror. You should feel free to modify any of these effects for the safety of you and your players.</p>\n</aside>\n<h1>Wrathrock Story Hooks</h1>\n<p>You can use one of the following story hooks to integrate this lair into an adventure:</p>\n<p><strong>Ghost Hunt.</strong> Taldrys Paleflame, a renowned dragonborn sage who studies ghosts, asks the characters to investigate the vengeful spirits rumored to haunt the ruins of Castle Wrathrock. She offers the characters a <em>cape of the mountebank</em> to thoroughly investigate the ruins — but she is unaware of the real danger lurking within.</p>\n<p><strong>Lost Legacy.</strong> Bronwen Wrathrock, a human noble, wishes to reclaim and rebuild his family's castle. He offers the characters 10,000 gp to clear out any occupants.</p>\n<p><strong>Slime Plague.</strong> The people of Eroce, a town outside of Castle Wrathrock, begin suffering a new psionic disease that torments the mind and ultimately turns victims into puddles of slime. Emeryx Caradar, a local halfling healer, traces the malady's origins to waters that run through the ruins of Wrathrock. He begs the characters to investigate. If the characters kill or drive Ithu'rath away from the castle, the disease stops spreading, and those still infected recover completely 1d10 days later.</p>\n<h2>Wrathrock Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the ruins of Wrathrock has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Old and New.</strong> The lair is a mix of rough-walled tunnels and caverns along with a few chambers and passages that have avoided collapse since the days of the castle.</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> Tunnels and passageways in the ruins vary from 10 to 12 feet high, worked-stone chambers range from 15 to 25 feet high, and natural caverns run from 30 to 50 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> The lair is dark, except in areas @UUID[.IYRL1f9iZBqwROIV]{J2} and @UUID[.pWdZYJ7qcBoM1PU0]{J6}. Slime servants who don't have darkvision wear phosphorescent algae from the flooded caverns for light, shedding dim light in a 15-foot radius. Humans of the Havoc Host carry lanterns that shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Slime Tunnels.</strong> Tunnels and passageways in the lair that aren't underwater are coated with a 3-inch-thick layer of slick slime, as indicated on the lair's map. The slime imposes disadvantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to climb, and any creature who uses the Dash action in a tunnel must succeed on a [[/save dex 16]] saving throw or fall &amp;reference[prone] at the end of their movement. Ithu'rath can use their swimming speed to move through these tunnels, squeezing if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Empty Areas.</strong> Chambers and caverns not labeled on the map are empty. Some are used as latrines by the Havoc Host or as grim offal piles for creatures eaten by slime servants.</p>\n<h2>Servants of Ithu'rath</h2>\n<p>Only creatures serving Ithu'rath and a few vengeful spirits are allowed to roam Wrathrock. Slime servants and Havoc Host mercenaries attack any intruders they notice. A slime servant's Servant Senses trait automatically notifies Ithu'rath when the slime servant spots intruders, and the olothec telepathically puts the lair on alert (see @UUID[.qDEIEBVALOVZUnYr#patrols]{Patrols}).</p>\n<p>Havoc Host mercenaries who engage intruders don't alert any slime servants or Ithu'rath, hoping to loot defeated characters and ply them for useful information.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Servants.</strong></em> Ithu'rath's loyal slime servants can't be reasoned with and fight until slain. However, Havoc Host mercenaries bargain for their lives if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer. With appropriate roleplaying, a bribe of 100 gp, or a successful [[/skill intimidation 16]] check, a mercenary reveals one of the following pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Some of the lair's old worked-stone chambers are haunted by invisible spirits.</li>\n  <li>The lair's crumbling passageways are generally safe, but must be walked carefully.</li>\n  <li>Hundreds of Ithu'rath's slime servants dwell in the flooded caverns, whose water can transform creatures into slime servants over time (see “Grim Transformation” in area @UUID[.IYRL1f9iZBqwROIV]{J2}).</li>\n  <li>Ithu'rath rests in the temple at the heart of the lair, lurking beneath the surface of the pool.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Patrols</h2>\n<p>Ithu'rath's slime servants and the Havoc Host constantly patrol Wrathrock. Each time the characters move through two to three areas or take a short or long rest, roll a [[/r d10]]. On a roll of 1, a Havoc Host patrol crosses the party's path; on a roll of 2 or 3, the party encounters slime servants. (The Havoc Host patrols only the upper tunnels; in a flooded passageway or cavern, use a slime servant patrol on a roll of 1.)</p>\n<p>Each time a patrol encounter begins, have each character make a [[/skill perception 15]] check, made with advantage if encountering the Havoc Host (due to the lanterns the mercenaries carry). On a success, the characters notice the patrol. If the party is aware of the patrol and succeeds on a group [[/skill stealth 15]] check, the characters can either hide for 1 minute and avoid the patrol completely, or the characters can set an ambush and catch the patrol by surprise. Otherwise, the patrol spots the characters and attacks.</p>\n<p>If Ithu'rath is defeated, the patrols cease.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Havoc Host Patrol.</strong></em> Three Havoc Host mercenaries (a @UUID[Actor.CmLNsO4ELVTDsMTv] and two @UUID[Actor.jbkxRrlGwyhrHKmf]{Human Knaves}) attack intruders on sight, thrilled to have a distraction from the tedium of patrol duty. Defeated mercenaries each carry [[/award 4d10*10sp 2d10+20gp]].\n</p>\n<p>Only two Havoc Host patrols can be encountered in the lair. If both patrols are defeated, ignore further rolls of 1.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Slime Servant Patrol.</strong></em> Three @UUID[Actor.vrnUWhxuDf5tP6zU]{Orc Rampart Slime Servants}, a @UUID[Actor.qaTMemgjUwf3Fs33]{Goblin Underboss Slime Servant}, and a @UUID[Actor.sXo2ci6KS2sIbiWW]{Lizardfolk Bloodeye Slime Servant} encounter the characters while heading to or returning from the temple (area @UUID[.6aW0rSX1wnjR84pk]{J7}). They zealously attack intruders. The characters can encounter an indefinite number of these patrols.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Alert.</strong></em> If Ithu'rath puts Wrathrock on alert (see @UUID[.qDEIEBVALOVZUnYr#servants-of-ithurath]{Servants of Ithu'rath}), roll for random patrols in each area the characters move through. Characters have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide from or ambush patrols.\n</p>\n<h2>Entering the Ruins of Wrathrock</h2>\n<p>The isolation of Castle Wrathrock appealed to Ithu'rath when the olothec first came to the site decades ago. The well-known ruins are easy to find. This aboveground area, which isn't shown on the lair map, has the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“A field of rubble punctuated by crumbling piles of ancient stone rises along the lakeshore, marking out the ruins of Castle Wrathrock.”</li>\n  <li><strong>(Secret)</strong> A squad of slime servants patrols the ruins, watching constantly for intruders.</li>\n  <li><strong>(Secret)</strong> Three entrances leading down to the lair lie among the ruins. A fourth entrance is hidden behind some vines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Slime Servant Patrol.</strong></em> As the characters explore, have them each make a [[/skill perception]] check. The character who got the highest check result notices a patrol of two @UUID[Actor.ceDid6bVgnQ8svRx]{Human Brawler Slime Servants} and two @UUID[Actor.6wynL9vmbRTD6zrs]{Human Trickshot Slime Servants}. The characters can make a group [[/skill stealth 17]] check. If the group check is successful, the characters can hide for 1 minute and allow the group to pass or set an ambush; otherwise, the slime servants spot the characters and attack.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Lair Entrances.</strong></em> At three locations across the ruins, a rough 6-foot-high tunnel leads steeply down. The tunnels connect to specific locations of areas @UUID[.cv9vl1rkhFCPugun]{J1}, @UUID[.IYRL1f9iZBqwROIV]{J2}, and @UUID[.CL6XoLlcVDbF1HoU]{J3}, as shown on the map. A character who succeeds on a [[/skill skill=investigation/perception 15]] check while exploring the ruins finds tracks leading to a fourth entrance covered by a screen of vines that leads to area @UUID[.pWdZYJ7qcBoM1PU0]{J6}.\n</p>"

I'm no fool. Everyone wants what I have — even people working for me. They want to wield the Grasp and aren't content to simply share the spoils of my brilliance. I make it look easy, but those peons don't realize that my hard work gives them the good life. They could never be me. That's why they fail.</p>\n  <p>— <cite>Xorannox</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Tower Story Hooks</h2>\n<p>You can use one of the following story hooks to integrate this lair into an adventure:</p>\n<p><strong>Egg Hunt.</strong> Rixoros, a secretive dragonborn sorcerer, needs an overmind egg to complete a ritual to protect his city in the World Below from an overmind's psionic influence. He offers the characters 10,000 gp for infiltrating the White Tower and stealing one of Xorannox's eggs (in area @UUID[.GP3JI7Rrgs9Rfjop]{X9}).</p>\n<p><strong>Orb Marks the Spot.</strong> Viranis Rusk, a gnome antique dealer, purchased a strange orb from an adventurer who claimed the artifact came from a voiceless talker. Viranis has interpreted the orb's strange markings as a map. He offers the characters 10,000 gp to follow it and find out where it leads. The map guides the characters to the White Tower.</p>\n<p><strong>Rogue Apprentice.</strong> Marka the Mirthful, an elf mage, has long competed with rival human wizard Basil—who recently stole Marka's spellbook. Marka believes the Grasp has recruited Basil (see area @UUID[.oAizjKDLN7fYEtOx]{X2b}). Marka offers the characters a <em>+2 wand of the war mage</em> for recovering her spellbook and ensuring Basil won't trouble her again.</p>\n<h2>Tower Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the White Tower has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The ceilings are 20 feet high, tall enough for Xorannox to hover imperiously above his followers without bumping his head.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors.</strong> The doors are iron. If a door is locked, a character can pick the lock with a successful [[/tool thief 16]] check or force the door open with a successful [[/check strength 16]] check. Each door has AC 19, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Xorannox and Ornaz (see area @UUID[.72cdNuVgDvT1XnFe]{X7}) hold keys to the doors.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Hanging chandeliers and torches in wall sconces fill the tower with bright light.</p>\n<p><strong>Overmind Slime.</strong> The alabaster walls of the tower are clean in areas X1 through X4, but they ooze a sticky, smelly green slime in the suspended library (area X5) and below. When a non-overmind creature touches the slime for the first time on a turn or starts their turn touching it, they must succeed on a [[/save constitution 15]] saving throw or take [[/damage 2d10 poison average]] damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Spiral Staircase.</strong> The spiral staircase in the center of the tower runs from the top of the talon (areas @UUID[.oAizjKDLN7fYEtOx]{X2a-X2b}) to the top of the suspended library (area @UUID[.9myKMEKVoW4UR9wF]{X5}). Where the staircase ends, there is an 80-foot drop to the egg pit below (area @UUID[.GP3JI7Rrgs9Rfjop]{X9}).</p>\n<h2>The Grasp</h2>\n<p>Xorannox's lackeys in the Grasp are separated into two groups. The guards occupying the upper tower (areas @UUID[.ziTKoMgy5WFXaoJm]{X4} and above) are the rank-and-file grunts. They defend the tower's only surface entrance and maintain the upper levels' grandiose presentation. The guards occupying the lower tower (areas @UUID[.9myKMEKVoW4UR9wF]{X5} and below) are Xorannox's more capable followers who have earned a modicum of his trust or respect.</p>\n<p>Guards in the White Tower attack when they notice intruders and fight until it becomes clear they are going to lose, whereupon they flee or surrender.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Flying Guards.</strong></em> Basil and Cransta in the talon's attic (area @UUID[.oAizjKDLN7fYEtOx]{X2b}), Vor'pat in the war room (area @UUID[.On6263aS5bL4xWm7]{X3}), and the lower-tower guards each wear a @UUID[Item.Cg1Q8b9Dljuv5bZ5] that gives them a flying speed equal to their walking speed while within the tower. A creature who wears one of these amulets gains the same benefit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Guards.</strong></em> Upper-tower guards know little about the tower or its secrets, so interrogating them yields no information. However, a character who interrogates a lower-tower guard and succeeds on a [[/skill skill=deception/intimidation 15]] check convinces them to give up one of the following pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The guest quarters (area @UUID[.ziTKoMgy5WFXaoJm]{X4}) contain a deadly trap.</li>\n  <li>The library is equipped with psionic anti-noise measures (see “Silence Insurance” in area @UUID[.9myKMEKVoW4UR9wF]{X5}).</li>\n  <li>Xorannox's chief interrogator, Ornaz, is currently questioning a noble in the wisdom extraction room (area @UUID[.72cdNuVgDvT1XnFe]{X7}).</li>\n  <li>Breaking one of Xorannox's eggs (in area @UUID[.GP3JI7Rrgs9Rfjop]{X9}) sets off a psionic alarm in his mind.</li>\n  <li>Xorannox has a secret hatch beneath his egg pit (area @UUID[.GP3JI7Rrgs9Rfjop]{X9}) that leads to an underground tunnel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A character can convince a guard to hand over their psionic flying amulet with a successful [[/skill skill=deception/intimidation 18]] check.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> If the Grasp defeats the characters, the guards stabilize any dying characters and drag the party to the wisdom extraction room (area @UUID[.72cdNuVgDvT1XnFe]{X7}), where Ornaz takes their equipment and attempts to get information from them.\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Tower</h2>\n<p>Provided the characters first deal with any enemies in an area, they can take a short rest in any area without incident. If the characters attempt to take a long rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;30]]{70 percent chance} four @UUID[Actor.cKY6fqEkyGqEHfQA]{Human Knaves} and a @UUID[Actor.nByjRv42C1ERZODn] interrupt them halfway through their rest.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Talk Your Way Inside</h3>\n  <p>The “Entering the Tower” section and certain areas of the lair give the characters the option to bluff or persuade their way through the tower. If the characters are known enemies of Xorannox or the Grasp, you can remove these options, and members of the Grasp attack as soon as they notice the characters.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Entering the Tower</h2>\n<p>The tower's primary entrance is the “cuticle” of the finger, a wide opening 140 feet above the tower's base. A 5-foot-wide rope bridge connects this opening to a tall cliff 30 feet away.</p>\n<p>Four @UUID[Actor.cKY6fqEkyGqEHfQA]{Human Knaves} stand guard: two on the cliffside in front of the bridge and two in front of the cuticle. They ask the business of characters they notice approaching the tower.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Asking Permission.</strong></em> The Grasp typically schedules and vets all Xorannox's visitors before they arrive at the tower, but a character can convince the guards they have an appointment with a successful [[/skill skill=deception/persuasion 23]] check. If the check fails by 4 or less, the guards attack. If the check fails by 5 or more, the guards pretend to be fooled and escort the characters to the war room (area @UUID[.On6263aS5bL4xWm7]{X3}) to let Vor'pat deal with the intruders.\n</p>\n<p>If the check succeeds, the guards unsuspectingly escort the characters to the war room, where Xorannox receives them (see “Xorannox's Bargain” in area @UUID[.On6263aS5bL4xWm7]{X3}).</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Fighting for Entry.</strong></em> If combat breaks out, a knave on the cuticle side of the bridge runs for backup while the rest engage the intruders. The knave returns at the start of the third round of combat with two @UUID[Actor.hmOxwGhvMJK3gYKl]{Human Trickshots} and one @UUID[Actor.XhtugkyEF945GIgu] from the talon's bedchambers (area @UUID[.oAizjKDLN7fYEtOx]{X2a}).\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Enter from Below</h3>\n  <p>The characters may learn that Xorannox has a secret entrance to his lair from the World Below. If the characters navigate miles of tunnels (potentially laden with other hazards at your discretion), they reach a 50-foot-tall shaft that rises to the trapdoor in the egg pit (area @UUID[.GP3JI7Rrgs9Rfjop]{X9}). A character without a climbing speed or climbing equipment can climb the shaft's walls with a successful [[/skill athletics 18]] check. The trapdoor is visible from the underside. Opening it causes overmind slime to coat each creature in the shaft as if they were submerged in the egg pit (see “Slime Pool” in area @UUID[.GP3JI7Rrgs9Rfjop]{X9}).</p>\n</aside>"

While neopronouns are not as common as gender pronouns like “he,” “she,” and “they,” these pronouns are sometimes used by trans, nonbinary, and gender-expansive people because they don't come with pre-existing gender connotations and meanings. Player characters and NPCs of any background or species can use xe/xir as well, along with any other pronouns (neo or otherwise) that fit their character.

The devil offers no explanation for why they require the statue.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbidden Codex.</strong> Yarius Squird, a human scholar on the council of a prominent arcane university, believes that the <em>Book of Deudar the Dreadful</em> — a source of lost arcane knowledge — was meticulously inscribed in an ivory puzzle box. He has learned Aurumvas possesses the puzzle box in his hoard (area @UUID[.tMnMihVI8zj4JVQC]{D9}). Yarius asks the characters to retrieve the puzzle box, offering 20,000 gp for its recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Tortured Painting.</strong> Ace detective Cormin Flint, a tiefling, has been hot on the trail of a demonic cult whose members and victims vanished overnight. The only lead is a painting of the terrifying Canyon of the Tower Crown, depicting demons torturing a group of mortals — the missing victims. Cormin begs the characters to find the location and rescue the victims (in area @UUID[.tFr3QHr2JmraFeBe]{D4}).</p>\n<h2>Canyon Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the canyon has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Bones.</strong> The ground throughout the canyon is littered with bones, making it difficult to move on the ground without making noise. A creature has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while moving over the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The canyon used to be open to the elements, but Aurumvas had his lackeys build a ceiling over it. The ceiling is 40 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors.</strong> The doors in the complex are heavy slabs of stone. A creature can use their action to move one aside. The slabs stop sound from carrying between areas when they're closed.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Lanterns lit by the <em>continual flame</em> spell fill each area with bright, bloodred light so Aurumvas's minions can evaluate and sort his loot.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Doors.</strong> Aurumvas and Gorgonash (see area @UUID[.UtUxcEx00CyCCOju]{D7}) know the locations of the secret doors in the canyon. A creature notices the doors if they have a [[/skill perception 20 passive format=long]], or if they succeed on a [[/skill investigation 18]] check when searching the area. While inside the dungeon (area @UUID[.tFr3QHr2JmraFeBe]{D4}) and secret stash (area D9), a creature notices the doors without a check.</p>\n<p><strong>Walls.</strong> A character without climbing equipment can climb the rough walls of the canyon with a successful [[/skill athletics 14]] check.</p>\n<h2>Underlings</h2>\n<p>The lesser fiends who serve Aurumvas spend their time sorting, guarding, and gathering the demon lord's treasure in exchange for mortals to slaughter and souls to devour. Unless otherwise noted, they attack intruders, planning to take whatever loot they might find to Aurumvas, and they flee when it becomes obvious the battle is lost. These fiends hate the drudgery of their labor and relish the chance for violence.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Let's Do Business.</strong></em> If the characters openly approach the lair's guards with treasure in hand, they have 1 round to make a [[/skill skill=deception/persuasion 20]] check to convince Aurumvas's underlings that they've come to trade before the demon's forces attack. On a success, the guards don't attack, but escort the characters directly to Bray in the melting center (area @UUID[.sxRmqEjNyagy2KcY]{D6}). A character who succeeds on a [[/skill insight 15]] check can tell the demons are leading them into a trap. Once Bray has the characters cornered and sees what treasure they have to offer, she attacks.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Fiends.</strong></em> A character who succeeds on a [[/skill skill=deception/intimidation 17]] check convinces a captured or cornered fiend to give up one of the following pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Aurumvas wears a magic crown that allows him to teleport outside the canyon to any place in the timescape.</li>\n  <li>Aurumvas put a magic curse on his favorite treasures that makes them hard to steal.</li>\n  <li>Aurumvas has a secret treasure vault connected to his throne room with a trapped entrance.</li>\n  <li>Gorgonash (see area @UUID[.UtUxcEx00CyCCOju]{D7}), Aurumvas's curator and second-in-command, despises his job.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Resting in the Canyon</h2>\n<p>Provided the characters first deal with any enemies, they can safely take a short rest in any area of the canyon. If Gorgonash has been defeated, they can safely take a long rest in the dungeon (area @UUID[.tFr3QHr2JmraFeBe]{D4}). Otherwise, if the characters attempt to take a long rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} that two @UUID[Actor.At3RU57rA4rkFv7G]{Ruinants} and ten @UUID[Actor.8SIBRUJ9d4GybIER]{Pitlings} interrupt them an hour into their rest.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Canyon</h2>\n<p>At the westernmost tip of the canyon, two identical rope ladders hang across from one another at its north and south ends and reach 100 feet down to the floor of area @UUID[.nA7hlRwYMATDAgml]{D1}.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>North Ladder.</strong></em> The north ladder is worn with use and bolted into the canyon ridge. It can safely support one Medium or Large creature at a time. If a Medium or Large creature gets on the ladder while another creature is on it, there's a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} the rope breaks and each creature on the ladder falls to the floor. If a Huge or Gargantuan creature uses the ladder, it breaks immediately.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>South Ladder Illusion.</strong></em> A creature who succeeds on a [[/skill investigation 18]] check knows the south ladder is a magical illusion. The <em>dispel magic</em> spell causes the illusionary ladder to disappear. If a creature attempts to grab or use the ladder, they must succeed on a [[/save dexterity 18]] saving throw or fall to the canyon floor, taking [[/damage 10d6 bludgeoning average]] damage.\n</p>"

When he notices the characters, Aurumvas sees them as both a threat to his treasure and a chance to gain more from their corpses. He uses his Time Is Money villain action to allow the demons to act before the characters. He fights until reduced to 50 hit points then attempts to teleport out of the lair using his crown, which functions as a @UUID[Item.MUBtAcxQNEmEZJt2]{Helm of Teleportation}. Aurumvas assumes the intruders have already freed the prisoners in area D4 and doesn't waste time going back.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Trapped Door.</strong></em> A creature who examines the secret door and succeeds on a [[/skill investigation 20]] check notices an almost imperceptible seam running down the middle of the trapdoor and understands the trap. A creature can disarm it with a successful [[/tool thief 20]] check. On a failed check, the creature triggers the trap. If a creature attempts to open the door before the trap is disarmed, they trigger the trap.\n</p>\n<p>When a creature triggers the trap, the door flies off its hinges and attempts to clamp down around them like a hunting trap. The creature must succeed on a [[/save dexterity 18]] saving throw or take [[/damage 4d10 bludgeoning average]] damage and become &amp;reference[restrained]. While restrained, the creature takes [[/damage 4d10 bludgeoning average]] damage at the start of each of their turns. A creature can make a [[/check strength 18]] check, freeing themselves or another creature they can reach on a success. Once the door no longer restrains a creature, its trap can be reset as an action.</p>\n<p>Aurumvas always has an underling open this door for him, triggering the trap. He then murders the underling and devours their soul.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> @UUID[Item.xhETRLIxkQ0djNcy]{Aurumvas's throne} (worth 5,000 gp) weighs 2,000 pounds.

The elf encourages the characters to pick up where the expedition left off, promising riches within the tomb.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholar's Challenge.</strong> Adila Bahram, an elderly human scholar, has dedicated her life to studying an ancient mask of a jeweled raven's head. She recently discovered the artifact came from Kortar, and she believes more masks lie within the Tomb of the Keeper. Unaware of Ashyra's presence, Adila offers the characters 25,000 gp to venture into the crypt and recover any artifacts they can.</p>\n<h2>Tomb Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the Tomb of the Keeper has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The stone ceilings are 20 feet high and etched in runic symbols that keep the wards of the tomb active.</p>\n<p><strong>Empowered Undead.</strong> All Undead creatures in the tomb have advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns Undead.</p>\n<p><strong>Floral Scent.</strong> To mask the smell of death, the tomb magically smells like fresh-cut flowers.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> 6-inch-diameter magic spheres embedded in the ceiling fill each area with dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Theft Wards.</strong> Ashyra placed powerful wards in the tomb to protect the treasures of the sorcerer-sovereigns. When an object from the tomb is brought outside it, the object teleports back to its original place inside the tomb. If Ashyra is destroyed or leaves the tomb, this effect ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel Wards.</strong> A creature can't teleport inside the tomb from the outside or vice versa. While inside the tomb, the creature can't enter another plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Wandering Souls.</strong> Whenever the characters enter an area they've visited before or take a short or long rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;70]]{30 percent chance} they encounter a spirit who appears as a human made of blue, ethereal light. These spirits clean and maintain the rooms in the tomb. They have no statistics and don't acknowledge the party. If a character tries to harm a spirit, the spirit wails hauntingly before disappearing, and each creature within 15 feet of that spirit must succeed on a [[/save wisdom 17]] saving throw or take [[/damage 2d10 psychic average]] damage.</p>\n<h2>Undead</h2>\n<p>Mummies and other undead guard the tomb. The undead are members of Ashyra's cult who swore to protect the sorcerer-sovereigns in this life and the next. They know Ashyra wishes to interrogate intruders, so they attack, hoping to beat foes unconscious and bring them to her for questioning. The undead fight until destroyed.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> If the undead defeat the characters, they strip the party of their equipment and store it in the treasury (area @UUID[.P6jn6jHLNJlYv47o]{M6}), while survivors are brought to the throne room (area @UUID[.zAjXLnV3xBHbmKqp]{M5}) to stand before Ashyra.\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Tomb</h2>\n<p>Once an area is clear of enemies, the characters can take a short or long rest there without interruption, though they may glimpse the spirits who maintain the tomb (see “Wandering Souls” in @UUID[.tuCj38XB3aqLMVPu#tomb-features]{Tomb Features}).</p>\n<h2>Entering the Tomb</h2>\n<p>If the characters scour the wasteland around the tomb and succeed on a group [[/skill survival 16]] check, they find the weathered entrance to the tomb partially buried in the dirt. On a failure, the characters still find the entrance, but it takes them so much searching that they each must succeed on a [[/save constitution 16]] saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion.</p>\n<p>The stone door to the tomb is magically sealed. A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8] spell reveals that the door radiates an aura of abjuration magic. It is immune to all damage and can only be opened by providing a proper sacrifice or by a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz] spell.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Loyal Sacrifice.</strong></em> The tomb's door bears a carving of a skeletal hand encased in black fire. A creature who is proficient in Arcana, History, or Religion recognizes it as a sign, commonly used in spellbooks and scrolls, to indicate when a spell deals necrotic damage to a creature.\n</p>\n<p>When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the door, an ancient voice carried on the wind whispers to them, “The tomb requires a willing sacrifice of decay to prove your loyalty to the guardian — or if you have no magic to offer, give us your blood and we will empower the decay.”</p>\n<p>The door opens if a character willingly takes necrotic damage within 10 feet of the door or smears their blood on the door. A creature can choose to fail their saving throw against or to be hit by a spell that deals necrotic damage. If they smear their blood, they take an extra [[/damage 4d10 necrotic average]] damage as the door draws more blood from their body.</p>\n<p>The door opens into stairs that go on for 1 mile and end at the antechamber (area @UUID[.D9Z0wVt46SEeMzOW]{M1}).</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Where's the Rest of It?</h3>\n  <p>We get it. You want an awesome dead city adventure. Frankly, so do we, but that should be a book all on its own. If you'd rather not have the dead city in your adventure, simply remove the stairs down in the treasury (area @UUID[.P6jn6jHLNJlYv47o]{M6}) and have Ashyra enacting her own plans to raise the spirits of the one hundred sorcerer-sovereigns from her tomb.

A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8] spell reveals that the organs and their jars radiate auras of necromancy magic. If a creature destroys an organ or jar, that creature takes [[/damage 3d6 necrotic average]] damage and is cursed until they finish a long rest outside the tomb. While cursed in this way, Undead have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against effects created by Undead.

The pair were last seen venturing to the depths of the World Below. The characters can trace the orcs back to the Terminal Excrescence. If they bring back Gosha and Gorar, Berak gives the characters a <em>carpet of flying</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>New Flesh.</strong> A humanoid cult believes that Lord Syuul's grotesque experiments will lead to the perfect form. Its members travel to the World Below and willingly undergo his fatal procedures. Following the trail of these misguided fanatics leads the characters to the Terminal Excrescence.</p>\n<p><strong>Twin Vessel.</strong> An otherworldly vessel of the same make as the one that creates Syuul's laboratory crashed in a valley near the characters. The vessel has autonomously started to replicate some of Lord Syuul's experiments, producing mutated aberrations that threaten to overrun the region. Investigating the vessel reveals a map that can be followed to the location of the Terminal Excrescence. The local leaders offer the characters 30,000 gp to find this second ship and destroy it.</p>\n<h2>Terminal Excrescence Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the Terminal Excrescence has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The ceilings in the fortress are 15 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Extension of Will.</strong> Countless eyes — humanoid and not — line this structure's fleshy walls. Syuul is psionically connected to the eyes via the cerebral processor in the experimentation chamber (area @UUID[.eOvHD6a7zsqoIF7M]{S3}). While connected, he can see through these eyes and his own at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>Flesh Fortress.</strong> The fortress's walls, floors, ceilings, and other surfaces are covered with a mass of muscle, skin, teeth, and bones. This pulsing organic matter flinches if touched.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Inside the fortress (in areas @UUID[.1Kbg7wiV3HBtozAR]{S2} and @UUID[.eOvHD6a7zsqoIF7M]{S3}), chitinous growths on the walls and ceilings contain bioluminescent globules suspended in a clear liquid. These fill the interior of the fortress with dim light.</p>\n<h2>Worth More Alive</h2>\n<p>Powerful heroes are much more useful to Syuul alive than dead. His forces prioritize submission over destruction. Defeated adventurers are placed within the stasis pods in cold storage (area @UUID[.1Kbg7wiV3HBtozAR]{S2}) to await their inevitable vivisection.</p>\n<p>Syuul's servants are unerringly loyal and fight to the death. Interrogating them yields no information.</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Terminal Excrescence</h2>\n<p>Provided the characters first deal with any enemies in an area, they can take a short or long rest in any area without incident. At the GM's discretion, Lord Syuul can confront characters who rest in the cold storage (area @UUID[.1Kbg7wiV3HBtozAR]{S2}) before they find him in the experimentation chamber (area @UUID[.eOvHD6a7zsqoIF7M]{S3}).</p>\n<h2>Entering the Terminal Excrescence</h2>\n<p>A vast, winding tunnel network in the World Below leads to dozens of outcroppings in the upper levels of a massive cavern with a 150-foot diameter and a 300-foot-high ceiling.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Flight of the Navigators.</strong></em> Two flying patrols, each consisting of a @UUID[Actor.UoALnxXgbPwgOyAo] and ten @UUID[Actor.McjHLQEgmBT0ZsLl]{Mindkiller Whelps}, make circles through the cavern. The characters must succeed on a group [[/skill stealth 17]] check to get to the fortress without one of the patrols noticing. On a failed check, one patrol spots the characters and attacks; if the party doesn't defeat that patrol within two rounds, the second patrol arrives at the start of the third round and joins the fray.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Neoplasmic Webbing.</strong></em> A precarious webbing of sinewy bridges and fleshy knotted cords extends from the cavern's tunnels to the Terminal Excrescence's exterior (area @UUID[.EEyHRs7oRdJQTZyD]{S1}). The 10-foot-wide bridges have very little cover, and creatures on them have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If a creature instead tries to reach the lab by climbing the web of narrow cords, they have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks but must also succeed on a [[/skill athletics 15]] check to cross. A creature who fails this Strength (Athletics) check by 5 or more falls into the lake of rot, taking damage from the fall as normal. A creature who fails by less than 5 is unable to cross but safely slides back to the cavern's tunnels.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Lake of Rot.</strong></em> A 15-foot-deep lake of blood, bile, and worse drips from the Terminal Excrescence, covering the floor of the cavern 200 feet below the fortress. Non-Aberration creatures who start their turn touching the lake must succeed on a [[/save constitution 15]] saving throw or be &amp;reference[poisoned] for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, a creature's speed is halved as their limbs become rubbery and difficult to move.\n</p>\n<p>A living <strong>amalgam</strong> of flesh (a giant gibbering mouther) floats in the lake and attacks non-Aberration creatures who enter.</p>"

The bridges and cords intersect the body ball halfway up its side, just below the Horrid Climb.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Horrid Climb.</strong></em> A 25-foot-wide ring of steep difficult terrain circles the body ball.

The troll is immune to cold damage and loyal to the voiceless talkers. They remain motionless until a character gets within 5 feet of the footlocker, then the troll attacks. If the troll regains any hit points, they regrow the bottom half of the body, break free of their bonds, and fight to the death.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Footlocker.</strong></em> Beneath the troll's body, this membranous, fleshy chest contains two @UUID[Item.A0CQ3ZUL53ydmHkc]{dungeoneering packs} and equipment belonging to Gosha (see “Stasis Pods”) and Gorar (see area @UUID[.eOvHD6a7zsqoIF7M]{S3}).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Stasis Pods.</strong></em> Ten stasis pods encircle the chamber: nine pods are empty with clear windows, and one humming pod has a foggy window but is clearly occupied. On the occupied pod, a small console displays in Undercommon, “Use this console to open without killing subject.” A creature can open the pod by using an action to make a [[/skill arcana 15]] check. On a successful check, the pod opens without killing the creature inside. On a failed check, the pod opens but the creature inside is dead. A creature who can read Undercommon automatically succeeds on this check by following the console's prompts.\n</p>\n<p>If the occupied pod is safely opened, it hisses and white mist shoots out of its sides, revealing an unconscious, mucus-covered @UUID[Actor.EnCRDvEP3UyMA5HJ] named Gosha. A character can use an action to wake her. Gosha was captured with her brother, Gorar, when they were in the World Below looking for rare ores for smithing. If her brother is not with the party, she tells them with panic that Lord Syuul is probably experimenting on him in area @UUID[.eOvHD6a7zsqoIF7M]{S3} (see “Gorar”), and she eagerly joins the characters if offered a chance to fight Syuul.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Transporter Pad.</strong></em> A character who is proficient in Arcana or who spends 1 minute studying the metal plate knows what the transporter pad is and how it works. At the start of each round, any object or willing creature on the pad is teleported to the transporter pad in the experimentation chamber (area @UUID[.eOvHD6a7zsqoIF7M]{S3}), and vice versa.\n</p>"

If you or anyone in your group doesn't like such descriptions, the enucleator can instead magically scan and enchant creatures to give them magical features rather than rearranging or adding to their body parts. You should double-check with a player before their character enters the enucleator to get a body modification. Make sure the character is undergoing a change their player enthusiastically embraces.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>In this inner laboratory, Syuul vivisects living bodies to create new and horrifying amalgamations. This area has the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“Dim blue, pink, and purple light illuminates this vast chamber that smells of blood. Two enormous square mouths filled with mismatched teeth protrude from the east and west walls.”</li>\n  <li>“Statues of fused humanoid bodies form two rows in the middle of the room.”</li>\n  <li>“On the north side of the room, an enormous device made of flesh contains a translucent vat of viscous liquid.”</li>\n  <li>“A voiceless talker gazes into the vat in front of him.

The orc's nervous system, musculature, and skeleton are all visible as his isolated eyes dart in terror.”</li>\n  <li>“Lodged in the center of the chamber's ceiling, a 15-foot-diameter mass of brain matter pulsates slowly.”</li>\n  <li>“Three chests made of flesh stand on the east wall.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Lord Syuul.</strong></em> Using a psionic device called the enucleator, @UUID[Actor.BAJQ8NqpUJsT3u0X] works to isolate the biological origins of sorcery within an orc subject (see “Gorar”). He likely saw the characters approach through the eyes on the walls and ceilings of the fortress (see @UUID[.0iy0lfWwuEp0oxoD#terminal-excrescence-features]{Terminal Excrescence Features}), and it's nearly impossible to surprise him.\n</p>\n<p>Syuul isn't particularly angry with the characters for overcoming his guards. In fact, he thinks any spellcasters or psionic talents among them would be excellent subjects for his experiments. Assuming they decline his offer to volunteer as subjects, Syuul attacks. He begins by using his Wall of Flesh lair action (see the “Lair Actions” sidebar) to divide the party, and he uses his Grappling Jaunt bonus action to place his foes within 5 feet of the excremus. If defeat is imminent, Syuul attempts to flee.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Enucleator.</strong></em> This horrifying device can reconfigure a living creature's entire bodily structure, pulling their organs apart so they can be picked through or recombined with something else. The lid of the enucleator's 10-foot-deep tank is open, revealing an orc's disassembled body floating inside a psionic liquid (see “Gorar”). A creature who can manifest a psionic power or who is proficient in Arcana can touch the metal orbs of the enucleator and spend 1 minute splicing or putting back together a creature inside the enucleator tank. A creature spliced by the enucleator is &amp;reference[stunned], but the psionic liquid in the tank keeps them alive. If a spliced creature is removed from the tank before being reassembled, they die.\n</p>\n<p>On both sides of the enucleator, a mass of clear psionic gel rises in a column from floor to ceiling. The gel suspends and preserves organs, limbs, monstrous appendages, and unrecognizable viscera.</p>\n<p>The enucleator can also be used to make body modifications (see @UUID[.qiotoFtBpDcDZ2DN]).</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Excremus.</strong></em> Two 15-foot-wide square mouths with rows of mismatched teeth protrude from the walls on the east and west sides of the room. Their starting locations are shown on the map, but Lord Syuul can use his Excremus March lair action to move both mouths.\n</p>\n<p>When a creature starts their turn within 5 feet of a mouth, the creature must succeed on a [[/save dexterity 19]] saving throw or take [[/damage 2d12 piercing average]] damage and be swallowed by the excremus. While swallowed, a creature disappears into the excremus stomach cavity where they are &amp;reference[blinded] and &amp;reference[restrained], have total cover against attacks and effects outside the cavity, and take [[/damage 4d10 acid average]] damage at the start of each of their turns.</p>\n<p>Each mouth has AC 10 and 50 hit points. If destroyed, that mouth can no longer swallow creatures, though any creatures already swallowed remain in the stomach.</p>\n<p>A creature inside the stomach can attack it. The stomach has AC 10, and if it takes 20 or more damage on a turn, it relaxes until the end of that turn. A swallowed creature can exit the relaxed stomach on their turn (no action required), landing &amp;reference[prone] in an unoccupied space of their choice within 5 feet of either excremus mouth. If Syuul dies or leaves the fortress, the excremus stops functioning and the stomach relaxes.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Cerebral Processor. </strong></em>The cerebral processor is a mass of brain matter on the ceiling that connects Syuul's mind to the fortress. The processor has 15 AC and 60 hit points. If it is destroyed, Lord Syuul can no longer see through the fortress's eyes (see “Terminal Excrescence Features”) or use lair actions.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Chests.</strong></em> These chests contain Syuul's hoard. See @UUID[.qiotoFtBpDcDZ2DN] for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Gorar.</strong></em> The orc in the enucleator is Gorar, an @UUID[Actor.H6cbDpLEgNvWbEcH]{Orc Conduit}. If he's reassembled and rescued, he thanks the characters. If his sister Gosha is not with the party, he expresses hope they can save her from area @UUID[.1Kbg7wiV3HBtozAR]{S2} (see “Stasis Pods”). If Gosha and Gorar are both saved, Gosha offers to join the party as a retainer while Gorar goes back home.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Transporter Pad.</strong></em> A character who is proficient in the Arcana skill or who spends 1 minute studying the metal plate knows what the transporter pad is and how it works.

The sisters offer to make each character up to 20 years younger if the party discovers what happened to their third sister, Sasha (see area @UUID[.1dy7NgLSnS0W2QMi]{I8}), who went to ECAS to negotiate a contract and never returned.</p>\n<p><strong>Legalese Woes.</strong> Berik, an orc sage, recently discovered an ancient infernal pact in the library of a major city, and he believes it may imply every resident will soon be cursed with bad luck. However, the language is so complex and obtuse that Berik wants to confirm this interpretation with the devils at ECAS. The city pulls together the sum of 40,000 gp and asks the characters to go there to untangle the contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Soul-Mined.</strong> Many years ago, plane-shifting goblin mage Gaisa Reiks visited ECAS and had her soul mined during her stay. Though her infernal contract was resolved, her secrets gathered by the devils have recently resurfaced in an anonymous blackmail attempt. Not wanting to risk having more information taken from her, Gaisa offers the characters a <em>staff of frost</em> if they can find out who is responsible. In truth, Lazivos is spreading Gaisa's secrets in hopes she will send more powerful people into the offices to be mined.</p>\n<h2>ECAS Features</h2>\n<p>The Office consists of areas I1 to I4. The Agency consists of areas @UUID[.NdZoJsy7FvxmIpXl]{I5} to @UUID[.48N4b68uZdrsh8fr]{I12}. Unless otherwise noted, each area has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The ceilings are 15 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors (Agency).</strong> The doors to Agency areas are made of stygian steel and stand 10 feet tall. A <em>detect magic</em> spell reveals these doors have auras of transmutation magic. Each door is locked and can be picked with a successful [[/tool thief 20]] check. Failing this check deals [[/damage 3d10 fire average]] damage to the creature trying to pick the lock, and if the thieves' tools used are mundane, they instantly melt. Each door has AC 22, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from mundane attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors (Office).</strong> The wooden doors between Office areas are 10 feet tall and bear Lazivos's seal in gold inlay.</p>\n<p><strong>Furniture.</strong> The desks, couches, and other furniture in the lair appear to be beautiful pieces of art; however, a character who inspects a piece of furniture more closely notices its frame is carved from Humanoid bones and the leather is Humanoid skin.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> The lair is magically illuminated by bright ambient lighting that shines down from the ceilings.</p>\n<p><strong>Partner's Key.</strong> A @UUID[Item.XoBc7JZwj20aAYrw]{partner's key}, found in several areas throughout ECAS, can unlock or lock any door in the lair.</p>\n<h2>ECAS Staff</h2>\n<p>Creatures who work for Lazivos react differently to the characters depending on their location.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>The Office.</strong></em> The devils in the Office behave politely to all visitors who remain civil. They are happy to talk but offer no truly exploitable information about Lazivos or other employees, and they refuse to discuss any deal without the express permission of the clients involved.\n</p>\n<p>If a fight breaks out, or if the devils catch the characters sneaking into the Agency or stealing, the devils attack, fighting until it becomes clear they may lose, then fleeing.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>The Agency.</strong></em> Lazivos believes that any creature willing to breach his lair could be usefully employed — or would at least be interesting to interrogate. Unless otherwise noted, devils in areas I5 to I9 try to capture and imprison intruders. In areas @UUID[.h3g2b16XXnbYHB00]{I10}, @UUID[.hYOpaSWHOUVGib9X]{I11}, and @UUID[.48N4b68uZdrsh8fr]{I12}, the devils attack with lethal intent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Characters.</strong></em> Captured creatures are locked in the holding cells (area @UUID[.1dy7NgLSnS0W2QMi]{I8}) to await the Clinician. Their equipment is stored in the guard station (area @UUID[.NdZoJsy7FvxmIpXl]{I5}).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Devils.</strong></em> Any devils the party captures are bound by infernal contract to Lazivos and can't answer questions in a way that endangers their employer. They can, however, offer up misinformation: fake details of guard posts, misleading details of patrols, a claim that Lazivos is cursed to fear fire, and so on.\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in ECAS</h2>\n<p>If the characters haven't fought any battles in the lair, they can take a short rest in areas @UUID[.Fhr4C6wrBf1eiTWF]{I2} and I3. The party can also take a short or long rest in the interrogation clinic (area @UUID[.iuL227WVjZ0sh2eF]{I9}) after dealing with any enemies there. Otherwise, if the characters try to rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} a @UUID[Actor.jrV7IWChOR9zlR61] and two @UUID[Actor.2ulibli6eeZo6uDa]{Devil Legates} interrupt them halfway through the rest.</p>\n<h2>Soul Mining</h2>\n<p>Lazivos has woven magic into several pieces of his lair that covertly leech information from the minds of visitors and intruders in a process called soul mining. Soul mining doesn't work on creatures who are immune to effects that read their thoughts, such as a creature affected by a <em>mind blank</em> spell.</p>\n<p>Each time a creature is soul-mined, a piece of information is telepathically gleaned from their mind and transmitted to the archivists in the Vault of Leverage (area @UUID[.hYOpaSWHOUVGib9X]{I11}). Soul mining can also affect combat with Lazivos in his office (area @UUID[.48N4b68uZdrsh8fr]{I12}).</p>\n<p>The information stolen from the subject is one distinct, directly exploitable fact about them, such as a phobia, a flaw, a past mistake, or a vice. It should be something that would be damaging to the creature were it widely known, or otherwise useful leverage for Lazivos to have.</p>\n<p>When a creature who is proficient in Arcana is soul-mined, they can make a [[/skill arcana 22]] check. On a success, they know their mind was just plundered for secrets, but not what those secrets were.</p>\n<h2>Entering ECAS</h2>\n<p>Lazivos has made deals with solicitors, banks, and other businesses across the timescape to grow his power.

We've left the archdevil unnamed so you can use one that fits your campaign setting. If you need an archdevil, we suggest using Infernal Chancellor Lazivos or a member of the Court of Seven Cities from <a href=\"https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/kingdoms-warfare\">Kingdoms &amp; Warfare</a>.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Shadowkeep Story Hooks</h2>\n<p>You can use one of the following story hooks to integrate this lair into an adventure:</p>\n<p><strong>Cursed Carriage.</strong> An alarming number of villagers have been disappearing at night, and multiple witnesses claim the victims were lured into a carriage driven by a headless coachman. After the characters hear these tales, the same coach approaches them on the road at night. Boarding or following it leads them to Shadowkeep.</p>\n<p><strong>Dragon's Grudge.</strong> Vizfrilkat, a descendant of Wyraxain, seeks revenge for their ancestor, but the magic of Shadowkeep prevents the dragon from entering the region. Vizfrilkat promises the characters a <em>+3 weapon</em> of their choice in exchange for putting down Rhodar once and for all.</p>\n<p><strong>Missing Mercenaries.</strong> Renowned local adventurers Zendra and Ravlen (see areas @UUID[.ZPKrktTNuodGp65p]{V1} and @UUID[.XiQYfUGebzWeKhHM]{V3}) went into Shadowkeep and never returned. Mundila Wulf, the human mayor of a nearby town, is concerned about their disappearance, as the duo has been protecting the region from monsters for a long time. Mundila offers the characters a <em>+3 shield</em> if they can find out what happened to the adventurers.</p>\n<h2>Shadowkeep Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of Shadowkeep has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Built for Vampires.</strong> Shadowkeep was created around the vampiric traits of climbing and flying; certain locations and traps are purpose-built as obstacles for creatures without those speeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The ceilings are 30 feet high, aside from those in the underground tunnels and the mausoleum (area @UUID[.Mz2VEcJizrlEHPeI]{V8}), which are 10 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Devil's Influence.</strong> Rhodar named the infernal power infusing Shadowkeep “the Devil's Influence.” This power causes unexplainable magical events inside the fortress. Only a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz] spell or permanently destroying Rhodar can remove the Devil's Influence from Shadowkeep.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> The Devil's Influence manifests accursed black clouds, shrouding the summit of Drachen's Peak from the sun. In addition, Shadowkeep's interior and exterior walls exude eerie bloodred light, filling all areas with dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Pipe Organ.</strong> The pipe organ in the occult sanctum (area @UUID[.VJNyP6bVpZb4iRCV]{V6}) plays ominous gothic music throughout the fortress due to the Devil's Influence. A creature who isn't Undead inside Shadowkeep has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Doors and Trapdoors.</strong> Each Undead knows the location of the secret doors and trapdoors in Shadowkeep. A creature who has a [[/skill perception 20 passive format=long]] spots the outline of these secret entrances, as does a creature who searches the area and succeeds on a [[/skill investigation 20]] check.</p>\n<p><strong>Walls.</strong> A creature without a climbing speed or climbing equipment can climb Shadowkeep's walls with a successful [[/skill athletics 17]] check.</p>\n<h2>Shadowkeep's Undead</h2>\n<p>Shadowkeep's vampires and other corporeal undead are seasoned warriors. If they are losing a fight, they retreat to find reinforcements before leading a counterattack against their enemies. When cornered, these undead fight until destroyed.</p>\n<p>Spectral undead haunt the mausoleum, using their Incorporeal Movement trait to ambush creatures who foolishly disturb their resting place. These undead fight until destroyed.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Undead.</strong></em> A character who succeeds on a [[/skill skill=deception/intimidation 16]] check convinces a captured or cornered undead to give up one of the following pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The location of traps in the ichor path (area @UUID[.6KdYHdJFtTaSpxYo]{V4}).</li>\n  <li>The nature of the organ trap in the occult sanctum (area @UUID[.VJNyP6bVpZb4iRCV]{V6}).</li>\n  <li>The location of one of the secret passages connecting area @UUID[.nNVI5JGo6sD0ha0J]{V5} to @UUID[.Mz2VEcJizrlEHPeI]{V8}, area @UUID[.XiQYfUGebzWeKhHM]{V3} to @UUID[.Mz2VEcJizrlEHPeI]{V8}, or area @UUID[.VJNyP6bVpZb4iRCV]{V6} to @UUID[.sR1qWWcYnUiPwfMC]{V7}.</li>\n  <li>The knowledge that Rhodar already knows the characters are in Shadowkeep.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Unconscious Creatures.</strong></em> If a creature who isn't Undead is reduced to 0 hit points, nearby spectral undead and vampires prioritize killing that creature and raising them to undeath.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Rhodar.</strong></em> The Devil's Influence bound Rhodar's essence to the surrounding region. The vampire lord is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of Shadowkeep and knows the distance and direction to each creature. He can communicate telepathically with any creature he can sense in this way. Rhodar baits, taunts, or tempts the characters — possibly without revealing he knows they're in Shadowkeep — but allows them to explore without coordinating his servants to attack them. If the heroes can overcome his forces, Rhodar deems them worthy of replacing his servants as his new vampire lieutenants.\n</p>\n<p>Rhodar confronts the characters at the time and place of his choosing (see “Confrontation with Rhodar” below).</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While we drink blood, specters, wraiths, and other dead creatures without form feed on a different lifeforce. Some say it is energy drawn from the souls of the living these ghosts pass through. Other sages take a more tangible approach, claiming the spirits siphon the warmth needed to survive from the bodies of mortals. Whatever the case, these undead have no interest in feeding on vampires, and therefore make perfect companions.</p>\n  <p>— <cite>Count Rhodar von Glauer</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Confrontation with Rhodar</h2>\n<p>The final confrontation with Rhodar is designed to be epic and cinematic. Consider using Rhodar's communications with the characters as they explore Shadowkeep to increase their disdain for him before the encounter. Once the characters defeat all the vampires and vampire spawn in Shadowkeep — or if they try to leave the mountain before doing so — the GM can begin the confrontation with @UUID[Actor.saJzilrk4WCmIz39]. The following events precede the battle:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The Devil's Influence extinguishes the red light shed by the walls, plunging Shadowkeep into darkness.</li>\n  <li>The angelic face on the pipe organ in the occult sanctum (area @UUID[.VJNyP6bVpZb4iRCV]{V6}) weeps bloody tears as the instrument plays frantic, dreadful music.</li>\n  <li>Rhodar appears at a location of the GM's choice and initiates combat with the characters. The war room (area @UUID[.XiQYfUGebzWeKhHM]{V3}), the vault (area @UUID[.nNVI5JGo6sD0ha0J]{V5}), and the occult sanctum (area @UUID[.VJNyP6bVpZb4iRCV]{V6}) are excellent locations for this showdown.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Resting in Shadowkeep</h2>\n<p>Provided the characters first deal with any enemies in that area, they can take a short or long rest in areas @UUID[.nNVI5JGo6sD0ha0J]{V5} and @UUID[.Mz2VEcJizrlEHPeI]{V8}. Otherwise, if the characters attempt to rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} three @UUID[Actor.t0bsaNZ3UJ3xIniJ] interrupt them halfway through their rest.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Lair Actions</h3>\n  <p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.features.Item.f3npSixLe1ws5UCM inline]</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Entering Shadowkeep</h2>\n<p>Shadowkeep rests 27,666 feet above sea level atop the snow-tipped summit of Drachen's Peak, hidden by black clouds.

The hag is referring to Zendra in the war room (area @UUID[.XiQYfUGebzWeKhHM]{V3}).

A character who teleports across the threshold doesn't trigger this effect.

The blood splatter leaves an indelible stain that can't be washed or removed except by a <em>cure ailment</em> power of 4th order or higher, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk] spell, or a similar effect.

Brynmor Stonedancer, matriarch of a nearby dwarf settlement, asks the characters to stop the dragon before the cold reaches their homes within the mountain. If the characters put down the dragon, Brynmor rewards them with a <em>hammer of thunderbolts</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Wraiths.</strong> Spectral dragons are terrorizing the region surrounding Durixaviinox's Rest, causing chaos and panic. Those who know Draconic say the spirits lament the demise of their lost city and herald the return of the Ruined Providence. Local leaders offer the characters @UUID[Item.WTARU3qpHO35W9Du]{twenty magnificent diamonds} (worth 5,000 gp each) for delving into Durixaviinox's Rest and obtaining the dragon's head.</p>\n<p><strong>Rival Cult.</strong> A cult dedicated to one of Durixaviinox's draconic rivals (either Qazyldrath or Yserthrax) seeks the characters' assistance to make sure the Ruined Providence never rises again. The cultists claim that a war among the dragons would devastate the Mundane World.</p>\n<h2>Durixaviinox's Rest Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of Durixaviinox's Rest has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> Ceilings are 70 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Extreme Cold.</strong> At the end of each hour a creature spends in the lair, they must succeed on a [[/save constitution 15]] saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. Creatures who are wearing cold weather clothing or who have resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on this save.</p>\n<p><strong>Frigid Lakes.</strong> The lakes are 50 feet deep. When a creature starts their turn in a lake, they take [[/damage 4d6 cold average]] damage. Cold weather clothing that is wet grants its wearer no benefit against extreme cold until the clothing is removed and dried by a fire or other heat source for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Icy Surfaces.</strong> Every surface is covered in ice. A creature who moves more than half their speed while climbing or walking on the ice must succeed on a [[/skill acrobatics 15]] check or fall &amp;reference[prone] at the end of their movement. A creature who can ignore the effects of difficult terrain composed of ice succeeds automatically. A creature without climbing equipment must succeed on a [[/skill athletics 22]] check to climb the walls. Creatures who live in the lair are used to the icy surfaces, and can move normally over them without needing to make an ability check.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> There are no light sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Traps and Portal.</strong> The lair contains three magic traps (one in area W1 and two in area @UUID[.rPiH5GR6xzviTcwt]{W2}) and a portal (in area @UUID[.wclzVzpntJvu6KZU]{W4}). Treat the traps and the portal as 6th-level spells for the purpose of <em>dispel magic</em> and similar effects. A dispelled trap becomes mundane and is disarmed, and a dispelled portal closes.</p>\n<h2>Durixaviinox's Guardians</h2>\n<p>Durixaviinox's few guardians are undead and elementals who attack intruders and fight to the death.</p>\n<h2>Resting in Durixaviinox's Rest</h2>\n<p>After dealing with any enemies in an area, the characters can take a short rest there without interruption. If the characters take a long rest while @UUID[Actor.AdZ3Ci4t3WPh8mxh] is alive and in the lair, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;70]]{30 percent chance} he finds them [[/r 1d6]] hours into the rest.</p>\n<h2>Entering Durixaviinox's Rest</h2>\n<p>A creature must succeed on a [[/skill survival 20]] check to find the mountain cave that leads to Durixaviinox's Rest. On a failed check, the creature can't find the cave and can't try again for 24 hours. Each day the characters spend searching the mountains for the lair entrance, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;70]]{30 percent chance} that [[/r 1d4 + 2]] @UUID[Actor.PH9mgoye1a1TUWnN]{Trolls} who have immunity to cold damage find the party and attack.</p>\n<p>Once the characters find the cave, they must move through a 20-foot-wide, 40-foot-tall tunnel for 6 miles as it twists and turns, descending into the earth. This tunnel ends at the top of the chasm (area @UUID[.ZrkW2mJfkPYy8yOG]{W1}).</p>"

Dealing 5 or more fire damage to a 5-foot square of snow melts it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Freezing Runes Trap.</strong></em> A 5-foot-wide band of Draconic runes is carved into the floor beneath the snow. The band starts 10 feet away from the north wall and extends to 10 feet away from the south wall. A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8] spell reveals the runes' aura of evocation magic.\n</p>\n<p>A creature who removes the snow from the runes can see how far the runes extend but must succeed on a [[/skill sleightofhand 15]] check or activate the trap.</p>\n<p>When a creature who isn't Durixaviinox walks, flies, or otherwise crosses over the runes, the trap triggers. The triggering creature must make a [[/save constitution 18]] saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 6d8 cold average]] damage and is &amp;reference[restrained] by ice. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained. While restrained by ice, a creature takes [[/damage 3d8 cold average]] damage at the start of each of their turns. The ice has AC 17, 27 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. When the ice is reduced to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to the restrained creature, and they are no longer restrained.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Spear Trap.</strong></em> Characters who examine the ceiling and succeed on a [[/skill investigation 18]] check notice that 2-inch-diameter holes dot the stone on the other side of the ice.\n</p>\n<p>A thin tripwire made from the strong web of a fey spider runs north to south across the room at a height of 6 inches, buried in the snow. A creature who moves the snow around the tripwire must succeed on a [[/skill sleightofhand 15]] check or activate the trap.</p>\n<p>If the snow is cleared, a creature must succeed on a [[/skill investigation 20]] check to notice the wire. Once the wire is noticed, it is easily avoided. A creature who cuts the wire must succeed on a [[/tool thief 20]] check or trigger the trap.</p>\n<p>When the trap triggers, spears break through the ice and rain down from the ceiling, attacking each creature in the room on initiative count 20 for 1 minute. Each time the trap attacks, make a [[/attack formula=\"10\"]] ranged attack roll against each creature in the room. On a hit, a spear deals [[/damage 2d12 piercing average]] damage.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Freezing Wind Trap.</strong></em> A @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8] spell reveals the pillars' auras of evocation magic. Creatures who examine the pillars and succeed on a [[/skill arcana 22]] check realize the dragon images are cleverly shaped arcane runes that trigger a trap when a creature who isn't Durixaviinox passes between the pillars. A creature can knock over one of the pillars and disarm the trap with a successful [[/skill athletics 20]] check. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\n</p>\n<p>When the trap triggers, a blast of freezing wind rushes out from the pillars toward the west side of the room. The creature who triggered the trap and each creature in the chamber must make a [[/save strength 18]] saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 6d8 cold average]] damage, is knocked &amp;reference[prone], and is blown directly backward until they reach the chamber's west wall (which may trigger other traps in the room). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage, isn't knocked prone, and isn't moved.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Monument to Death.</strong></em> Characters who succeed on a [[/skill history 15]] check know the chamber's icy walls contain artifacts and people of Vexinoth. Durixaviinox created this grim display as a monument to a happier time in his life.\n</p>\n<p>Galithor, a @UUID[Actor.JRBW8m8jn9KMcMSp], is &amp;reference[incapacitated] and &amp;reference[restrained] by the ice on the walls. Creatures who examine the walls and succeed on a [[/skill perception 18]] check notice Galithor's eyes darting around the room and following creatures. A creature who can see Galithor and succeeds on a [[/skill insight 22]] check senses he means the characters no harm and is pleading with his eyes to be freed.</p>\n<p>A creature wielding a bludgeoning weapon, piercing weapon, or artisan's tools that include an awl, a hammer, a pick, or similar item, can free Galithor from the ice as an action. In thanks for his freedom, Galithor tells the characters about the freezing runes trap and offers to help them battle Durixaviinox. He doesn't know about the other traps because no intruder has ever made it beyond the first.</p>\n<p>Galithor has been trapped so long, he doesn't remember much about his life before Durixaviinox sealed him in the wall.

The scholars made a breakthrough discovery linking an acid lake — the entrance to the Coronal Hollow — with this phenomenon. They ask the characters to venture into the lake and investigate.</p>\n<p><strong>Frozen Flame.</strong> A sacred torch that burned for centuries in the temple of a sun deity has extinguished mysteriously. Ancient scriptures point to the Coronal Hollow as the only place where the flame will reignite. The sun priests ask the characters to carry the relic there to reignite it. If the characters return with a lit torch, the priests give them a <em>talisman of pure good</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Luminous Exodus.</strong> The characters encounter Emanael, a dying angel who escaped the Coronal Hollow and is being consumed by shadow. Moments before dying, Emanael tells the characters that celestials and other creatures of light are being captured across the timescape and brought to the Coronal Hollow for wicked experiments.</p>\n<h2>Coronal Hollow Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the Coronal Hollow has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> Ceilings in the Coronal Hollow are 120 feet high.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Damp darkness saturates the Coronal Hollow, which has no light sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Noxious Vents.</strong> Slits in the obsidian walls spew acid at intruders. A character who starts their turn within 5 feet of a wall has a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} of taking [[/damage 2d8 acid average]] damage. These vents hiss loudly when they erupt, drowning out other noises, so creatures in an area can't hear creatures outside that area.</p>\n<h2>Wyrm Servitors</h2>\n<p>The creatures who serve Qazyldrath are all violent and malicious, no matter the extent of their sentience or intelligence. Most of them are fanatically devoted to the ancient dragon, believing the wyrm is an apocalyptic, immortal force. The cultists (see area @UUID[.6IH18YIrQEZktqjT]{B5}) and the sunlight nexus (see area @UUID[.U2hDEo73zbFEoLSt]{B4}) retreat and seek reinforcements from other areas if they're losing a fight. Otherwise, they all fight intruders to the death.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Servitors.</strong></em> A character who succeeds on a [[/skill skill=deception/intimidation/persuasion 18]] check can convince a captured cultist (see area @UUID[.6IH18YIrQEZktqjT]{B5}) or sunlight nexus (see area @UUID[.U2hDEo73zbFEoLSt]{B4}) to reveal one of the following cryptic pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“What a glorious day it is for Qazyldrath indeed, that two creatures of light have been caught.” (see areas B5 and B6)</li>\n  <li>“Qazyldrath's treasure is past the writhing darkness.” (see area @UUID[.mtXgMXQHtRnJGTWb]{B6})</li>\n  <li>“Beware the statue in the place where treasure gleams.” (see area @UUID[.Z1Ft0it2T8xqnmNo]{B7})</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Obscured.</strong></em> A servitor has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to remain hidden.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Light-Hungry.</strong></em> A servitor has advantage on the first attack roll they make on their turn against a creature carrying a light source.\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Coronal Hollow</h2>\n<p>The characters can take a short rest without incident in the test bed (area @UUID[.6IH18YIrQEZktqjT]{B5}) and the light-harvesting depths (area @UUID[.mtXgMXQHtRnJGTWb]{B6}) once those areas are cleared of enemies. If the characters attempt to take a long rest in those areas, or rest elsewhere in the Coronal Hollow, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;50]]{50 percent chance} one @UUID[Actor.w3ae8qMaBE1CevHH] cultist finds them halfway through their rest. If the vampire isn't defeated in three rounds of combat, [[/r 1d4]] @UUID[Actor.1roxIZcptKEz5dqi] arrive during the vampire's turn on the fourth round.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Coronal Hollow</h2>\n<p>The entrance to the Coronal Hollow demiplane lies beneath a lake of acid in a deep cave in the Mundane World. The lake is 150 feet deep. A creature who enters the lake for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there must make a [[/save constitution 16]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 4d6 acid average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the lake lies a 10-foot-diameter portal that shimmers glittery black.

Eoghan Kadel, an elf and the head of a rebel cell fighting against Aranac, discovers that the source of the power is tied to Yserthrax. The rebel leader asks the characters to venture into the Eyes of the Mountain to kill the dragon and break this connection.</p>\n<p><strong>Voiceless Informant.</strong> The characters are approached by Faynex, a voiceless talker who believes the synlirii working for Yserthrax will be killed by the dragon once they outlive their usefulness. Faynex offers to lead the characters to the Eyes of the Mountain if they promise to stop the dragon. If the characters deliver on the promise, Faynex gives them a <em>rod of lordly might</em> as thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>Watcher in the Dark.</strong> Spellcasters across the Mundane World believe they are being watched whenever they cast divination spells. Uzma Nazari, a renowned orc seer, traces the arcane anomaly to the Eyes of the Mountain. She sends a letter summoning the characters to her home to ask for their help — but before they arrive, Uzma mysteriously disappears, and the only leads she leaves behind are her notes and a cryptic map to the lair. Yserthrax has already consumed the seer and is enacting a ritual to tap into every divination spell cast in the timescape to glean knowledge for the elder evils.</p>\n<h2>Eyes of the Mountain Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the Eyes of the Mountain has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The ceilings on the first and third levels are 45 feet high. The ceilings on the second level are 90 feet high. See “Organic Structures” for more information about the ceilings.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors.</strong> The doors are made of stone and unlocked.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> There are no light sources in the lair.</p>\n<p><strong>Organic Structures.</strong> The walls and ceilings contain petrified organic structures (such as arteries, veins, and synapses) which allow them to be climbed. However, the lingering corruption that Yserthrax spreads wherever she goes gives the walls a false life, causing these structures to occasionally pulse and quiver. A creature can climb the interior walls and ceilings with a successful [[/skill athletics 17]] check.</p>\n<h2>Synlirii</h2>\n<p>Most of the synlirii in the Eyes of the Mountain obey Yserthrax's commands but feel no true loyalty to the dragon and won't risk their own lives to save hers.</p>\n<p>Unless instructed otherwise, the synlirii avoid contact with intruders, preferring instead to remain hidden and observe. If they are discovered, voiceless talkers with the <em>guise</em> power take on the appearance of one of the intruders in hopes of confusing them long enough to escape. If a fight becomes inevitable, the voiceless talkers instruct any hulking brains and mindkillers within range of their telepathy to engage the intruders and fight to the death while the voiceless talkers flee. All synlirii fight to the death if forced into combat.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Eyes of the Mountain</h2>\n<p>Discovering the location of Yserthrax's lair requires research or an extensive search of the mountain range where it lies. Once the characters know how to find the lair, however, the gigantic face protruding from a cliff isn't difficult to notice.</p>\n<p>The petrified overmind's maw is open and level with the bottom of the cliff face, making it possible for characters to walk into the tentacle pits (area @UUID[.eTLaSYPXOqdu6Wrl]{N1}). A character who succeeds on a [[/skill survival 15]] check notices a lack of recent footprints or other signs of passage through this main entrance.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Illusory Eye.</strong></em> The overmind's 30-foot-diameter central eye is visible 75 feet above the main entrance. In reality, Yserthrax had the petrified eye removed long ago and projected a psionic illusion in its place. Characters who can fly or who succeed on a [[/skill athletics 15]] check to climb can reach the illusory eye. A character who reaches the eye and succeeds on a [[/skill investigation 21]] check recognizes the illusion for what it is. Passing through the illusory eye leads characters into Yserthrax's bedchamber (area @UUID[.bjSu3Q1GyyPtNfsc]{N5}).\n</p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Draconic Aberrations</h3>\n  <p>Just like Yserthrax is a dragon with eldritch power, you can give the voiceless talkers and other aberrations in this dungeon draconic features. You can implement the following changes to any Aberration stat block in the lair to surprise characters who have faced voiceless talkers and their creations before and show that spending time around a powerful dragon like Yserthrax can magically warp nearby creatures: @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.features.Item.lHnij85ly4oNkvWd]</p>\n</aside>"

Hildifons believes Xaantikorijek experienced a similar disaster and might hold the key to preventing its recurrence. The historian begs the characters to seek the dragon and see if they can recover the wyrm's memories.</p>\n<p><strong>Shattered Memories.</strong> Xaantikorijek's voice reverberates through dragonkind across the timescape, signaling the elder dragon's recovery of a new memory. This results in more frequent and vicious dragon attacks everywhere. A group of nations pools their resources, offering the characters 200,000 gp to find the Voice of the Ages in his lair and learn what prompted the attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Whispers in Glass.</strong> Mysterious glass structures start appearing throughout the Mundane World, bearing patterns that mirror the etchings in Xaantikorijek's mural (see area @UUID[.anPFocWA5T9FRjQg]{R2}). The structures are the product of the Ozvarthrax, a wicked dragonborn cult that seeks to gain the storm dragon's favor and use the wyrm as weapon to subjugate others. If the characters can get to Xaantikorijek's lair before the cult, they might be able to convince the wyrm to stand against the cult—or kill him before he can join.</p>\n<h2>Cavern Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the Glass Cavern has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings and Walls.</strong> The ceilings of tunnels and the hallways are 40 feet high. All ceilings and walls are made of smooth glass and can't be climbed without supernatural aid. The glass is reinforced with magic, and unless otherwise specified, it is immune to all damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Torches lit by the <em>continual flame</em> spell line the halls of the cavern, but the colorful glass walls absorb some of their illumination. Each area is filled with dim light, and only a light-creating spell of 3rd level or higher can cast bright light in the lair. All other effects that create bright light cast dim light instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandstone Floor.</strong> The floors of the cavern are sandstone.</p>\n<h2>Fire Giants</h2>\n<p>The fire giants are disciples of Zenith Aastrika led by a lightbearer named Genesis Karmark. Aastrika told the giants to seek out Xaantikorijek and help him regain his memories. The giants believe that secrets of enlightenment are locked inside the wyrm, and they protect him with their lives.</p>\n<p>Visitors to the Glass Cavern are exceedingly rare. Xaantikorijek and the fire giants are suspicious but not immediately hostile to uninvited visitors. They attack those who are caught stealing or harming others in the lair. Otherwise, the fire giants bring intruders to Xaantikorijek to discern their intent through Xaantikorijek's Wyrm's Memories lair action. If he senses a creature has no ill intent, they are escorted from the cavern. If the creature has nefarious intentions, such as harming Xaantikorijek or stealing from him, they are attacked immediately. On rare occasions, Xaantikorijek detects knowledge within a creature who intrigues him and offers them shelter within the caverns, an exchange of knowledge, or even a small favor or piece of treasure in exchange for more information.</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Glass Cavern</h2>\n<p>If Xaantikorijek is dead or isn't in the lair, the characters can take a short or long rest in any unoccupied area of the cavern without interruption. If the dragon is alive, whenever they rest, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;80]]{20 percent chance} @UUID[Actor.AIzGTR8TPAt0ThpF] finds them halfway into the rest.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Glass Cavern</h2>\n<p>The hourglass chamber (area @UUID[.JUoTAXcb0I5gLadp]{R1}) provides the only entrance to the Glass Cavern. In the deepest part of a vast desert in the Mundane World, a lone patch of quicksand serves as a portal to this chamber; creatures submerged in the quicksand are instantly transported miles directly below the surface into the chamber.</p>\n<p>Finding the patch of quicksand is easiest at night, for when Xaantikorijek slumbers, the sound of his snoring is transmitted through the patch and sounds like thunder throughout the desert. A character who succeeds on a [[/skill nature 16]] check identifies the thunder as a dragon's snores. A character can track the sound through the desert to the quicksand with a successful [[/skill survival 15]] check.</p>\n<p>Xaantikorijek's presence and nightly snoring deters much of the desert's wildlife from approaching the quicksand patch, even during the day. A character knows this fact with a successful [[/skill history 20]] check, and a character can find this particularly barren section of desert with a successful [[/skill survival 20]] check.</p>\n<p>A creature transported by the quicksand portal falls from the ceiling of the hourglass chamber (area @UUID[.JUoTAXcb0I5gLadp]{R1}) and lands harmlessly on a pile of soft, talc-like sand in the center of the room.</p>"

A character who examines the ground and succeeds on a [[/skill skill=investigation/survival 20]] check notices that something enormous has been tunneling in the sand.

In its typical state, the portal is infinitesimally small, allowing only a single grain of sand (along with any creatures submerged in the quicksand) to enter the chamber and allowing no exit. However, when Xaantikorijek needs himself or another creature to leave his lair, he expands the portal to allow travel to the surface.\n</p>\n<p>When Xaantikorijek recalls details of his past every few centuries, the quicksand above shifts to form a magical amplifier, allowing Xaantikorijek's voice to be heard by all dragons in the Mundane World.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Sand Pile.</strong></em> While the center pile of sand is perpetually filled, it never grows, but remains the perfect size to cushion the landing of whatever creatures fall from the ceiling. If a creature attempts to remove sand from the pile to decrease its size, the trickle of sand immediately adjusts to maintain the pile. If a creature adds sand to the pile, a mysterious breeze blows, dispersing precisely enough sand to maintain the pile's size.\n</p>"

As payment, the villagers offer the party a <em>vorpal longsword.</em> When the characters arrive, Forzaantilirys assumes they're part of the tribute and attempts to consume them.</p>\n<p><strong>Cinder Secrets.</strong> Xochitlin, a human cleric, recently translated ancient tablets that reveal a magical seal lies beneath Mount Brazen. This seal is tied to Goxomoc, a slumbering titan with the power to end the world. Fearing that Forzaantilirys's presence might weaken the seal before the titan's timely awakening, Xochitlin asks the characters to deal with the dragon.</p>\n<p><strong>Draconic Rest.</strong> Bright Akhros, one of the giants serving the dragon Xaantikorijek, learns that Forzaantilirys is keeping corpses of the storm dragon's progeny as trophies in her lair. Akhros tells the characters they will gain Xaantikorijek's favor if they can infiltrate Mount Brazen and destroy the corpses, putting the blue dragons' spirits to rest.</p>\n<h2>Mount Brazen Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of Mount Brazen has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> Forzaantilirys has expanded the tunnels and chambers in her lair, increasing their height to 60 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Hotter than Hell.</strong> At the end of each hour a creature spends in the lair, they must succeed on a [[/save constitution]] saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC is 10 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each consecutive hour spent in the lair. Creatures in medium or heavy armor or heavy clothing have disadvantage on this save. Creatures who have resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on this save.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Lava sheds bright light for 15 feet and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Otherwise, the lair is dark.</p>\n<p><strong>Lava.</strong> The lava pools and rivers in the volcano are 15 feet deep. The first time a creature enters the lava on a turn or starts their turn there, they take [[/damage 6d10 fire average]] damage. When a creature starts their turn submerged in the lava, they must succeed on a [[/skill athletics 15]] check or have their speed reduced to 0 until the start of their next turn. A creature who is resistant to fire damage has advantage on this saving throw, and a creature who is immune to fire damage automatically succeeds on it.</p>\n<p><strong>Volcanic Rock.</strong> The ceilings, floors, and walls are made of ash-streaked igneous rock and obsidian. These surfaces radiate heat. A wall can be climbed without equipment with a successful [[/skill athletics 13]] check.</p>\n<h2>Elemental and Giant Servants</h2>\n<p>Wicked elementals and fire giants serve Forzaantilirys in her quest to burn the world. These guards and soldiers attack intruders and fight to the death.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Captured Guards.</strong></em> If the characters question a captured guard and succeed on a [[/skill skill=intimidation/persuasion 20]] check, the guard reveals one of the following pieces of information:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The black rock chamber (area @UUID[.ACdne9iBoR5HwlAR]{F2}) is made of life-sapping stone, and invisible undead haunt that chamber.</li>\n  <li>The Draconic phrase to pass through the trophy room (area @UUID[.YGXjLMnqB1XnUUSP]{F3}) without triggering the trap is “Frezzelvarax my beloved, I'll not rest until Xaantikorijek the murderer is slain.”</li>\n  <li>There is a shortcut to help the characters navigate the volcano (see @UUID[.cAFFiYMP3TvXHgqu#navigating-mount-brazen]{Navigating Mount Brazen}). This information allows the character guiding the party through the tunnels to automatically succeed by 5 on their next Wisdom (Survival) check to navigate Mount Brazen's tunnels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Resting in Mount Brazen</h2>\n<p>If @UUID[Actor.5FtZHXo1Alqdw9zf] is alive and in the lair while the characters rest in the volcano, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;70]]{30 percent chance} she finds them halfway through their rest. If Forzaantilirys is dead or not present, the characters can rest without interruption in any area of Mount Brazen once they deal with the area's enemies.</p>\n<p>While resting, they must contend with the extreme heat of the lair (see “Hotter than Hell” in @UUID[.cAFFiYMP3TvXHgqu#mount-brazen-features]{Mount Brazen Features}).</p>\n<h2>Entering Mount Brazen</h2>\n<p>There are two ways to get to the heart of the volcano.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Secret Entrance.</strong></em> A tunnel to the ground entrance (area @UUID[.F6K66xwz7sNkg3qZ]{F1}) is hidden behind a lava fall at the base of the volcano. A creature approaching the volcano notices the tunnel with a successful [[/skill perception 22]] check. A creature searching the volcano's perimeter who succeeds on a [[/skill skill=investigation/survival 20]] check notices faint footprints in the ash just in front of the entrance, which indicate that an enormous dragon has landed there and then walked into the lava fall.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Into the Crater.</strong></em> The most obvious way into Mount Brazen is to scale or fly to the 10,000-foot-high peak of the volcano and enter through the volcanic crater (area @UUID[.3Zs0ztzl7vaEYF7c]{F5}). A creature can climb up the side of the mountain and avoid the flowing lava with a successful [[/skill athletics 18]] check. A creature who fails the check still reaches the top of the volcano but takes [[/damage 6d10 fire average]] damage from the lava.\n</p>\n<p>A creature who flies into the crater must fly through a cloud of burning, toxic ash. If the creature needs to breathe, they must make a [[/save constitution 18]] saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 4d10 fire average]] damage and is &amp;reference[poisoned] for 1 hour. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and aren't poisoned.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Come Prepared</h3>\n  <p>Before the characters enter the tunnels of Mount Brazen, make sure they understand just how hot it is inside the volcano and what effect the heat could have on them. The characters have a better chance at winning the day if they come prepared to beat the heat or easily remove levels of exhaustion.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Navigating Mount Brazen</h2>\n<p>A sprawling network of 20-foot-wide tunnels connects the areas of Mount Brazen. The characters might travel the lair in reverse order if they enter the volcano through the crater (area @UUID[.3Zs0ztzl7vaEYF7c]{F5}). When the party leaves an area of Mount Brazen and attempts to go deeper into (or out of) the volcano, one character can make a [[/skill survival 20]] check to guide the others through the tunnels:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If the check fails, the characters take an hour to reach the next area. For instance, if the characters are traveling from area @UUID[.F6K66xwz7sNkg3qZ]{F1}, it takes them an hour to reach area @UUID[.ACdne9iBoR5HwlAR]{F2}.</li>\n  <li>If the check succeeds by 4 or less, it takes the characters 30 minutes to reach the next area.</li>\n  <li>If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the characters find a shortcut and can either make it to the next location in 15 minutes, or they can avoid the next area and make it to the area after the skipped one in 30 minutes. For instance, if the characters are traveling from area @UUID[.F6K66xwz7sNkg3qZ]{F1}, they can choose to make it to area @UUID[.ACdne9iBoR5HwlAR]{F2} in 15 minutes or area @UUID[.YGXjLMnqB1XnUUSP]{F3} in 30 minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The characters can navigate their way back to any area they've visited (or skipped) without making an ability check. Travel between familiar areas takes only 15 minutes.</p>"

The mural warns of the potential return of Atæshia and her army. Terrified countryfolk beg the characters to find the Ash Queen and deal with her.</p>\n<p><strong>Guardian's Legacy.</strong> Zerphis, a goblin scholar who specializes in elemental phenomena, wishes to learn more about the first elemental war and its heroes. Hearing legends of the Ash Queen's Reliquary, Zerphis entreats the characters to go there and collect information — and relics. He offers the characters a @UUID[Item.DZNzzZ4WOkcR7kri] if they return with the information he seeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Portent of Ashes.</strong> The skies over the Mundane World darken, and soon after, ash begins to fall. Elementals across the timescape whisper that this is a portent of the Ash Queen's imminent march on the gods. A council of world leaders urge the characters to find Atæshia and stop her from rising again, offering the party 500,000 gp to do the job.</p>\n<h2>Reliquary Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the Ash Queen's Reliquary has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Adamant Walls.</strong> The reliquary's structure is cast from primordial adamantine. As a magical metal, it can't be changed or transmuted by supernatural means, such as the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.7Fw7Bf1k3xxDVr5L] or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd] spells. The walls also prevent teleportation or planar travel into the lair from the outside, except via the teleportation circle in the queen's chamber (area @UUID[.XADIF74PGWuZEodC]{A5}). Climbing the tower's walls without climbing equipment requires a successful [[/skill athletics 18]] check.</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The tiled ceilings are 40 feet high and 5 feet thick. They block sound traveling between floors to avoid disturbing the queen's vigil.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination Orbs.</strong> Magical orbs float 3 feet below the ceiling, filling each area with bright light. A creature who speaks Primordial can use an action or bonus action to command the orbs in an area to shed dim light, bright light, or no light.</p>\n<p><strong>Lift.</strong> An arcane lift connects the third, fourth, and fifth floors of the tower (via areas @UUID[.XADIF74PGWuZEodC]{A5}, @UUID[.qgOjWJtvuobqBl97]{A6}, and @UUID[.QQXMCfzPK1I2KNH3]{A7}). If Atæshia is in the tower, the lift works only for her. If she isn't in the tower, any creature on the lift can verbally command it to move up or down in Common or Primordial. When the lift isn't in use, a stone trapdoor that can retract into the floor covers the lift shaft. Opening one of these doors while the lift isn't in use requires a successful [[/check strength 20]] check made as an action.</p>\n<p><strong>Transportation Orbs.</strong> These violet sunburst orbs have a 1-foot diameter, hover 4 feet off the ground, and provide magical transportation between the first three floors of the reliquary (via areas @UUID[.pOr5UWs52iQ7uqtd]{A2}, @UUID[.JlOk3mxC1gS3qy8Q]{A3}, and @UUID[.hVf9S2r9561htMle]{A4}). The transportation orbs are immune to all damage. A creature can touch an orb (no action required) to teleport one floor in a direction determined by the orb's appearance: a rising sun for up, or a three-quarters eclipse for down. When a creature moves up a floor, they arrive within 5 feet of the new floor's down orb, and vice versa. Transporting from the second to the third floor (from area @UUID[.JlOk3mxC1gS3qy8Q]{A3} to @UUID[.hVf9S2r9561htMle]{A4}) also requires a command word — <em>Kitseth</em>, the name of an ancient fire elemental (see area @UUID[.XADIF74PGWuZEodC]{A5}). The command word can be learned by casting an @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH] spell on an orb or by spending 1 hour touching an orb during a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Guardians</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, the elemental guardians demand intruders leave the premises and treat mortals with open suspicion. This isn't Atæshia's court. She expects no envoys, and there is no reason for a mortal's casual presence. If a warning is ignored, the guardians fight to the death to defend their queen, secure in the knowledge that Atæshia can resurrect them. They also prioritize alerting Meskrit (see area @UUID[.hVf9S2r9561htMle]{A4}) or Atæshia (see the “Atæshia's Vigil” sidebar) to intruders.</p>\n<p>Individual descriptions note how the elementals act toward characters they don't know. If the characters are known enemies of Atæshia, the elementals attack as soon as they notice them.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> If the guardians defeat the characters, the elementals don't kill them. Instead, Meskrit alerts Atæshia, who locks them in the empty preserver fields in the preservation vaults (area @UUID[.QQXMCfzPK1I2KNH3]{A7}).\n</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Sapient Elementals</h3>\n  <p>The elementals in the Ash Queen's Reliquary are sapient beings who live and fight together as a band. They have a rich history, hold grudges, and experience emotions just like humans do. Other elementals, called motes, exist in the timescape as well. Motes think and behave the way most experienced gamers expect when they hear the word “elemental.”</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Resting in the Reliquary</h2>\n<p>The first time the characters try to rest within the reliquary while Meskrit, a @UUID[Actor.yGNKX11r3JD8p7Ou], is alive (see area @UUID[.hVf9S2r9561htMle]{A4}), he detects them using his Visceral Sight trait. Meskrit alerts all the reliquary's guardians to watch out for the intruders, then he goes to face the characters accompanied by Nayrin, a @UUID[Actor.0PowSxo1lOqSCJCP] (see area @UUID[.hVf9S2r9561htMle]{A4}).</p>\n<p>If Meskrit doesn't know the characters or their motivations, he respectfully asks why the characters are in the reliquary. Meskrit is earnest, but if the characters seek a relic or if they have killed any elementals in the tower, he ultimately has no option but to oppose their further ascent. He asks them to leave but offers for them to rest where they are for 1 hour first. If the characters then try to take a second rest while Meskrit is alive, he alerts Atæshia to their presence. She relocates the lair's hoard elsewhere via the teleportation circle in the queen's chamber (area @UUID[.XADIF74PGWuZEodC]{A5}), then she prepares to meet the characters in battle.</p>\n<p>If the characters seek an audience with Atæshia, they must provide Meskrit with an urgent reason and make a [[/skill skill=intimidation/persuasion 25]] check. On a success, he contacts @UUID[Actor.UyU3pjnKv9ZGcLyA], who arrives [[/r 1d10]] minutes later.</p>\n<p>If the characters try to rest in the lair and Meskrit isn't there, any elementals alerted to their presence come and find them. If no living elementals in the tower have been alerted to the characters' presence, they can rest without interruption in any area clear of enemies.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Atæshia's Vigil</h3>\n  <p>Atæshia performs a month-long vigil in areas A5 through A7 of the reliquary each year, accompanied by a band of guards. This lair assumes the characters arrive during a vigil.</p>\n  <p>To avoid disturbing their queen, guardians instead alert the vanguard, Meskrit (see area @UUID[.hVf9S2r9561htMle]{A4}), who performs a 1-minute ritual to communicate telepathically with Atæshia. The queen has deemed this method the most respectful way to contact her during her vigil, though it's only to be used in dire circumstances.</p>\n  <p>If the characters arrive while Atæshia is away, the guardians try to alert her to the attack via the communion orb in the study (area @UUID[.hVf9S2r9561htMle]{A4}). She arrives via the teleportation circle in the queen's chamber (area A5) [[/r 1d10]] minutes later with her retinue and goes to confront the characters.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Entering the Reliquary</h2>\n<p>The main way inside is the guarded door on the Ashen Approach (area @UUID[.NunAJhaBQpqNd8FA]{A1}). The characters could also discover the sigil sequence to the teleportation circle in the queen's chamber (area @UUID[.XADIF74PGWuZEodC]{A5}).</p>"

The pair are content to idly chat with travelers, but they eventually ask what the characters want.\n</p>\n<p>Dorik, a @UUID[Actor.rA5J66qcGdeHGBSv], uses their Earth Glide trait to hide in the ground.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p><p>The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.</p><p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends.

A circle of druids believes the treants are being corrupted by an unnatural magic emanating from the Boughs of Eternity. The druids ask the characters to investigate. If the characters destroy Vairae's soulstone — the cause of this magic — the druids give them a <em>ring of invisibility</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbidden Knowledge.</strong> Rysaen, an elf and Vairae's former apprentice, asks the characters to steal a dangerous spellbook from the library of the Boughs of Eternity (area @UUID[.KF5q6YK7GOaZhzJ4]{L5}). Unaware of the High Mage's true nature, Rysaen believes the adventure to be a simple heist. She just wants the book, and she tells the characters of other objects of power within the tower that they can keep for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Unraveling History.</strong> Eruvel Sennat, an elf scribe from Gael Wode, recently stumbled across ancient records that hint at Vairae's lichdom. Eruvel asks the party to investigate his findings — and if true, to put down the lich. If the characters do the deed, Eruvel gives them a <em>luck blade</em> for their trouble.</p>\n<h2>Tower Features</h2>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each area of the Boughs of Eternity has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The vaulted halls of Vairae's tower have 30-foot-high ceilings.</p>\n<p><strong>Doors.</strong> All doors are made from exquisitely decorated adamantine. They are 10 feet high and 1 foot thick.</p>\n<p><strong>Illumination.</strong> On the bottom three levels of the tower (areas @UUID[.JeeAfPNd0wfSnzFm]{L1}-@UUID[.KjxIRlC3pNHOfOI1]{L6}), glowing flowers grow from the walls, filling each area with bright light. On the top level of the tower (areas @UUID[.06aDIIweV8mRxP5l]{L7}-@UUID[.b1AvMz0Ll0H0cDHf]{L9}), icy crystals take the place of the flowers, filling each area with dim light.</p>\n<p><strong>Living Tower.</strong> The tower's ceilings, walls, and floors are shaped from living wood and foliage. Any damaged walls and floors immediately regrow and repair themselves at the start of the next turn of the creature who damaged them.</p>\n<p><strong>Noise.</strong> Vairae has designed their tower to prevent travel of sound, both to ensure a productive study environment and prevent eavesdropping. Creatures in one area can't hear creatures outside that area.</p>\n<p><strong>Protective Ward.</strong> Except for Vairae, creatures can't teleport into the tower from outside it or pass through the tower doors or walls using supernatural means (such as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd] spell).</p>\n<h2>High Mage's Retinue</h2>\n<p>Vairae keeps a retinue of fiendish soldiers who are vigilant against intruders. The guards attack with military precision, cooperating to the best of their ability. Characters who present themselves at the antechamber with appropriate pageantry are treated as honored guests — though they aren't permitted to explore beyond the Spring Gallery (area @UUID[.Dzc0YXdsSbkLRC3V]{L2}) without the High Mage's permission.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Illusions of Grandeur.</strong></em> Vairae takes great care to maintain their reputation as High Mage of Gael Wode. To hide their nature from guests, Vairae's guards are magically disguised to look like the finest elven soldiers by a permanent @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.mbFw57uyfLkyiw5k] spell (save DC 22).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Bound Devils.</strong></em> The devil soldiers in Vairae's retinue are magically bound to serve the lich to the utter end. If the magic circle in the mortuary (area @UUID[.KjxIRlC3pNHOfOI1]{L6}) is dispelled or destroyed, a character can attempt to convince a member of Vairae's retinue to betray the lich with a [[/skill skill=deception/intimidation/persuasion 25]] check. On a successful check, the devil stops battling the characters, but won't directly act against Vairae. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the devil informs the character about the secret door in the autumn library (area @UUID[.KF5q6YK7GOaZhzJ4]{L5}) or provides one of the passwords to open the soulstone sanctum (area @UUID[.4okAWT9BsIAsuu4E]{L8}).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Defeated Characters.</strong></em> Vairae instructs their soldiers to take defeated intruders alive if convenient. Defeated intruders are taken to the mortuary (area @UUID[.KjxIRlC3pNHOfOI1]{L6}) for interrogation by the High Mage. A character who ceases to be useful is killed by Vairae and raised as a @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-flee-mortals-where-evil-lives.bestiary.Actor.Wo1ID8gjUFse24YQ] permanently under the lich's command.\n</p>\n<h2>Resting in the Tower</h2>\n<p>If the characters rest in an area of the tower, there is a [[/r 1d100cs&gt;70]]{30 percent chance} that @UUID[Actor.VWDyL5kf5MZ0Dj9T] finds them halfway through their rest. If the lich has been destroyed, the characters can rest without interruption in any area once it is clear of enemies.</p>\n<h2>Entering the Tower</h2>\n<p>The Boughs of Eternity are well known to the upper classes of Gael Wode. Though there are no roads to Vairae's tower, characters who have learned its approximate location notice the tower rising above the forest canopy.</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Grand Entrance.</strong></em> Keeping up appearances is of utmost importance to High Mage Vairae; they are always prepared to receive important guests. The grand arches at the base of the tree trunk present an open doorway into the arboreal tower, leading directly to the willow's welcome (area @UUID[.JeeAfPNd0wfSnzFm]{L1}), the only entrance.\n</p>"

They treat all arrivals in the antechamber as honored guests but are secretly skeptical of unexpected parties. A character can convince the dryads to grant them entry without an appointment by succeeding on a [[/skill skill=deception/intimidation/persuasion 25]] check. If the character fails the check or is caught trying to sneak further into the tower, the dryads attack, fighting until destroyed. When the dryads use Entangling Roots, they can avoid affecting their allies.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Dirt Mournling.</strong></em> If combat breaks out here, the @UUID[Actor.mX7ZqQjk3oG6mY1O] bursts through the ground to engage enemies, fighting until destroyed or ordered to stop by the dryads.

The devil resents Vairae for the role the lich gave him but can't betray them while bound to the magic circle in the mortuary (area @UUID[.KjxIRlC3pNHOfOI1]{L6}). A creature who succeeds on a [[/skill insight 20]] check senses Hanaphaen is miserable. If a creature succeeds on a [[/skill persuasion 20]] check, Hanaphaen shares what little he can, saying, “Vairae's circle in the mortuary is of the utmost importance to the wizard's safety.” If the characters destroy the magic circle and return to this area, Hanaphaen happily joins their cause.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Spectral Children.</strong></em> The illusions depict Vairae's fondest memories of childhood, acting out a scene every 5 minutes. In the first reception area, the illusion depicts Vairae at school with other elf children; Vairae raises a hand to answer their teacher's question before anyone else. In the second, Vairae leads a recital of an ancient elven play. In the final area, a teenage Vairae whispers a promise while holding their best friend's hand. A character who succeeds on a [[/skill perception 22]] check overhears the illusionary Vairae whisper, “We'll seize eternity together, Aethilen.” The name Aethilen is one of the passwords used to open the soulstone sanctum (area @UUID[.4okAWT9BsIAsuu4E]{L8}).\n</p>"
