Whether you acquired your skills through natural talent and extensive training, or have received a blessing from a divine being, you have an uncanny ability to weave words and magic together.</p><h3>Divine Chant</h3><p><em>3rd-level College of Chanting Feature</em><br />You learn how to perform magical chants that can empower your allies or weaken your foes. You learn two chants of your choice from among the chants described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one chant you know with a different one from this feature. You learn additional chants when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Chants Known table.</p><table class=\"align-center\"><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Chants Known</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Bard Level</strong></td><td><strong>Number of Chants</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As a bonus action, you can begin a chant you know that lasts for 1 minute or until you choose to end it (no action required). The chant also ends if you speak, sing, cast a spell of 1st level or higher with a verbal component, become Incapacitated, or if you are otherwise prevented from chanting.</p><p>While you are chanting, any creature of your choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of you and can hear you is affected as described for each chant below. The creature is affected by the chant until the start of the creature’s next turn, even if the chant ends, the creature can no longer hear the chant, or the creature moves out of range of the chant. If you choose to, you become affected by your own chant in the same way when you begin the chant and at the start of each of your turns while chanting. If a chant requires a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your Charisma Modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h5>Chant of Despair</h5><p>The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened.</p><h5>Chant of Discordance</h5><p>The creature has disadvantage on ability checks that use Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma, as well as saving throws made to maintain its concentration.</p><h5>Chant of the Elements</h5><p>The creature has resistance to your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage. While you are chanting, you can change the damage type as a bonus action on your turn.</p><h5>Chant of Enfeeblement</h5><p>The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved and it deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength.</p><h5>Chant of Insight</h5><p>The creature has advantage on ability checks that use Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma, as well as saving throws made to maintain its concentration.</p><h5>Chant of Life</h5><p>The creature has advantage on Constitution saving throws, resistance to Necrotic and Poison damage, and its hit point maximum can’t be reduced.</p><h5>Chant of Magic</h5><p>The creature gains a bonus to one damage roll of each spell it casts equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).</p><h5>Chant of Peace</h5><p>The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it has disadvantage on attack rolls.</p><h5>Chant of Resolve</h5><p>The creature has advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the Charmed, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned conditions on itself.</p><h5>Chant of Swiftness</h5><p>The creature’s speed increases by 10 feet and it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws.</p><h5>Chant of Vulnerability</h5><p>The first time the creature takes non-Psychic damage on a turn, it takes Psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).</p><h5>Chant of War</h5><p>The creature gains a bonus to its weapon damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).</p><h3>Preacher</h3><p><em>3rd-level College of Chanting Feature</em><br />You have a deep knowledge of the religious and your performances are always divine. When you make a Charisma (Performance) or Intelligence (Religion) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p><h3>Divine Secrets</h3><p><em>6th-level College of Chanting Feature</em><br />You learn one cleric or druid spell of your choice. The spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spell counts as a Bard spell for you and is included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p><p>Moreover, you know the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.W4Qx5z0id6da0vqg]{legend lore}</em> spell, which is a Bard spell for you, and can cast it, requiring no material components. Once you cast it in this way, you can’t cast it again using this feature until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Seraphic Harmonization</h3><p><em>6th-level College of Chanting Feature</em><br />While you are chanting, you can use a bonus action on your turn to change your chant to a different chant you know. In addition, you can now cast spells using a spell slot of a level equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus that require a verbal component without ending your chant.</p><h3>Celestial Chanter</h3><p><em>14th-level College of Chanting Feature</em><br />You have become a truly divine chanter. Your chants now affect any creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. Moreover, you can start and maintain two chants simultaneously. When you do so, you must expend one use of your Divine Chant for each chant you begin, and you choose which creatures are affected by each chant; a creature can be affected by one chant and not the other, both chants at the same time, or neither.</p></div>"

Whenever the creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, the roll is considered a success if the roll of the d20 is an even number and a failure if the roll is an uneven number. The effect ends after 1 minute or if it causes the creature to either succeed or fail two rolls in a row.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Channel Divinity: Chaos Surge</h3><p><em>2nd-level Chaos Domain Feature</em><br />As an action, you present your holy symbol and each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you suffers a random magical effect determined by rolling on the Chaos Surge table.

If the result is equal to or lower than the spell’s level, you take Psychic damage equal to 1d8 + the spell’s level. If the result is higher than the spell’s level, you can change the spell in your choice of one of the following ways:</p><ul><li><p>The spell takes effect as if it was cast using a spell slot one level higher than the one used to cast it.</p></li><li><p>One creature has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes to resists the spell’s effects.</p></li><li><p>You can add half your cleric level (rounded up) to one of the spell’s damage rolls.</p></li><li><p>You regain one expended spell slot of a level that is lower than the spell you cast.</p></li><li><p>Any material component of the spell isn’t consumed.</p></li></ul><h3>Potent Spellcasting</h3><p><em>8th-level Chaos Domain Feature</em><br />You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip</p><h3>Master of Chaos</h3><p><em>17th-level Chaos Domain Feature</em><br />Chaos favors your willingness to take risks.

This spirit can embody many different concepts – it could be another mortal’s souls, a being sent from heaven, or, at the DM’s discretion, it’s not really a creature on its own but instead the character’s own spirit. Through its Tether ability, the guardian spirit’s primary function is to enhance the abilities of the character, so even players who prefer to only handle their own character can enjoy the Exalted Knight subclass.</p></blockquote><h3>Divine Creed</h3><p><em>3rd-level Exalted Knight Feature</em><br />When you finish a long rest, you can beseech a divine power to imbue you with a holy creed.

Moreover, a non-Plant creature moving within the wall must spend 4 feet of movement for each 1 foot it moves. A 5-foot section of the wall can be destroyed by dealing 10 or more Fire damage to it.

Read or paraphrase the following:</p><p><em><br />“The world around you twists and swirls as you see colorless, ghostlike visions of a majestic tree with a golden crown towering over squat buildings in a flourishing forest filled with animals.

The scene changes, the elf now entering a stone building surrounded by carnivorous plants, a gnarled staff in one hand and what appears to be a golden leaf in the other. Inside the temple, the elf slams her staff into an altar. As she murmurs in a strange language, it seems as if the fungi, and the rot along with it, is being drawn into the elf – she consuming it as it consumes her. Before your vision fades away, you see thorny brambles emerging from the large stone building and quickly growing together with the canopy above, gradually sealing off the entire area.“</em></p><p><br />The visions last for a single round during which the character is Incapacitated.

Ingesting a dawnsight flower that has been carefully harvested grants Darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet for 8 hours. A character can attempt to carefully harvest enough flowers for a single use with a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failure, the attempt fails, and the character must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be Poisoned for 1 hour. A single use of the flowers is worth 25 gp and up to three uses can be harvested.</p><p><em><strong>Carvings on the Wall.</strong></em> If the dawnsight flowers are removed, a mural on the wall behind them becomes visible. The mural depicts a group of humanoids praying under a majestic, golden tree. The second image depicts a person holding a leaf above their head as they enter a temple surrounded by carnivorous plants. This hints at how one can use a leaf from the tree in @UUID[.xsfT7Kfs00l1ksA0#e3.-gods-tree]{area E3} to enter area @UUID[.xsfT7Kfs00l1ksA0#e8.-temple-entrance]{E8.

A character who notices the colorful fungal caps can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check to realize they may belong to a spore screecher. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also knows the spore screecher’s Fungal Growths trait and Immobilizing Screech action.</p><h4>E7.

On a failure, a cloud of yellow spores bursts from a mushroom, and each creature in a 10-foot radius of it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take [[/r 2d6]] Poison damage and be Poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature also gains [[/r 1d4]] levels of Exhaustion and becomes diseased. At the end of every hour while diseased in this way, the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of Exhaustion.

Fungus-Infested Ruins}.</p><p><em><strong>God’s Tree Leaf.</strong></em> If the characters are carrying a <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.DzptpEQm4wsqpKAg]{god’s tree leaf}</em>, the plants are indifferent toward the characters, allowing them to pass freely.</p><h4>E9. Earthmother’s Altar</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Vines and plants cover the entirety of this room, seemingly growing from a gnarled staff fixed into a stone altar in the room’s center. A thick mass of plants glowing with a faint radiance are curled around the altar’s base.</p></blockquote><p>It was by this altar the elven druid used the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em> to combat the whiterot infestation.</p><p><em><strong>Sacred sporespawn.</strong></em> When the archdruid cast her spell, she was consumed by the primordial magic and turned into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.MXGONorbWdAArwfz]{sacred sporespawn}</strong>, an amalgamation of a divine being and a plant monstrosity. As the characters approach the altar, the sacred sporespawn that has twisted itself around the altar’s base unfurls and assumes a vaguely humanoid shape. The creature is near-mindless and has only a single goal: to prevent anyone from removing the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em> and thus dispelling the wall of plants that keeps the whiterot plague contained within the temple area.</p><p><em><strong>Removing the Staff.</strong></em> A character who attempts to remove the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em> staff from the altar in the room’s center can do so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. If the staff is removed, the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.MXGONorbWdAArwfz]{sacred sporespawn}</strong> can’t use its lair actions.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Once the sacred sporespawn has been reduced to 0 hit points, you can read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>As the final strike brings down the plant-like creature, most of the growths covering its twisted shape wither away, revealing a vaguely female figure beneath. Falling to the ground, the pitiful creature croaks: “...don’t take the staff... Must finish the ritual... End the rot... Please.”<br />With those last, pleading words, the woman expires, her form decomposing rapidly before your eyes.</p></blockquote><p>If the characters acquiesce to the druid’s pleas, they can attempt to wield the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em> and finish the ritual to cleanse the area.</p><h5>Earthmother’s Ritual</h5><p>A character proficient in Religion realizes that to cleanse the area of the whiterot infestation once and for all, they must perform a taxing 1-hour-long ritual while touching the staff and praying to the Earthmother. If no character would know this, the caipora from @UUID[.xsfT7Kfs00l1ksA0#e4.-overgrown-mansion]{area E4} can also tell them. The ritual requires three rolls:</p><ul><li><p>A DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check to formulate a suitable prayer to the Earthmother.</p></li><li><p>A DC 13 Constitution saving throw to maintain composure during the taxing ritual.</p></li><li><p>A DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to withstand the mental pressure of the ordeal.</p></li></ul><p>Each character participating makes all three rolls. Tally the successes, counting a roll of 20 as two successes.</p><p><em><strong>Success.</strong></em> If the characters have more successes than failures at the end of the ritual, the ritual succeeds and the whiterot fungi in the area wither away, disappearing permanently. The temple cleansed, the characters can freely take the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em> and may receive a @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.Vy0G6JFW7QGBAF6l]{Divine Boon of Vitality} from the Earthmother, at your discretion. As they leave, the wall of plants has already begun receding and rays of sunlight filter in from above.</p><p><em><strong>Failure.</strong></em> If the ritual fails, the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em> withers away and the ritual can’t be reattempted.</p><h5>Whiterot’s Doom</h5><p>If the characters fail the ritual or take the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em> without attempting it, the wall of plants begins withering away and unless otherwise stopped, the whiterot fungi will decay all plants – including the god’s tree – in the area over the next few days before slowly spreading to the rest of the forest. At your discretion, the characters may suffer a @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.lQ2zIJu97ZbrlwCk.JournalEntryPage.EPJvW6wAPOGaCQjh]{Divine Punishment} from the Earthmother.</p><h3>Adjusting Difficulty</h3><p>As written, the Earthmother’s Temple is suitable for a party of four 6th-level adventurers. Below is general advice on how to adjust the temple’s difficulty, as well as specific advice for adjusting to parties of other levels.</p><h5>Adjusting on the Fly</h5><p>The difficulty of the Earthmother’s Temple depends in large part on how many encounters they face and how they handle these encounters. If the characters decide to take one or more short rests in between encounters, they might be at almost full strength before they reach area @UUID[.xsfT7Kfs00l1ksA0#e9.-earthmothers-altar]{E9. Earthmother’s Altar}. Conversely, if they fight everything and don’t rest, they will likely be hard-pressed for the final encounter.</p><p>To account for these variables, you can adjust the difficulty by using more or fewer of the Temple Encounters. If the characters approach area @UUID[.xsfT7Kfs00l1ksA0#e8.-temple-entrance]{E8. Temple Entrance} already weakened, you may also want to remove the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.6OFsVmpWqjuQo4kS]{razor vines}</strong> from the entrance.</p><h5>Adjusting to Specific Levels</h5><p>Below is advice on adjusting the adventure’s difficulty to specific levels for a group of four characters:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Level 5.</strong> Remove the lair actions from the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.MXGONorbWdAArwfz]{sacred sporespawn}</strong> in @UUID[.xsfT7Kfs00l1ksA0#e9.-earthmothers-altar]{area E9}, decrease its hit points by 30, and decrease the DCs of its abilities by 2.</p><p><strong>Levels 6–7.</strong> No changes required.</p><p><strong>Levels 8–9.</strong> Run at least two Temple Encounters, use two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.YH6ROkqxcKXqfeBv]{spore screechers}</strong> in @UUID[.xsfT7Kfs00l1ksA0#e6.-fungus-infested-ruins]{area E6}, increase the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.MXGONorbWdAArwfz]{sacred sporespawn’s}</strong> hit points by 30, and give it two uses of its Legendary Resistance.</p></div></div>"

For decades, priests and tinkerers lived and worked here, creating magical machinations and paying homage to their god.</p><p>Eventually, the place was abandoned as the order’s number dwindled but the powerful magic of the Maker clings to the very foundation of the sanctum. Before the last of the order left the sanctum, they ensured that riddles, traps, and magical guardians would remain behind to ensure that the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.VineP6bFmBxmhPAP]{Timepiece of Equilibrium}</em>, the sanctum’s greatest treasure, would remain safe from anyone not of the order.</p><h3>General Features</h3><p>The sanctum has the following general features unless otherwise noted:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The sanctum’s ceilings are 20 feet high.</p><p><strong>Dead Adventurers.</strong> A few weeks ago, three adventurers entered the sanctum to steal the relic. They became separated by the rotating rooms (see below) and each wound up dead in separate locations within the sanctum.</p><p><strong>Doors.</strong> The heavy stone doors within the sanctum are unlocked unless otherwise noted. If a creature places a hand on an unlocked door, the door slides seamlessly into the wall. It slowly slides back a few seconds later, unless touched again.</p><p><strong>Illumination.</strong> The mosaic carved on the stone walls within the sanctum magically emits dim, blue light. The scale in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s5.-antechamber]{area S5} can be used to adjust the sanctum’s illumination, ranging from bright light to darkness. When the characters first enter the sanctum, it is cast in dim light.</p><p><strong>Rotating Ring.</strong> The sanctum’s middle ring can rotate on its axis. It is controlled by disks that can be found in areas @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s1.-entrance-room]{S1} and @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s4.-dormitory]{S4}. If a creature uses an action to rotate a disk ninety degrees in either direction, the middle ring rotates in the same direction and falls into place at the start of the creature’s next turn.</p><p><strong>Walls.</strong> All walls within the sanctum are enchanted, making it impossible to move through them using magic, such as with the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.PQuEgKyCdovOvhqN]{etherealness}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}</em>.</p></div><h3>Foundry Guide</h3><p>This map makes use of the Token Attacher module, so that the center ring can be rotated along with the walls. This is done by selecting the Control Token located in the center of the map, and then scrolling up/down while holding down the shift button.</p><p>Please note that this will not move any tokens placed on the map, so to prevent areas from being accidentally revealed, make sure to move any tokens to the outermost rooms (Areas S1-4) beforehand.</p><h3>Areas in the Sanctum</h3><p>The following locations are keyed to the Sanctum Mechanicum map.</p><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/maps/mechanicum-1-border.webp\" /><div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:row;flex-wrap:nowrap\"><div><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/maps/mechanicum-2-border.webp\" /></div><div><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/maps/mechanicum-3-border.webp\" /></div><div><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/maps/mechanicum-4-border.webp\" /></div></div><h4>S1. Entrance Room</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>The stairs lead down into a wide room with curved walls carved with intricate symmetric patterns that emit a faint, cerulean glow. In the center of the room stands a waist-high, circular pedestal of stone with a large metal disk mounted on top. Brass tubes run down the sides of the pedestal and disappear into the tiled floor. At the far end of the chamber is a wide doorway set with a heavy, curving stone door.</p></blockquote><p>This room is used as an entry point to the sanctum and features a control disk, which is used to rotate the central circle of the sanctum.</p><p><em><strong>Doorway.</strong></em> When the characters first enter the sanctum, the rotating rooms are in Configuration 1 and the room’s doorway reveals the door to @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s5.-antechamber]{area S5}.</p><p><em><strong>Rotating Disk.</strong></em> A character who examines the pedestal with the disk in the middle of the room notices that the metal disk is attached to a pole in the center of the pedestal so that it can be rotated on its axis. It is not immediately clear what purpose the brass tubes connected to the pedestal serve, but common sense dictates that the disk is somehow connected to other parts of the sanctum. The first time a character rotates the disk, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>As you turn the disk, it rotates smoothly until it has turned ninety degrees where it slides into place with a clicking sound. The brass tubes make a loud hiss and begin to glow with bright, blue light. As the ground trembles beneath your feet, the door in front of you slides away in the same direction as you turned the disk, and the doorway is momentarily blocked as the walls of the room beyond slide across it. With another click, this one much louder, the revolving chambers come to a halt and another – nearly identical – door fills the doorway.</p></blockquote><p>Depending on which way the disk was turned, the Sanctum Mechanicum is now in either Configuration 2 or 4, allowing passage to either area @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s6.-library]{S6} or @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s8.-pools-of-enlightenment]{S8}, respectively. If the characters wish to, they can continue turning the disk, rotating the sanctum’s middle circle accordingly with each rotation.</p><h4>S2. Symmetry Room</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Two weapons float in beams of blue light, one at either end of the room – an elegant-looking longsword at one end and at the other, a metallic staff with a blue orb at its tip. At the far side of the chamber, symmetrical, glowing patterns flow together to create an intricate drawing of a hand holding a weight scale. Near the middle of the room, a young dark elf lies dead in a pool of dried blood.</p></blockquote><p>This room holds two of the order’s magic creations within beams of force energy.</p><p><em><strong>Dead Rogue.</strong></em> The corpse in this room belongs to Phyriziel, a male dark elf rogue, who entered the sanctum a few weeks ago to retrieve its fabled relic. Tempted by the hovering items, the rogue tried to grab the sword, was cut down, and stumbled back to the middle of the room before dying of blood loss. A trail of blood leads from the corpse to the beam of energy, where the rogue’s arm lies in another pool of blood.</p><p><em><strong>Beams of Energy.</strong></em> The beams of force energy holding the weapons are 5 feet in diameter and flow from floor to ceiling. The beams dispel all other magic, so that spells such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Utk1OQRwYkMkFRD3]{mage hand}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.HQfd7jJyULIoGxrZ]{telekinesis}</em> have no effect inside them. If a creature reaches into a beam to grab either the staff or the sword, the item won’t budge and a magical trap is triggered:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Staff.</strong> The creature must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw as the staff pulses with psychic energy. On a failure, the creature takes [[/r 4d6]] Psychic damage, and has disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws and is unable to cast spells that require concentration. Any spell the creature is currently concentrating on immediately ends. This effect lasts until the creature finishes a long rest and can be ended early with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}</em> spell, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}</em> spell, or similar magic.</p><p><strong>Sword.</strong> The sword makes an attack roll ([[/r 1d20 + 7]]{+7} to hit, [[/r 4d6]] Slashing damage) against the creature. If the attack hits, the creature also has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws, and whenever it takes the dash action on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall Prone. This effect lasts until the creature finishes a long rest and can be ended early with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}</em> spell, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}</em> spell, or similar magic.</p></div><p>As the mural of the balanced scale hints at, the sword and staff can be removed from their protective beams without triggering their respective traps if they are grabbed at the same time by two different creatures.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> The weapons found in this room are a <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.pXIRy8MPWpAqHHA1]{sword of balance}</em> and a <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.imBlesRUwiKdiGEr]{staff of focus}</em>; the dead rogue has two daggers, a set of thieves’ tools, and a pouch containing coins worth a total of 134 gp.</p><h4>S3. Guardian Room</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A huge, vaguely humanoid construct stands in the center of this chamber. Solid plates of rune-etched metal cover most of its body, exposing only the balls of glowing energy which seem to fuse the construct’s limbs together like joints. In the center of its chest sits a blue, octagonal gemstone the size of an adult’s fist.</p></blockquote><p>This room holds the Sanctum Key – the magical gemstone that can open the door to @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s9.-inner-sanctum]{area S9} – and the key’s guardian, a fearsome magical construct.</p><p><em><strong>Gemstone.</strong></em> A character who has seen the door in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s5.-antechamber]{area S5} immediately realizes that the gemstone at the golem’s chest would be a perfect fit for the indentation in the door. The gemstone can be pried free from the golem’s chest as an action with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p><p><em><strong>Gravity Golem.</strong></em> The construct in this room is a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.5qnIwZ3bfpi5ghyg]{lesser gravity golem}</strong> that has been tasked with protecting the Sanctum Key. The golem remains inanimate as long as the characters don’t harm it or attempt to take the Sanctum Key from its chest.</p><p><em><strong>Riddle.</strong></em> When one or more characters approach to within 20 feet of the golem, the runes on its body begin to glow and a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.7v06rdmUakoTk1LQ]{magic mouth}</em> spell speaks the following riddle in a disembodied, monotone voice:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>I have endless shapes, that each make little sense,<br />But put in order, convey a knowledge so immense,<br />That those who use me, can history explore,<br />Create art, broker peace, or even start a war,<br />So name me now and give me form,<br />Or your lives shall be forsworn.</p></blockquote><p>The answer to this riddle is “letter” or “letters.” At your discretion, “language,” “words,” “glyphs,” “alphabet,” “signs,” or similar answers may also be suitable – as long as the answer is close enough.</p><p><em><strong>Developments.</strong></em> If the characters harm the golem or try to take the Sanctum Key from its chest, the golem attacks relentlessly, chasing the characters until it has destroyed them or can no longer reach them, before returning to this chamber, if it is able. If the characters answer the golem’s riddle correctly – by standing directly in front of it and clearly declaring their answer – it bows down to one knee, takes the Sanctum Key from its chest and holds it forth to the characters, who can take it safely.</p><h4>S4. Dormitory</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>The walls of this chamber are lined with unfurnished wooden beds and a waist-high stone pedestal with a metal disk on top sits in the center. Next to the thick brass tubes that run from the pedestal and into the tiled floor lies the corpse of a muscular, tattooed humanoid wearing furs and leathers.</p></blockquote><p>This room was where the sanctum’s inhabitants slept. It also holds a damaged control disk.</p><p><em><strong>Dead Adventurer.</strong></em> The corpse at the pedestal’s foot belongs to Maryn, a female goliath barbarian, who entered the sanctum a few weeks ago. Maryn died when toxic, magical gas was released from the control disk’s tubes as she activated it. The gas was released because the goliath had struck the tubes with her axe in frustration at being separated from her companions. A creature who examines the corpse and makes an Intelligence or Wisdom (Investigation or Medicine) check can learn the following:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>DC 10.</strong> The goliath has no visible wounds.</p><p><strong>DC 13.</strong> The goliath has blue residue on her palms, as if they had been immersed in a liquid or dense gas.</p></div><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Control Disk.</strong></em> The control disk in this room functions as the one in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s1.-entrance-room]{area S1}, except that the tubes connecting to it have been damaged. A creature who examines the disk notices a gash across the brass tubes. A creature can repair the tubes with a mending spell or as an action by using cloth, metal, or another material to patch the holes and succeeding on a DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.</p><p><em><strong>Magical Gas.</strong></em> If the control disk is turned before the tubes are repaired, the sanctum’s middle ring doesn’t rotate. Instead, the magical gas that fuels the contraption is instead released into the room. You can run this scenario in the following way:</p><ul><li><p>Roll initiative as the gas is released from the tubes.</p></li><li><p>At initiative count 20 on each round for five rounds, the gas expands 10 feet outward from the control disk, as long as the tubes haven’t been repaired.</p></li><li><p>The gas affects any non-Construct creature it touches. A creature that starts its turn within the gas must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of Exhaustion and is choking for as long as it remains within the gas.</p></li><li><p>If the tubes are repaired while the gas is being released, it stops expanding.</p></li><li><p>When the gas is no longer being released (after five rounds or because the tubes were repaired), it dissipates after as many rounds as it was being released for, leaving behind only a faint residue.</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> The dead goliath is wearing studded leather armor and lies next to her greataxe and six javelins. She otherwise has nothing of value.</p><h4>S5. Antechamber</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A waist-high, stone pedestal stands in the center of this room. Atop the pedestal is a perfectly balanced weight scale holding a small, marble sphere in each arm – one onyx black and the other alabaster white. Behind the pedestal, a curving, closed stone door fills most of the wall. The door has an octagonal indentation, about the size of an adult’s palm, in its center that is ringed by a circular inscription.</p></blockquote><p>This chamber holds a device that controls the sanctum’s light, as well as the door that can lead to @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s9.-inner-sanctum]{area S9} and the sanctum’s relic.</p><p><em><strong>Scale of Illumination.</strong></em> The scale in the middle of the chamber is fused to the stone pedestal and can’t be moved. Its two arms are perfectly balanced and shaped to fit the two marble spheres it holds. If a sphere is removed from the scale (it can be placed into a small indentation in the pedestal in front of it), the magical light emitted by the symmetric patterns that adorn the sanctum’s walls changes:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Dim Light.</strong> If the scale is balanced, the sanctum is filled with comfortable dim light.</p><p><strong>Bright Light.</strong> If the scale holds only the alabaster sphere, the sanctum is filled with magical bright light that suppresses any magical darkness cast at 5th level or lower.</p><p><strong>Darkness.</strong> If the scale holds only the onyx sphere, the sanctum is filled with magical darkness. Creatures with Darkvision can see normally in this darkness, but any mundane light sources emit no light and any spell of 5th level or lower that produces light is suppressed.</p></div><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Door.</strong></em> The stone door has no lock, handle, or hinges, and can’t be opened unless the Sanctum Key found in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s3.-guardian-room]{area S3. Guardian Room} is placed in the empty socket in its center. If the rooms are in Configuration 4, the characters can enter @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s9.-inner-sanctum]{area S9. Inner Sanctum}<br />Otherwise, the door slides away to reveal only a blank wall behind it.</p><p><em><strong>Riddle.</strong></em> The following rhyme is inscribed on the frame of the door, written in Common:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Between a choice, all are torn,<br />To venture forth at dusk or dawn?<br />To shield eyes from the burning light,<br />Or stare blindly into the dark of night?</p></blockquote><p>The riddle on the door hints at the choice that stands before the characters when they open the door to @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s9.-inner-sanctum]{area S9} – to open the door in bright light, dim light, or no light (see area S9. Inner Sanctum).</p><h4>S6. Library</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>The curving walls of this chamber are lined with bookshelves and small reading desks. Several books seem to have been pulled from the shelves in haste and lie spread around the chamber’s floor, seemingly discarded at random.</p></blockquote><p>This chamber holds the sanctum’s library. The three adventurers searched the room briefly, leaving behind a disorganized mess.</p><p><em><strong>Bookshelves.</strong></em> The bookshelves in this room contain mostly religious texts to the Maker, theoretical texts that have to do with invention, order, and knowledge, and finally manuals of construction. A character who spends at least 10 minutes perusing the bookshelves can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find the following:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>DC 10.</strong> The books seem to mostly have to do with balance, order, and invention, including titles such as <em>The Order of the Multiverse</em> and <em>Perfectly Balanced – A Theoretical Approach to a Better Self</em>.</p><p><strong>DC 13.</strong> All the books are arranged by their alphabetic titles, except for the books that have been strewn carelessly on the floor.</p><p><strong>DC 15.</strong> A book titled <em>Tenets of Order</em> is filled with prayers and sermons that all seem to praise symmetry, balance, order, and law.</p><p><strong>DC 17.</strong> Neatly folded inside an incredibly bland smut novel titled <em>One Shade of Gray – A Tale of a Balanced Relationship</em> is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.l9Ju5KE7bbn3WpTm]{spell scroll of hold monster}</em> and a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{spell scroll of greater restoration}</em>.</p></div><p>If the characters return all the books strewn around the floor to their correct alphabetical positions on the bookshelf, the Maker is pleased and blesses each character with a @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.CdRDblCDMybYmFuG]{Divine Boon of Guidance} for 24 hours.</p><h4>S7. Workshop</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Several tidy worktables line the walls of this chamber and tools and crafting materials hang in orderly rows on the wall. In the middle of the chamber lies the still form of a small humanoid clad in gray robes.</p></blockquote><p>This room served as the sanctum’s workshop.</p><p><em><strong>Dead Adventurer.</strong></em> The corpse is that of Serkraf Nimbletuck, a male gnome wizard, who entered the sanctum a few weeks ago. The gnome was slain by the golem in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s3.-guardian-room]{area S3} when he gave up trying to answer its riddle and tried to take the Sanctum Key. The golem’s blow knocked Serkraf into this chamber, where he expired. A character who investigates the corpse finds a notebook, a spellbook tucked in the gnome’s belt pouch, and a spell component pouch (see Treasure).</p><p><em><strong>Notebook.</strong></em> The gnome’s notebook gives a brief account of his findings in the sanctum, written down in small, disjointed sentences across its tiny pages:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Maryn, muscle (dumb). Phyriziel, sneak (don’t trust)<br />White sphere – light. Dark sphere – darkness<br />Separated. Maryn (idiot). Left. Left. Right<br />Golem riddle: Endless shapes, knowledge immense, put in order, explore history, art, peace, war<br /><s>Soldiers</s> <s>Drawings</s> <s>Numbers</s> <s>Gears</s> <s>Magic</s></p></blockquote><p>The last five words, which were hastily written and crossed out, are wrong answers the gnome tried giving to the golem in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s3.-guardian-room]{area S3. Guardian Room}.</p><p><em><strong>Spellbook.</strong></em> The wizard has inscribed a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{glyph of warding}</em> on his spellbook that triggers a 3rd-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WTbOQBsarsL1LuXJ]{thunderwave}</em> spell (save DC 13) if it is opened by any other creature. If triggered, the spellbook is destroyed. The glyph is clearly visible and a creature proficient in Arcana immediately recognizes it as a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{glyph of warding}</em>.

Pools of Enlightenment</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Two pools fill the curved corners of this room. A silver cup stands on a pedestal in the middle of the room.</p></blockquote><p>This room holds two sacred basins that the sanctum’s inhabitants used to drink from to bless themselves.</p><p><em><strong>Spirit Wards.</strong></em> Two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.t86RG9FRyYZVoxJL]{spirit ward weavers}</strong> inhabit this room, one lingering in each basin. These spirits belong to two priests of the Maker who died of natural causes and agreed to have their mortal souls remain behind to guard the sanctum. Eventually drawn to this room, the spirits have been warped by the magical basins, granting them weird arcane abilities. Both spirits emerge to attack a creature that approaches to drink from either basin, surprising the intruders unless their intangible forms are spotted with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check first. The spirits attack until destroyed.</p><p><em><strong>Basins.</strong></em> The water in the two 5-foot deep basins in this room have different magical properties. If a creature drinks from only one basin, it suffers a negative effect, as described below:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Amplifying.</strong> A creature who drinks from the basin to the left of the doorway becomes oversensitive to magic until it finishes a long rest. While affected in this way, the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Moreover, once per turn when the creature takes damage from a spell or other magical effect, it takes an additional [[/r 1d8]] of that damage.</p><p><strong>Nullifying.</strong> A creature who drinks from the basin to the right of the doorway has its connection to the weave of magic interrupted until it finishes a long rest. While affected in this way, the creature regains only half as many hit points from magical healing, they can’t be considered a willing target of a spell or other magical effect, and they must always try to resist the spell or other magical effect, if able. If the creature is targeted by a beneficial spell or other magical effect that doesn’t require a saving throw, they must roll a d20. On a roll of 10 or less, the spell or magical effect has no effect on them.</p></div><p>The basins are also another manifestation of the symmetric nature of the sanctum; if a creature mixes the holy water from each and drinks the mixture, they instead gain the following beneficial effect:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Mix.</strong> The creature becomes at one with the weave of magic for 1 hour. While affected in this way, the creature has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and resistance to damage from spells and other magical effects.</p></div><p>Drinking first from one basin and then the other doesn’t grant the benefits a creature would get from mixing them. Likewise, a creature who has already drunk from one of the basins can’t gain the benefit of drinking a mix of the two basin’s liquids until it has finished a long rest. The water loses its magical abilities when it is removed from the sanctum.</p><p><em><strong>Drinking Cup.</strong></em> A creature who examines the drinking cup notices that it has a line within it that indicates the cup’s exact midpoint, hinting at the fact that the water from the basins should be mixed.</p><h4>S9. Inner Sanctum</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>An ornate pedestal sits in the middle of this round chamber, surrounded by a field of cerulean energy. A beautiful amulet featuring cogwheels and arcane symbols hang suspended above the pedestal. On opposite sides of the pedestal are two 10-foot-diameter portals of stone, each engraved with arcane symbols and filled with a viscous mass of roiling energy.</p></blockquote><p>The final chamber of the sanctum holds the sanctum’s most powerful relic guarded by fierce elementals of darkness and light.</p><p><em><strong>Pedestal.</strong></em> The pedestal, and the amulet hovering above it, is protected by a powerful, impenetrable forcefield that nullifies all other magic within it and can’t be breached by any means except a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{wish}</em> spell. To suppress the forcefield, the sanctum’s guardians must first be defeated.</p><p><em><strong>Portals.</strong></em> The two portals in the room are used to summon the sanctum’s guardians. As hinted at on the door in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s5.-antechamber]{area S5. Antechamber}, the temple’s illumination (which can be adjusted by the scale in the same room) dictates which elementals are summoned to guard the amulet when the characters approach the pedestal in the center of the room:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Bright Light.</strong> If the temple is illuminated with bright light, both portals are filled with radiant light and each spawns a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.C9Cs2KfXNGdXKnMJ]{radiance elemental}</strong>.</p><p><strong>Darkness.</strong> If the temple’s light is extinguished, both portals are filled with churning shadows and each spawns a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.St2rdIxQnYHHq3F3]{darkness elemental}</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dim Light.</strong> If the temple is illuminated by dim light, one portal is filled with radiant light and spawns a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.C9Cs2KfXNGdXKnMJ]{radiance elemental}</strong> and the other is filled with roiling shadows and spawns a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.St2rdIxQnYHHq3F3]{darkness elemental}</strong>.</p></div><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Fighting the Elementals.</strong></em> Regardless of which elementals are spawned, they attack intruders with mindless ferocity, fighting until destroyed. How easy or difficult the fight is depends in large part on which elementals were summoned and how the temple is illuminated. If one of each elemental was summoned, their auras cancel each other out as long as they are within 30 feet of each other; the sanctum remains dimly lit and neither elemental can use any actions or abilities that require it to be in darkness or bright light, respectively. A pair of identical elementals suffer no such weaknesses, but may be affected even more severely if the characters are clever enough to realize that they can manipulate the light to harm and weaken the elementals (i.e., using the Scale of Illumination in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s5.-antechamber]{area S5} to cast the sanctum in magical darkness while fighting two radiance elementals).</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Once the elementals have been defeated, the forcefield around the pedestal falls away and the characters can pick up the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.VineP6bFmBxmhPAP]{Timepiece of Equilibrium}</em> and leave the sanctum at their leisure.</p><h3>Adjusting Difficulty</h3><p>As written, the Sanctum Mechanicum is suitable for a party of four 7th-level adventurers. Below is general advice on how to adjust the sanctum’s difficulty, as well as specific advice for adjusting to parties of other levels.</p><h5>Adjusting on the Fly</h5><p>The characters’ route through the sanctum, as well as their choices when facing each challenge, largely determines how difficult the sanctum is.</p><p>If the characters avoid or bypass all superfluous traps and hazards, they only really need to deal with the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.5qnIwZ3bfpi5ghyg]{lesser gravity golem}</strong> in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s3.-guardian-room]{area S3} and the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.C9Cs2KfXNGdXKnMJ]{radiance}</strong>/<strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.St2rdIxQnYHHq3F3]{darkness elementals}</strong> in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s9.-inner-sanctum]{area S9}. The golem can be bypassed by answering the riddle correctly and the elementals can be weakened greatly by adjusting the light correctly.</p><p>Conversely, the party may run headfirst into these dangers in addition to triggering the traps in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s2.-symmetry-room]{area S2}, activating the defective control disk in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s4.-dormitory]{area S4}, and triggering the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{glyph of warding}</em> in @UUID[.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3#s7.-workshop]{area S7}.

          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h1\">Shrine of the Rising Sun</p><p>Even the followers of the Dawnbringer have things they wish to keep away from prying eyes. One such artifact is the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.fEzvasSvoMBGUV1s]{Dawnbringer’s Crown}</em>, which lies hidden in the Shrine of the Rising Sun. The shrine, which only appears to those who stand at the exact right spot at the break of dawn, tests visitors’ ability to manipulate and overcome the powers of light.</p><h3>Finding the Shrine</h3><p>The shrine sits isolated on a small hilltop. It only appears when the dawn’s light hits it at just the right angle – and only remains for a few minutes. Creatures within the shrine when it disappears can exit the shrine but will find that they are not able to reenter before the next dawn because the shrine is no longer there. Read or paraphrase the following when the shrine appears:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Like a shimmering mirage, a semi-circular marble structure appears. About 30 feet tall and windowless, the only entry to the building is a large door made entirely of near-blinding light.</p></blockquote><h3>General Features</h3><p>The Shrine of the Rising Sun has the following general features unless otherwise noted:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The shrine’s ceilings are 30 feet high.</p><p><strong>Illumination.</strong> The shrine is filled with warm, rosy light emanating from small orbs that sit in indentations in the walls. The orbs cast bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet, and can be moved freely around the shrine, but magically return to their places if removed from the shrine.</p><p><strong>Sun Pillars.</strong> The shrine features several triangular, 10-feet tall pillars made from mirror-like crystal that reflects light. A creature who investigates a pillar quickly realizes that they can use an action to rotate the pillar on its axis. If a beam of light, such as the one created by the Sun Altar (see area @UUID[.nVXoyA9hSEiNccIM#s1.-altar-of-the-sun]{S1. Altar of the Sun}) strikes a pillar’s side, the beam is reflected further on without being diminished.</p><p><strong>Walls.</strong> All walls within the shrine are enchanted, making it impossible move through them using magic, such as with the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.PQuEgKyCdovOvhqN]{etherealness}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}</em>.</p></div><h3>Locations within the Shrine</h3><p>The following locations are keyed to the Shrine of the Rising Sun map.</p><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/maps/rising-sun-border.webp\" /><h4>S1. Altar of the Sun</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>The decrepit stairs leads down to a wide hallway and into a semi-circular chamber. A pleasant, rosy light emanates from small, glowing orbs fitted into the walls, and a stone altar sits in the middle of the chamber. Three black marble doors lead out from the chamber and five triangular pillars of smooth, mirror-like crystal stand at regular intervals.</p></blockquote><p>This room has an altar that priests would use to pray by – and which can produce beams of light that, when reflected, can open the doors to the rest of the shrine.</p><p><em><strong>Sun Altar.</strong></em> Two sun symbols are carved into the altar, inside each of which is a triangle and a small, round indentation. The following phrase is written in Common between the two symbols:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>It never rests, is never still,<br />Moves silently from hill to hill.<br />It does not walk, run, or trot.<br />All is cool where it is not.<br />Away at night, fills the day,<br />Shine from here, to light the way,<br />Banish darkness, venture forth,<br />Reflect the light back to our Lord.</p></blockquote><p>If a glowing orb from the wall or another source of magical light is placed inside one of the two indentations, the altar creates a beam of sunlight that shoots directly north to hit the sun pillar in front of the altar. A creature or object that touches a beam of light for the first time on its turn, or starts its turn in a beam of light, takes [[/r 4d6]] Radiant damage. If the pillar directly in front of the altar hasn’t been turned before the altar is activated, the beam hits the pillar and reflects back to hit any character standing directly in front of the altar, unless they succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.</p><p><em><strong>Sun Doors.</strong></em> The black doors leading out of this room are indestructible and can’t be opened by any means except if they take 10 or more Radiant damage in a single turn, in which case they evaporate instantly. The doors magically reform one round later unless a beam of sunlight (such as the one created by the Sun Altar) passes through its space to prevent it from reforming.</p><p><em><strong>Activating the Main Pillar.</strong></em> When both statues in @UUID[.nVXoyA9hSEiNccIM#s2.-chamber-of-guardians]{area S2} and @UUID[.nVXoyA9hSEiNccIM#s3.-chamber-of-reflection]{area S3} have been lit by the sunbeams produced by the altar, the central sun pillar shoots forth a thick beam of light through the door to @UUID[.nVXoyA9hSEiNccIM#s4.-chamber-of-light]{area S4} and lights up the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.fEzvasSvoMBGUV1s]{Dawnbringer’s Crown}</em> within.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Running S1.

The guardians spring to life and attack any creature who approaches the pillar or the Dawnbringer’s Statue, unless the creature or an object it is carrying emits bright, magical light (such as one of the glowing orbs from the walls). The magical constructs attack until destroyed or until they can’t see any conscious creatures in the room that aren’t emitting magical light. If no targets are present, the guardians return to their positions and become inanimate. The guardians won’t leave the chamber and disappear when reduced to 0 hit points but magically reform at the next dawn.</p><p><em><strong>Beam of Light.</strong></em> During combat, creatures can move through a space filled with the beam of light without being struck if they make a successful a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</p><p><em><strong>Dawnbringer’s Statue.</strong></em> When the guardians have been bypassed or defeated, the sun pillar can be angled so that the beam of sunlight produced by the altar in @UUID[.nVXoyA9hSEiNccIM#s1.-altar-of-the-sun]{area S1} can be reflected to strike the statue, which then glows with a fierce, bright light.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> The tools and weapons hanging on the walls are mostly mundane, and include two maces, two morningstars, three quarterstaffs, two light crossbows, one lance, one longsword, and one maul.

While a beam of sunlight strikes the crystal, such as if the beam of sunlight produced by the altar in @UUID[.nVXoyA9hSEiNccIM#s1.-altar-of-the-sun]{area S1} is reflected into the chamber, the beam splits into multiple smaller beams and fills the chamber with a mesh of radiant energy. A creature who moves into the chamber while it is filled with this mesh of light must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check for each 10 feet they move or take [[/r 4d6]] Radiant damage. The crystal can’t be moved but a creature can attack the crystal (AC 15, 15 hit points; immunity to Poison and Radiant damage; resistance to Piercing damage). Ranged weapon attacks against the crystal are made with disadvantage as any mundane missile is likely to be destroyed by the radiant mesh of light. If an attack misses the gem or deals damage to it but fails to reduce it to 0 hit points while the crystal is reflecting a beam of light, the crystal spins on its axis and scatters light in random directions so that each creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take [[/r 4d6]] Radiant damage.</p><p><em><strong>Dawnbringer’s Statue.</strong></em> Once the crystal has been destroyed, the sun pillar can be angled so that the beam of sunlight produced by the altar in @UUID[.nVXoyA9hSEiNccIM#s1.-altar-of-the-sun]{area S1} can be reflected to strike the statue, which then glows with a fierce, bright light.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Running S3.

The shrine, carved into a rocky mountainside, is unassuming from the outside and is rarely visited by anyone except devout followers of the Masked One who come to pay fealty to their dark lord.</p><h3>Finding the Shrine</h3><p>The entrance to the Shrine of the Silent Blade is only visible during the twilight hour when day turns to night and the veil between the Mortal World and its shadowy echo plane is thinnest. As darkness falls, the obsidian door becomes visible, as does the footpath that leads to the entrance.</p><p>Hidden as it is, only those who either know of the shrine’s existence and exact location, or those who, by amazing coincidence, happen at the exact spot at dusk, can find and enter the shrine.</p><h3>General Features</h3><p>The Shrine of the Silent Blade has the following general features unless otherwise noted:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The ceilings in the shrine are 30 feet high.</p><p><strong>Doors.</strong> Doors within the temple are made from black obsidian. All doors are closed but unlocked.</p><p><strong>Illumination.</strong> Most of the shrine is dimly lit by magical light emanating from torches that hang in sconces on the walls. The heatless and odorless flames are created by <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f]{continual flame}</em> spells and can be extinguished with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}</em> spell or covered with cloth or similar material to block their light.</p><p><strong>Walls.</strong> All walls within the shrine are enchanted, making it impossible to move through them using magic, such as with the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.PQuEgKyCdovOvhqN]{etherealness}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}</em>.</p></div><h3>Areas in the Shrine</h3><p>The following areas are keyed to the Shrine of the Silent Blade Map.</p><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/maps/silent-blade-border.webp\" /><h4>S1. Antechamber</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>This small, round chamber is empty except for a single torch held in a sconce on the eastern wall, which fills the room with a dim, purple light. The room has two doors, one to the west and one to the east. Above the eastern door is a plaque that reads, in Common:<br />“Light and dark are one in binding,<br />Both reveal, both are blinding,<br />Light brings sight to corners deep,<br />Darkness is where the secrets creep.”</p></blockquote><p>The small riddle in this room provides a helpful hint to clever characters: darkness may be necessary to glean all the secrets in the shrine.</p><p><em><strong>Hallway Riddle.</strong></em> If this chamber is cast in darkness, such as by covering, dispelling, or removing the magical torch (see General Features), the plaque above the door to @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s2.-hallway-of-perils]{area S2. Hallway of Perils} changes to a glowing script that reads:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“Proceed as in life –<br />Slow on four, quick on two, careful on three,<br />To escape the knives you cannot see.”</p></blockquote><p>This riddle hints at the safe way to avoid the three traps in area @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s2.-hallway-of-perils]{S2. Hallway of Perils}: first by crawling, then by running, and then by moving carefully with a crutch or cane.</p><h4>S2. Hallway of Perils</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>This 10-foot wide hallway stretches for 30 feet and ends at another obsidian door. Three torches set at regular intervals fill the hallway with dim light.</p></blockquote><p>The Hallway of Perils is a trap-littered hallway that promises swift death to unwary adventures.</p><p><em><strong>Dart Trap.</strong></em> A faint beam of light thin as a thread spans the hallway 10 feet in at a height of 3 feet. If the beam is broken, magical darts shoot down the length of the hallway from west to east, disappearing as they reach the hallway’s end. Each creature in the hallway must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 4d6]] Piercing damage on a failure and half as much on a success.</p><p><em><strong>Swinging Blade Trap.</strong></em> A faint screen of light spans the hallway 20 feet in, reaching from floor to ceiling. If the light is broken for more than a second (such as by a creature walking calmly through it) three huge axe blades come swinging out from invisible slits in the wall around it and each creature within 5 feet of the screen of light must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 4d6]] Slashing damage on a failure and half as much on a success.</p><p><em><strong>Spiked Pit Trap.</strong></em> The last 10 feet of the hallway’s tiles are partly illusory, their true nature revealed only by the faint light they emanate. Though they are illusory, the tiles hold firm until 20 lbs or more weight is placed upon them – unless the weight is distributed across at least two points. If a creature walks normally across the tiles, the magical tiles vanish, and the creature falls 10 feet into a pit filled with spikes and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 2d6]] Bludgeoning damage and [[/r 2d6]] Piercing damage on a failure and half as much on a success. It’s impossible to jump the tiles while the door at the end of the hallway is closed.</p><p><em><strong>Noticing the Traps.</strong></em> As the traps’ light is very dim, they are nearly impossible to detect unless it’s dark. While the hallway is lit by the torches on the walls, a character searching for traps must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check for each trap to notice the light that reveals its presence. If the torch next to the trap has been covered, dispelled, or moved, casting the area in relative darkness, the light is clearly noticeable.</p><p><em><strong>Bypassing the Traps.</strong></em> As indicated by the dark riddle in @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s1.-antechamber]{area S1. Antechamber}, clever characters can bypass the traps by moving through the hallway in specific ways. A character can easily crawl under the beam of light by the Dart Trap to avoid triggering it. A character that runs through the sheen of light by the Swinging Blade Trap won’t break its light long enough to trigger it. Finally, a creature walking past the last tiles either without lifting their feet or with the aid of a cane or crutch won’t trigger the Spiked Pit Trap.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Running S2. Hallway of Perils</p><p>The Hallway of Perils challenges the characters with three separate traps as they move down the hallway:</p><ul><li><p>First, a dart trap that can be avoided by crawling.</p></li><li><p>Second, a swinging blade trap that can be avoided by running.</p></li><li><p>Third, a spiked pit trap that can be avoided by taking shuffling steps or using a cane.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Trap Triggers.</strong></em> Each trap is revealed only by faint light, which makes it very difficult to spot (DC 25) unless the magical torch by each trap is moved or extinguished so the light is clearly visible. The plaque and Hallway Riddle in @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s1.-antechamber]{area S1. Antechamber} hint at both the benefit of darkness and how each trap can be avoided.<br /><em><strong>Tips &amp; Advice.</strong></em> As the characters enter the hallway, make sure to emphasize the presence of the torches and give the front-most character(s) an opportunity to search for traps, before going ahead. The character(s) should only be able to spot the trap immediately in front of them, so once they’ve moved past the first trap, give them another opportunity to see if they can spot and avoid the next trap, and so on.</p></blockquote><h4>S3. Hall of Shadows</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>This chamber is cast almost completely in darkness, as the only light is a faintly glowing script on a pillar in the middle of the room that reads, in Common:<br />“Guardian born of the oldest foe,<br />Cast down to follow wherever you go,<br />Cannot exist without their bane,<br />Bring it here and you’ll know pain.”</p></blockquote><p>The Hall of Shadows is cast in complete darkness.</p><p><em><strong>Shadows.</strong></em> Eight <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.QGcQYZbVl4bWzi4E]{shadows}</strong> lurk in the corners of the room. While the room is in darkness, a creature with Darkvision can vaguely perceive the shadowy figures with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The shadows remain in the corners of the room, observing the characters without harassing them. If light is brought within the chamber, the shadows attack immediately, focusing their efforts on whichever creature is holding or producing the light. The shadows fight until destroyed or until the light has been extinguished, in which case they scurry back into the darkness if they are able to.</p><h4>S4. Knight’s Tomb</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A large sarcophagus sits at the back of this chamber, which is dimly lit by a single torch hanging on the wall. The sarcophagus’ surface has been drawn with the likeness of a somber knight holding a long blade. A plaque sits at the foot of the sarcophagus.</p></blockquote><p>A character with intimate knowledge of the Masked One or who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check knows with certainty that the internment and portrayal of an honorable knight is out of place in a shrine dedicated to the Masked One.</p><p><em><strong>False Friend Riddle.</strong></em> The plaque at the foot of the sarcophagus reads in Common:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“Here lies Sir Archibald the Brave – heed his words:<br />Though lain to rest forevermore,<br />Never to rise as I did before,<br />I’ll bless you to your spirits soar,<br />Lift the lid to be restored.”</p></blockquote><p>If the room is cast in darkness, the word “lies” in the first line glows with a faint, purple light, which indicates that the rest of the script is a lie; the mummified corpse within hasn’t been lain to rest forevermore and holds no blessings or restorations.</p><p><em><strong>Scrollwrapped Mummy.</strong></em> If the lid is pushed off the sarcophagus, the mummified corpse of Sir Archibald rises as a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.x2HSCP0mbkv3ezY7]{scrollwrapped mummy}</strong> and attacks the characters relentlessly.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Once defeated, the mummy’s unused <em>spell scrolls</em> can be harvested from its remains.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Running S4. Knight’s Tomb</p><p>The incongruous Knight’s Tomb was created with the intention of tricking those who are too trusting or ignorant of the Masked One’s tenets to push off the lid and awaken the deadly mummy within.</p><p><em><strong>Tips &amp; Advice.</strong></em> Make sure you give any character with proficiency in Religion, or who has knowledge of the Masked One, a chance to realize how out-of-place the sarcophagus is. Also make sure to emphasize the word “lies” as you read the sarcophagus’ plaque. The players should feel clever if they avoid the danger based on these subtle clues – and sheepish if they don’t!</p></blockquote><h4>S5. Maiden’s Tomb</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A large, stone sarcophagus sits at the back of this small chamber. Its surface has been drawn with the likeness of a young woman dressed in rich finery. With her slender hands held across her breast and smiling shyly, she is the picture of innocence.<br />A rack on the western wall holds five flasks filled with different colored liquids in order: red, gold, black, white, and green. A bronze plaque hangs underneath the rack.</p></blockquote><p>This room holds the sarcophagus of the Poison Princess, a renowned assassin famed for her many devious poisons. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the depiction.</p><p><em><strong>Poison Bottle Riddle.</strong></em> The plaque underneath the bottles reads in Common:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“One rhymes with what it makes you,<br />Another takes what it seems to be,<br />Innocence is pretty, but never true,<br />Envy’s a sin, oh yes, you’ll see,<br />The last is power, always there beneath,<br />Choose only one, or all you get is grief.”</p></blockquote><p>Each line of the riddle presents a clue, in order:</p><ul><li><p>The red potion is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.qBSEGJyHxdKIlBfj]{potion of poison}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The gold liquid is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.RdRri8zF7IpGfS3c]{potion of poverty}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The white liquid is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.qBSEGJyHxdKIlBfj]{potion of poison}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The green liquid is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.qBSEGJyHxdKIlBfj]{potion of poison}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The black liquid is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.YKxVNecwGJ3dx0wC]{potion of divine essence}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The characters will “get grief” if they take more than one potion (see Poison Gas Trap).</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Poison Gas Trap.</strong></em> If the characters remove more than one potion from the rack on the wall, poisonous gas billows forth from tiny holes at the foot of the sarcophagus. Each creature inside the chamber must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking [[/r 4d6]] Poison damage on a failure and half as much on a success. A creature that fails this save is also Poisoned for 1 hour.</p><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Sarcophagus.</strong></em> The sarcophagus seems to be a solid block of stone with no lid or openings. A creature that carefully investigates the sarcophagus and succeeds on a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a tiny slit where the painted woman’s hands cross over her heart. If the room is cast in darkness, the faint light that shines from the slit reveals it clearly. A character who knows what they’re looking for also finds the slit easily. The slit is exactly wide enough to fit a thin blade – when inserted, a hatch pops open to reveal a small, square compartment.</p><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> The compartment holds a heart-shaped purple amethyst (500 gp) that is also the key to @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s8.-vault-of-shadows]{area S8. Vault of Shadows}.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Running S5. Maiden’s Tomb</p><p>The Maiden’s Tomb holds not only the potential for a useful magical potion, but also the heart-shaped amethyst that is required to open the secret passage to @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s8.-vault-of-shadows]{area S8. Vault of Shadows}. The latter can only be accessed by inserting a blade into a slit in the maiden’s chest that is nearly invisible while the torch in the room casts its light.</p><p><em><strong>Tips &amp; Advice.</strong></em> You can allow the characters to automatically find the hidden compartment in the sarcophagus if they cast the chamber in darkness (perhaps remembering the advice from @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s1.-antechamber]{S1. Antechamber}) or if they have figured out the Missing Words Riddle in @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s7.-false-vault]{area S7. False Vault}.</p></blockquote><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/ui/potion-riddle-handout.webp\" /><h4>S6. Hall of Reckoning</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>This long hall has curving walls and is lined with pillars of obsidian carved with grimacing faces; some are contorted in anger or arrogance, others display solemn patience or melancholy compassion. Dim light from several torches illuminates the room and reveals a plaque on the foremost pillar.</p></blockquote><p>In this hall, visitors must hide or mask themselves or be assailed by splinters of their own personality.</p><p><em><strong>Shadow Riddle.</strong></em> The plaque on the pillar directly in front of the characters reads in Common:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“Unseen in the dark,<br />Unread like a mask,<br />Secret and stark,<br />No eyes, no ask.”</p></blockquote><p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) checks knows that this rhyme is a popular phrase with followers of the Masked One and that it encourages followers to move stealthily and mask emotions. If the area around the plaque is cast in darkness, the words “dark” and “mask” glow, hinting at how the party can pass through the hall unscathed.</p><p><em><strong>Pillars.</strong></em> A character who actively investigates or observes the pillars notices that the faces on the pillars have six distinct expressions: a friendly, compassionate expression, a greedy, hungry-looking expression, a bored, unassuming expression, a prideful, sneering expression, a calm, stoic expression, and an angry, hateful expression. They may also note that the faces’ eyes seem to follow specific characters as they move about the room – i.e., all the angry faces may focus on a particular character and so on.</p><p><em><strong>Soulsplinter Sprites.</strong></em> When at least one character reaches the middle of this hall, <strong>soulsplinter sprites</strong> spring forth from the pillars and attack the party – one for each character who hasn’t avoided their notice (see Avoiding Notice below). Each sprite embodies one of the characters’ most dominant personality traits, so that a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.6G4G0sPTMKbK55rh]{soulsplinter sprite (wrath)}</strong> springs forth to attack the raging barbarian and a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.2Z2qbfZBFecYptUH]{soulsplinter sprite (compassion)}</strong> appears to attack the goodly cleric. The sprites vaguely resemble that character and use that character’s proficiency bonus to determine its power.</p><p><em><strong>Avoiding Notice.</strong></em> Characters can avoid the sprites’ notice by either masking their emotions or by sneaking as they move through the hall. Doing so requires a successful DC 20 Charisma (Deception) or Dexterity (Stealth) check. The DC is reduced by 5 for the Deception check if they wear a mask and by 5 for the Stealth check if the chamber is cast in darkness. A character who succeeds on this check doesn’t spawn a soulsplinter sprite as they move through the hall.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Running S6. Hall of Reckoning</p><p>The Hall of Reckoning tests visitors’ aptitude for deception and stealth – two traits the Masked One values. Characters who enter the hall carelessly will be assailed by <strong>soulsplinter sprites</strong> embodying their most dominant personality traits. If the characters employ darkness and/or mask themselves, as hinted at in the Shadow Riddle, their chances of moving through the chamber unnoticed by the sprites are much improved.</p><p><em><strong>Tips &amp; Advice.</strong></em> If the characters experiment with masking their emotions or moving stealthily, give them subtle clues that their efforts are working, such as noting how the faces’ eyes are drawn to characters who make no efforts at stealth. When a character approaches the door to @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s7.-false-vault]{area S7} without using deception or stealth, or failing their check to do so, have a <strong>soulsplinter sprite</strong> appear for each character in the hall who took no steps to conceal themselves. Add some flavor to the encounter by describing how each sprite looks like a twisted version of the character it spawned from and having the sprite focus its attacks against that character.</p></blockquote><h4>S7. False Vault</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>At the far end of this chamber is a tall, stone altar. A beautiful, black and crimson sword lies upon a velvet pillow on the altar. Torches hanging on the pillars cast this room in a dim, purple light.</p></blockquote><p>This room is a red herring and the blade on the altar isn’t the tomb’s true treasure but a dangerous construct.</p><p><em><strong>Altar.</strong></em> The altar is carved with scenes of historical and religious events. A character who takes the time to look closer at the altar and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (History or Religion) check notices they don’t show anything that would normally be associated with the Masked One, but rather scenes of unicorns frolicking, a priestess healing the wounded, and brave knights fighting dragons.</p><p><em><strong>Shadow Blade.</strong></em> The blade lying on the altar is a magical construct made from solid shadow. If the sword is moved or touched, it splits into three <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.xDVRkBaEWCB07HQ7]{shadow blades}</strong> and attacks the would-be-thieves. Simultaneously, all light in the chamber is extinguished and black tentacles fill the chamber’s floor. For 1 minute, or until the shadow blades are destroyed, the floor is difficult terrain and a creature that moves into the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn standing on the ground must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take [[/r 2d6]] Bludgeoning damage and be Restrained (escape DC 15). A creature takes [[/r 2d6]] Bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns while Restrained in this way.</p><p><em><strong>Missing Words Riddle.</strong></em> A character that approaches the altar notices that something is written on the wall behind it in Common, over a heart-shaped indentation:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“The best way to protect from theft,<br />Is to lose all, have nothing<br />Hidden under stone and gloss,<br />Two hands atop to form a<br />Truth inside the maiden’s heart,<br />Blade pierces, always under”</p></blockquote><p>Three words are missing from this riddle: the second line should end with “left,” the fourth line should end with “cross,” and the final line should end with “guard.” Together, these three words read “Left Cross Guard” which refers to @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s5.-maidens-tomb]{area S5. Maiden’s Tomb}, where the characters can find a heart-shaped amethyst. If all light is extinguished in the chamber the missing words become visible, glowing faintly on the wall.</p><p><em><strong>Secret Door.</strong></em> If the heart-shaped amethyst from @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s5.-maidens-tomb]{area S5. Maiden’s Tomb} is placed in the indentation in the easternmost wall, the gemstone dissolves into shadows and the wall glides aside to reveal a passage to @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s8.-vault-of-shadows]{area S8. Vault of Shadows}.</p><h4>S8. Vault of Shadows</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>This triangular room is bare except for two pillars and an ornate sword that has been plunged into the tiled floor in the center of the room. Cracks glowing with radiant light spread outward from the sword.</p></blockquote><p>The god-killing sword <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.VEsgOd94knwcSwR4]{Bedlam}</em> was plunged into the floor here, after it had been used to wound – or possibly kill – a god several centuries before.</p><p><em><strong>Bedlam.</strong></em> The magical shortsword <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.VEsgOd94knwcSwR4]{Bedlam}</em> sits embedded in the floor, still smeared with the blood of a god. At your discretion, the sword may only be retrievable by a character who fulfills certain criteria or is a follower of the Masked One. Otherwise, the sword can be pulled out by any who dares.</p><p><em><strong>Godblood Ooze.</strong></em> When the sword <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.VEsgOd94knwcSwR4]{Bedlam}</em> is pulled free, a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.3jJAT18IRYOn68rV]{godblood ooze}</strong> bubbles forth from the floor and attacks anyone within the chamber relentlessly.</p><h3>Adjusting Difficulty</h3><p>As written, the Shrine of the Silent Blade is suitable for a party of four 5th-level adventurers. Below is general advice on how to adjust the shrine’s difficulty, as well as specific advice for adjusting to parties of other levels.</p><h5>Adjusting on the Fly</h5><p>How difficult the Shrine of the Silent Blade ends up being depends in large part on how clever and careful the characters are. If the characters are cunning and stealthy, they can avoid all challenges within the shrine with the exception of the ooze in area S8. Vault of Shadows. Conversely, if they bumble into every challenge the shrine has to offer, they may well be in dire straits when they reach the true vault.</p><p>To account for these variables, you can adjust difficulty as the characters proceed by adding or removing creatures, particularly in @UUID[.llKMPlAq9sQsnGYo#s8.-vault-of-shadows]{area S8. Vault of Shadows}. If the characters have been challenged sufficiently when arriving there, you can remove the godblood ooze; if they arrive almost unscathed, they may meet two godblood oozes instead of one.</p><h5>Adjusting to Specific Levels</h5><p>Below is advice on adjusting the adventure’s difficulty to specific levels:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Levels 3–4.</strong> Reduce DCs by 2 and halve trap damage.

          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h1\">Temple of Three Challenges</p><p>Whether it sits in the center of a bustling city, perches precariously on a lonely mountainside, or is hidden deep beneath the ground, the Temple of Three Challenges is a tempting destination for pious pilgrims and daring adventurers alike. Though it doesn’t look like much from the outside, the temple is home to three daunting challenges that must be overcome by those who seek to uncover the great treasure that lies within.</p><h3>Using the Temple</h3><p>The Temple of Three Challenges is a modular location that can function as a holy site for a specific deity or several deities, where visitors must overcome three challenges to obtain a specific prize of your choosing.</p><h5>The Temple’s Challenges</h5><p>The temple’s three challenges come with example solutions based on six different Divine Domains – Chaos, Darkness, Light, Order, Peace, and War – but you can adjust solutions to fit any deity of your choice.</p><p>When the description of the temple’s areas refers to “the deity,” this can be the deity the entire temple is dedicated to, the deity that a specific challenge is dedicated to, or even the patron deity of the character who is performing the challenge, at your discretion.</p><p>It is also left up to you to decide how many characters should answer the puzzle in each chamber. In most cases, it is likely enough that only one character needs to answer for the puzzle to be solved – or that the puzzle needs one answer for each deity.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Temple to whom?</p><p>The Temple of Three Challenges can be dedicated to any one deity or several at once, such as:</p><ul><li><p>The temple is dedicated to a single deity, which could be whichever deity fits your campaign or storyline.</p></li><li><p>The temple is dedicated to the deities of light, order, and peace, and the temple’s rooms are associated with them in that order.</p></li><li><p>The puzzles’ solution changes based on which deity the character attempting to solve it follows.</p></li></ul></blockquote><h3>General Features</h3><p>The Temple of Three Challenges is built exclusively as a place where visitors test themselves and as such has no living quarters or similar amenities. The temple has the following general features unless otherwise noted:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The ceilings in the temple are 30 feet high.</p><p><strong>Doors.</strong> The doors within the temple are sealed with magic and will only open under certain circumstances. The doors cannot be forced open, circumvented, or destroyed except with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{wish}</em> spell or similar magic.</p><p><strong>Illumination.</strong> The central object in each chamber casts a magical light that fills the room with a pleasant, dim illumination.</p><p><strong>Magic.</strong> Strong enchantments prevent anyone inside the temple from casting spells of teleportation or planar travel.</p><p><strong>Walls.</strong> All walls within the temple are enchanted, making it impossible to move through them using magic, such as with the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.PQuEgKyCdovOvhqN]{etherealness}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}</em>.</p></div><h3>Areas in the Temple</h3><p>The following areas are keyed to the Temple of Three Challenges Map.</p><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/maps/three-challenges-border.webp\" /><h4>T1. Test of Judgment</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A huge, oval stone-framed mirror stands in the middle of this crescent-shaped room. As you approach, the mirror blurs and color begins to swirl and coalesce, forming vague, dreamlike images. A voice resounds in the chamber: “Watch and pass judgment,” as the mirror shows a thin waif hurry past a baker’s stall on a busy street and pocketing a loaf of bread. Before the waif can disappear down a side alley, the baker steps in front of her and grabs her wrist – she is caught!</p></blockquote><p>To open the door to area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t2.-test-of-kinship]{T2. Test of Kinship}, the characters must pass the judgment that correlates to the tenets of their own or the temple’s deity. Depending on the deity’s divine aspect, the correct answer could be:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Chaos.</strong> The waif should be freed so she can help herself – she is only acting on natural instincts and shouldn’t be bound by mindless “laws.”</p><p><strong>Darkness.</strong> There is no room for compassion; the waif should be put to death if she can’t fend for herself.</p><p><strong>Light.</strong> The waif should be forgiven and provided with food and shelter – punishing her would not cure her hunger or remove her need to eat.</p><p><strong>Order.</strong> The waif must be handed over to the authorities and punished according to the city’s law.</p><p><strong>Peace.</strong> The waif should repay the baker by working as an apprentice – a position that would also see her fed and given a roof over her head.</p><p><strong>War.</strong> The waif’s punishment is up to the baker – if she is too weak to defend herself, the baker is within their rights to beat her to a pulp then and there.</p></div><p>At your discretion, a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check may recall information that allows them to deduce which judgment the deity might prefer. You can accept alternate answers if you think they would make sense for the deity of choice. The test here isn’t to give the “correct” answer, just that the character understands the deity’s disposition.</p><p><em><strong>Wrong Solution.</strong></em> If a character answers incorrectly, they take Psychic damage equal to [[/r 2d6]] plus their character level and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 10 + half their character level or suffer 1 level of Exhaustion. A character who answers incorrectly cannot answer again, but another character can answer in their stead to open the door.</p><p><em><strong>Passing the Test.</strong></em> When the correct answer or answers have been provided (you decide if each character must answer, or just one), the door to area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t2.-test-of-kinship]{T2. Test of Kinship} opens.</p><h4>T2. Test of Kinship</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Six spectral figures stand before the pillars in this chamber: a friendly priest, a luxuriously-dressed king, a pitiful beggar, a smug-looking wizard, a brawny knight, and a black-clad thief. As you approach, a voice resounds: “Bow to the one who most deserves it.”</p></blockquote><p>To open the door to area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t3.-test-of-mettle]{T3. Test of Mettle}, the characters must choose one spectral figure to bow before. Below are examples of correct answers based on a selection of divine aspects:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Chaos.</strong> Bow to the thief, wizard, or nobody.</p><p><strong>Darkness.</strong> Bow to the thief or wizard.</p><p><strong>Light.</strong> Bow to the priest or knight.</p><p><strong>Order.</strong> Bow to the king.</p><p><strong>Peace.</strong> Bow to the beggar or priest.</p><p><strong>War.</strong> Bow to the knight.</p></div><p>At your discretion, a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check may recall information that allows them to deduce which figure the deity would respect the most. When a character bows before a figure, the figure bows back if the answer is correct. You can accept alternate answers as long as you think they fit with the deity’s disposition.</p><p><em><strong>Wrong Solution.</strong></em> If a character bows to the wrong spectral figure, the figure immediately comes to life as a <strong>soulsplinter sprite</strong> and attacks the character. The sprite uses the character’s proficiency bonus to determine its statistics, and its form is determined by which spectral figure it was:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Beggar.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.3FJyFSmEQFMjO4m4]{Humility} or @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.J2AKZkExCpsNidGq]{Temperance}</p><p><strong>King.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.5q3iZ4zalSE0jM5U]{Greed} or @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.9HcLaNrZJRcSrFcD]{Pride}</p><p><strong>Knight.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.J2AKZkExCpsNidGq]{Temperance} or @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.6G4G0sPTMKbK55rh]{Wrath}</p><p><strong>Priest.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.2Z2qbfZBFecYptUH]{Compassion} or @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.3FJyFSmEQFMjO4m4]{Humility}</p><p><strong>Thief.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.5q3iZ4zalSE0jM5U]{Greed} or @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.6G4G0sPTMKbK55rh]{Wrath}</p><p><strong>Wizard.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.9HcLaNrZJRcSrFcD]{Pride} or @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.6G4G0sPTMKbK55rh]{Wrath}</p></div><p>If a single character answered for the whole party, you can have the spectral figure split into several <strong>soulsplinter sprites</strong> (see @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#adjusting-difficulty]{Adjusting Difficulty}), or you can decide that only the character who answered can harm the sprite or be harmed by it.</p><p><em><strong>Passing the Test.</strong></em> Once a correct answer has been provided or the sprites have been defeated, the door to area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t3.-test-of-mettle]{T3. Test of Mettle} opens.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">How many successes?</p><p>How many correct answers you require before all characters can move on to the next room should depend on how long you want the relic hunt to take – and how many deities the temple is devoted to. For a simple and quick relic hunt, requiring only a single correct answer is sufficient and should still challenge the party.</p></blockquote><h4>T3. Test of Mettle</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>The walls of this round chamber are lined with a multitude of different weapons. In the center of the room stands an expressionless stone statue. As you approach, the statue’s eyes glow and a voice resounds in the chamber: “Arm yourself with your choice of weapon and strike me down.”</p></blockquote><p>The characters must destroy the nondescript statue in this chamber using the deity’s favored weapon to open the door to area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t4.-inner-sanctum]{T4. Inner Sanctum}.</p><p><em><strong>Armory.</strong></em> Any number of simple and martial weapons of your choice hang on the chamber’s walls. Among these is the deity’s favored weapon, which could be:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Chaos.</strong> A dagger, flail, or maul.</p><p><strong>Darkness.</strong> A dagger, crossbow, or dart.</p><p><strong>Light.</strong> A battlehammer or morningstar.</p><p><strong>Order.</strong> A longsword or warhammer.</p><p><strong>Peace.</strong> An unarmed strike, club, or healing magic.</p><p><strong>War.</strong> A greatsword, greataxe, or maul.</p></div><p>A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check may tell a character what a deity’s favored weapon is. When the statue is struck with the deity’s favored weapon, it crumbles to dust. You can accept alternate answers, as long as you think they fit with the deity’s disposition.</p><p><em><strong>Wrong Solution.</strong></em> If the statue is dealt damage by any weapon other than the deity’s favored weapon, it dissolves into a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.3jJAT18IRYOn68rV]{godblood ooze}</strong> that is vulnerable to damage dealt by the deity’s favored weapon. The godblood ooze attacks the characters relentlessly.</p><p><em><strong>Passing the Test.</strong></em> When the statue is struck with the deity’s favored weapon, it crumbles to dust and the door to @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t4.-inner-sanctum]{T4. Inner Sanctum} opens. The door also opens if the characters destroy the ooze.</p><h4>T4. Inner Sanctum</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>The door swings open to reveal a square chamber with an altar at the far end.</p></blockquote><p>The temple’s innermost sanctum holds the temple’s final prize. This could be a holy relic, a sacred text, or even a holy person or celestial being who can aid the characters on a quest or help them atone for a sin. It might also just be a place where they can beseech their deity of choice for a miracle.</p><p><em><strong>Holy Relics.</strong></em> If you decide that the Inner Sanctum contains a holy relic, you can use the following suggestions based on the temple’s deity or deities:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Chaos.</strong> An erratic <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.Ni64pt8WkZBNPOZc]{skeptic’s shelter}</em>.</p><p><strong>Darkness.</strong> The sinister <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.bLY1uIe52TZKQk2C]{Staff of the Skull Cult}</em>.</p><p><strong>Light/Peace.</strong> A benevolent <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.mu6KBzeHNJwCQWKG]{martyr’s amulet}</em>.</p><p><strong>Order/War.</strong> The legendary sword <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.VEsgOd94knwcSwR4]{Bedlam}</em>.</p></div><h3>Adjusting Difficulty</h3><p>The Temple of Three Challenges is written to fit a party of 3rd- to 11th-level adventurers and assumes that the party doesn’t take a long rest while inside the temple. Below is specific advice for adjusting the challenges within the temple to various levels:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Levels 3–5.</strong> At most, each character is confronted by 1 <strong>soulsplinter sprite</strong> in area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t2.-test-of-kinship]{T2} and the statue in area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t3.-test-of-mettle]{T3} dissolves into 1 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.3jJAT18IRYOn68rV]{godblood ooze}</strong>.</p><p><strong>Levels 6–8.</strong> At most, each character is confronted by 2 <strong>soulsplinter sprites</strong> in area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t2.-test-of-kinship]{T2} and the statue in area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t3.-test-of-mettle]{T3} dissolves into 2 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.3jJAT18IRYOn68rV]{godblood oozes}</strong>.</p><p><strong>Levels 9–11.</strong> At most, each character is confronted by 3 <strong>soulsplinter sprites</strong> in area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t2.-test-of-kinship]{T2} and the statue in area @UUID[.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44#t3.-test-of-mettle]{T3} dissolves into 4 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.3jJAT18IRYOn68rV]{godblood oozes}</strong>.</p></div></div>"

        "Tomb of the Undying": {
          "name": "Tomb of the Undying",
          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h1\">Tomb of the Undying</p><p>In a long forgotten tomb, followers of the Lord of Death buried a revered priest along with her trusted disciples – and some of their treasure. Unfortunately for the priest, a spiteful curse prevents her spirit from continuing on to the afterlife and her god’s embrace. Now her spirit lingers in her tomb, a resentful sliver of her former self, waiting to be freed.</p><h3>Finding the Tomb</h3><p>The Tomb of the Undying is marked only by its nondescript entrance: a small hillock with a dirty, marred bronze door that seems impossible to open. Whether tucked away deep in a forest or on a desolate plain, few travelers ever come by the tomb – and most of those who do immediately sense the darkness that surrounds it and give it a wide berth.</p><h3>General Features</h3><p>The Tomb of the Undying has the following general features unless otherwise noted:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The ceilings are 15 feet high.</p><p><strong>Illumination.</strong> The interior of the tomb is cast in complete darkness.</p><p><strong>Uneasy Rest.</strong> At the end of each hour a creature spends within the tomb, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion.</p><p><strong>Walls.</strong> All walls within the tomb are enchanted, making it impossible to move through them using magic, such as with the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.PQuEgKyCdovOvhqN]{etherealness}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}</em>.</p></div><h3>Locations in the Tomb</h3><p>The following locations are keyed to the Tomb of the Undying Map.</p><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/maps/undying-border.webp\" /><h4>T1. Entrance</h4><p>As the characters find the tomb’s entrance, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A bronze door stands alone in a small, rocky hillside, so overgrown with vines it’s easy to miss despite its size. Letters and symbols glow faintly underneath the dirt and plants covering the door’s surface.</p></blockquote><p>The door is sealed with an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{arcane lock}</em>, is impervious to damage, and can’t be forced open unless the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{arcane lock}</em> is suppressed with a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic} spell or similar magic.</p><p><em><strong>Door Riddle.</strong></em> A character who approaches the door can make out faint letters on its surface. If the vines are cleared away, a rhyme in Common becomes visible:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>From mother’s womb to resting tomb,<br />One truth will all consume,<br />To open this gate, speak its name,<br />As you rest your palm upon my frame.</p></blockquote><p>To open the door, a creature must touch the door or its frame and speak the word “death” in any language. As they do so, the door slowly swings open with a slight rumble. If a creature touches the door and utters an incorrect word or phrase, each creature touching the door takes [[/r 2d8]] Necrotic damage.</p><p><em><strong>Door Symbols.</strong></em> A character who investigates the door can make an Intelligence (Arcana, History or Religion) check to learn the following:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>DC 10.</strong> Most of the symbols depict various stages of life. The symbols on the left side of the door depict youth while those on the right side depict old age.</p><p><strong>DC 13.</strong> The symbols on the door depict the passage to the afterlife and an ancient symbol used by followers of the Lord of Death is at its center.</p></div><h4>T2. Entrance Room</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>The cold, dust-covered stone floor of this room narrows down into a hallway to the east. A marble statue standing near the northern wall depicts a robed figure holding a scale in a skeletal hand. The entirety of the southern wall is a mural of a peasant in the various stages of life from birth to deathbed.</p></blockquote><p>The thick layer of dust that covers the floor makes it apparent that no one has stepped here for years.</p><p><em><strong>Statue of Death.</strong></em> A character who investigates the statue and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes it as a depiction of the Lord of Death. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also knows that the god’s worshipers tend to view death as a natural part of life that should be embraced rather than feared.</p><p><em><strong>Death’s Blessing.</strong></em> A character who makes a gesture of reverence toward the statue is unaffected by the temple’s Uneasy Rest (see @UUID[.TGoUWCjSNA5AQ802#general-features]{General Features}) and gains resistance to Necrotic damage for 1 hour. Depending on how the Lord of Death is perceived in the world, gestures of reverence may include:</p><ul><li><p>Singing a well-known dirge often sung at funerals.</p></li><li><p>Uttering the phrase: “<em>We fear not to die for death is life, with grace we embrace when the end is nigh.</em>”</p></li><li><p>Placing a single gold piece on the scale.</p></li></ul><h4>T3. Hallway of Seasons</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A dark hallway with cobwebs stretching from wall to wall leads further east into another room. Each of the stone tiles that fill the hallway is dyed with either a faint yellow, green, red, or blue color. Above the entrance is a golden plate etched with intricate letters.</p></blockquote><p>The hallway leads onwards for 60 feet to area @UUID[.TGoUWCjSNA5AQ802#t4.-servants-crypt]{T4. Servant’s Crypt}.</p><p><em><strong>Golden Plate.</strong></em> The golden plate above the hallway’s entrance is written in Common and reads:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Here lies Alaïne Zeldir, disciple in life, saint in death.<br />Quick like blossoming spring, healthy like summer in full, swift like the winds of fall, hard like winter’s ice.<br />Those who wish to pay their respects must walk with hallowed steps through the passage of time.</p></blockquote><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Trap.</strong></em> Each of the colored tiles on the floor (see the Tomb of the Undying Map) represents a season. To pass the hallway unscathed, a character must step on the tiles in the order of the seasons, starting with spring (yellow), leading to summer (green), then autumn (red), and then winter (blue), and then repeating the cycle. If a creature steps out of order at any point, it suffers one of the following effects, depending on the tile’s color:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Yellow (Spring).</strong> The creature takes [[/r 1d8]] Poison damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be Poisoned for 1 hour.</p><p><strong>Green (Summer).</strong> The creature takes [[/r 2d8]] Fire damage.</p><p><strong>Red (Autumn).</strong> The creature takes [[/r 1d8]] Necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its Strength score is reduced by [[/r 1d4]] for 1 hour.</p><p><strong>Blue (Winter).</strong> The creature takes [[/r 1d8]] Cold damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved for 1 hour.</p></div><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Remembering Alaïne.</strong></em> Upon reading the name Alaïne Zeldir, any character proficient in History or Religion can make a Intelligence (History or Religion) check. Depending on how well they roll, they may remember the following information:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>DC 13.</strong> The character remembers that Alaïne Zeldir was an elven priest famous for sacrificing her own youth to lift a curse that held a large area in an everlasting state of winter many centuries ago.</p><p><strong>DC 15.</strong> The character also remembers that Alaïne was called the Priest of the Seasons and always wore yellow clothes in spring, green in summer, red in autumn, and blue in winter.</p></div><h4>T4. Servants' Crypt</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A large stone sarcophagus stands in each corner of this room which connects to a hallway to the west and to the east.</p></blockquote><p>This room leads east to @UUID[.TGoUWCjSNA5AQ802#t5.-tomb-corridor]{T5. Tomb Corridor} and west to @UUID[.TGoUWCjSNA5AQ802#t3.-hallway-of-seasons]{T3. Hallway of Seasons}.</p><p><em><strong>Sarcophagi.</strong></em> Alaïne Zeldir’s closest followers were laid to rest in the four sarcophagi. The lid of each sarcophagus is carved with a mosaic of a humanoid priest wearing a yellow, green, red, or blue robe, respectively. The heavy, dust-covered lids can be pushed aside as an action by one or more creatures with a combined Strength score of 15 or higher.</p><p><em><strong>Disturbing the Sarcophagi.</strong></em> While Alaïne Zeldir’s followers have long since passed, their sarcophagi are now guarded by four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.lfW2YW6XmsjcMXh2]{spirit wards}</strong>. If a character attempts to push the lid off a sarcophagus or otherwise disturbs it, the floating, glowing spirits emerge from the sarcophagi and an otherworldly voice fills the room: “You disturb the slumber of the dead! Here lie Aiel, Ezka, Fienor, and Gramlich – do not sully their graves. Be gone, thieves!”</p><p><em><strong>Peaceful Solution.</strong></em> A character who tries to convince the spirits that they didn’t mean to disturb the graves or gives a compelling argument for their presence can make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. On a success, the spirits calm down and explain that they are servants of the Lord of Death bound to protect the dead priests’ earthly remains and therefore can’t leave the room or let the characters open the sarcophagi. However, the spirits sense something has prevented Alaïne Zeldir from passing to the afterlife and urge the characters to find her resting place in the tomb and figure out the cause.</p><p><em><strong>Combat.</strong></em> If the characters fail to convince the spirits of their good intentions, the spirits attack with lethal intent and fight until destroyed or until the characters leave the tomb.</p><p><em><strong>Secret Tunnel.</strong></em> A character who investigates the walls and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices a stone that protrudes slightly from the room’s northern wall. If the stone is pushed in, a section of the wall slides back to reveal a narrow tunnel sloping downwards for 20 feet to area @UUID[.TGoUWCjSNA5AQ802#t7.-alaines-tomb]{T7. Alaïne’s Tomb}.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Each sarcophagus contains a skeletal corpse holding a holy symbol set with a small emerald, ruby, sapphire, and topaz worth 100 gp each.</p><h4>T5. Tomb Corridor</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>This corridor leads to a heavy wooden door lit by a torch on each side of the door. The door and torch stands are covered in strange symbols.</p></blockquote><p>The door at the end of the corridor is sealed with an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{arcane lock}</em> spell, is impervious to all damage, and can’t be forced open unless the magic is suppressed with @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic} or similar magic. On each side of the door is a magical torch with a heatless flame that functions like a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MK6gpQMeDFo0cP9f]{continual flame}</em> spell and sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The torches can’t be removed or dispelled.</p><p><em><strong>Door Puzzle.</strong></em> The following text is written in Common on the door’s frame:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>One flame for those of age,<br />another for youth,<br />Touch each to break the gate,<br />and move on through.</p></blockquote><p>If the youngest character in the party touches the flame of the torch to the left, or if the oldest character in the party touches the flame of the torch to the right, the torch’s flame changes to a pleasant blue light for 1 minute. If both torches shed blue light, the door swings open and each creature within 30 feet of the door gains the effect of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8dzaICjGy6mTUaUr]{bless}</em> spell for 1 hour.</p><p>If a creature that isn’t the youngest present touches the flame to the left, or if a creature that isn’t the oldest present touches the one to the right, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of Exhaustion as the torches flare with red light. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature also ages by a tenth of its maximum lifespan. This effect can be reversed with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}</em> spell or similar magic.</p><p><em><strong>Understanding the Symbols.</strong></em> A character who investigates the door and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana, History or Religion) check realizes that the symbols on the handle of the torch on the left depict youth and vitality, while the symbols on the torch on the right depict age and wisdom.</p><h4>T6. False Tomb</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A stone sarcophagus covered in dust rests atop a 3-foot-tall bier in the center of this otherwise empty room. The lid of the sarcophagus is decorated with a carving of a beautiful woman who looks to be sleeping serenely.</p></blockquote><p>The lid of the sarcophagus is impossible to move, and in truth, the entire sarcophagus is a single piece of solid stone. It is, in fact, a decoy meant to entrap any who would dare disturb Alaïne’s eternal rest.</p><p><em><strong>Puzzle.</strong></em> A character who approaches the sarcophagus notices words carved on the sarcophagus in Common:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>To break the seal, blood must seep,<br />Stretch your hand, let me feed.</p></blockquote><p>This rhyme hints that a character should cut themselves and let their blood drop unto the carved face’s lips. If a character does so, nothing happens until they touch their hand to the carved lips, upon which a mechanism shaped like a fanged mouth shoots forth from the lid and snaps its maw around the character’s wrist. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take [[/r 3d8]] Piercing damage and be Restrained (escape DC 18). At the start of each of its turns while Restrained in this way, the creature takes [[/r 2d8]] Necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be cursed.

The trap magically resets after 1 hour.</p><p><em><strong>Secret Tunnel.</strong></em> A character who investigates the area around the sarcophagus and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices that the bier it stands on is loose. The bier and sarcophagus can be pushed aside with a successful DC 15 Strength check, revealing a narrow, dark tunnel leading to area @UUID[.TGoUWCjSNA5AQ802#t7.-alaines-tomb]{T7. Alaïne’s Tomb}.</p><h4>T7. Alaïne’s Tomb</h4><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>An overwhelming smell of death and decay fills up this dark room with web-covered murals on the walls. A single coffin rests on a bier next to the northernmost wall.</p></blockquote><p>Alaïne Zeldir’s corpse lies in the sarcophagus, but her soul has turned into a vengeful wraith due to the accursed <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.ZOmA3I6ZOw5Al2x1]{ring of the undying}</em> a spiteful rival put on the priest’s finger before she was laid to rest.</p><p><em><strong>Vengeful Wraith.</strong></em> Once all characters have entered the room, or as soon as a character approaches Alaïne’s casket, the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.98snb7Vtc94MJchZ]{death wraith}</strong> emerges from the sarcophagus and attacks the nearest character as its sinister voice fills the room: “You dare disturb my tomb? Now, embrace the gift of death I couldn’t have!”</p><p>The wraith fights until it is destroyed or until the characters flee from the tomb. If the characters kill the wraith, its shadowy form dissolves into a dark mist and retracts into Alaïne’s coffin.</p><p><em><strong>Alaïne’s Coffin.</strong></em> If the characters open the coffin, they find Alaïne’s corpse in pristine condition – as if she had died minutes ago instead of centuries. She wears a jet-black ring that seems to pull in the light around it. If a character removes the ring from Alaïne’s finger, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Shadowy mist rises from the dead priest’s chest and the translucent form of a beautiful woman manifests before you. “Thank you, strangers,” the specter murmurs, its voice barely more than a whisper. “The ring prevented my spirit from leaving this world – a parting ‘gift’ given to me by a spiteful rival. Thank you for allowing me to finally seek out my Lord’s embrace.” The spirit then looks up and draws a last sigh of relief before slowly fading away.</p></blockquote><p>Once Alaïne’s spirit has been freed, each character in the tomb gains a @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.Vy0G6JFW7QGBAF6l]{Divine Boon of Vitality} that lasts for 7 days.</p><p><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> Alaïne Zeldir’s has a <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.ZOmA3I6ZOw5Al2x1]{ring of the undying}</em> on her skeletal finger.</p><h3>Adjusting Difficulty</h3><p>As written, the Tomb of the Undying is suitable for a party of four 7th-level adventures. Below is advice on adjusting the adventure’s difficulty to specific levels:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Levels 5–6.</strong> Reduce DCs by 2 and halve damage dealt by curses and traps.

We try to do so in a way where information is as generally and easily applicable as possible.

That things are logical and organized – like cogs in a great machine, where every individual knows their place and purpose, and which way they should turn. In a world inhabited by fantastical species and creatures, and spellcasters who constantly test the boundaries of reality, the pursuit of order is certainly understandable.</p><p>Some take that pursuit to an extreme, as they seek to bring the Maker’s perfect order to the mortal world. One such cult, the Ordo Creatoris, was established when the mysterious Arcanumicon, a large, magical machine, was uncovered. Though they don’t quite know its purpose, the cultists see the Arcanumicon’s ability to inspire rationality in mortals as a means to achieving the perfect world order they crave.</p></div><div class=\"artisan-box\"><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">ORDO CREATORIS OVERVIEW</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cult</strong></td><td>Followers of the Maker who draw power from a mysterious machine</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Goals</strong></td><td>To bring perfect order and rationality to the Mortal World</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Methods</strong></td><td>Clandestine ploys, such as spreading <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.XW67Qcc3ImFY0bc4]{amulets of rationality}</em> and using arcamantium to fuel the Arcanumicon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Structure &amp; Position</strong></td><td>The Ordo has a strict hierarchical structure.

Unsurprisingly, the cult has clear, outlined plans for how that goal will be accomplished.</p><h5>Mindful Machinations</h5><p>Through the power of the Arcanumicon, the Ordo Creatoris has discovered how to craft <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.XW67Qcc3ImFY0bc4]{amulets of rationality}</em>. These amulets are fashioned from crystals created by the Arcanumicon and they imbue those who wear them with intellect and rationality.</p><p>Crafting the amulets drains the Arcanumicon’s powers, so the Ordo Creatoris has a limited supply. They place these precious amulets around the necks of powerful sovereigns who will then rule their respective domains with logic and reason. Most of the time, they try to win the sovereign’s favor and highlight the benefits of the amulet, so the subject willingly chooses to wear it. If that fails, the Ordo Creatoris has been known to coerce unwilling subjects with violence or magic, though such methods gall them.</p><h5>The Mysterious Machine</h5><p>The thing that truly distinguishes the Ordo Creatoris’ members from other mortals devoted to the Maker, is the Arcanumicon. This huge construction of crystal and metal, that defies mortal comprehension, was unearthed long ago from deep beneath the ground.</p><p>The Ordo Creatoris has gone to great lengths to keep the Arcanumicon’s location secret. Through extensive research, the cult has discovered that the machine can be fed with arcamantium, a rare substance found in small caches deep in the ground. The locations of these caches at first seemed random, but the Ordo has discovered that their positions follow a pattern that makes it possible to calculate with precision where each cache will be. The Ordo Creatoris believes that, by fueling the machine with arcamantium, they can eventually activate it and bring about a miracle that will cast the world into perfect order. In truth, they have no proof of the validity of this belief.</p><h3>Structure &amp; Position</h3><p>The Ordo Creatoris exists outside the Maker’s church. Its existence isn’t a secret in itself, but its true goals and methods are. Most civilized societies see the cult as harmless, though some followers of the Maker who know of the Arcanumicon see the cult’s devotion to the magical machine as idolatry and dangerous heresy.</p><h5>Single-Celled Organism</h5><p>It is not only the Ordo Creatoris’ specific faith that is centered around the Arcanumicon; the cult itself is also physically centered around it. Even though the cult is geographically centralized, it has a wide reach, as it sends small groups or even single agents to spread the tenets of order to new subjects – typically by finding suitable subjects to receive an <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.XW67Qcc3ImFY0bc4]{amulet of rationality}</em> – or to seek out and secure caches of arcamantium.</p><h3>Followers &amp; Leaders</h3><p>The Ordo Creatoris is a small cult with relatively few, but diverse, followers. The only creatures that aren’t allowed within its ranks are the intrinsically chaotic, such as demons and other denizens of the Lower Planes. As for talents, followers of the Ordo Creatoris are most often inventors, tinkers, and intellectuals, typically artificers, clerics, and wizards, but also a fair share of monks and paladins take up the cause.</p><h5>Ranks &amp; Hierarchy</h5><p>The Ordo Creatoris has a clear and logical hierarchy that is structured to perfectly disseminate orders and information through its ranks. At the head of the Ordo is the Unarch, the cult’s unquestioned leader – currently the venerable Ajo Enath – whose word is law. The Unarch directly commands two Duarchs, who in turn each command four Quartarchs, who each command up to eight Octarchs. If the cult grows further, the Ordo Creatoris would expand to create an additional rank of sixteen Sedecimarchs, and so on.</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">The Ordo Creatoris' Ranks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Activities</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Octarch</td><td>Lowest of the Ordo, the Octarchs act as enforcers and infiltrators</td></tr><tr><td>Quartarch</td><td>Quartarchs typically oversee cult activity in a certain region</td></tr><tr><td>Duarch</td><td>Each Duarch oversees one branch of activity: the deployment of <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.XW67Qcc3ImFY0bc4]{amulets of rationality}</em> and the gathering of arcamantium, respectively</td></tr><tr><td>Unarch</td><td>The Unarch oversees the Ordo’s web of activities and maintains oversight over the Arcanumicon</td></tr></tbody></table><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/ui/ajo-enath.webp\" class=\"hgdd-img\" /><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Unarch Ajo Enath</h5><p>At the top of the Ordo Creatoris’ organizational pyramid is Unarch Ajo Enath. As a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.eiifqZwYGi71r2Yl]{medusa}</strong>, Ajo Enath was initially devoted to order only as far as they enjoyed lording minions around in their cave lair and “establishing order” by turning dissenters into stone.</p><p>As it happened, Ajo’s cave-dwelling was near to where the Arcanumicon lay dormant in the ground. Over time, the machine’s order-infused energy seeped through the stones, slowly increasing the medusa’s intelligence and rational abilities. When Ajo Enath eventually sought out the cultists, the medusa already felt a part of the machine and easily found a place in the cult’s ranks. Since then, Ajo has grafted crystal produced by the Arcanumicon into their own flesh, further continuing their ascendance from chaos and savagery to perfect order and rationality.</p><p>Ajo Enath became the leader of the Ordo Creatoris when the previous leader was slain by a treacherous devil. Driven not only by a desire to see order triumph over chaos, but also a personal desire to rule over others, it was Ajo who came up with the plan to devote some of the Arcanumicon’s magical energies to convert powerful individuals into rational, lawful beings that could spread order and aid the Ordo’s cause.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Roleplaying Ajo Enath</p><p>Their slate-gray skin specked with fluorescent crystals set in symmetrical patterns and with snake-hair bound into an orderly knot, Ajo Enath is simultaneously beautiful and imposing.

Once a mindless automaton, Kay-Ûl was infused with crystals from the Arcanumicon, which granted it true sentience – and further underlined its devotion to order and structure.</p><p>While some among the Ordo Creatoris see Kay-Ûl as a transgression against a natural order – golems, after all, were made to obey, not to think for themselves – Ajo Enath recognizes Kay-Ûl’s unique talents and abilities. With the medusa’s favor, Kay-Ûl has risen through the Ordo’s ranks to become a Quartarch in command of a squad of other sentient constructs.</p><p>Obedient, rational, and imbued with immense physical power, Kay-Ûl and its Octarchs are Ajo Enath’s most fearsome enforcers. They are deployed only in extreme situations, such as when a rebellious sovereign who has definitively spurned the Ordo’s efforts to “bless” them with rationality needs to be “convinced,” or when agents of chaos that meddle in the Ordo’s affairs must be destroyed. Kay-Ûl always approaches such tasks with cool rationality and fearless cunning, performing its tasks to the letter – but with an ability to improvise that most golems do not possess.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Roleplaying Quartarch Kay-Ûl</p><p>Kay-Ûl is a nine feet tall construct of stone embedded with fluorescent crystals. It moves with heavy, grinding steps – though it can move swiftly when it has to.

Would you care to remove your crown before I begin – it would be a shame to break it, don’t you agree?”</p></blockquote><h3>Quest Hook</h3><p>The characters may become entangled with the Ordo Creatoris through the following quest hook.</p><h5>The King’s Decree</h5><p>The party is approached by Princess Ellia, who has sneaked out of her castle to find brave adventurers. She explains her predicament: her father, King Halstrom, who used to be a somewhat dim-witted man with a gentle and loving nature, has become cold and aloof in recent weeks. He has secluded himself, dismissed his advisors, and locked down the castle. Furthermore, he has promised Ellia’s hand in marriage to the chieftain of a nearby ogre tribe, implemented draconian laws, decreed higher taxes, and canceled funding of orphanages and shelters. Ellia pleads with the characters to discover what has happened to her father.</p><p>The characters can learn that mysterious envoys – an alabaster-skinned tiefling and a fair-haired human – have been visiting King Halstrom frequently in the past months. Further investigation reveals that these envoys have convinced King Halstrom to wear an <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.XW67Qcc3ImFY0bc4]{amulet of rationality}</em>, which is the cause of his transformation. They have also advised him to make peace with the ogres of the nearby tribe, so they can gain access to the cache of arcamantium the tribe jealously guards.</p><p>Through muscle, diplomacy, or stealth, the characters can find their way to the King and attempt to take the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.XW67Qcc3ImFY0bc4]{amulet of rationality}</em> from him – which will cause him to regain his senses and return to his normal self. Grateful, the King and his daughter give the characters a handsome reward of 5,000 gold pieces.</p><h3>Important Locations &amp; Objects</h3><p>There are a few locations that are of particular importance to the Ordo Creatoris, as well as objects they hold in high regard.</p><h5>Arcanumicon</h5><p>The Arcanumicon is of pivotal importance to the cult. This huge machine-like construct stands in a massive complex of caves deep underneath the ground. These caves serve as the Ordo Creatoris’ base and is home to Unarch Ajo Enath and a steady stream of cult agents traveling through. Its location is secret and the surrounding area is closely guarded, making it difficult for outsiders to reach the Arcanumicon.</p><h5>Amulets of Rationality</h5><p>These simple-looking gemstone amulets are at the heart of the cult’s operations. Each represents a strain put on the Arcanumicon and is thus only bestowed to powerful and influential individuals that can help further the Ordo Creatoris’ cause. The cult will go to great lengths to retrieve any amulets that go missing.</p><h5>The Sanctum Mechanicum</h5><p>The location of an ancient sanctum dedicated to the Maker has recently been uncovered. Believed to hold powerful artifacts created by the Maker’s faithful, both the Ordo Creatoris and the official church of the Maker are interested in taking control of the sanctum. Either faction may hire a group of adventures to delve within the sanctum – or oppose anyone who dares to trespass within the sacred halls. See @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.32fjLn55TZ4d9g3G.JournalEntryPage.UxQLnTxxrSfyc3y3]{Sanctum Mechanicum} for a description of the sanctum.</p></div>"

Only thus can we hope to be victorious.”</strong></em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>– Sunmaster Serenius</strong></em></p><div><p>From high priests who spend their days healing the sick to the stoic paladins who stride into battle with the knowledge that their lord’s light will protect or embrace them, the servants of the Dawnbringer are usually goodly, noble, and selfless individuals. There are those, however, among the Dawnbringer’s servants who do not believe that the Church of Light is doing enough. That the Dawnbringer’s decree to vanquish darkness supersedes all other concerns and responsibilities – even the lord’s other tenets of honor, purity, and compassion. In the eyes of these zealots – who are often considered extremists by their peers – darkness is winning the war against the light and has “shattered” the sun.</p></div><div class=\"artisan-box\"><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">SHATTERED SUN OVERVIEW</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sect</strong></td><td>Followers of the Lord of Light who are sworn to fight evil</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Goals</strong></td><td>To vanquish all evil, especially fiends and undead, by any means necessary</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Methods</strong></td><td>Ruthless violence and complete disregard for collateral damage</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Structure &amp; Position</strong></td><td>Decentralized into smaller cells within the official Church of Light, which regards it as dangerous but ultimately suffers its existence</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Followers</strong></td><td>Mostly clerics, paladins, and warriors</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Noteable NPCs</strong></td><td>Sunmaster Serenius, who leads the sect, and Dawnbreaker Emyra Morngrym</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Goals &amp; Methods</h3><p>The Shattered Sun has a single, clear goal: to seek out and eradicate darkness until only light and purity remain. They rank fiends and undead, and mortals who consort with such monsters, as the foulest of evils that must be eradicated by any means necessary.</p><h5>Warriors of the Light</h5><p>When members of the Shattered Sun say “by any means necessary,” they actually mean it. While quick to label others as evil-doers for the smallest infractions, they themselves do not shy away from wicked deeds if they believe it necessary to destroy a greater evil. As such, the Shattered Sun may choose to bolster the ranks of a wicked tyrant as long as he is dedicated to purging the land of undead, or be comfortable using innocent civilians as bait to lure forth the agents of evil.</p><p>This pragmatic approach to the war against darkness makes the Shattered Sun highly effective but also feared and even reviled by most other servants of light.</p><h3>Structure &amp; Position</h3><p>While the Shattered Sun has a unifying leader, Sunmaster Serenius, it is a decentralized sect. As a faith within a faith, small chapters or cells of Shattered Sun zealots exist within the ranks of most of the Church of Light’s temples and clergies.</p><h5>The Light Within</h5><p>Though often viewed with concern by other members of the Church of Light, the sect hasn’t been outlawed by the church’s leadership. To avoid taking an official stance that might widen the schism in the church even further, it’s been left up to each individual congregation how they handle members of the Shattered Sun.</p><p>In some temples, the zealots can proudly flaunt their affiliation with the sect and still achieve high ranks within the clergy. Most of the time, however, members of the Shattered Sun keep their true allegiance hidden while among their less extreme peers, or leave the Dawnbringer’s official clergy to strike out in small bands of warriors who fight evil on their own terms.</p><h3>Followers &amp; Leaders</h3><p>The ranks of the Shattered Sun are comprised mostly of paladins and clerics but also count fighters, monks, and rangers among their numbers. The only prerequisite is that followers are fully dedicated – and able – to combat the forces of darkness wherever they may be. The Shattered Sun also welcomes members of any ancestry except for tieflings, whom they believe to be inherently tainted by darkness and evil due to their fiendish bloodline.</p><h5>Ranks &amp; Hierarchy</h5><p>Decentralized as it is, the Shattered Sun is typically found in smaller chapters ranging from a handful to a couple dozen members. The servants of the Shattered Sun use ranks and titles that mirror the ranks of the official church of the Dawnbringer, except they call themselves “zealots” instead of “servants.”</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">The Shattered Sun Ranks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Activities</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Zealot</td><td>The rank-and-file of the sect often serving much like soldiers</td></tr><tr><td>Dawnbreaker</td><td>An officer in command of a small cell or squad of zealots</td></tr><tr><td>Dawnlord</td><td>A commander in control of a smaller temple or platoon of zealots</td></tr><tr><td>Sunmaster</td><td>The highest rank reserved for leaders of large temples that oversee an entire region</td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Sunmaster Serenius</h5><p>The unofficial leader of the Shattered Sun is Sunmaster Serenius, a fiercely militaristic and highly-regarded silver dragonborn paladin who’s fought countless battles against evil. Sunmaster Serenius is the head of a temple that consists solely of clerics and paladins loyal to the Shattered Sun. Even though Sunmaster Serenius has long ago declared that he answers only to the Dawnbringer, the Church of Light’s formal leadership has yet to expunge him, as they fear doing so would cause the schism within the Dawnbringer’s clergy to widen. Thus, Serenius is left to spread his extreme views to an ever-growing circle of zealots.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Roleplaying Sunmaster Serenius</p><p>Serenius is a gruff, no-nonsense silver dragonborn of about 50 years.

Fondly dubbed the “Blood Dawn” by her peers, Emyra is famous for her prowess in battle and the zeal and fervor with which she fights the forces of darkness.</p><p>Young, brash, and confident, Emyra could easily be mistaken for the daughter of a noble house or an ambitious city official – were it not for the stern set of her brow and the prominent scars criss-crossing her handsome face. Though only in her mid-twenties, Emyra has seen dozens of battles, lost dear comrades, and brought down unspeakable evils. While many would shy from such a life, Emyra is simply fulfilling the vow she made as a child, when her family was ruthlessly slaughtered by roaming undead: to cleanse the world of the scourge of evil!</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Roleplaying Dawnbreaker Emyra</p><p>Emyra is a serious but courteous human woman in her mid-twenties. Emyra’s striking red hair and prominent scars make her stand out in any crowd.

But that day is far in the future still.”</p></blockquote><h3>Quest Hooks</h3><p>The zealots of the Shattered Sun are involved in many different schemes, which could see them cross paths with a party of heroes.</p><h5>Led Astray</h5><p>Sir Hodric Aegknush, an old dwarven cleric of the Dawnbringer, is appalled to see that his favored student, the half-elf cleric Timaziel, has left his position at the local temple to strike out with the zealots of the Shattered Sun. Hoping to steer his pupil away from the path of extremism before it’s too late, Hodric offers the characters 100 gp if they can track down Timaziel and convince him to return.</p><p>Finding Timaziel and his brethren from the Shattered Sun Cult in the rugged badlands proves a difficult, but not impossible, task. As long as the characters don’t provoke the zealots, they are free to talk with Timaziel, who explains that he’s mostly involved with the cult because he’s fallen head-over-heels in love with Dawnbreaker Emyra. The characters may be able to convince the young man that he’s being foolish – the Dawnbreaker clearly has no interest in him – but before they can convince him to return, the zealots and the characters are assaulted by a horde of undead creatures. If he survives, the ordeal convinces Timaziel to return with the characters.</p><h5>Trouble on the Road</h5><p>The characters are approached by Mayor Engbal, a middle-aged halfling woman with a shrewd mind and pleasant demeanor. The mayor is troubled because rogue knights have taken to extorting travelers and merchants going into and out of the town. Camped by the main trade road, these self-proclaimed zealots maintain that they protect the town and surrounding lands from evil – and demand that anyone who utilizes the roads pay a fee for their continued services.</p><p>While Engbal sees this as extortion, the zealots themselves are adamant that the mandatory fee is necessary to keep the zealots provisioned and fed as they fight the evil creatures that roam the countryside. That they are fighting evil is true enough – there have been far fewer accounts of monsters and actual brigands in the past months. Even so, the band of Shattered Sun zealots, who are led by Emyra Morngrym, are scaring the townsfolk and slowing trade to a trickle. Engbal offers a reward of 50 gold pieces to the characters if they can seek out these zealots and chase them off or convince them to stop demanding their toll.</p><p>See @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.VGtnPKF9BD1kVTt3.JournalEntryPage.Ln4QZCswCMoVuBd3]{Shattered Sun Zealots} for a description of the encounter, which can help set up a confrontation with the zealots.</p><h5>Important Locations &amp; Objects</h5><p>The Shattered Sun zealots revere every temple, shrine, and relic that was made in devotion to the Dawnbringer, but have a particular connection to the Temple of the Unquenchable Light and the legendary <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.fEzvasSvoMBGUV1s]{Dawnbringer’s Crown}</em>.</p><h5>Temple of The Unquenchable Light</h5><p>Located on the outskirts of a large city, the Temple of the Unquenchable Light stands as a bastion against darkness; or so, at least, Sunmaster Serenius describes his home. With towering walls made from alabaster stone, the Temple of the Unquenchable Light is as much fortress as it is a place of worship. Plate-clad paladins patrol its hallways alongside pious priests, all equally fervent in their worship of the Dawnbringer and their devotion to Sunmaster Serenius and the Shattered Sun. If one wanted to attack the heart of the sect, there is no better place to do it, though such an endeavor would surely be tantamount to suicide.</p><h5>The Dawnbringer’s Crown</h5><p>Legends hold that a powerful crown was once forged by one of the Dawnbringer’s solars. Marvelously made and imbued with a sliver of divine essence, the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.fEzvasSvoMBGUV1s]{Dawnbringer’s Crown}</em> has long been lost to the annals of history. Sunmaster Serenius has not given up hope of finding the crown, as he believes such an artifact would both help in the war against darkness and increase his authority and gravitas, perhaps even enough to claim complete control of the Church of Light.</p><p>You can run the relic hunt @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.32fjLn55TZ4d9g3G.JournalEntryPage.nVXoyA9hSEiNccIM]{Shrine of the Rising Sun} if you want the characters to get involved with the Shattered Sun zealots. The characters could be hired by the official clergy to claim the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.fEzvasSvoMBGUV1s]{Dawnbringer’s Crown}</em> before the Shattered Sun gets their hands on it – which could see the heroes and zealots cross paths.</p></div>"

Even so, there are those among the Lady of Mercy’s servants who do not believe that peace can be achieved by peaceful means. There exists no clearer example of this than the Spear of Peace. Led by Zephimir, who was one of the Lady of Mercy’s most trusted <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.MA8tv04UaATBLRbv]{seraphs}</strong> before it fell from the deity’s heavenly home, this cult of fervent radicals strive to abolish war and eradicate any who break the peace.</p></div><div class=\"artisan-box\"><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">SPEAR OF PEACE OVERVIEW</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cult</strong></td><td>Followers of the seraph Zephimir, who formerly served the Lady of Mercy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Goals</strong></td><td>To bring about an eternal peace and eradicate all conflict and violence.

Even to other followers of the Lady of Mercy, this can sound naive and unrealistic, but to the followers of the Spear of Peace, it is a holy mission they take most seriously.</p><h5>Fighting Violence</h5><p>The Spear of Peace differs from other followers of the Lady of Mercy both in the scope of their ambitions and in their methods. With express permission from their leader, the seraph Zephimir, whom most members of the sect believe to be an emissary sent by the Lady of Mercy herself, followers of the Spear of Peace employ methods that would be reprehensible to most other agents of peace.</p><p>Where a regular servant of the Lady of Mercy serves the cause by aiding others with blessings and healing magic, members of the Spear of Peace see it as their divine duty to eradicate violence by any means necessary. They are even encouraged to seek out and destroy those who foster war – as long as reasonable efforts have been made at non-violent solutions first.</p><h5>Angelic Ascension</h5><p>Known only by the sect’s inner circle, Zephimir was not sent by the Lady of Mercy to act as her emissary in the Mortal World. In truth, Zephimir was exiled from the heavens because it defied the deity and used violence not in self-defense but as a preemptive measure. Though its banishment to the Mortal World was meant as a mercy – a less compassionate deity might have destroyed the rogue seraph outright – it only served to convince Zephimir that the Lady of Mercy was no longer fit to be the steward of peace.</p><p>In addition to its plans to bring about peace by any means, Zephimir is also slowly convincing the Lady of Mercy’s followers to direct their prayers to itself instead of the Lady of Mercy. Ultimately, Zephimir’s goal is to gather enough followers and become powerful enough to usurp the Lady of Mercy’s divine responsibilities and return to Celestia as the new God of Peace.</p><h3>Structure &amp; Position</h3><p>Despite their violent methods – or maybe because of them – the Spear of Peace has attracted many followers from within the Merciful Hands, the official church of the Lady of Mercy. In particular, those who pray to the Lady of Mercy because they were harmed or wronged by war or violence, and still hold resentment because of their experiences, see the Spear of Peace’s tenets as more palatable than pacifism. Conversely, others see it as a dangerous and misguided sect that is at odds with the Lady of Mercy’s tenets. A few even suspect the truth of Zephimir’s fall to the Mortal World.</p><h5>Cult Within a Sect</h5><p>The Spear of Peace is centered around the seraph Zephimir, who acts as sole arbiter of right and wrong, and who oversees all the sect’s plans and affairs. Most followers, however, believe Zephimir to be the Lady of Mercy’s proxy in the Mortal World. Only the seraph’s closest advisors know the truth and are aware of the seraph’s plans to usurp the Lady of Mercy’s divinity.</p><p>This inner circle, which Zephimir has dubbed its Disciples of Peace, is a full-fledged cult. Fully devoted to the seraph, the disciples are ruthless assassins and spies who work under the direct guidance of Zephimir. They are often sent to infiltrate the courts of militaristic sovereigns or warlords and convince them to abandon their plans of war – or assassinate them in cold blood, if they refuse.</p><h3>Followers &amp; Leaders</h3><p>The Spear of Peace attracts a varied crowd of individuals. The common denominator is a belief that peace is a goal worth fighting – and dying – for, and that war is inherently abhorrent and evil. There is a preponderance of clerics, monks, paladins, and military veterans among the sect’s ranks.</p><h5>Ranks &amp; Hierarchy</h5><p>The seraph Zephimir sits unquestioned at the top of the sect’s hierarchy, overseeing affairs as a dictator. Directly beneath it are the Disciples of Peace, who serve as the angel’s lieutenants, trusted advisors – and assassins. Lowest among the sect’s followers are the Palms of Peace, who spread the doctrine of the Spear of Peace and are, occasionally sent in groups to disseminate peace by force, such as by defending an innocent village from orc marauders or protecting a temple from roving bands of brigands.</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">The Spear of Peace's Ranks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Activities</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Palms</td><td>The rank and file who work to spread the cult’s tenets, recruit new members, and act as enforcers</td></tr><tr><td>Disciples</td><td>The Emissary’s advisors who are also secretly sent as assassins and spies to secure peace by any means</td></tr><tr><td>Emissary of Peace</td><td>The absolute and unquestioned leader of the Spear of Peace</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>Most folk like to believe that all angels are pristine, beautiful creatures.

Over the course of many millennia, Zephimir began to doubt that the Lady of Mercy would ever be successful in achieving her goals of peace through pacifistic and purely defensive measures.</p><p>When Zephimir argued that violence and ruthlessness might be a necessary evil, the Lady of Mercy dismissed its beliefs as dangerous. Eventually, things came to a head when Zephimir, acting on its own, attacked agents of evil and war to eradicate them before they could cause destruction. In her mercy, the Lady chose not to destroy the angel for its heresy and disobedience, and instead banished it to the Mortal World, in the hope that living among mortals would help de-radicalize the misguided angel.</p><p>Instead, the god’s foolish act of mercy – as Zephimir perceived it – served only to galvanize the seraph against her. Almost immediately, Zephimir begin gathering a cult around it, convincing them it was the god’s emissary, sent to guide them.

Perhaps to be rid of the latter, we must first vanquish the former?”</p></blockquote><h3>Quest Hooks</h3><p>As warriors for peace, there are many ways the characters and the cultists may become entangled with each other. Below are two such quests.</p><h5>Emissary Unmasked</h5><p>Archpriest Aunil, a female tiefling of some 50 years, has become suspicious of the Spear of Peace and their leader, Zephimir. Through communion with her deity, Aunil has gained hints that Zephimir is not a true servant of the Lady of Mercy, which the Emissary of Peace otherwise claims. Coupled with the cult’s less-than-peaceful methods and aggressive recruiting among the clergy, Aunil fears that Zephimir and the Spear of Peace is corrupting the Lady of Mercy’s faith.</p><p>Unable to have her suspicions definitively verified by the Lady of Mercy, Aunil is now looking for outsiders who will investigate the Spear of Peace and discover what Zephimir’s end goal is. Specifically, Aunil is looking for evidence that Zephimir is not the Lady of Mercy’s emissary, as it purports to be, so she can convince her peers among the Lady’s faithful to condemn and outlaw the cult. Aunil is willing to reward the characters with up to 2,000 gp or a rare magic item, at your discretion.</p><p>If the characters accept Aunil’s quest, they must find a way to get close to Zephimir, who doesn’t usually see outside petitioners. They may do so by trying to become members of the cult, which will see them scrutinized by the elf Keniziel, or they can attempt to sneak into the Peacekeeper’s Sanctuary, where Zephimir and his closest lieutenants reside.</p><h5>Death to the Tyrants</h5><p>A desperate noblewoman named Lady Elara Valmont seeks the help of a group of skilled adventurers. Lady Elara’s family has been targeted by assassins and two of her brothers have been slain. Elara believes that the family is being targeted because they control the production of armor and weapons in the region.</p><p>If the characters investigate the brothers’ belongings, they may find letters from an organization called the Spear of Peace, politely warning the Valmont family to cease the manufacture of weapons or suffer the consequences. The letters are signed by a Keniziel. This clue may lead the characters to Keniziel the Even-Handed and his band of cultists, or Keniziel may find the characters, as he continues to go after members of the Valmont family.</p><p>If the characters stop Keniziel and prevent further attacks against House Valmont, Lady Elara gives them a reward of up to 5,000 gold pieces.</p><h3>Important Locations &amp; Objects</h3><p>As a relatively new sect, the Spear of Peace doesn’t have a particular bond to many locations or objects – overall, Zephimir is more focused on its ascension to heaven than anything the Mortal World has to offer.</p><h5>Peacekeeper’s Sanctuary</h5><p>This ancient temple was built many millennia ago, although one would not guess so when looking at its pristine, white marble walls. A marvel of architecture, this circular, two-story temple is several hundred feet in diameter and can house dozens of followers at the same time. In the sanctuary’s center is a large, circular chapel where sermons are held at least once daily.</p><p>Zephimir usually resides within the Peacekeeper’s Sanctuary alongside its most trusted advisors and followers. Though the celestial does not need sleep or drink, it has claimed for itself the luxurious bedchambers of the sanctuary’s former archpriest, who “disappeared” mysteriously as most of the temple’s clergy joined the Spear of Peace. Zephimir sees petitioners here and uses the chamber to hold routine meetings with the Disciples of Peace.</p><h5>Martyr’s Amulets</h5><p>High-ranking clerics and paladins within the Spear of Peace often wear <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.mu6KBzeHNJwCQWKG]{martyr’s amulets}</em> which grant them the ability to absorb the pain of others. These amulets are blessed by Zephimir and given only to cultists who deliberately – and passionately – pray to the seraph in place of the Lady of Mercy.</p></div>"

Whether they want to unlock all magic’s secrets and become masters of their craft, or they desperately covet the ability to wield magic though they have no aptitude for it, members of the Unbound Weave are wholly dedicated to unleashing magical power.</p></div><div class=\"artisan-box\"><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Unbound Weave OVERVIEW</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cult</strong></td><td>Followers of the Goddess of Magic who believe magic is the most sacred marvel of all</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Goals</strong></td><td>To ensure that magic can be used freely and without restrictions, and is shared by as many people as possible</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Methods</strong></td><td>Chaotic, reckless operations that often involve unstable raw magic or dangerous magical artifacts</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Structure &amp; Position</strong></td><td>Completely decentralized with no formal leadership. Often outlawed by lawful societies</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Followers</strong></td><td>Mostly arcane spellcasters – bards, sorcerers, warlocks, wizards – but also common folk who wish to wield magic</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Noteable NPCs</strong></td><td>High Unraveler Mayhem, an anarchistic tiefling with delusions of grandeur</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Goals &amp; Methods</h3><p>The Unbound Weave has several, varying goals that all share a common thread: magical power should be spread and utilized as widely as possible, and as freely as possible. Where other sects dedicated to the Lady of the Weave aim to keep magic under control and prevent spellcasters from abusing their magical powers, the Unbound Weave strives toward the exact opposite: to imbue all sentient beings with magical powers and ensure that their use of magic is never fettered by petty concepts of law, morality, or responsibility.</p><h5>Dabblers in Raw Magic</h5><p>What makes the Unbound Weave most dangerous is its willingness to tamper with raw, wild magic. Where magic wielded by trained arcanists can be devastatingly destructive, it is typically bound to the caster’s will. Not so with raw magic, the pure, unstable essence of magical energy, which is not only unpredictable, but also capable of magically scarring those who touch it. It is a common practice among acolytes of the Unbound Weave, especially those who are not trained spellcasters, to seek out patches of raw magic – which often looks like blue, odorless fire – and willingly subject themselves to the azure flames in order to gain magical abilities. The more unscrupulous of the faithful will even subject unwitting victims to raw magic to “give them the gift of magic,” even though the touch of raw magic is fatal as often as not.</p><h5>Arcane Cabals</h5><p>Even if the Unbound Weave isn’t considered evil, its members are almost universally regarded as insane and dangerous. Thus, most acolytes of the Unbound Weave keep a low profile while working discreetly to further their goals. Usually, these acolytes form small cabals that infiltrate towns or cities where they try to turn other arcanists to their cause – or even murder any who might dare to oppose them.</p><p>Their hunger for magical power often leads acolytes of the Unbound Weave to ancient ruins, abandoned crypts, and other places where powerful relics might be found. They’re especially interested in locations that have been scarred by wild magic, such as the site of an ancient battle between archmages or a wizard’s tower that was contaminated by raw magic after an arcane experiment gone wrong.</p><h3>Structure &amp; Position</h3><p>Though the Lady of the Weave is usually considered a balancing force – a divine entity that keeps the weave of magic organized and enforces “safety measures” on its use – the Unbound Weave fully embraces the chaos of magic. As such, the sect’s organization is loose; it has no central leadership and instead consists of a scattering of small cells spread out across the lands.</p><h5>A Force for Change</h5><p>The perception of the Unbound Weave by other followers of the Lady of the Weave – and arcane spellcasters in general – varies, but most who aren’t arcanists view the sect as a dangerous, unpredictable element. Although many sorcerers and wizards can certainly empathize with the Unbound Weave’s core philosophy, few agree with the sect’s extreme measures and careless approach to the laws of society and magic.</p><p>Authorities that are aware of the Unbound Weave’s existence typically opt to ban the sect and persecute its members, as havoc and disaster almost always follow in its wake. Thus, most members of the Unbound Weave keep their affiliation to themselves – as far as they can, seeing that most bear prominent spellmarks or other magical deformities.</p><h3>Followers &amp; Leaders</h3><p>The Unbound Weave’s members have only one thing in common: they must be able to wield arcane magic in some capacity. That does not mean that followers must be spellcasters before they join – even a lowly commoner who is willing to risk their life by gaining an unstable spellmark may be welcomed by the sect.</p><h5>Ranks &amp; Hierarchy</h5><p>Though no central leadership exists, each cell or chapter of the sect has its own, loose hierarchy. Typically, those with no innate ability to cast spells but who have acquired their magical powers through spellmarks or similar “artificial” means, comprise the lowest ranks. Leaders are typically the most zealous, reckless, and, of course, powerful arcanists.</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">The Unbound Weave's Ranks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Activities</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Acolyte</td><td>Typically simple enforcers or infiltrators acting on orders from higher-ranked members</td></tr><tr><td>Unraveler</td><td>Agents with special talents operating within a cell but with some authority over acolytes</td></tr><tr><td>High Unraveler</td><td>The leader of a cell who lays the plans and issues orders to unravelers and acolytes</td></tr></tbody></table><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/ui/mayhem.webp\" class=\"hgdd-img\" /><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Mayhem</h5><p>Though he would object to being called a “leader,” there can be no doubt that Mayhem, a purple-skinned tiefling with a flair for theatrical, is an authority within the Unbound Weave. This is paradoxical, as Mayhem abhors authority in any form – just like he hates organization and hierarchy (though bossing other people around is fun enough, even if he can’t fathom why anyone would ever take orders from others).</p><p>With utter disregard for anyone’s safety and no time to listen to objections, Mayhem works tirelessly to ensure that every person gets to feel the exulting touch of magic – even if it kills them. <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.LUWNetSXff9litq8]{High Unraveler}</strong> Mayhem and his clique of fervent faithful have been linked to several magical catastrophes in the past years. One such operation left a whole village desolate after Mayhem broke a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.eM5gEe4SEOvA2Y9t]{staff of power}</em> in the city square in an attempt to infuse the townsfolk with arcane power!</p><p>Mayhem makes no secret of the fact that he loves the Lady of the Weave and that he believes the feeling is mutual – in fact, the tiefling often refers to the god as “my dear” or “my beloved.” Mayhem’s ultimate goal is to take his rightful place alongside the Lady of the Weave as her consort and lover.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Roleplaying MAYHEM</p><p>Mayhem is a handsome, charming tiefling with purple skin and prominent ram’s horns. He always wears exquisite clothing, often in hues of bright green, blue, and gold.

And there’s nothing more powerful than love!”</p></blockquote><h3>Quest Hooks</h3><p>The Unbound Weave are always concocting arcane schemes that inquisitive adventurers could easily become embroiled in.</p><h5>A Concerned Colleague</h5><p>The characters are approached by Gertrude Eight-Fingers, a middle-aged human wizard of some renown. Getrude is concerned that one of her wizardly colleagues, Ferron the Binder, has become embroiled with a dangerous crowd. It started when Ferron suffered weird, blue markings after a magical experiment went awry. At first, he seemed intent on finding a cure for his magical malady and even enlisted Gertrude’s help. During the past months, however, he’s become more withdrawn, claiming that his marks no longer trouble him. The few times he and Gertrude have spoken, he’s been almost manic, rambling about discovering “pure magic” and “uncovering the source.” Now, he’s stopped answering Getrude’s magical messages and his wizard’s tower has been sealed off.</p><p>Gertrude, who is timid and scholarly by nature, knows that his tower is well protected against intruders and wishes to hire the characters to go in and look for her old friend. She has a spell scroll that she believes can cure him, and offers the party a reward of 500 gp or an uncommon magic item if they agree to take the scroll and save Ferron from whatever they find.</p><p>If the characters venture within the tower, they will find a multitude of magical traps and guardians. In addition, the tower is rife with patches of unstable, wild magic. When they finally find Ferron, they find that he’s been rendered insane by the spellmarks that cover his body. Whether they destroy Ferron or cure him with Gertrude’s scroll, they also discover that Ferron was apparently in contact with a mysterious cult called the Unbound Weave – and that they are apparently planning something sinister.</p><h5>Something in the Water</h5><p>As the characters pass through a small city they notice that a lot of people are behaving erratically and random magical effects seem to occur without cause or reason. Suddenly, a man begins to levitate, floating upwards before dropping like a stone, and a spellcaster who tries to save the man ends up summoning a demon instead of casting a simple spell of flight. These events are not isolated, the party quickly learns; magical mishaps have begun happening with concerning frequency. Guard Captain Heinmill approaches the party and offers them 1,000 gp if they can help discover the cause of these events and put an end to them.</p><p>Through their investigation, the characters learn that secretive cultists are operating within the city, apparently under the supervision of someone called Mayhem. When they discover the cult’s lair in an abandoned magical asylum, they also find the reason behind the weird happenings: the cult has been pouring undiluted raw magic into the city’s water supply, imbuing the citizens with erratic and dangerous magical abilities. The party must either convince Mayhem to leave the town, defeat the cultists, or destroy the cultist’s cache of distilled raw magic.</p><h3>Important Locations &amp; Objects</h3><p>Decentralized as it is, the Unbound Weave doesn’t have a singular base of operations or compound. However, certain locations and objects are still are important to them and their goals.</p><h5>Mythwards</h5><p>Ancient, nearly indestructible, and imbued with incredible magical power, <em>mythwards</em> are huge artifacts that can spread powerful magic in a large area. Many of the Unbound Weave’s ploys are centered around utilizing mythwards to infuse whole areas and populations with magical power – a risky endeavor that often has catastrophic consequences.</p><h5>Raw Magic</h5><p>Sites where magical mishaps have happened, or where great magical power was unleashed in ancient times, can sometimes become infused with raw, unstable magic, also sometimes referred to as “spellfire.” Such locations are of great interest to the Unbound Weave’s agents, who sometimes harvest the raw magic to create <em>potions of raw magic</em> that can imbue individuals with erratic magical power for a limited time.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Wild magic in MIlando’s Guide</p><p>A mythward plays an essential role in the adventure Mythical Madness in <a href=\"https://eventyrgames.store/products/milandos-guide-to-magical-marvels\"><em>Milando’s Guide to Magical Marvels</em></a>, which also has <em>potions of raw magic</em>, and other magic items inspired by the concept of wild magic.</p></blockquote></div>"

As trade flourishes, and agriculture, forestry, and industry replace a more primal way of life, the people become wealthier and their lives become more interconnected.</p><p>There are those, however, who do not view civilization as progress or think material wealth should be celebrated. Instead, they see forests being cleared to make space for towns or to fuel the furnaces of industry, and rivers and lakes drying up as ever-growing settlements drain the resources of the land.</p><p>Chief among these self-proclaimed “enemies of civilization” is the Verdant Path, a fanatical cult of druids, rangers, shamans, and various intelligent beasts, fey, plants, and monstrosities, whose affection for nature has been turned into a hatred of civilization.</p></div><div class=\"artisan-box\"><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">VERDANT PATH OVERVIEW</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cult</strong></td><td>Followers of the Earthmother who believe civilization is a cancer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Goals</strong></td><td>To protect nature by destroying civilization wherever it encroaches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Methods</strong></td><td>Sabotage and subterfuge, including violent raids and ambushes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Structure &amp; Position</strong></td><td>Divided into smaller circles with one formal leader, and feared by most settlements that are aware of them</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Followers</strong></td><td>Druids, rangers, fey, and others who revere and cherish nature</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Noteable NPCs</strong></td><td>The cult’s leader, Eilunêth the Dryad Queen, who is a fanatical dryad with a deep-seated hatred for civilization</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Goals &amp; Methods</h3><p>The Verdant Path has two goals, though the cult views them as one and the same: to protect and preserve nature by eradicating civilization. The first part, preservation of nature, is a tenet that all who worship the Earthmother can subscribe to. It is the second part, to destroy civilization, that sets the cult apart, defines its radical methods, and makes it extremely dangerous.</p><h5>Nature Ascendant</h5><p>The Verdant Path sees civilization as a destructive force that must be vanquished in order for nature to thrive. To that end, the Verdant Path is ruthless. Though most of their number hold no ill will against the simple farmers or peaceful settlers who have been “corrupted” by civilization, the cultists have no qualms about poisoning their wells or weaving dark curses upon their settlements if that’s what it takes to uproot them. Even brute force – often in the form of wild beasts or elementals enhanced and compelled with primordial magic – is employed when it’s deemed necessary to purify nature from the taint of civilization.</p><h5>Primordial Rage</h5><p>Like the wild’s fiercest predators, the Verdant Path uses stealth, patience, and sudden ferocity as they work toward their goal of eradicating civilization. From farmers waking up to find their crops blighted to a town being swept completely away by an unexpected flash flood, the Verdant Path often leaves behind clear displays of nature’s brutal “retribution,” while keeping the cult’s existence hidden from prying eyes.</p><h3>Structure &amp; Position</h3><p>The Verdant Path is organized into many smaller cells or “circles,” each of which is typically led by a druid. Each circle is responsible for carrying out specific tasks and missions, such as scouting out potential targets for attack, gathering intelligence on settlements, or conducting sabotage and sabotage-like operations.</p><h5>One Tree, Many Roots</h5><p>The followers of the Verdant Path are spread across a large geographical area. Animals, wilderness spirits, and even the elements themselves help the members of the Verdant Path communicate across vast distances, so that information between the circles is disseminated quickly and effectively. This efficient communication also allows the Dryad Queen, the cult’s supreme leader, to give precise orders to each circle of cultists or to assemble the circles into larger forces when needed.</p><h3>Followers &amp; Leaders</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>While disliking people in general is a cause I can get behind, the Dryad Queen and her minions take it to a whole other level. It’s like they crossed that fine line between “scowling at other people on the street” and “setting the whole town ablaze and watching it burn while you laugh.” It’s a very fine line, but still...</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>The Verdant Path is comprised of a relatively small number of fiercely devoted humanoid and fey creatures, as well as a selection of intelligent beasts, plants, monstrosities, and elementals. Most humanoid followers are druids, rangers, shamans, and similar folk, who’ve always held an appreciation for nature and are so appalled at seeing forests felled and rivers polluted by expanding settlements that they feel more drastic measures are necessary.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Ranks &amp; Hierarchy</h5><p>The Verdant Path has a strict hierarchy, with the Dryad Queen as the ultimate and unquestioned leader. Below the Dryad Queen herself, druids are typically the most powerful and influential members of the cult, and often serve as the Dryad Queen’s closest advisors and lieutenants. Rangers serve as scouts and skirmishers, alongside non-humanoids that possess a similar aptitude for combat and stealth. The lowest-ranking members of the cult are the Forestborn, typically humanoids who share the cult’s devotion to nature and hatred for civilization, but who have no druidic magic or particular skills in combat.</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">The Verdant Path's Ranks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Activities</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Forestborn</td><td>Performs lesser tasks such as spying, sabotage, and raiding</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Often tasked with infiltration and gathering information</td></tr><tr><td>Druid/Shaman</td><td>Oversees a circle of Forestborn and develops plans of action</td></tr><tr><td>Dryad Queen</td><td>The ultimate authority who lays out the cult’s general strategy</td></tr></tbody></table><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/ui/eiluneth.webp\" class=\"hgdd-img\" /><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Eilunêth, the Dryad Queen</h5><p>There is no Verdant Path without the Dryad Queen.

When the tree her existence was bound to was felled, cut into pieces, and fed to the furnaces of industry, she did not perish or lose her connection to the tree. Instead, she felt every stroke of the axe and every second of immolation, and to this day, that pain guides her as she works to eradicate civilization.</p><p>Eilunêth never bonded to a new tree – instead, she now considers herself one with every tree, rock, and woodland creature, and sees even the slightest harm to any of them as a direct affront to herself. The Dryad Queen is always on the move, striding from tree to tree as she oversees the vast operations of the Verdant Path, while birds, spirits, and the wind itself keeps her informed of the cult’s activities across the realm.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Roleplaying The Dryad Queen</p><p>With skin as green as leaves and hair-like vines specked with gold, Eilunêth could be considered beautiful, were it not for the hard set of her face.

A band of loggers from the town – which bases its very existence on its logging enterprises – have been missing for two days. A small expedition was sent out to look for the loggers but hasn’t returned. At his wit’s end, the halfling mayor is willing to pay the characters 50 gp if they can find the loggers and bring them back.</p><p>If the characters accept, their quest takes them into the forest, where they eventually find the bodies of the loggers and the folk who were send to find them, all of which seem to have been strangled by vines and left to rot on the forest floor. More troubling, they also discover – by following the tracks left by cultists of the Verdant Path – why the loggers were slain: the loggers had discovered that the Verdant Path is working to dismantle a nearby dam, which would cause Willowdale to be flooded. They must now race to either prevent the Verdant Path from doing so or to evacuate the town before the river sweeps it away.</p><h5>The Blight</h5><p>Alisse, who is the ruler of a small nation or regional power, hires the characters to investigate rumors that an outlying village has been devastated by disease, dark magic, or a combination. Alisse wants to know if the rumors are true and what has happened, and stop whoever or whatever is behind it. She offers a reward of 2,500 gp if the characters can accomplish this feat.</p><p>Traveling to the village of Dawn’s Hollow, the characters find all the villagers slain, ostensibly by a terrible disease that leaves them half-rotted and covered in fungi. A sole survivor, a young boy of half-elven descent, lets the characters know that he saw what he believes to be druids investigating the corpses and even taking some back with them. Following their tracks into the depths of the woods, the characters learn that the Verdant Path is working on a deadly disease it intends to spread throughout the realm. They’ve managed to make it target only humans and other non-elves, and had tested it out on the village in an effort to perfect it. The characters also learn that a group of cultists have already traveled to the region’s capital and intend to unleash the deadly disease within the large city, potentially killing thousands!</p><h3>Important Locations &amp; Objects</h3><p>A few key locations and objects is of particular importance to the Dryad Queen and, by extension, the Verdant Path.</p><h5>The Bleeding Oak</h5><p>Before it was felled by thoughtless loggers, the Dryad Queen’s dryadic tree was an ancient and majestic oak. Now, all that remains of the tree is a huge, blood-spattered stump in a large clearing. Though the place brings her great pain, the Dryad Queen often convenes meetings with her most trusted underlings here to lay their plans of destruction with the fulcrum of her wrath within clear sight. Sometimes, particularly hated captives – the director of a logging operation or the mayor of a larger town – is brought here to be decapitated at the foot of the Bleeding Oak, in an act of obvious, ironic spitefulness.</p><p>Anyone who would want to confront the Dryad Queen and the Verdant Path, or simply to gain her attention, could do so by visiting the Bleeding Oak in the heart of the dense, dark forest.</p><h5>The Earthmother’s Vine</h5><p>Though the Verdant Path already possesses many powerful magic items related to nature, one object has so far eluded them: the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em>. Said to have been crafted by an archdruid beholden to the Earthmother, the staff supposedly possesses power enough to turn entire towns or cities into wild, untamed wilderness in a matter of hours. For centuries, however, the staff has been lost, even to the Verdant Path’s vast network of rangers and other forestfolk.</p><p>The relic hunt @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.32fjLn55TZ4d9g3G.JournalEntryPage.xsfT7Kfs00l1ksA0]{Earthmother’s Temple} is centered around the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em> and can be used to facilitate a meeting between the characters and the Verdant Path – perhaps someone realizes that the Verdant Path may soon find the staff, and desperately seeks to prevent them from doing so!</p></div>"

This rare and invasive type of fungus grows in humid areas and, paradoxically for a fungus, can only spread when exposed to sunlight. It decays the plants it infests and is near-impossible to get rid of once it has taken hold in an area.</p></li><li><p><strong>DC 15.</strong> Whiterot is also known as “the White Sight” in some cultures, as chewing on the fungi can cause vivid visions of past events that have happened in the area where the fungi grow.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Ingesting the Fungi.</strong></em> If a character chews on a piece of whiterot, they experience colorless, ghostlike visions of the most important events that have transpired within the spore network of the fungus, which can hint at the temple’s fate – and how to reach the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kwdKqEdrnO7aQ93]{Earthmother’s Vine}</em>. The vision they see is what happened when the temple area was infested by the fungi and how the druid who oversaw the temple sacrificed herself in an attempt to contain the rot. Read or paraphrase the following:</p><p><em><br />“The world around you twists and swirls as you see colorless, ghostlike visions of a majestic tree with a golden crown towering over squat buildings in a flourishing forest filled with animals. As you watch, the rich plant life begins to rot away as glowing fungi spread throughout the area. An elf appears, brow furrowed as she studies the fungi spreading up the large tree’s trunk. The scene changes, the elf now entering a stone building surrounded by carnivorous plants, a gnarled staff in one hand and what appears to be a golden leaf in the other. Inside the temple, the elf slams her staff into an altar. As she murmurs in a strange language, it seems as if the fungi, and the rot along with it, is being drawn into the elf – she consuming it as it consumes her. Before your vision fades away, you see thorny brambles emerging from the large stone building and quickly growing together with the canopy above, gradually sealing off the entire area.“</em></p><p><br />The visions last for a single round during which the character is Incapacitated.

Holding no regard for the rule of law, be it mortal law or divine, Daveet is a begrudging tool of the gods who wishes only to live a life of security and peace.</p><p>While Daveet is a true oracle and sometimes receives visions from gods, they make their day-to-day living as a fortune teller for a traveling carnival. Adventurers can stumble upon Daveet’s booth in any urban location, small town, or even by the side of a busy road.</p><div class=\"artisan-box\"><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">The Fortune Teller Overview</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>NPC</strong></td><td>Daveet Sterling, a half-elven carnival fortune teller and occasional true oracle, with a pragmatic and down-to-earth approach to mysticism</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Services</strong></td><td>Fortune-telling, true visions, divination magic, and magic items</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Biases</strong></td><td><p><strong style=\"color:green\">+</strong> Any who's been taken advantage of<br /><strong style=\"color:red\">–</strong> Clerics and the overly pious</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"artisan-row\"><div><p><strong>Sell Prices</strong></p><p>120%</p></div><div><p><strong>Bargaining DC</strong></p><p style=\"font-size:1.5em\"><strong>13</strong></p></div><div><p><strong>Buy Prices</strong></p><p>50%</p></div></div></div><h3>Background</h3><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/tokens/The%20Fortune%20Teller.webp\" class=\"hgdd-token\" /><p>Daveet spent their formative years sitting on a literal throne, worshiped by cultists for their prophetic gifts. They have no memories of their life before their time with the cult, but Daveet’s childhood as a living god does not fill them with fondness. As they grew and became able to question the teachings of the cult, Daveet’s interpretations of their visions began to differ from those of the cult’s High Priest.</p><p>Just before their thirteenth nameday, Daveet discovered a proclamation that was to be given by the High Priest, declaring that Daveet had seen a vision of their own death and “rebirth” into a new vessel. Having had no such vision and fearing for their life, Daveet fled the temple.</p><p>Unfamiliar with the outside world, Daveet struggled to find their footing at first. Over time, Daveet learned that people were willing to give money in exchange for a peek at the future, and began selling their services as a soothsayer. This venture was met with mixed success (“For some reason, people rarely enjoy paying for bad news!”) Thankfully, Daveet soon encountered a traveling carnival where the resident fortune teller took them in and taught them their trade.</p><h3>Roleplaying the Fortune Teller</h3><p>Daveet typically plays the part of the mysterious fortune teller, affecting an accent that is difficult to identify – because it is entirely made up – and selling themselves and their skills as mystic arts from far-off lands. If the characters have knowledge about Daveet’s true abilities and make it clear that their interest is in Daveet’s genuine skillset, the half-elf will drop the act and speak plainly, with no traceable accent and no attempt to avoid vulgarity or slang.</p><p>While Daveet thinks first and foremost of their own success and comfort, they lean toward doing good when it comes to large moralistic choices. Daveet may be swayed by an offer of gold but is just as likely to respond to plucking at their conscience – and if someone can give them gold and the satisfaction of doing a good deed, all the better!</p><h3>The Fortune Teller’s Services</h3><p>Daveet is unimpressed by prideful people and forceful personalities. Customers who attempt to bully or intimidate the fortune teller to perform their services, are likely to receive a false – and unflattering – prophecy. If a customer is kind and humble, and helping them would further a good cause, Daveet can be convinced to provide their services free of charge.</p><h5>Fortune-Telling Services</h5><p>Daveet offers a selection of fortune-telling services to the general public. These services don’t provide actual prophetic guidance, as Daveet’s true premonitions come to them via unbidden visions. Daveet’s fortune-telling services include:</p><table class=\"last-align-right\"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Service</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Cost</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Palm Reading</p></td><td><p>1 sp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Oracle Deck Reading</p></td><td><p>1 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bone Reading</p></td><td><p>1 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tea Leaf Reading</p></td><td><p>5 gp</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Palm Reading.</strong> Daveet takes the character’s hand and examines it closely, tracing lines in the palm and examining folds in the skin. After a minute of careful palm reading, Daveet provides one of the fortunes from the Possible Fortunes table.</p><p><strong>Oracle Deck Reading.</strong> Daveet produces a deck of crimson cards with ornate illustrations in gold ink. They shuffle the cards and ask the adventurer to cut the deck before taking it back and laying out three cards, representing the past, present, and future. After gazing at the cards ponderously, Daveet provides one of the fortunes from the Possible Fortunes table.</p><p><strong>Bone Reading.</strong> Daveet produces a bag from their belt and empties it into a wooden cup. The fortune teller then shakes the cup while humming a nonsensical chant, and casts the contents over the table to reveal a series of boiled bones (clearly poultry bones to anyone with proficiency in Medicine or Nature). Daveet scrutinizes the bones before providing one of the fortunes from the Possible Fortunes table.</p><p><strong>Tea Leaf Reading.</strong> Daveet gives each character a chipped teacup, none of which match. The seer fills each cup with loose-leaf tea and water which the participants must drink (it is astringent and bitter in taste) until only the dregs remain. Explaining that the participants are transferring the energy of their inquiries into the cups, Daveet instructs them to swirl the dregs three times and invert their teacups covered with a saucer. Daveet takes each teacup and flip them back over to reveal the contents, squint at the tea for a while, and then provide one of the fortunes from the Possible Fortunes table.</p></div><table class=\"odds-align-center\"><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Possible Fortunes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>d8</strong></td><td><strong>Fortune Outcome</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>You will come into money but lose it quickly.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You will struggle with trying to achieve your goals, but your persistence will be rewarded.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>The weather may turn on you unexpectedly; carry an umbrella.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You will find love, but it will have setbacks.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>If you feel you are right, stand firmly by your convictions.

When receiving a true vision, Daveet’s body becomes rigid, and their eyes glow gold-white. When they speak, their voice is sonorous and haunting, filling listeners with a sense of being in the presence of terrifying power. Premonitions given by Daveet in this state are vague and come in the form of riddles, metaphors, or verses. After the conclusion of the vision, Daveet collapses and falls briefly unconscious. When they wake, they suffer a splitting headache and feeling of sickness. Their willingness to offer help interpreting the vision depends upon their relationship to whoever is asking and whether there is a genuine danger to someone innocent or good.</p><h5>Divination Magic</h5><p>Despite their reluctance to conduct real divine magic, Daveet is capable of casting a few divination spells if the cause is worthy – and the price is right.</p><table class=\"last-align-right\"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Spell</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Value</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{Identify}</em></p></td><td><p>10 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.4v2H3hHb3Ph9XLNd]{Augury}</em></p></td><td><p>25 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9]{Divination}</em></p></td><td><p>100 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{Scrying}</em></p></td><td><p>250 gp</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Magic Items</h5><p>Daveet has a selection of minor trinkets, charms, and magic items on offer.

The charm remains magical for 24 hours, seven days (Greater), or permanently (Superior).</p></blockquote><h3>Quest Hooks &amp; Relic Hunts</h3><p>Daveet regularly receives visions of sinister events. Though Daveet has no interest in dealing with these omens themselves, they do still feel an obligation to do <em>something</em> – even if that just means unloading these visions on adventurers that pass through.</p><h5>The Prophet Reborn</h5><p>While Daveet wants nothing to do with the cult that raised them, they do keep track of news of the group when they can. Lately they have heard rumors that the group is planning to celebrate the “return” of their prophet in the form of a young child. Daveet wishes to spare the child the experiences they survived and asks the heroes to look into the matter and save the child. Daveet tries to convince the party that they have a moral obligation, the fortune teller will offer a reward of 500 gold pieces for the heroes’ aid, if they have to.</p><h5>Temple of Three Challenges</h5><p>Daveet has had visions of a temple that holds a divine relic, which may contain the power to end the world — or may just be somewhat useful. The visions aren’t really clear on that point, but Daveet doubts the gods would keep sending them visions of this temple if it wasn’t important. Daveet asks the party to investigate the issue and destroy the relic, or just take it and keep it safe. Though Daveet offers no reward, they are convinced that it will be worth the heroes’ time.</p><p>See @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.32fjLn55TZ4d9g3G.JournalEntryPage.boZ8uKDHPdIrQo44]{Temple of Three Challenges} a description of the temple.</p></div>"

Jaw set firmly, scarred brow furrowed, and dull steel plate creaking with every movement, the draconic humanoid embodies a dragon’s ruthless pragmatism much more than its grace and splendor. “So, I take it you’re looking for some divine intervention – or maybe the divine has already intervened too much?” the dragonborn grates in a gravelly voice. Green eyes unblinking, you’re offered a scarred and leather-bound hand. “Name’s Kassanthra, but call me Kass. And who might you be?”</p></blockquote><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.o9eDLcZGRG4feMiX]{Kassanthra}</strong> – also commonly referred to as the Heretic – is a gold dragonborn who has dedicated her life to understanding the divine. Stubborn, fearless, and as fond of gold as any true dragon, Kass is equal parts adventurer, author, merchant, and mercenary. Adventurers may seek her out to gain information from her or to buy some of the magical relics she’s accumulated during her many travels. When she’s not on the road, Kass is often found staying at a modest inn – or deep in her cups in a seedy tavern!</p><div class=\"artisan-box\"><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">The HERETIC OVERVIEW</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>NPC</strong></td><td>Kassanthra, a gold dragonborn who specializes in foiling the schemes of deities and their mortal followers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Services</strong></td><td>Magic items and religious knowledge, courtesy of the scribe Pericles</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Biases</strong></td><td><p><strong style=\"color:green\">+</strong> Dragonborn, honorable warriors<br /><strong style=\"color:red\">–</strong> Clerics, druids, paladins, and other pious folk</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"artisan-row\"><div><p><strong>Sell Prices</strong></p><p>130%</p></div><div><p><strong>Bargaining DC</strong></p><p style=\"font-size:1.5em\"><strong>15</strong></p></div><div><p><strong>Buy Prices</strong></p><p>40%</p></div></div></div><h3>Background</h3><img src=\"modules/heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity/images/tokens/The%20Heretic.webp\" class=\"hgdd-token\" /><p>Kassanthra grew up in a small, dragonborn community on the outskirts of civilization. The memories she has of her clan are fond, but far too few. While she was still only a hatchling, human cultists sworn to a God of Order descended upon the settlement and slew most of her kin. Only a handful dragonborn, Kass among them, escaped the gruesome slaughter.</p><p>When she learned that the zealots had been driven by a belief that dragonborn were “unnatural” and “abominations,” Kass was filled with anger. While still barely an adolescent, she joined up with a group of dragonborn who had suffered similar mistreatment. Together, the dragonborn outlaws hunted down bigots like those who had slain her clan and exacted vengeance – a bitter and bloody business, that quickly transformed Kass into a fierce and ruthless warrior.</p><p>Eventually, however, it became clear to Kass that the group was more than just a band of comrades. There had always been prayers to Tiamat, the draconic God of Chaos, but as the band grew, the prayers came more frequently and with more fervor. When the group’s leader, a black dragonborn named Yerithilix, ordered the raid of a helpless village of “human scum,” Kass realized she had become what she hated most.</p><p>Courageously, she stood up to Yerithilix and the rest of the group, but she’d waited too long. Her companions were either too fanatic or too cowardly to side with her. Kass was brutally beaten and left powerless to intervene as her former comrades sacked the village and slew the innocent townsfolk.</p><p>Since that day, Kass has dedicated herself to fight the evils wrought by the gods and their followers. She’s unraveled evil cults, repossessed dangerous relics, hunted down fanatics, and fought to keep the gods’ insidious influence from corrupting mortal minds. The fervor with which she denounces the gods and combat their influence earned her the moniker “The Heretic.”</p><h3>Roleplaying the Heretic</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>Kassanthra’s dislike of the divine – which is often irrational – stems from how much she hates to see her fellow mortals misused or mistreated by the gods. Which you’d think would make her a better employer, but alas, I’ve yet to convince her that “overtime” and “hazard pay” are real concepts.</p><p>– the Scribe</p></blockquote><p>At her core, Kassanthra is empathic and kind, and has a deep sense of justice. All that, however, is hidden beneath an exterior of cynicism and gruffness as thick and hard as her dull, golden scales. With all the innocent people she’s seen slain and the many evils she’s witnessed, “I’d have to be as blind as one of the Orclord’s one-eyed priests to believe this world is all rainbows and sunshine!”</p><p>While Kass disdains all deities and their followers, she is not blind to the fact that some faiths are worse than others. She tolerates followers of goodly faiths (albeit not without expressing her distaste whenever they fall to prayer or preaching) and will even admit that priests and paladins can use their powers for good.</p><p>Even so, she is always highly skeptical of the actions and motives of the pious, as she firmly believes that the gods that direct them are inherently selfish and have no regard for mortal lives. Too often, she has witnessed fanaticism corrupt the hearts of good people, or seen otherwise rational and compassionate people perform deranged deeds because their deities demanded it.</p><p>Kass is also a gold dragonborn through and through, which shows in the slight air of superiority she possesses, but also in how much she values respect. She expects others to treat her courteously and always treats others with respect – until they give her reason not to. Kass also has a dragon’s fondness for gold, although she doesn’t allow it to cloud her judgment or corrupt her morals. If two quests are equally important, however, but one comes with a larger reward, “Only an egg-brained hatchling wouldn’t go for the gold!”</p><h3>The Heretic’s Services</h3><p>Kass isn’t a merchant as much as she is a collector of religious relics and other useful objects. Even so, she values gold, and can be convinced to sell magical items to adventurers – as long as she believes her wares will be used to combat the evils wrought by the gods.</p><h5>Magic Items</h5><p>Kass’ stock of magic items are either religious items she’s found or magical items designed specifically to combat or harm the gods’ servants.</p><table class=\"last-align-right\"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Item</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Type</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Value</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Scroll of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pxpb2eOB6bv4phAf]{Banishment}</p></td><td><p>Spell Scroll</p></td><td><p>500 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.Ni64pt8WkZBNPOZc]{Skeptic's Shelter} ♦</p></td><td><p>Armor (Shield)</p></td><td><p>800 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.oZj3W7OBKgqvyNnm]{Seraph's Ruin} ♦</p></td><td><p>Weapon (Longbow)</p></td><td><p>2,000 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.zcIwN7Ab4e2oA7ps]{Consecrated Aegis} ♦</p></td><td><p>Armor (Breastplate)</p></td><td><p>3,000 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.2kRNdnnJJggBSnMQ]{Ring of Perpetual Sanctification} ♦</p></td><td><p>Ring</p></td><td><p>10,000 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;font-size:0.8em\"><p>♦ = <em>Requires Attunement</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Religious Knowledge</h5><p>Kass knows a lot about the gods and their servants, and her loyal companion, the young scribe Pericles, knows even more, if he’s present. Thin, scraggly-bearded, and friendly, Pericles is Kass’s opposite in most regards. Together, they can provide inquisitive adventurers:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Information.</strong> If the characters are looking for something specific, such as how to find a particular relic or what a certain cult is up to, Kass and Pericles are willing to help as long as the characters’ intentions are pure. Kass may ask the characters for a favor or monetary compensation (“Sure, Pericles can research that and find you an answer – but who’ll pay for his food and drink in the meantime?”)</p><p><strong>Tutoring.</strong> If the characters are looking for more general knowledge, such as how to slay a certain type of fiend or just want a broader understanding of religion, they may have to stay with Kass and Pericles for a while. Unless they perform some other service, the avaricious dragonborn will charge 10 gp per day for tutoring. A tutored character may gain one of the benefits from the table below:</p></div><table class=\"last-align-right\"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Benefit</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Days</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How to perform a specific ritual</p></td><td><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Advantage on attacks and saving throws vs a specific Celestial or Fiend</p></td><td><p>5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Proficiency in Religion</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal language</p></td><td><p>30</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Expertise in Religion</p></td><td><p>60</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quest Hooks &amp; Relic Hunts</h3><p>As an active adventurer, Kassanthra is more often quest-taker than quest-giver. On occasion, however, the dragonborn finds herself overwhelmed with quests, or unsuited for a specific task, and will instead outsource a job to a group of suitable adventurers.</p><h5>Scales of Darkness</h5><p>Kass has heard rumors that a sect of dragonborn cultists calling themselves the Scales of Darkness are operating in a city a week’s travel away. Kass has history with that particular band and has been hunting them for decades. As much as she’d love to head straight for the cult and confront their leader, a dragonborn named Yerithilix, she knows from bitter experience that if she goes poking around, the cult is likely to spook before she can track them down. Instead, she offers the characters 500 gold pieces or an item of similar value if they’ll go to the city, discover the cult’s location, and report back to her.</p><p>When they arrive in the city, the characters can ask around for a while and learn that the cult is holed up in a decrepit temple that used to be inhabited by followers of the Lady of Love. They also learn that the cultists are planning something nefarious – and they are not likely to wait for them to fetch Kass. If the characters can appear as dragonborn, they stand a good chance at infiltrating the temple. Within, they can confront and possibly defeat Yerithilix and his cultists before they enact their plan, which is to release a poisonous gas in the city’s temple district!</p><h5>The Timepiece of Equilibrium</h5><p>A friendly soul has told Kass that a small sect of tinkers beholden to the Maker, a god of order and invention, has abandoned their secret sanctum in the nearby mountains. For whatever reason, it appears they have left behind a legendary object – the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.VineP6bFmBxmhPAP]{Timepiece of Equilibrium}</em> – and Kass is concerned it may fall into the wrong hands. She doesn’t have time to look into it herself, so Kass is willing to pay the characters up to 1,000 gold pieces, in addition to any other treasures they find, if they will visit the Sanctum Mechanicum and recover the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.VineP6bFmBxmhPAP]{Timepiece of Equilibrium}</em> for her.

Yaziel’s place in elven society was clear and secure – she would train as a priest and eventually represent her house on the High Council.</p><p>In a dark turn of events, Yaziel’s father, the revered Lord Elanthîl, made an illegal bid for kingship, but was thwarted – and slain, alongside most of Yaziel’s family. Yaziel, who had not been involved in her family’s sinister conspiracy, was left orphaned and dishonored by her father’s deeds.</p><p>Exiled from the Veiled Isles, Yaziel spent decades trying to come to terms with her misfortune. Eventually, her anger and bitterness mellowed and she was left with a distaste for dishonesty and lies. She became enamored with oath and vows, and building upon her clerical training, she learned how to reach out to the gods themselves and make such oaths binding. Yaziel plies her trade wherever she thinks it is needed, and will provide her services to anyone, as long as they are honest in their devotion.</p><h3>Roleplaying Yaziel</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>As far as divine servants go, you could do a lot worse than Yaziel. She’s honest and speaks matter-of-factly. Swears worse than a sailor too. How someone so level-headed can be naive enough to put so much faith in the gods is beyond me, but hey – nobody’s perfect.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>Yaziel’s noble bearing, serious expression, and mystical occupation bring most who see her to expect that she will be serious and soft-spoken. Not quite so – while she speaks softly and somberly, Yaziel is also possessed of a dry humor and wry wit. Her sarcastic quips are, however, often so subtle that only very few people pick up on them, such as when she admonishes a paladin for breaking their Vow of Truth (“You had to lie to save an innocent life? That is a surprising turn of events”) or a cleric for breaking their Vow of Pacifism (“Yes, I can see how it would be hard to kill a demon without harming it. Did you try reasoning with it?”)</p><p>While she has devoted her life to the divine, Yaziel is far from a cloistered devout. She drinks hard liquor, beds beautiful women, and plays games of chance – and does all three better than most. She also has a habit of speaking of the gods in an irreverent manner (“The Lady Luck is a fickle hag indeed – not particularly fond of keeping to her oaths, that one!”) which her more pious petitioners often find a bit off-putting.</p><h3>The Oathbinder’s Services</h3><p>Yaziel sells a small selection of sacred magic items and can cast a number of clerical spells at a cost, but her main service is her ability to facilitate Sacred Vows.</p><h5>Magic Items</h5><p>The few magic items that Yaziel sells were either found or enchanted by herself.</p><table class=\"last-align-right\"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Item</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Type</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Value</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of Healing}</p></td><td><p>Potion</p></td><td><p>50 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.Ni64pt8WkZBNPOZc]{Skeptic's Shelter} ♦</p></td><td><p>Armor (Shield)</p></td><td><p>800 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Scroll of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz]{Raise Dead}</p></td><td><p>Spell Scroll</p></td><td><p>1,500 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.mu6KBzeHNJwCQWKG]{Martyr's Amulet} ♦</p></td><td><p>Wondrous Item</p></td><td><p>2,000 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.F7fj05EllcxbjYSZ]{Totem of Seraphs} ♦</p></td><td><p>Wondrous Item</p></td><td><p>3,000 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;font-size:0.8em\"><p>♦ = <em>Requires Attunement</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Clerical Services</h5><p>For the right price, Yaziel can perform divinations to consult the gods, speak with the fallen, or even attempt to resurrect a recently deceased creature.

This is a responsibility she does not take lightly, and she will only forge a bond on behalf of a character who is truly devoted to both their divine patron and their vow. She has a knack for sniffing such people out, and may suggest to pious characters that they forge a Sacred Vow: “And you, paladin – if you’re really serious about the truth, why not swear on it?”</p><p>Depending on the situation, Yaziel may perform this service for free or she may charge a minor fee as per the table below: “The gods may have no need for gold, but I certainly do – a girl’s gotta eat!”</p><table class=\"last-align-right\"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Sacred Vow</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Cost</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.K9pUBUk6IBkow5xj]{Poverty}, @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.v9Y8FrPAKlCpT3Wo]{Truth}</p></td><td><p>50 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.OF7UKyZytv8bszAG]{Mercy}, @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.BzR6owLI2OXjgQE0]{Pacifism}</p></td><td><p>100 gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.MnPKTwFjIWpK6D8m]{Enmity}, @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.s8Zxm18Gmm4TIq57]{Loyalty}</p></td><td><p>250 gp</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quest Hooks &amp; Relic Hunts</h3><p>Always looking to maintain the delicate balance between good and evil, law and chaos, Yaziel often has quests she needs help with – and which petitioners can complete to earn her services or gain a discount on her magical wares.</p><h5>The Broken Vow</h5><p>A few years back, a paladin convinced Yaziel to forge a Sacred Vow of Poverty between himself and the Lady of Mercy. Using the oath as proof of his trustworthiness, the paladin then secured the favor of a wealthy noble who entrusted the paladin with the protection of their treasures.</p><p>As it turned out, the paladin was not so dedicated to poverty after all – instead of guarding the treasures, he broke his oath and absconded with the most valuable gemstones. A reward has been offered for him, but he’s thus far eluded capture.</p><p>While Yaziel is used to oaths being broken, the paladin’s deception has galled her nonetheless. She wishes the characters’ aid in finding the paladin – who is rumored to be holed up in a forest stronghold with a handful of hired thugs – and retrieve the noble’s treasure. In return, she’ll make sure they get the bounty of 1,000 gp and also provide a discount of up to 1,000 gp on any of her magic items, clerical services, or Sacred Vows.</p><h5>The God-Killing Blade</h5><p>Yaziel has learned of the existence of a blade that is said to be able to harm even the gods themselves – as a matter of fact, the blade was used to kill a god long ago, or so the story goes.</p><p>Yaziel knows that if she’s heard about this blade – it’s likely that agents of evil have as well. Thus, she wants someone goodly – “or at least not wholly evil, beggars can’t be choosers!” – to find the blade and make sure it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. As far as she knows, the blade can be found in a place called the Shrine of the Silent Blade. The shrine, which exists partially in the Shadow Realm, can be found at the foot of a desolate hill at dusk, when the shadows are deepest.</p><p>In return for aid in securing the blade – which the heroes may keep for themselves – Yaziel will provide a discount of up to 500 gp on any of her magic items, clerical services, or Sacred Vows.</p><p>See page 122**** for a description of the Shrine of the Silent Blade.</p></div>"

He has forgone living in a society that seeks to serve people and instead has devoted himself to the service of the gods – and his own survival. To that end, Rev has established a compound where he and other like-minded folks have retreated to prepare for the Armageddon that he is certain is coming very soon.</p><p>Rev’s compound is located within a network of caves that is surrounded by a wooded area that provides access to water and hunting game. Adventurers may hear about “that crazy gnome in the woods” while in a nearby town, or they may accidentally stumble across one of the many traps set up around the perimeter of Rev’s compound.

As an adolescent, he enlisted in the army and took advantage of the soldier’s life to travel and explore far-off lands. Rev’s experiences while enlisted began to shape his worldview: he saw violence, poverty, and inequality and what happened when civilizations crumbled and failed to fulfill people’s needs. The more he saw, the more he began to believe that the gods were granting him insight into what was coming – visions of the end of days.</p><p>He earned the nickname “Reverend Doom” as he began trying to spread awareness of these signs of the coming apocalypse. It was intended to silence him, but he embraced the moniker and used the attempted ridicule as a way to engage new believers.</p><p>After being kicked out of a tavern one evening for upsetting guests, Rev met Bamli Bimbee, another gnome, who had heard Rev’s sermons and wanted to discuss plans for survival. Together, the pair began stockpiling food and gear, while formulating the idea of creating a place for believers who cared about getting right with the gods to make ready for the end of days.</p><h3>Roleplaying the Reverend</h3><p>Rev can appear stand-offish and distrustful – especially if he encounters visitors who have wandered too close to his wilderness compound – but there’s no malice in him. He favors the pious and the well-prepared, and as long as visitors can convince him they’re not there to rob him, he will relax and welcome them to peruse his wares (and discuss the coming apocalypse).</p><p>Rev smokes a large cigar which is often clenched in his teeth even as he speaks, though he removes it when he needs to speak seriously about something so that his words are clear. He fancies himself an expert at demolition and often defaults to suggesting explosives as a solution to most problems.</p><p>Despite his doomsday beliefs, Rev is generally upbeat, though he is rough around the edges. He often makes jokes about the impending destruction of the world and fall of civilization, occasionally poking fun at the under-preparedness of others (“All I’m sayin’ is that it ain’t gonna seem like madness when I’m the only one for miles who’s got a chamberpot and a place to clean it.”) He’ll also happily offer up unsolicited (and ever-changing) theories about how the world will end, as shown on the How the World Ends table.</p><table class=\"odds-align-center\"><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">How the World Ends</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>d6</strong></td><td><strong>End of the World</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The earth is flat and increasing global temperatures will lead to the melting of the ice wall around the world that keeps the oceans in place.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Experiments of careless mages will rip the fabric of the universe apart – again.

Friendly, thoughtful, and studious, Beinorin is the self-appointed steward of an archival library, which may be located in a dense forest, a remote monastery, or even in ancient temple ruins.

Here he spent decades listening to the philosophical debates of priests and parishioners, before he was, by the grace of the Lorekeeper, awakened and given true intelligence.</p><p>Beinorin remained in the temple for many years, engaging in discourse with the clerics, students, and anyone who visited the temple, but before long his curiosity grew too big for the small courtyard. He left the temple to collect more stories and gain more first-hand knowledge of the world.</p><p>Eventually, Beinorin put down roots when he discovered a long-neglected archive full of rare, hand-written tomes and ancient manuscripts. Believing that the Lorekeeper had guided him to this place for a purpose, Beinorin became the librarian of the archives and has been content to spend the last several decades sequestered with his mission.</p><h3>Roleplaying Beinorin</h3><p>Beinorin is friendly and kind, even in the face of sarcasm, aggression, or rudeness. He is always pleasantly surprised by visitors, whom he readily offers drinks and snacks to, and loves to discuss history, religion, politics, and philosophy with intelligent creatures of any type or species. He does not seek to impose his own beliefs on others, only to listen and exchange ideas. He values thoughtfulness and loves nothing more than a good story or learning an interesting fact (and he finds all facts interesting).</p><p>Beinorin speaks slowly and deliberately, taking time to choose his words carefully. He is easily distracted by tangents and has a habit of following amusing or interesting side comments to their conclusion rather than staying on topic. He may reference long-dead heroes or rulers who are no longer in power, or possibly a mentor of one of the current adventurers, having known that person in their younger years and not realizing that they died long ago (which is news that always greatly saddens the old treant).</p><p>Beinorin loves wordplay and has a penchant for puns (“If it’s weaponry you’re looking for, I’m afraid you’re barking up the wrong tree!”). He does not appreciate being interrupted – if someone interrupts him multiple times he may stop talking until prompted to speak, to which he’ll respond, “I apologize, it seemed you did not want me to contribute to this conversation, as every time I spoke you interrupted me.”</p><h3>The Sage’s Services</h3><p>Beinorin trades in knowledge and stories primarily, but he has a small inventory of items he’s found while rummaging through the archives.

        "Sacred Vows": {
          "name": "Sacred Vows",
          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>Sacred Vows... I have a hard time imagining anything worse. To willingly enter into a binding agreement with a god, as if you could ever be equals. And to then have the gall to excuse yourself by saying “I have taken a vow” whenever you do something heinous or stand passively by in the face of evil. Pitiful.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p class=\"hgdd-h1\" style=\"clear:none\">Sacred Vows</p><p>Few bonds are as strong and as meaningful as those made between mortals and deities. A Sacred Vow is, at its core, a contract between a mortal and a divine entity; once made, it places responsibility upon both parties. The mortal vows to perform – or not perform – a particular action, and in turn the deity grants a divine blessing. Vows are typically less powerful than feats and, since they can be broken, less permanent.</p><h3>Taking Vows</h3><p>It is up to you, the DM, how vows between mortals and divine beings are forged.</p><p>In some cases, you may allow a particularly pious character to start with a Sacred Vow already sworn. You can also decide that a character must complete a specific quest to be able to swear a Sacred Vow, or that the character must speak with a celestial agent, such as an angel, a spirit, or an @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.GuKDnuujZkoDKUfB.JournalEntryPage.Y2YR2n3DywdYnv5y]{Oathbinder} to facilitate the Sacred Vow.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Roleplaying Vows</p><p>Sacred Vows are meant to give players a tool to improve their roleplaying and to give devoted characters mechanical benefits that make following their divine tenets meaningful. They should never be something that disrupts the game, such as if the paladin who’s sworn a Vow of Truth will not let any other character use deception or the cleric who’s sworn an Vow of Pacifism disavows the party if they harm other creatures. To avoid Sacred Vows becoming disruptive, remind your players of a few things:</p><p>First, Sacred Vows are personal. The truth-sworn paladin may not like it when the party’s rogue lies, but they can stand by and let it happen without breaking their vow. You shouldn’t punish a character for what another character does, and the player shouldn’t punish their party for a personal vow they’ve made.</p><p>Second, Sacred Vows are meant to inspire conflict within a character as they must make difficult choices. Always abiding by the oath even if it means letting innocent people die or the villain win isn’t the intention. Sometimes a character has to break their vow, either partially or fully, and those are often the most interesting and rewarding situations to roleplay.</p></blockquote><h3>Breaking Vows</h3><p>A character who has sworn a Sacred Vow only gains its benefits for as long as they keep their vow. As soon as they break their oath, they immediately lose any benefits gained from it, either permanently or for a limited time, depending on whether their vow was fully broken or only partially broken.</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Fully Broken.</strong> If a character breaks their Sacred Vow intentionally and fully, the vow is permanently broken. This could happen if a character who’s sworn a Vow of Truth tells a direct lie or if a character who’s sworn a Vow of Mercy deliberately slays a sentient creature. To restore a permanently broken vow, if you decide that it is at all possible, a character must beseech their deity directly, or find a divine agent – such as an Oathbinder – to mediate for them.</p><p><strong>Partially Broken.</strong> When a character breaks their Sacred Vow unintentionally or because they were magically compelled to do so, they lose the benefits of their vow for 24 hours. This could happen if a character who’s sworn a @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.s8Zxm18Gmm4TIq57]{Vow of Loyalty} is tricked into attacking their liege, or if a creature who’s sworn a @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.BzR6owLI2OXjgQE0]{Vow of Pacifism} accidentally pushes a creature into a pit of acid. What constitutes a partial break has as much to do with intent as anything else. A clever character may be able to come up with ways to lie without actually lying, but divine entities are not stupid; any attempts to deliberately circumvent one’s vow usually means breaking it at least partially.</p></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Additional Penalties</p><p>If you want Sacred Vows to carry more risk, you can decide that breaking a vow comes with additional penalties. In this way, breaking a vow doesn’t just mean losing a benefit – it also introduces an actual penalty. You can find a selection of such penalties under @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.lQ2zIJu97ZbrlwCk.JournalEntryPage.EPJvW6wAPOGaCQjh]{Divine Retribution}. At your discretion, this penalty may apply until the character finishes a long rest, until the vow is reforged, or until it is removed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}</em> or similar magic.</p></blockquote><h3>Vows</h3><p>Below is a selection of eight Sacred Vows. <span style=\"font-family:Bookmania\">Item versions of the vows can be found in the Items folder.</span></p><h4>Vow of Enmity</h4><p>You vow to be the enemy of a specific creature or type of creature, such as the wizard Adderghast, all red Dragons, or all Undead. Your dedication to that creature’s destruction grants you the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Attack rolls you make against that creature or type of creature is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws you make against the spells and abilities of that creature or type of creature.</p></li></ul><p>You break your vow if you do anything that aids a creature you have sworn enmity toward, or if you knowingly work alongside your sworn enemy.</p><h4>Vow of Freedom</h4><p>You vow to fight against oppression and slavery. Your dedication grants you the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Your speed increases by 10 feet.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to avoid or end the Grappled or Restrained condition on yourself.</p></li></ul><p>You break your vow if you willingly enslave or imprison others for an extended period of time.</p><h4>Vow of Knowledge</h4><p>You vow to seek out and protect knowledge at all costs. Your dedication grants you the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information.</p></li><li><p>As a reaction, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or saving throw it isn’t proficient in, you can allow the creature to add your proficiency bonus to the saving throw. A creature can only benefit from this once per long rest.</p></li></ul><p>You break your vow if you willingly destroy or conceal knowledge that could benefit others.</p><h4>Vow of Loyalty</h4><p>You vow to obey the commands of another creature and protect them with your life. Your dedication to that creature grants the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>While the creature is within 30 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws.</p></li><li><p>When the creature takes damage while within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to halve the damage (rounded up) it takes. If you do, you take the remaining half.</p></li></ul><p>You break your vow when you disobey a command given by that creature or cause harm to that creature.</p><h4>Vow of Mercy</h4><p>You vow to never kill a sentient creature. Your dedication to mercy grants you the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>Whenever you cause another creature to regain hit points, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on death saving throws. Moreover, you regain 1 hit point if you roll a 19 or 20 on the d20 when rolling a Death Saving Throw.</p></li></ul><p>You break your vow when you act in a manner that causes the death of a sentient creature.</p><h4>Vow of Pacifism</h4><p>You vow to never harm another creature. Your dedication to peace grants you the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You gain a +1 bonus to AC and all saving throws.</p></li><li><p>Any creature that targets you with an attack or harmful spell or ability must first make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failure, the creature must choose a new target for the attack, spell, or ability, or lose it. A creature that succeeds on this save is immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p></li></ul><p>You break your vow when you cause another creature to take damage.</p><h4>Vow of Poverty</h4><p>You vow to never possess more than you need. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You need only half as much food, drink, and sleep as you normally would.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.</p></li></ul><p>You break your vow when you own or use currency or an object that has a value of more than 1 gp. You can possess up to five objects that are omitted from this restriction, such as a suit of armor, a weapon, or a tool kit. You must be able to carry these objects on your person and each must have a practical value that corresponds to its monetary value (a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.59pjg8FGM4GG4Fdd]{+1 dagger}</em> is acceptable, but a gem-studded regular dagger isn’t).</p><h4>Vow of Truth</h4><p>You vow to never willingly tell a lie. Your dedication to the truth grants you the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You have advantage on Insight and Persuasion checks, as well as Investigation and Perception checks made to discern illusions or forgeries.</p></li><li><p>You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed condition on yourself.</p></li></ul><p>You break your vow when you tell a lie.</p></div>"

Hallway of Perils</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>This 10-foot wide hallway stretches for 30 feet and ends at another obsidian door. Three torches set at regular intervals fill the hallway with dim light.</p></blockquote><p>The Hallway of Perils is a trap-littered hallway that promises swift death to unwary adventures.</p><p><em><strong>Dart Trap.</strong></em> A faint beam of light thin as a thread spans the hallway 10 feet in at a height of 3 feet. If the beam is broken, magical darts shoot down the length of the hallway from west to east, disappearing as they reach the hallway’s end. Each creature in the hallway must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 4d6]] Piercing damage on a failure and half as much on a success.</p><p><em><strong>Swinging Blade Trap.</strong></em> A faint screen of light spans the hallway 20 feet in, reaching from floor to ceiling. If the light is broken for more than a second (such as by a creature walking calmly through it) three huge axe blades come swinging out from invisible slits in the wall around it and each creature within 5 feet of the screen of light must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 4d6]] Slashing damage on a failure and half as much on a success.</p><p><em><strong>Spiked Pit Trap.</strong></em> The last 10 feet of the hallway’s tiles are partly illusory, their true nature revealed only by the faint light they emanate. Though they are illusory, the tiles hold firm until 20 lbs or more weight is placed upon them – unless the weight is distributed across at least two points. If a creature walks normally across the tiles, the magical tiles vanish, and the creature falls 10 feet into a pit filled with spikes and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 2d6]] Bludgeoning damage and [[/r 2d6]] Piercing damage on a failure and half as much on a success. It’s impossible to jump the tiles while the door at the end of the hallway is closed.</p><p><em><strong>Noticing the Traps.</strong></em> As the traps’ light is very dim, they are nearly impossible to detect unless it’s dark. While the hallway is lit by the torches on the walls, a character searching for traps must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check for each trap to notice the light that reveals its presence. If the torch next to the trap has been covered, dispelled, or moved, casting the area in relative darkness, the light is clearly noticeable.</p><p><em><strong>Bypassing the Traps.</strong></em> As indicated by the dark riddle in area @UUID[.1AwNXQ7PNTONZ5D5]{S1. Antechamber}, clever characters can bypass the traps by moving through the hallway in specific ways. A character can easily crawl under the beam of light by the Dart Trap to avoid triggering it. A character that runs through the sheen of light by the Swinging Blade Trap won’t break its light long enough to trigger it. Finally, a creature walking past the last tiles either without lifting their feet or with the aid of a cane or crutch won’t trigger the Spiked Pit Trap.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Running S2. Hallway of Perils</p><p>The Hallway of Perils challenges the characters with three separate traps as they move down the hallway:</p><ul><li><p>First, a dart trap that can be avoided by crawling.</p></li><li><p>Second, a swinging blade trap that can be avoided by running.</p></li><li><p>Third, a spiked pit trap that can be avoided by taking shuffling steps or using a cane.</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Trap Triggers.</strong></em> Each trap is revealed only by faint light, which makes it very difficult to spot (DC 25) unless the magical torch by each trap is moved or extinguished so the light is clearly visible. The plaque and Hallway Riddle in area @UUID[.1AwNXQ7PNTONZ5D5]{S1. Antechamber} hint at both the benefit of darkness and how each trap can be avoided.<br /><em><strong>Tips &amp; Advice.</strong></em> As the characters enter the hallway, make sure to emphasize the presence of the torches and give the front-most character(s) an opportunity to search for traps, before going ahead. The character(s) should only be able to spot the trap immediately in front of them, so once they’ve moved past the first trap, give them another opportunity to see if they can spot and avoid the next trap, and so on.</p></blockquote></div>"

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the depiction.</p><p><em><strong>Poison Bottle Riddle.</strong></em> The plaque underneath the bottles reads in Common:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“One rhymes with what it makes you,<br />Another takes what it seems to be,<br />Innocence is pretty, but never true,<br />Envy’s a sin, oh yes, you’ll see,<br />The last is power, always there beneath,<br />Choose only one, or all you get is grief.”</p></blockquote><p>Each line of the riddle presents a clue, in order:</p><ul><li><p>The red potion is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.qBSEGJyHxdKIlBfj]{potion of poison}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The gold liquid is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.RdRri8zF7IpGfS3c]{potion of poverty}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The white liquid is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.qBSEGJyHxdKIlBfj]{potion of poison}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The green liquid is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.qBSEGJyHxdKIlBfj]{potion of poison}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The black liquid is a <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.YKxVNecwGJ3dx0wC]{potion of divine essence}</em>.</p></li><li><p>The characters will “get grief” if they take more than one potion (see Poison Gas Trap).</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Poison Gas Trap.</strong></em> If the characters remove more than one potion from the rack on the wall, poisonous gas billows forth from tiny holes at the foot of the sarcophagus. Each creature inside the chamber must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking [[/r 4d6]] Poison damage on a failure and half as much on a success. A creature that fails this save is also Poisoned for 1 hour.</p><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Sarcophagus.</strong></em> The sarcophagus seems to be a solid block of stone with no lid or openings. A creature that carefully investigates the sarcophagus and succeeds on a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a tiny slit where the painted woman’s hands cross over her heart. If the room is cast in darkness, the faint light that shines from the slit reveals it clearly. A character who knows what they’re looking for also finds the slit easily. The slit is exactly wide enough to fit a thin blade – when inserted, a hatch pops open to reveal a small, square compartment.</p><p style=\"text-indent:1em\"><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> The compartment holds a heart-shaped purple amethyst (500 gp) that is also the key to area @UUID[.33hTg9SElM8YoYyq]{S8.

          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h2\">S6. Hall of Reckoning</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>This long hall has curving walls and is lined with pillars of obsidian carved with grimacing faces; some are contorted in anger or arrogance, others display solemn patience or melancholy compassion. Dim light from several torches illuminates the room and reveals a plaque on the foremost pillar.</p></blockquote><p>In this hall, visitors must hide or mask themselves or be assailed by splinters of their own personality.</p><p><em><strong>Shadow Riddle.</strong></em> The plaque on the pillar directly in front of the characters reads in Common:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“Unseen in the dark,<br />Unread like a mask,<br />Secret and stark,<br />No eyes, no ask.”</p></blockquote><p>Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) checks knows that this rhyme is a popular phrase with followers of the Masked One and that it encourages followers to move stealthily and mask emotions. If the area around the plaque is cast in darkness, the words “dark” and “mask” glow, hinting at how the party can pass through the hall unscathed.</p><p><em><strong>Pillars.</strong></em> A character who actively investigates or observes the pillars notices that the faces on the pillars have six distinct expressions: a friendly, compassionate expression, a greedy, hungry-looking expression, a bored, unassuming expression, a prideful, sneering expression, a calm, stoic expression, and an angry, hateful expression. They may also note that the faces’ eyes seem to follow specific characters as they move about the room – i.e., all the angry faces may focus on a particular character and so on.</p><p><em><strong>Soulsplinter Sprites.</strong></em> When at least one character reaches the middle of this hall, <strong>soulsplinter sprites</strong> spring forth from the pillars and attack the party – one for each character who hasn’t avoided their notice (see Avoiding Notice below). Each sprite embodies one of the characters’ most dominant personality traits, so that a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.6G4G0sPTMKbK55rh]{soulsplinter sprite (wrath)}</strong> springs forth to attack the raging barbarian and a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.2Z2qbfZBFecYptUH]{soulsplinter sprite (compassion)}</strong> appears to attack the goodly cleric. The sprites vaguely resemble that character and use that character’s proficiency bonus to determine its power.</p><p><em><strong>Avoiding Notice.</strong></em> Characters can avoid the sprites’ notice by either masking their emotions or by sneaking as they move through the hall. Doing so requires a successful DC 20 Charisma (Deception) or Dexterity (Stealth) check. The DC is reduced by 5 for the Deception check if they wear a mask and by 5 for the Stealth check if the chamber is cast in darkness. A character who succeeds on this check doesn’t spawn a soulsplinter sprite as they move through the hall.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Running S6. Hall of Reckoning</p><p>The Hall of Reckoning tests visitors’ aptitude for deception and stealth – two traits the Masked One values. Characters who enter the hall carelessly will be assailed by <strong>soulsplinter sprites</strong> embodying their most dominant personality traits. If the characters employ darkness and/or mask themselves, as hinted at in the Shadow Riddle, their chances of moving through the chamber unnoticed by the sprites are much improved.</p><p><em><strong>Tips &amp; Advice.</strong></em> If the characters experiment with masking their emotions or moving stealthily, give them subtle clues that their efforts are working, such as noting how the faces’ eyes are drawn to characters who make no efforts at stealth. When a character approaches the door to @UUID[.oJtg1EoKqqigBKlZ]{area S7} without using deception or stealth, or failing their check to do so, have a <strong>soulsplinter sprite</strong> appear for each character in the hall who took no steps to conceal themselves.

A character who takes the time to look closer at the altar and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (History or Religion) check notices they don’t show anything that would normally be associated with the Masked One, but rather scenes of unicorns frolicking, a priestess healing the wounded, and brave knights fighting dragons.</p><p><em><strong>Shadow Blade.</strong></em> The blade lying on the altar is a magical construct made from solid shadow.

A creature takes [[/r 2d6]] Bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns while Restrained in this way.</p><p><em><strong>Missing Words Riddle.</strong></em> A character that approaches the altar notices that something is written on the wall behind it in Common, over a heart-shaped indentation:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“The best way to protect from theft,<br />Is to lose all, have nothing<br />Hidden under stone and gloss,<br />Two hands atop to form a<br />Truth inside the maiden’s heart,<br />Blade pierces, always under”</p></blockquote><p>Three words are missing from this riddle: the second line should end with “left,” the fourth line should end with “cross,” and the final line should end with “guard.” Together, these three words read “Left Cross Guard” which refers to area @UUID[.qSZTI8bbunKvDpTE]{S5.

class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Choosing Divine Spells</p><p>As literal gods, it makes sense that deities can cast virtually any spell in existence. Since that can be a bit hard to keep track off, the Domain Spellcasting table provides some suggestions for spells based on each of the twelve core Divine Domains. If you want your deity to be able to cast spells that aren’t listed here, don’t hesitate to change or expand the deity’s selection of spells as you see fit. Likewise, the base stat blocks and Domain Spells table includes only spells that are viable in combat. Outside of combat, the deity should be able to cast any spell that you would want it to – it just doesn’t make sense to list those spells in its stat block.</p></blockquote></div>"

This is the number of features that is included in the deity’s Challenge Rating if you are using one of the base stat blocks in this chapter.</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"4\">Included Divine Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Stat Block</strong></td><td><strong>Benefits</strong></td><td><strong>Traits</strong></td><td><strong>Actions</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Lesser Deity</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Standard Deity</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Greater Deity</td><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Suggested Divine Features table on the following page provides suggestions for which features go well with which Divine Domains.</p><h5>Selecting Additional Features</h5><p>If you want to give your deity additional benefits, traits, and actions, or even lair actions or divine forms, the deity may become significantly more powerful. The Additional Divine Features table provides an estimate for how much adding additional features – beyond what is included for each base stat block – increases the deity’s Challenge Rating.</p><table class=\"last-align-right\"><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Additional Divine Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>CR Increase</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Divine Benefit</td><td>+1/3 CR</td></tr><tr><td>Divine Trait/Action</td><td>+1/2 CR</td></tr><tr><td>Divine Form</td><td>+3 CR</td></tr><tr><td>Lair Actions</td><td>+2 CR</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Following these guidelines, giving a CR 10 lesser deity three additional divine benefits and one additional divine action, would mean increasing its CR by 1½, resulting in a total of CR of 12 when rounded up.</p><h5>Calculating Bonuses &amp; Modifiers</h5><p>When you change a creature’s ability scores, as it is possible to do using divine benefits, or increase its Challenge Rating by giving it additional divine features, you may inadvertently alter the creature’s proficiency bonus, its bonuses to attacks, and the save DCs of its features. Below are guidelines on how to handle the deity’s bonuses and modifiers.</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Proficiency Bonus.</strong> In fifth edition, a creature’s proficiency bonus increases whenever the creature’s Challenge Rating reaches 5 (+3), 9 (+4), 13 (+5), 17 (+6), 21 (+7), 25 (+8), and 29 (+9). If you want to avoid recalculating features and bonuses when the deity’s CR increases, you can decide to forgo increasing its proficiency bonus and instead regard CR as just a tool to gauge a monster’s difficulty.</p><p><strong>Attack Bonus.</strong> A creature’s weapon attacks typically have a bonus to hit equal to its Strength (melee) or Dexterity (ranged) modifier + its proficiency bonus. A spell attack typically uses the creature’s primary mental ability modifier – which is, at your discretion, just the creature’s highest ability score out of Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma.</p><p><strong>Save DC.</strong> The save DC for a creature’s effects is equal to 8 + its proficiency bonus + an ability modifier. Which ability modifier the save DC uses typically depends on the effect. Actions that Grapple, Restrain, Stun, or physically move a creature typically use Strength, while breath weapons and similar effects are typically based on Constitution. Features such as spells and spell-like effects, as well as actions that target a creature’s mind, are typically based on the creature’s primary mental ability.</p></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Balancing Divine Features</p><p>While an effort has been made to make the divine features presented here balanced, it is not impossible to create a combination of divine features that is much more powerful than other combinations (i.e., making your deity immune to all types of damage, for example). In the end, your deity will be as powerful as you want it to be – this system is mostly meant to provide a framework for you to work within. If you feel that a combination of features makes your deity more powerful than the guidelines otherwise would suggest, you should adjust your deity’s CR accordingly.</p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Suggested Divine Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Domain</strong></td><td><strong>Suggested Features</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Chaos</td><td>Aura of Bloodlust, Change Fate, Warp Spell, Wild Surge</td></tr><tr><td>Darkness</td><td>Aura of Fear, Damage Immunity: Necrotic, Dark Master, Incite Shadows</td></tr><tr><td>Death</td><td>Aura of Death, Damage Immunity: Necrotic, Enslave Soul</td></tr><tr><td>Fate</td><td>Aura of Captivation, Change Fate, Mark of Misfortune, Reactive, Revert Time</td></tr><tr><td>Knowledge</td><td>Aura of Divinity, Divine Focus, Mind Blast, Memory Flux, Omniscient</td></tr><tr><td>Life</td><td>Aura of Absorption, Aura of Hope, Divine Blast, God’s Blood, Regeneration</td></tr><tr><td>Light</td><td>Aura of Sunlight, Damage Immunity: Radiant, Holy Spirit</td></tr><tr><td>Magic</td><td>Counterspell, Magic Immunity, Quick Spellcasting, Reflect Spell, Unravel</td></tr><tr><td>Nature</td><td>Aura of Tranquility, Entangling Strike, Living Armor, Regeneration, Wild Surge</td></tr><tr><td>Order</td><td>Aura of Divinity, Condition Immunities: Paralyzed &amp; Stunned, Injunction, Omniscient</td></tr><tr><td>Peace</td><td>Aura of Tranquility, Captivating Presence, Injunction, Rebuke</td></tr><tr><td>War</td><td>Aura of Bloodlust, Aura of Fear, Bash, Coward’s Bane, Divine Dash, Divine Warcry</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Divine Benefits</h3><p>Divine Benefits are passive improvements that incrementally increase the deity’s power.

Talk about killing morale.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, you want a deity that defies mortal reasoning – whether that means increasing the deity’s CR to more than 30 or just having a deity that can do more than would be otherwise possible. This is where the idea of multiple Divine Forms can be useful.</p><p>The concept is simple: when the deity drops to 0 hit points, it isn’t destroyed but instead reshapes itself and assumes a new form. This new form can either have the same statistics but have all its hit points and features recharged, be a variant with new features, or have completely different statistics that force its enemies to change their approach to the combat entirely. In essence, the deity’s foes will have to defeat it twice or even thrice, potentially in different forms, before the deity is completely destroyed.</p><p>Below are two approaches to this concept: Divine Reincarnation and Divine Restoration.</p><h5>Divine Reincarnation</h5><p>When creating a deity, you can create up to three separate stat blocks with the same CR, each of which represents one of the deity’s forms, and give each form (aside from the last) the Divine Form trait:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-feature\"><p><em><strong>Divine Reincarnation.</strong></em> When the deity would die or drop to 0 hit points, its form dissipates and it instantly reappears in a new form in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of where this form disappeared.</p></blockquote><h5>Divine Restoration</h5><p>If you prefer to only provide your deity with one form, you can also give it the Divine Restoration trait instead, with X being the amount of times you want the deity to be able to be restored in this way:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-feature\"><p><em><strong>Divine Restoration (X/Day).</strong></em> When the deity would die or drop to 0 hit points, it is instead fully restored. Any harmful conditions, spells, and effects on the deity end, it is restored to its maximum hit points, and all its actions and traits (except this one) immediately recharge, including its Legendary Resistances and uses of its Spellcasting.</p></blockquote><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>Another way to increase a deity’s challenge and make the combat more interesting is to give the deity Lair Actions. These are actions the deity can use while it is in its realm – which could be a single building, a large dungeon, or the entirety of its celestial plane.</p><h5>Lair Actions</h5><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the deity can take one of the following lair actions; the deity can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Binding.</strong> Each creature of the deity’s choice within its realm must succeed on a DC 15/17/20 Strength saving throw or be Restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p><p><strong>Enfeeblement.</strong> Each creature of the deity’s choice within its realm must succeed on a DC 15/17/20 Constitution saving throw or until initiative count 20 on the next round, the creature’s speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws using Strength or Dexterity.</p><p><strong>Invisibility.</strong> The deity and each creature of its choice within 60 feet becomes Invisible until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p><p><strong>Quake.</strong> Each creature of the deity’s choice that is standing on the ground within the deity’s realm must succeed on a DC 15/17/20 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8/3d8/4d8 Bludgeoning damage and be knocked Prone.</p><p><strong>Rejuvenation.</strong> The deity and each creature of its choice within 60 feet regains 2d8/3d8/4d8 hit points and is affected as by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}</em> spell.</p><p><strong>Summon Minions.</strong> The deity summons any number of creatures with a combined CR of up to 4/6/10 in unoccupied spaces within its realm. The creatures remain until reduced to 0 hit points or the deity uses this lair action again.</p><p><strong>Temporal Reflow.</strong> Each creature of the deity’s choice within its realm must reroll initiative.</p><p><strong>Weaken.</strong> Each creature of the deity’s choice within its realm must succeed on a DC 15/17/20 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8/3d8/4d8 Necrotic damage and the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken.</p></div></div>"

Do the gods exist? Do mortals believe that the gods exist – or do they know that the gods exist? These are simple, but pivotal questions. Typically, there are four ways to present divinity in a fantasy setting:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>No Divinity.</strong> There are no gods and nobody believes that there are.</p><p><strong>Dubious Divinity.</strong> It is uncertain whether gods actually exist, but some mortals believe in them.</p><p><strong>Assumed Divinity.</strong> The gods exist and some or most mortals believe in them.</p><p><strong>Definite Divinity.</strong> The gods exist and almost all mortals know that they exist.</p></div><p>Most officially published settings for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and other fantasy tabletop roleplaying games have either assumed or definite divinity, where the gods exist and most mortals either know that they exist, or at least believe that they do. After all, when a cleric’s prayers can facilitate magical miracles, there’s not a whole lot of wiggle room for true atheism.</p><h3>System of Divinity</h3><p>Typically, divinity is presented in one of the following base models in fantasy settings:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Monotheism.</strong> Only one true god exists. It may have different names or aspects and be worshiped in different ways, but there exists only one god.</p><p><strong>Dualism.</strong> Two divine entities exist and they are often opposites, such as good/evil or order/chaos.</p><p><strong>Pantheon.</strong> Multiple gods form one or more pantheons. Typically, each god represents different themes or aspects of divinity.</p><p><strong>Spiritualism.</strong> Gods in the traditional sense of the word don’t exist, but divine forces of nature, often portrayed as spirits, are present.</p></div><p>The pantheon model, which we know from Egyptian, Greek, and Norse mythologies, is the model of choice for most fantasy settings, including the most popular <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>’ settings, and is thus also the model we will focus on in this chapter.</p><h4>What does a Pantheon look like?</h4><p>If you use a pantheon in your campaign world, it’s a good idea to think about how it is structured. This includes considering the pantheon’s organization, hierarchy, and relationships:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Organization.</strong> The pantheon could be a single group of deities who, even as they embody different @UUID[.PiBlBddbRPw4BE0I#divine-domains]{Divine Domains}, are part of the same whole. The pantheon can also be split into subgroups of like-minded gods, such as “evil gods” and “good gods,” or even smaller subgroups within each major domain, such as “gods of order” or “gods of war,” and so on.</p><p><strong>Hierarchy.</strong> A pantheon may have a flat structure, where no gods have automatic authority over other gods. It can also have a more strict hierarchy, where greater gods command lesser gods, or where a divine sovereign – similar to Odin or Zeus – holds supreme authority over the other gods.</p><p><strong>Relationships.</strong> The gods may have little to no interaction with each other, existing as individual entities who stay mostly out of each other’s way. Conversely, the gods may be heavily interconnected, often visiting each other or even holding celestial council meetings.</p></div><p>In fantasy settings, there is a tendency towards pantheons that are loosely structured and have some sort of hierarchy, such as a “prime god” who has extra authority and/or a division of the gods into greater and lesser gods. In these types of pantheons, the gods usually have sporadic relationships, where they are able to interact with each other, but only do so under specific circumstances, such as when disaster looms.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>The Classic Pantheon is <strong>organized</strong> into smaller clusters of deities with similar themes, but no formal division exists. There is an Archgod who rules over all other gods, but there is otherwise no formal <strong>hierarchy</strong>. The gods have varying degrees of interaction with each other, ranging from no contact to close <strong>relationships</strong>.</p></blockquote><div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>The Draconic Pantheon is <strong>organized</strong> into two dualistic pantheons; one for chromatic dragons and one for metallic dragons. Each pantheon has a <strong>hierarchy</strong>, with the greater gods Tiamat and Bahamut ruling at the top. The dragon gods within each group have complex <strong>relationships</strong> and frequently interact.</p></blockquote></div><h4>How many Pantheons?</h4><p>It is not uncommon for fantasy settings to provide pantheons tailored to specific subgroups of mortals, such as Elvish or Dwarvish pantheons, or pantheons that are specific to a culture, nation, or continent. This approach implies that deities are bound to the same concepts of species, culture, and geography as mortals. If you don’t think that makes sense, it could also just be that various species, cultures, or regions of the world have different names and perceptions of what are, essentially, the same gods. The God of Light and Order may be referred to as “The Father of Elves” in elven realms and as “The Dawnbringer” in human-dominated societies – but still be the exact same deity.</p><h3>Divine Domains</h3><p>Because divinity is such an immense and unquantifiable concept that almost defies definition, it can be helpful to parcel it into lesser concepts that are easier to work with. In fantasy settings, these aspects of divinity are often referred to as Divine Domains.</p><h4>What is a Divine Domain?</h4><p>At its core, a Divine Domain is a theme – such as light, darkness, order, or nature – that defines a god’s area of interest and influence. Typically, each god is associated with at least one Divine Domain, and sometimes with multiple different domains. A god’s collection of Divine Domains is sometimes called its Divine Portfolio.</p><p>A Divine Domain isn’t a monolith that can only be interpreted in one way. It is not uncommon for two gods to share a Divine Domain but approach and understand it in very different ways. An evil god who has chaos as its Divine Domain might seek to cause a cataclysmic event that’ll plunge the Multiverse into madness. Conversely, a non-evil god with the same Divine Domain might just find enjoyment in taking risks and pulling harmless pranks.</p><h4>Which Divine Domains exist?</h4><p>It is up to you to decide which Divine Domains exist in your world. You may opt to work only with the Divine Domains that clerics can choose from in the fifth edition of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, or you may decide that virtually any ideal or theme can be a Divine Domain.</p><p>In this book, we have chosen to work with twelve core Divine Domains, which are some the most often mentioned domains in Dungeons &amp; Dragons and similar fantasy tabletop roleplaying games:</p><p> </p><table class=\"odds-align-center\"><thead><tr><th colspan=\"4\">Core Divine Domains</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>[[/r d12]]</strong></td><td><strong>Domain</strong></td><td><strong>[[/r d12]]</strong></td><td><strong>Domain</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Chaos</td><td>7</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Darkness</td><td>8</td><td>Magic</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Death</td><td>9</td><td>Nature</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Fate</td><td>10</td><td>Order</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Knowledge</td><td>11</td><td>Peace</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Life</td><td>12</td><td>War</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In most cases, these core Divine Domains are enough to encompass all aspects of divinity. If you want to take a more granular approach, you can also find a selection of alternate domains or subdomains in the Additional Divine Domains table. To avoid over-complicating matters, however, this book will, for the most part, only reference these twelve core Divine Domains.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Divinity &amp; Alignment</p><p>While alignments are sometimes considered relived vestiges of the early days of tabletop roleplaying games, the concept of alignment can be useful when it comes to deities, who typically embody ideals. That’s also why evil and good aren’t Divine Domains on their own, but can instead be used to inspire different interpretations of the same Divine Domain – i.e., how does a chaotic evil God of Nature differ from a lawful good God of Nature?</p></blockquote><table class=\"odds-align-center\"><thead><tr><th colspan=\"4\">Additional Divine Domains</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>[[/r d100]]</strong></td><td><strong>Domain</strong></td><td><strong>[[/r d100]]</strong></td><td><strong>Domain</strong></td></tr><tr><td>01-02</td><td>Air</td><td>51-52</td><td>Madness</td></tr><tr><td>03-04</td><td>Animals</td><td>53-54</td><td>Mercy</td></tr><tr><td>05-06</td><td>Art</td><td>55-56</td><td>Moon</td></tr><tr><td>07-08</td><td>Beauty</td><td>57-58</td><td>Murder</td></tr><tr><td>09-10</td><td>Civilization</td><td>59-60</td><td>Nobility</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>Courage</td><td>61-62</td><td>Pain</td></tr><tr><td>13-14</td><td>Decay</td><td>63-64</td><td>Plants</td></tr><tr><td>15-16</td><td>Destruction</td><td>65-66</td><td>Protection</td></tr><tr><td>17-18</td><td>Dreams</td><td>67-68</td><td>Renewal</td></tr><tr><td>19-20</td><td>Duty</td><td>69-70</td><td>Retribution</td></tr><tr><td>21-22</td><td>Earth</td><td>71-72</td><td>Secrets</td></tr><tr><td>23-24</td><td>Family</td><td>73-74</td><td>Strength</td></tr><tr><td>25-26</td><td>Fertility</td><td>75-76</td><td>Summer</td></tr><tr><td>27-28</td><td>Fire</td><td>77-78</td><td>Sun</td></tr><tr><td>29-30</td><td>Freedom</td><td>79-80</td><td>Tempest</td></tr><tr><td>31-32</td><td>Glory</td><td>81-82</td><td>Time</td></tr><tr><td>33-34</td><td>Honor</td><td>83-84</td><td>Travel</td></tr><tr><td>35-36</td><td>Hope</td><td>85-86</td><td>Trickery</td></tr><tr><td>37-38</td><td>Invention</td><td>87-88</td><td>Truth</td></tr><tr><td>39-40</td><td>Justice</td><td>89-90</td><td>Twilight</td></tr><tr><td>41-42</td><td>Joy</td><td>91-92</td><td>Undeath</td></tr><tr><td>43-44</td><td>Law</td><td>93-94</td><td>Water</td></tr><tr><td>45-46</td><td>Loss</td><td>95-96</td><td>Wealth</td></tr><tr><td>47-48</td><td>Love</td><td>97-98</td><td>Wisdom</td></tr><tr><td>49-50</td><td>Luck</td><td>99-00</td><td>Winter</td></tr></tbody></table><div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Classic Pantheon typically have <strong>multiple domains</strong> in their Divine Portfolio, at least one of which is a core Divine Domain.</p></blockquote></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Draconic Pantheon usually have <strong>multiple domains</strong> in their Divine Portfolio, except for Tiamat and Bahamut, who represent chaos and order respectively.

        "Defining Divinity": {
          "name": "Defining Divinity",
          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h1\">Defining Divinity</p><p>When we have decided how divinity is presented in our world, it’s time to define what divine existence is. At the heart of nearly every religion is the idea of a deity – a divine entity who channels otherworldly powers, performs miracles, hears prayers, and everything in between. If religion is a web, the deity is the spider that weaves it, traverses it, and sits at its center, pulling the strings. Thus, to understand divinity and religion, the most important thing we must do is define deism: what it means to be a god.</p><h3>Divine Existence</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>Whatever you think the gods are or aren’t, one thing’s for certain: they’re arrogant, self-serving, and ruthless. And dangerous. In the end, that’s all anyone really needs to know.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>It is implicit in the word deity or god, that we are talking about a supreme being; an entity who is powerful, otherworldly, and spiritual in nature. But what the deity is – as in, what type of creature it actually is, if it even is a creature at all – is up to you. Below are the most common answers to that question:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Deity.</strong> A category unto itself, there exists no clear definition of what a deity is, except that it is a divine being. This approach works well if deities are permanent and relatively obscure – i.e., the gods have always been there and will always be there, and it is impossible to interact directly with them.</p><p><strong>Celestial Spirit.</strong> Another common approach is that deities are powerful spirits. Akin to a primordial elemental, a deity is, at its core, a celestial spirit that is functionally the same as any other creature, except that it is much more powerful – and that it has worshipers or believers.</p><p><strong>Divine Spark.</strong> The deity is defined solely by its Divine Spark. Simply put, a Divine Spark is what sets gods apart from mortals – sort of like a god’s soul or spirit. It often is (but doesn’t have to be) the essence of the god’s power, including its ability to receive worship, govern over Divine Domains, shepherd souls in the afterlife, or whatever unique powers the gods have in your world. If a creature has a Divine Spark, it is a deity – regardless of whether it is otherwise an archangel, a demon lord, or even a mere mortal.</p></div><p>Any approach to this question can work, but the most common seems to be the third option, which has the benefit of giving us something – a Divine Spark – to define deism with. You either have it, or you don’t.</p><h4>Where are the Gods?</h4><p>As any other creature that exists, a god needs to exist <em>somewhere</em>, even if that somewhere is everywhere. The answer to that question – where do the gods exist? – can vary for each individual deity, but is typically one of the three following places:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Metaphysical.</strong> As otherworldly entities, the gods are nowhere and everywhere. Either as invisible, intangible spirits that travel from location to location, or as omnipresent entities that are woven directly into the fabric of existence. This approach works well in a setting where the gods are more mystical and spiritual than actual, “living” creatures the player characters can interact with directly.</p><p><strong>Extraplanar.</strong> The gods live on other planes of existence, such as Heaven, the Nine Hells, or any number of other planes of your choosing. The gods may all reside on the same plane, like most of the gods in Norse mythology are often portrayed as living together in Valhalla, or on different planes that correspond with their Divine Domains.</p><p><strong>Mortal World.</strong> The gods may also live in the world of mortals – either hidden in plain sight as invisible spirits or disguised as mortals, in remote or secret locations, or even openly, striding among mortals in their full divine splendor. Greek mythology is an example of this, where most of the gods reside on Mount Olympus, which is often interpreted as a real mountain that exists in Greece.</p></div><p>As mentioned, the answer to this question can vary a lot, and each approach carries its own interesting ramifications. Most commonly in the settings associated with Dungeons &amp; Dragons, deities live on different planes of existence in a vast Multiverse – sometimes governing over their own separate plane of existence, or living together in small groups on the same plane. It is, however, not uncommon for some ancient deity to be hidden away in the Mortal World, or for gods to live among mortals for a limited time, either because they choose to or because they have been banished from their celestial realms.</p><div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Classic Pantheon are, for the most part, <strong>celestial spirits</strong> defined by their <strong>Divine Sparks</strong>. They live in <strong>extraplanar realms</strong> – some together in groups, others alone on their own plane.</p></blockquote></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Draconic Pantheon are dragons imbued with <strong>Divine Sparks</strong>. Except for Tiamat and Bahamut, who are <strong>celestial spirits</strong> that reside in <strong>extraplanar realms</strong>, the dragon deities live in the <strong>Mortal World</strong>.</p></blockquote><h4>Where do Gods come from?</h4><p>Though they can seem to transcend creation, gods often come from somewhere, even in real-world religions. There are a multitude of different answers to the question of where gods come from, and it may vary from god to god, but the most common are:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Eternal.</strong> Gods have always been there – or have at least been there from the very beginning – and will always be there.</p><p><strong>Created.</strong> Gods are created, either by cataclysmic events, a powerful divine force or a primordial archgod, or they are born from other gods.</p><p><strong>Transformed.</strong> Gods are mortal creatures who have been transformed, either through some grand event or powerful magic, or by divine forces upon the mortal’s ascension to the afterlife.</p></div><p>As is also the case in our own world’s many religions, it is not uncommon to employ a mix of these approaches in the same religion. Egyptian mythology had gods that were eternal or created, but also (at least in some periods) included beliefs that pharaohs were divine and would be transformed to at least partial godhood upon their deaths. The same is also the case in many official campaign settings, such as the Forgotten Realms, where some gods are eternal, some gods were created later, and some gods were transformed from mortals.</p><h4>How do you become a God?</h4><p>The answer to this question – how can a mortal become a god? – can lay the foundation for a whole campaign or provide the ultimate personal goal for a player character. Here are some of the most commonly described ways in which a mortal can attain godhood:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Magic.</strong> A mortal creature may be able to attain godhood through powerful magic. Whether hidden away in ancient texts or relentlessly researched by a powerful archmage, the secret of attaining godhood is out there and, naturally, coveted by many mortals.</p><p><strong>Taken.</strong> A mortal creature can become a god by taking the Divine Spark from an existing deity. Most commonly, this is done by killing the god upon which the mortal can assume the god’s Divine Portfolio. It could also be that a god’s divinity is stored in an ancient artifact that can be stolen or destroyed, or that magic exists that can transfer a god’s Divine Spark from one creature to another.</p><p><strong>Given.</strong> A god can cause a mortal to ascend to godhood, either by imbuing it with a fresh Divine Spark, or by imparting some or all of its own divinity to the creature. This could happen when a particularly worthy follower ascends to the afterlife or when a god sacrifices itself for a great cause and chooses a mortal to be its successor.</p></div><div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Most deities in the Classic Pantheon were <strong>created</strong> by the Archgod, who is <strong>eternal</strong>. A few gods are mortal creatures who have been <strong>transformed</strong> into gods by magic, or because they have <strong>taken</strong>, or were <strong>given</strong>, a deity’s Divine Spark.</p></blockquote></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Draconic Pantheon are dragons who have been <strong>transformed</strong>, except for Tiamat and Bahamut, who are <strong>eternal</strong>. Chromatic dragons attain godhood by slaying a deity and <strong>taking</strong> their Divine Spark, while metallic dragons are <strong>given</strong> their Divine Sparks by a council of their peers.</p></blockquote><h4>How do Gods die?</h4><p>Though gods are most commonly considered to be immortal, that does not have to mean that gods can’t die or cease to exist, just that they will never die of old age or natural causes. If you decide that gods can indeed die in your world, the next question becomes: how? Below are some common causes of death among deities in fantasy campaign settings:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Violence.</strong> Like mortals, gods can be slain with violence. Typically, only other gods have the ability or necessary power to slay a god. Sometimes, however, a mortal may get their hands on a particularly powerful artifact or spell that gives them the power to harm or even kill a god.</p><p><strong>Obscurity.</strong> If the gods’ powers depend on the worship or souls of their mortal followers, or the spread of their Divine Domains, they may be weakened or even die as their powers diminish. A minor God of Light may fade away and cease to exist as its last worshiper dies, or the God of War may die if the entire world is ever at peace at the same time.</p><p><strong>Limited Lifespans.</strong> It may also be that the gods have limited lifespans, just like mortals. Perhaps their divine power is finite, and once they’ve given it all away to their worshipers, they cease to exist. Or maybe each god reigns for a thousand years, after which a worthy mortal is raised up to take its place and assume the deity’s Divine Spark and Divine Portfolio.</p></div><p>Most commonly in fantasy settings, gods can die, even if it’s a rare occurrence. Typically, a god dies because it is slain by its peers or because it chooses to cease to exist, for some reason or another. The idea that the deity’s immortality is connected to the worship of its followers is an interesting one, however. Even if losing worshipers isn’t lethal in itself, the loss of power associated with losing worshipers is often used to explain how a god became weak enough to be slain.</p><h4>What happens when a God dies?</h4><p>As a rule of thumb, the death of a major god is almost always a near-cataclysmic event with massive ramifications – something that is felt across the entire Mortal World in one way or another. The death of a divine being in a fantasy world can be handled in many different ways. Below are some ideas:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Worshipers.</strong> A god’s death leaves behind a deep, almost maddening void. This vacuum is felt by its worshipers, who suddenly can’t channel divine magic or call upon the god, and perhaps even by every being in the Multiverse. In some cases, the sudden absence of the god drives its worshipers insane or even kills them outright.</p><p><strong>Domains.</strong> The god’s death may also cause catastrophes associated with its Divine Domains – when the God of Nature dies, plants whither and die or natural disasters abound, and when the God of Magic dies, magic items cease to function or spellcasting becomes erratic and unstable.</p><p><strong>Divine Spark.</strong> The god’s Divine Spark may linger, just waiting for someone to attempt to assume it – whether it be another god or a mortal!</p></div><p>The death of a god could very easily be the start of a campaign – or the culmination of one. Whatever the case, a major deity’s death should never be a trifling matter, lest you risk that the concept of divinity becomes somewhat cheapened.</p><h4>What happens to a dead God?</h4><p>Another question we should consider is what happens to a deity when it dies. Below are some options:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Divine Afterlife.</strong> In a setting where there is a greater deity or divine entity above the gods, the gods may go to a sort of Heaven above Heaven – a realm specifically for dead deities.</p><p><strong>Divine Corpse.</strong> The god’s corpse lies where it was slain or is set adrift in the Astral Plane, as a stark reminder that nobody cheats death. Perhaps this corpse holds the last vestiges of its Divine Spark – and maybe a powerful being can even use the corpse as a catalyst to resurrect the deity.</p><p><strong>Reincarnation.</strong> The god may be reincarnated in a new form, such as a mortal baby, a natural beast, or a ghostly spirit. It could also be that the deity becomes a mortal when slain, and awakens in the Mortal World – finding a reincarnated god and restoring it to greatness would be a quest fit for true heroes!</p><p><strong>Dissipation.</strong> When a god dies, it simply ceases to exist, leaving nothing behind (except for, perhaps, its Divine Spark).</p></div><div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Classic Pantheon can only die by <strong>violence</strong>. When a deity dies, it is often a catastrophe for the deity’s <strong>worshipers</strong> and its <strong>Divine Domains</strong>. The deity itself <strong>dissipates</strong>, leaving behind only its <strong>Divine Spark</strong>.</p></blockquote></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Draconic Pantheon can die by <strong>violence</strong>, and, except for Tiamat and Bahamut, have <strong>limited lifespans</strong> (though they live for millennia). When a draconic deity dies in the Mortal World, it leaves behind a <strong>divine corpse</strong> and its <strong>Divine Spark</strong>, but its death is otherwise not a catastrophic event.</p></blockquote><h3>Divine Power</h3><p>Part of being a god is to have incredible powers that mortals can only dream of. Thus, we should decide <em>where</em> the gods gain their power from, <em>what</em> powers they have, and <em>how</em> their divine power is limited.</p><h4>Where does Divine Power come from?</h4><p>The sources of the gods’ powers can greatly influence their goals and motivations, as well as their relationships with each other and their followers. Four of the most common answers to this question are:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Innate.</strong> A deity is imbued with divine power that is either infinite or self-replenishing. Various restrictions may prevent the deity from being omnipotent, but it has divine power that is innate and unaffected by outside factors.</p><p><strong>Worship.</strong> A deity’s power is based on the number of worshipers it has and/or the quality of its worshipers. Whether it is enough that people believe in the deity, or active prayers, rituals, and sacrifices are required, the commonality is that the deity gains power through worship.</p><p><strong>Domains.</strong> A deity gains power through its Divine Domains – that is, how prevalent its domains are in the Mortal World or across the planes of existence. The God of War gains strength when the world is at war while the God of Nature gains power when nature flourishes, and so on.</p><p><strong>Souls.</strong> A deity gains power through the souls or spirits that flock to it in the afterlife. These souls may be absorbed by the deity to become part of it, or their mere presence in its divine realm provides the deity with power, either directly or as they are transformed into powerful servants such as celestials or fiends.</p></div><p>It is important to note that these sources of divine power are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the most common approach in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> campaign settings is to mix all four. In this mixed model, each deity has a measure of innate divine power, and also gains divine power based on how much it is worshiped, how prominent its Divine Domains are across the planes, and how many devoted souls it can gather.</p><div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Classic Pantheon have <strong>innate</strong> divine power and gain additional divine power from <strong>worship</strong>, <strong>domains</strong>, and <strong>souls</strong>.</p></blockquote></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Draconic Pantheon have <strong>innate</strong> divine power and gain additional divine power from <strong>worship</strong>. Only the greater gods Tiamat and Bahamut draw power from <strong>souls</strong> and the spread of their domain, which is chaos and order, respectively.</p></blockquote><h4>What is Divine Power?</h4><p>Although we may be inclined to simply consider gods to be omnipotent and imbued with limitless divine power, that is rarely the case in fantasy settings. Even in real world religions, gods may appear omnipotent when compared to mere mortals, but not when compared to each other, where one god may be stronger than another or capable of wielding its divine power in ways that other gods can’t. Thus, defining divine power is important in both a general sense, as in what feats are all gods capable of, but also for each individual deity, as the God of Nature may have wildly different powers from the God of Peace, and so on.</p><p>Below are some of the most common forms divine power takes in fantasy settings:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Divine Magic.</strong> A god may be able to provide clerics, druids, paladins, and other worshipers with divine magic, often in the form of spells they can cast.</p><p><strong>Guidance.</strong> A god may be able to provide guidance to mortals, either by communicating to them through dreams, visions, or subtle signs, or through an envoy such as a sacred beast or a celestial being.</p><p><strong>Agents.</strong> A god may be able to send otherworldly agents to act in its stead, such as sending an angel to the Mortal World to aid heroes in a time of need.</p><p><strong>Miracles.</strong> A god may be able to intervene directly in the Mortal World by creating miracles, ranging from conjuring up a thunderstorm to bringing a deceased mortal back to life.</p><p><strong>Manifestation.</strong> A god may be able to manifest itself physically in the Mortal World, either by possessing a mortal creature, as an avatar that holds a fraction of its divine power, or in its full divine splendor.</p></div><p>Typically in campaign settings associated with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and similar tabletop roleplaying games, the gods’ power in the Mortal World is handled almost entirely through the divine magic they bestow upon their followers. These clerics, paladins, and other divine spellcasters can then use their divine magic to implore the gods to perform miracles (i.e., a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO]{resurrection}</em> spell), ask the gods for guidance (i.e., a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9]{divination}</em> spell), or summon helpful celestial agents (i.e., a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV]{gate}</em> spell). Only in rare cases do the gods provide guidance, send agents, or perform miracles without using a mortal as a catalyst – and they almost never manifest physically in the Mortal World.</p><h4>How is Divine Power limited?</h4><p>Another important question we have to answer is <em>how</em> the deities are limited in the way they can use their power to influence the Mortal World. These limitations are important because they help us define the gods’ relationships with their mortal followers. There are, in essence, three approaches:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Unlimited Interference.</strong> A god can wield its powers like any other creature, unfettered by any celestial restraints. It can manifest in the Mortal World as it wishes, to smite or raise up any creature of its choice. It may choose not to do so because it doesn’t care that much about the Mortal World or because it is vulnerable while doing so, but there is nothing that explicitly prevents it from interfering.</p><p><strong>Limited Interference.</strong> A god is limited, either by divine decree, or by supernatural restraints, in the way it can interact with the Mortal World. Maybe the gods have a firm agreement to never interfere directly, punishable by destruction or exile, or perhaps it is outright impossible for the god to interfere with the Mortal World in specific ways, even if it wanted to.</p><p><strong>No Interference.</strong> A god can’t interfere with the Mortal World at all. Gods and mortals are kept firmly separate, unless mortals are able to visit a god in its divine realm – either in life or death.</p></div><p>In a setting where the gods can’t easily interfere directly in the Mortal World, each god has to rely on its worshipers to enact its will. A god has to empower its followers with divine magic, so that they can stop the evil villain, cleanse the lands of the dark corruption, or accomplish whatever goal the god has – because the god can’t do so itself. This creates an interesting, transactional relationship between mortals and gods where the gods rely just as much on their followers as the other way around, which has the added benefit of giving us endless ways to hook the characters into new adventures.</p><div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Classic Pantheon can employ all the different types of <strong>divine power</strong>, but mostly use <strong>divine magic</strong> because their power to interfere in the Mortal World is <strong>limited</strong> by decree of the Archgod.</p></blockquote></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>The lesser deities in the Draconic Pantheon – those who are <strong>manifested</strong> in the Mortal World – can provide followers with <strong>divine magic</strong> and <strong>interfere directly</strong> in the Mortal World. They act as agents of Tiamat and Bahamut, who, besides providing <strong>guidance</strong>, are otherwise <strong>unable to interfere</strong> in the Mortal World.</p></blockquote><h3>Divine Motivation</h3><p>As with any other creatures or characters we include in our world, gods can have motivations or goals that give them personality and purpose, and make them compelling. That said, it is an oft-repeated truth that the divine “works in mysterious ways,” so these motivations may not be immediately apparent to the players or their characters. Below are some of the most common types of motivations we can ascribe to individual deities:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Power.</strong> Like many mortals, a god may see power as a goal unto itself. Whether it is so they can govern over their peers, to protect themselves from harm, or just because they enjoy having it, the lust to acquire more power may drive much of what a god does. Depending on where the god gains its powers, this could mean trying to grow its base of worshipers or spreading its Divine Domain in the Mortal World.</p><p><strong>Domain.</strong> As an embodiment of a specific Divine Domain, a god may be compelled to spread its Divine Domain, regardless of whether it gains power from doing so or not. Thus, the God of War is always working to foment war and spread strife, while the God of Knowledge is always trying to preserve and spread knowledge, simply because it’s what they do.</p><p><strong>Relationships.</strong> The gods may be motivated by their relationships with other deities. The God of Order’s primary goal may be to repair whatever havoc the God of Chaos wreaks, and the God of Light may be focused on finding a way to initiate a deeper partnership with the God of Life.</p><p><strong>Individual.</strong> The gods may have individual goals that are specific to them and that are not necessarily tied directly to their Divine Domain. The God of Darkness may seek to bring an end to existence itself, while the God of Magic seeks the Eternal Scroll that can bind the entire cosmos to its will. See the Divine Goals table for a list of example individual goals.</p></div><p>The gods’ motivations can vary from god to god, and each god can have several goals. Some gods may strive solely for power or to spread their domains, while other gods in the same pantheon have more individual goals.</p><div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Classic Pantheon have goals of all different types, with the spread of their <strong>domains</strong> being the most common goal all deities share.</p></blockquote></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p>Deities in the Draconic Pantheon are commonly focused on increasing their own <strong>power</strong> and that of Tiamat or Bahamut. Each deity also has their own <strong>individual goals</strong> that are often based on their <strong>relationships</strong> – alliances or rivalries – with other gods.</p></blockquote><table class=\"odds-align-center\"><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Divine Goals</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>[[/r d100]]</strong></td><td><strong>Goal</strong></td></tr><tr><td>01-02</td><td>To protect and guide their mortal followers</td></tr><tr><td>03-04</td><td>To gain power and control other gods</td></tr><tr><td>05-06</td><td>To punish those who do not worship or obey</td></tr><tr><td>07-08</td><td>To test the strength and faith of mortals</td></tr><tr><td>09-10</td><td>To avenge a past wrong or injustice</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>To ensure the survival of a specific civilization</td></tr><tr><td>13-14</td><td>To bring about the end of the world</td></tr><tr><td>15-16</td><td>To prove oneself superior to other gods</td></tr><tr><td>17-18</td><td>To explore the mysteries of the universe</td></tr><tr><td>19-20</td><td>To gain the love and devotion of mortals</td></tr><tr><td>21-22</td><td>To control the forces of nature</td></tr><tr><td>23-24</td><td>To destroy a mortal who wronged them</td></tr><tr><td>25-26</td><td>To gain control over the afterlife</td></tr><tr><td>27-28</td><td>To spread chaos and destruction</td></tr><tr><td>29-30</td><td>To gain access to forbidden knowledge</td></tr><tr><td>31-32</td><td>To seek redemption for past mistakes</td></tr><tr><td>33-34</td><td>To protect a sacred place or object</td></tr><tr><td>35-36</td><td>To gain worshipers and followers</td></tr><tr><td>37-38</td><td>To maintain the status quo</td></tr><tr><td>39-40</td><td>To seek a powerful relic or artifact</td></tr><tr><td>41-42</td><td>To protect the natural world</td></tr><tr><td>43-44</td><td>To gain control over the elements</td></tr><tr><td>45-46</td><td>To punish those who disrespect the gods</td></tr><tr><td>47-48</td><td>To find a powerful enemy to defeat</td></tr><tr><td>49-50</td><td>To gain control over the dead</td></tr><tr><td>51-52</td><td>To spread a particular moral code</td></tr><tr><td>53-54</td><td>To gain control over the stars and planets</td></tr><tr><td>55-56</td><td>To gain control over a new Divine Domain</td></tr><tr><td>57-58</td><td>To protect an institution or organization</td></tr><tr><td>59-60</td><td>To gain control over the future</td></tr><tr><td>61-62</td><td>To find the long-lost Temple of Creation</td></tr><tr><td>63-64</td><td>To discover the secrets of a lost civilization</td></tr><tr><td>65-66</td><td>To gain control over a powerful artifact</td></tr><tr><td>67-68</td><td>To ascend to a higher plane of existence</td></tr><tr><td>69-70</td><td>To resurrect a long-dead divine entity</td></tr><tr><td>71-72</td><td>To find a way to break an ancient curse</td></tr><tr><td>73-74</td><td>To discover the true purpose of the universe</td></tr><tr><td>75-76</td><td>To find a way to reverse the process of death</td></tr><tr><td>77-78</td><td>To gain control over the power of dreams</td></tr><tr><td>79-80</td><td>To find a way to unite the gods</td></tr><tr><td>81-82</td><td>To erase the memory of some past event</td></tr><tr><td>83-84</td><td>To restore balance to the natural world</td></tr><tr><td>85-86</td><td>To find a way to unite the races of the world</td></tr><tr><td>87-88</td><td>To find a way to restore a lost love</td></tr><tr><td>89-90</td><td>To prevent a great disaster or cataclysm</td></tr><tr><td>91-92</td><td>To stop a powerful evil</td></tr><tr><td>93-94</td><td>To spread its Divine Domain(s)</td></tr><tr><td>95-96</td><td>To manifest in the Mortal World</td></tr><tr><td>97-98</td><td>To find a worthy mortal to take its place</td></tr><tr><td>99-00</td><td>To create a new species in its own image</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

They are typically passive benefits the character is granted by a deity and that last for a specified amount of time.</p><h3>Receiving Divine Boons</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>There exist many accounts of heroes and martyrs using Divine Boons to perform epic deeds. Even so, Kass insists they should be called “divine bribes” instead, but that seems unfair. Hmm... I wonder if the Lorekeeper would grant me a Divine Boon if I make his entry extra flattering.</p><p>– the Scribe</p></blockquote><p>A Divine Boon is often a reward to pious followers, who have demonstrated their devotion through a religious ritual or a heroic act. In some cases, a divine entity may provide a mortal with a Divine Boon while they undertake a quest of particular importance. As a rule of thumb, a Divine Boon should be viewed as a minor, time-limited benefit that can be given to a character as a reward for roleplaying their devotion.</p><h3>Boon Duration</h3><p>Usually a Divine Boon lasts anywhere from a single day to forever, or expires when a certain condition is met. A deity or other entity may grant a character a Divine Boon that lasts for seven days, until the next full moon, or until they have slain the evil necromancer. A Divine Boon may also last for as long as the recipient fulfills certain requirements – such as striving to do good – or as long as they don’t transgress against the entity that gave them the boon.</p><h3>Boons</h3><p>Below are examples of ten Divine Boons. Item versions of the boons can be found in the Items folder.</p><h4>Awareness</h4><p>You know if you hear a lie. Moreover, you can’t be surprised while you are conscious and you gain a bonus to initiative rolls equal to your proficiency bonus.</p><h4>Bravery</h4><p>You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Frightened condition on yourself, and being Frightened can’t prevent you from moving or reduce your speed.</p><h4>Communion</h4><p>You can communicate with a divine entity known to you as if you’d cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{commune}</em> spell. Once used, this feature can’t be used again until you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Fortune</h4><p>When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once used, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Freedom</h4><p>Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be Paralyzed or Restrained.</p><h4>Guidance</h4><p>When you roll an ability check, you can roll a [[/r d8]] and add the number rolled to the result. You can do so after making the ability check but before the outcome is determined. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h4>Protection</h4><p>You can spend 1 hour in meditation to gain one of the following benefits until you use this feature again:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Durable.</strong> Any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.</p><p><strong>Resistant.</strong> You gain resistance to one type of damage of your choice.</p><p><strong>Warded.</strong> You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws.</p></div><h4>Undying</h4><p>When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can choose to become undying. While in this state, you remain conscious but must still make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. If you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until the end of your next turn, and you die only if you still have 0 hit points. If you regain hit points, you are no longer undying. Once used, this feature can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><h4>Vitality</h4><p>You have resistance to Poison damage and advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Poisoned condition. Moreover, whenever you would regain hit points, you regain 1 additional hit point.</p><h4>Weaving</h4><p>When you cast a spell with a level lower than or equal to your proficiency bonus, you can have it take effect as if you had cast it using a spell slot one level higher than the one you used to cast it. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p></div>"

Other character classes have only few options for becoming embroiled with divinity – and little mechanical incentive to do so. This chapter seeks to set that right by providing DMs and players with an assortment of new divinely inspired character subclasses and a whole category of new divine feats, all compatible with the fifth edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, that players can select from when they level up their characters.</p><h2>Divine Subclasses</h2><p>There is nothing that prevents a player from imbuing their character with divine flavor, such as explaining how an ability or a spell might originate from a divine source or be the result of a pact with a god or other celestial entity. Even so, there are precious few ways for characters to actually make the mechanics of their character feel divine or holy in nature.</p><p>On the @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.1OydbJbb6ZMpQhUC]{following pages}, you’ll find eight subclasses that do exactly that – provide new and exciting divine options for player characters:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Bard: College of Chanting.</strong> This bardic subclass relies on chants and hymns to provide powerful buffs to their allies – or penalize and even harm their foes.</p><p><strong>Cleric: Chaos Domain.</strong> This cleric subclass embraces the Divine Domain of chaos to create wild and random magical effects.</p><p><strong>Fighter: Exalted Knight.</strong> This fighter subclass has been blessed with a guardian spirit and follows divine creeds that grant them useful bonuses.</p><p><strong>Monk: Way of Peace.</strong> This monk subclass is sworn to peace and vanquishes its foes through admonition and pacification rather than brute force.</p><p><strong>Paladin: Oath of the Templar.</strong> This paladin subclass is sworn to protect others from the dangers of magic and is a lethal foe to any spellcaster.</p><p><strong>Ranger: Spirit Guide.</strong> This ranger subclass has a deep connection to the spiritual world and can partially, or even wholly, manifest as a spirit in the Mortal World.</p><p><strong>Rogue: Anointed Blade.</strong> This rogue subclass can bless its weapons and trinkets with holy power, and wields divine magic and stealth in equal measure.</p><p><strong>Warlock: The Soulbound.</strong> This warlock subclass possesses a soulstone it can use to harvest souls and channel spiritual power.</p></div><h2>Divine Feats</h2><p>On the @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.3x0Q3Y5bjKMuagfy]{following pages} are feats that allow any character to gain divine blessings, either from a specific deity or just in general, presented in alphabetical order.</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><h3>Azariphiel</h3><p>Azariphiels are a breed of angels inextricably linked to death. They typically appear as medium-sized angels shrouded in black or crimson cloaks, casting ominous shadows, and capable of emitting maddening shrieks.</p><h5>Harbingers of Doom</h5><p>Often referred to as angels of death or harbingers of doom, Azariphiels wield the dreadful power to manipulate mortal souls. Consequently, most Azariphiels pledge their allegiance to deities of death and darkness, acting as enforcers or emissaries.</p><h3>Caipora</h3><p>The caipora is a small Fey native to dense forests and jungles, and known for its mischievous nature and uncanny ability to blend into its surroundings. Standing only 2 to 3 feet tall, the caipora resembles a diminutive humanoid with greenish-brown skin covered in leaf-like patterns, aiding its incredible camouflage. It has large, curious eyes and a playful grin, which hints at its fondness for pranks and trickery.</p><h5>Jungle Ambusher</h5><p>Armed with a blowgun and poison darts, the caipora is a fierce protector of its woodland home, targeting those who would despoil or exploit the natural world. The creature’s magical laughter is infectious, causing all who hear it to erupt into uncontrollable giggles, leaving them vulnerable to its attacks.</p><p>In the realm of the Fey, the caipora is a skilled hunter and gatherer, using its agility and stealth to outwit both prey and predators. The caipora also carries a vine spear, that sprouts vines around whatever creature it hits. Despite its mischievous streak, a caipora can be a valuable ally to those who respect the natural order and seek to preserve nature’s balance.</p><h3>Caladrius</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>I normally don’t have many nice things to say about celestial creatures, but the caladrius is an exception to that rule. Magnificently beautiful, pure-hearted to a fault, and really handy to have nearby when you’re down on your luck.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>Caladrii are benevolent and wise Celestial birds with an innate ability to heal and cure ailments. Legend has it that they can form bonds with ambitious yet kind\u0002hearted humanoids, such as devoted paladins, powerful priests, or benevolent rulers. When they do, they dedicate themselves to guiding their charge on a path of light throughout its lifespan. While caladrii mostly roam in the Upper Planes, they are sometimes sent to the Mortal World to seek out mortal charges, and are wont to show up in a moment of crisis.</p><h3>Celestial Dragon</h3><p>Celestial dragons are the embodiment of divine grace and celestial power. Feathered wings adorn their backs, and their scales are a pristine, pure white with a delicate touch of glimmering iridescence. As the dragon grows older, its iridescence intensifies, ultimately creating a display of colors that seem to dance across the dragon’s body like a living aurora.</p><h5>Peaceful Guardians</h5><p>Celestial dragons are innately good creatures. Wise and compassionate, celestial dragons prefer diplomacy over violence and work to maintain balance and promote harmony in the world. Celestial dragons are also known to provide aid and guidance to heroes on quests to vanquish great evils, imparting wisdom and even serving as powerful allies in times of need.</p><h5>Relic Hoarders</h5><p>Celestial dragons value relics and artifacts with divine origins or connections to the Upper Planes above all other treasure. They are particularly drawn to items that carry the power to heal, protect, and inspire hope. They also collect tomes and scrolls of divine magic, ancient prophecies, and chronicles of heroic deeds, as they believe in the importance of preserving the stories and lessons of the past.</p><h5>A Celestial Dragon’s Lair</h5><p>When they live outside celestial planes, the lairs of celestial dragons are often found in places where the veil between the Mortal World and the Upper Planes is thin, such as ancient temples, hidden mountain sanctuaries, or sacred groves. These locations emanate a serene, almost holy atmosphere.</p><h5>Lair Actions</h5><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Divine Reprisal.</strong> Each creature that has dealt damage to the dragon since the start of the creature’s last turn must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or, until initiative count 20 on the next round, the creature can’t take reactions and must choose whether it gets an action, a bonus action, or a move on its turn; it gets only one of the three.</p><p><strong>Enfeeblement.</strong> Each creature of the dragon’s choice within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or, until initiative count 20 on the next round, the creature’s speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws using Strength or Dexterity.</p><p><strong>Rejuvenation.</strong> The dragon is affected as by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}</em> spell.</p></div><h3>Death Wraith</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>When delving into an archpriest’s crypt, it’s my experience that there’s a 50/50 chance you’ll find a death wraith down there. They’re not too bad, really – just make sure you bring a bunch of healing potions and a “sunny” disposition!</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>A death wraith is the terrifying result of a soul being trapped on the plane where its physical body perished. Capable of commanding shadows and siphoning the life out of living creatures, these powerful Undead retain few, if any, memories of their mortal life – appearing and acting as resentful, spectral slivers of their former selves.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Cursed Creatures</h5><p>Unlike other wraiths who are typically spirits of creatures that were evil in life, the fate of becoming a death wraith can befall even goodly creatures as their souls are trapped and twisted through dark magic. In most cases, slaying the death wraith allows the creature’s soul to pass on to the afterlife and find peace.</p><h3>Deities</h3><p>Possibly the most powerful beings in all existence, deities are divine power made manifest. They may exist as intangible spirits, as grotesque monstrosities composed of a multitude of wings and eyes, or as towering humanoid creatures – and anything in between. The gods’ powers can also vary wildly, from a deity’s relatively weak avatar – the physical form that represents it in the Mortal World – to a true, greater god that can bend the very laws of reality.</p><p>The stat blocks on the following pages are created using the rules for @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.Py9SDRdC3odAguMc]{Designing Divinity}. Beneath the description of each deity, you will find a list of the Divine Features that has been added to the deity’s base stat block.</p><h4>God of Nature, Lesser</h4><p>This divine avatar belongs to a god of nature, such as the Earthmother or the Forestfather, giving physical form to the deity in the Mortal World. Significantly less powerful than a true god, the avatar still possesses powerful divine powers, such as the ability to change its shape, entangle enemies with is strikes, and dash across the battlefield at incredible speed.</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Divine Benefits.</strong> Ability Increase: +4 Wisdom; Divine Health; Condition Immunities: Charmed and Frightened; Save Proficiency: Constitution</p><p><strong>Divine Traits.</strong> Aura of Tranquility; Living Armor; Magic Resistance</p><p><strong>Divine Actions.</strong> Divine Dash; Entangling Strike; Injunction.</p></div><h4>God of Darkness, Standard</h4><p>This deity statblock belongs to a lesser god of darkness, or a true god that has been weakened, such as if it is encountered outside of its celestial realm. It possesses an affinity for darkness, divine regeneration, and a repertoire of powerful divine spells.</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Divine Benefits.</strong> Ability Increases: +8 Strength and +4 Dexterity; Divine Health; Condition Immunities: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, and Frightened; Damage Immunity: Necrotic; Save Proficiency: Charisma; Speed; Truesight</p><p><strong>Divine Traits.</strong> Damage Absorption: Necrotic; Dark Master; Magic Resistance; Regeneration</p><p><strong>Divine Actions.</strong> Incite Shadows, Mind Blast, Quick Spellcasting, Teleport</p></div><h4>God of Order, Greater</h4><p>A true deity, this stat block could represent a deity such as the Lawbringer or the Lorekeeper. Incredibly powerful, this deity can read and control the minds of other creatures, bleeds living oozes of radiance, and controls time itself.</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Divine Benefits.</strong> Ability Increases: +6 Strength, +4 Constitution, Wisdom +6; Divine Health; Condition Immunities: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, and Stunned; Save Proficiency: Charisma; Truesight</p><p><strong>Divine Traits.</strong> Aura of Divinity; Divine Focus; Magic Immunity; Magic Resistance; Regeneration</p><p><strong>Divine Actions.</strong> Antimagic; Bash; God’s Blood; Injunction; Memory Flux</p></div><h3>Divine Deceiver</h3><p>A divine deceiver is a cunning Celestial that sustains itself on holy energy and the prayers of mortals. A deceiver might, for example, kill a local cleric and adopt their identity so it can slowly corrupt the congregation, until they are no longer praying to their god but to the deceiver itself.</p><h5>Charged by Divinity</h5><p>While the deceiver typically has no interest in combat – preferring subterfuge that allows it to trick mortals into surrendering their prayers and spiritual essence willingly – it is still a fearsome combatant. It steals its foes essences and prayers and uses the divine energy to fuel its attacks against them.</p><h3>Elementals</h3><p>When one thinks of elements, it is typically concepts such as air, earth, fire, and water that come to mind. Rarely does one consider light – or the lack of it – as an element, though it is, in truth, perhaps one of the most powerful elements in the Multiverse. When light takes physical form, either as pure radiance or overwhelming darkness, it does so as frightful creatures every bit as potent and destructive as Elementals of air, earth, fire, and water.</p><h4>Radiance Elemental</h4><p>A faintly humanoid shape is visible through a dawn-like sphere of radiance that casts light in a wide radius around it. A radiance elemental is illumination made manifest and sheds light wherever it goes. Only magical darkness – its antithesis – can dampen its powers and cause it visible discomfort.</p><h4>Darkness Elemental</h4><p>A slender, deep purple humanoid shape lurks within the core of pitch blackness that oozes from this elemental’s form. So dark that it suppresses light in a wide area around it, a darkness elemental is like a void that engulfs and consumes everything it touches, leaving behind nothing but cold, dead husks.</p><p>Despite its fearsome appearance and chilling presence, a darkness elemental is not without its weaknesses. Magical light can suppress and truly weaken the elemental, causing its form to waver and dissipate. When confronted with such light, the elemental’s darkness recedes, and its once-fluid movements become erratic and desperate, as if fighting against the very essence of its antithesis.</p><h3>Fateweaver</h3><p>Fateweavers are Celestials who serve as enigmatic guardians of destiny, acting as both keepers and enforcers of the God of Fate’s intent. They often appear as ordinary – though strikingly beautiful – humanoids with golden symbols on their skin.</p><h5>Arbiters of Destiny</h5><p>Fateweavers have an innate understanding of the intricate web of fate that connects all living beings. They perceive the subtlest shifts in the fabric of destiny and can foresee the far-reaching consequences of even the smallest actions. Their ability to manipulate these threads allows them to alter the course of events, either by subtly nudging the strands of fate or by making more drastic changes when necessary.</p><p>Despite their power to shape destiny, fateweavers are acutely aware of the delicate balance that governs the universe. They understand that the flow of fate, for the most part, should be allowed to follow the path laid out by fate. Consequently, fateweavers rarely intervene directly in the lives of mortals – but when they do choose to act, their influence can be life-changing, leaving an indelible mark on the lives of those touched by their power.</p><h5>Revered Oracles</h5><p>Despite rarely interfering directly in the affairs of mortals, fateweavers have been known to reside on the Mortal World, where they often act as oracles, offering cryptic prophecies to those who seek their wisdom.</p><h3>Forsaken Deva</h3><div class=\"hgdd-text\"><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>A deva’s identity can be so wrapped up in the god they follow, that their mind shatters when they lose connection to that deity. Pathetic, when you think about it. Why not just enjoy your goddamn freedom and pick up a new hobby?</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>When a deity dies, all celestial creatures that are aligned with that deity’s aspect or created in its image, feel its passing vividly. Some creatures bear this trauma better than others; the forsaken deva is an example of a devotee that is driven to madness and despair by the unexpected demise or disappearance of its deity.</p></div><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Broken Being</h5><p>While still a holy creature, the forsaken deva is filled with grief, pain, and a thirst for vengeance that makes it as fierce and savage as any demon. It even resembles one more, as its celestial beauty fades away to reveal a blood-soaked, grotesque monstrosity beneath.</p><h3>Godblood Ooze</h3><div class=\"hgdd-text\"><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>While it’s disconcerting to be attacked by a glowing glob of god’s gore – and that’s something I’ve learned through personal experience – it’s also confirmation that gods can indeed bleed, and thus, also die. So, disconcerting on multiple levels.</p><p>– the Scribe</p></blockquote><p>To many scholars’ surprise, even gods can bleed. Sometimes, when a deity’s physically manifested form is cut or slashed, radiant blood will pour from the wound, often in unimaginable quantities. This divine liquid is not just the deity’s lifeblood, however; it is also a defense mechanism. For when the god’s spilled blood senses that the god is in danger, it coalesces into a godblood ooze – a divine, formless blob of a creature that is dedicated wholly to the protection of the god.</p></div><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Mindless Radiance</h5><p>In combat, the godblood ooze seeks to latch onto and envelop foes, keeping them restrained and incapable of hurting the deity it protects. It can also emit a flash of bright, radiant light to blind and burn assailants. Finally, the godblood ooze, which is in possession of a tiny sliver of its god’s Divine Spark, can use the spells or abilities of a creature it has engulfed.</p><h3>Gravity Golem</h3><p>Gravity golems are fierce arcane constructs crafted from various alloys etched with magical runes. Defying common sense, a gravity golem’s disjointed body parts are held together through gravitational energy.</p><h3>A Forceful Guardian</h3><p>A gravity golem is a formidable sentinel, obeying its master’s commands with unyielding and single-minded determination, and using gravitational magic and pure energy to destroy whoever tries to stand against it.</p><h3>Guardian Spirit</h3><p>A guardian spirit is a celestial being of immense benevolence, summoned from the ethereal realm to serve as a steadfast protector and compassionate companion to mortals in need. It manifests as a floating orb of radiant light, pulsating with divine energy.</p><h5>Divine Bond</h5><p>Through an intricate process of spiritual bonding, the guardian spirit often forms a connection with a chosen mortal. When bonded to a creature in this way, the guardian spirit uses that creature’s Proficiency Bonus (PB) in place of its own whenever one of its traits or actions reference a proficiency bonus.</p><p>The guardian spirit also enhances the combat abilities of its mortal partner, imbuing them with divine strength and heightened reflexes. The guardian spirit can also unleash holy bolts of light, or channel its celestial energy into its partner, fueling their strikes. Furthermore, the spirit possesses potent healing powers, and can mend wounds and restore vitality to its mortal companion.</p><h3>Marithiel</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>Ah, yes, the marithiel. Probably the most well-armed – pun fully intended – divine servant I’ve ever had the misfortune of meeting. A lot of blades, barely any sense of humor, and very quick. Damnably quick.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>Marithiels are fierce, human-like Celestials with six arms and uncanny reflexes. Fearsome foes wielding a sword in each hand, marithiels are often deployed on the Mortal World to serve as guardians of sacred grounds or hunters enacting their deity’s will.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Immortal Loyalty</h5><p>While many marithiels pledge their loyalty to benevolent deities, focusing on protecting the innocent and vanquishing forces of evil, a marithiel’s allegiance ultimately lies with the deity to whom it has sworn fealty. Regardless of whether their deity’s intentions are perceived as good or evil by mortal standards, marithiels doggedly pursue their deity’s wishes with unwavering dedication.</p><h5>Matriarchal Societies</h5><p>Marithiels primarily reside in the Upper Planes, where they form matriarchal societies that govern their communities. Each group, or enclave, of marithiels may have its own distinct customs and traditions, but they all share a common purpose: to serve their deity with unyielding devotion.</p><h5>Eternal Rivalry</h5><p>Despite any internal differences that may exist among marithiels, they are universally bound by their enmity towards Demons. This ancient rivalry is fueled by the polar opposition of their natures, with marithiels representing divine order and Demons embodying chaos. This enmity is an integral part of their identity, and the marithiels’ unwavering commitment to vanquishing their sworn enemies is legendary.</p><h3>Melodiel</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>Melodiels are beautiful creatures, but also, by all accounts, quite deadly. Even so, it would be a wondrous experience to hear one play. Not for too long, mind you, just a quick tune or two.</p><p>– the Scribe</p></blockquote><p>Melodiels are passionate Celestials who are celebrated as the finest musicians of the heavenly planes. While their angelic beauty is matched only by their transcendent music, mortals who hear a melodiel’s performance may find it a short-lived pleasure as its tune can cause them to age rapidly.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Eternal Companions</h5><p>Unlike most celestials, melodiels are driven by fierce emotions and seek life-long bonds with their chosen partners. These celestial musicians are even known to choose Humanoids as partners. In a testament to their devotion, a melodiel often chooses to end their own existence upon the passing of a mortal partner.</p><h3>Nephilim</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>I can’t speak much to the nephilim, as I’ve never seen one in the flesh. I felt one, once – or so I think, though I didn’t stick around to confirm it. Once the ground started shaking so hard it felt like my horns would fall off, I figured it was time for me to excuse myself and slip away.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>The ground quakes with the force of the nephilim’s steps as it lifts its colossal glaive to enact divine retribution in honor of its patron deity. Heralds of cataclysmic change, the nephilim are gargantuan celestial creatures so powerful that they can singlehandedly lay waste to cities or entire nations.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Primordial Loyalty</h5><p>While few people can claim to know the true origin of the nephilim, there are those who believe these gigantic Celestials are the offspring of gods and primordial creatures that came before. Whatever the case, the few nephilim that exist swear fealty to a specific god – and no nephilim chooses the same god.</p><h5>Heralds of Holy War</h5><p>In the annals of history, the nephilim have long been associated with the divine struggle between deities, acting as their champions in wars against each other. Ancient scriptures and paintings even tell the tale of nephilim fighting on opposite sides in holy wars in the Mortal World, their titanic clashes leaving mountains shattered and landscapes forever altered.</p><h4>Nephilim Scions</h4><p>Perhaps the most fascinating and disturbing aspect of the nephilim is their ability to produce progeny, either by bonding with other Celestials or even with Fiends or mortals. Such unions give rise to humanoid-like beings known as nephilim scions.</p><p>Fearsome combatants, nephilim scions are celestial creatures that retain some of the true nephilim’s traits and typically have an almost human-like appearance. Like their creators, nephilim scions tend to swear allegiance to a single, powerful being, such as a deity or the nephilim that created them. Due to their human-like appearance, they are often deployed on the Mortal World to carry out the will of their patron, whether that includes serving as a protector of mortals or a sacred site, or hunting down those who pose a threat to their patron’s plans.</p><h3>Radiant Guardian</h3><p>Radiant guardians are Constructs said to be imbued with divine magic. They often serve as protectors of sacred locations, maintaining the sanctity of ancient temples and crypts by warding off intruders.</p><h5>Luminous Constructs</h5><p>Radiant guardians have the innate ability to channel radiant light, bestowing them with both the power to scorch foes and cleanse their own system of magical ailments. Their connection to light comes at a cost, however, as exposure to magical darkness may render a radiant guardian temporarily unconscious.</p><h3>Razorvine</h3><p>Residing in dark forests, razorvines are large predatory Plants. Capable of appearing as ordinary, if somewhat dense and tangled, plants while motionless, razorvines lull prey into a false sense of security before cutting, grappling, and choking their victims with vines.</p><h3>Sacred Sporespawn</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>So a druid dies and instead of becoming compost, some god of nature awakens them as a mindless plant-being overgrowing with vines and spores. Does that sound “natural” to you?</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>A sacred sporespawn is a weird amalgamation of a Celestial, a Humanoid, and a Plant. Their origin is a mystery, but many believe that powerful druids who have served their god well may become a sacred sporespawn after death, enabling them to serve as a guardian of nature in perpetuity.</p><p>Sacred sporespawn are almost always found in the wilds, where they lie dormant until intruders awaken them. In combat, the sporespawn uses a combination of poisonous attacks and divine blessings to diminish and debilitate its foes.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Lair Actions</h5><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sporespawn can take one of the following lair actions; the sporespawn can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Entangling Roots.</strong> Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the sporespawn can see within 60 feet. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be Restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the sporespawn dies or uses this action again.</p><p><strong>Spawn Fungi.</strong> The sporespawn conjures forth 1d4 + 2 <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.7EmUVycEASn7SFL0]{violet fungi}</strong> in unoccupied spaces of its choice within 30 feet. The fungi act on the sporespawn’s initiative in combat and follows its unspoken commands (no action required). The fungi remain until reduced to 0 hit points or the sporespawn uses this action again.</p></div><h3>Scrollwrapped Mummy</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>A fascinating thing, wrapping a corpse in spell scrolls. According to legend, the practice originated with a tribe of tieflings who believed it would protect their souls from their archdevil father. Did a lot more than that, as we now know.</p><p>– the Scribe</p></blockquote><p>In some cultures and religions, it is not uncommon to mummify important or renowned figures when they die. When the process of mummification is performed by powerful high priests, they may even inscribe magical protections on the mummy’s wrappings. Not only does this protect the mummy from harm, it also lends it magical power to protect its tomb from robbers.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Wrapped in Magic</h5><p>A scrollwrapped mummy can instinctively cast the spells inscribed on its wrappings if it needs to. However, because the scrolls also lend the mummy magical protection, each casting is a trade-off that must be considered carefully. Each spell scroll expended by the mummy is magically restored after the next dawn. If the mummy dies, each unused <em>spell scroll</em> falls to the ground in its space.</p><h3>Senilith</h3><p>Seniliths are cruel devils known for their cunning manipulation of mortals, luring them into ill-fated contracts that allow the senilith to steal their life force and turn them into puppet-like thralls. These sinister beings revel in the perverse joy of collecting souls, seeing each new acquisition as a testament to their diabolical cunning and a source of personal amusement.</p><h5>Morbid Obsession</h5><p>Seniliths appear as thin, alien creatures with devilish grins that betray their malevolent intentions. While a senilith may take on a more accommodating appearance when seeking out mortals in the Mortal World to claim their souls, a senilith takes great pride in showing off its collection. Thus, a senilith encountered in its own devilish domain may be found seated upon a grotesque throne constructed from the desiccated remains of their ensnared victims, a chilling monument to their morbid obsession with collecting souls.</p><h3>Seraph</h3><p>Seraphs are otherworldly Celestials that defy conventional understanding. Their divine presence is so strange and peculiar it is overwhelming for most who behold its true form – a series of strange eyes and several sets of wings on a body shaped in ways that seems to challenge the very laws of reality.</p><h5>A Mortal Presence</h5><p>While seraphs usually dwell in the heavenly planes, they are able to adopt humanoid forms when they so choose to, and legends of seraphs who, for reasons known only themselves, have abandoned their patron deities to walk among mortals, are not unheard of.</p><h3>Seraphic Seer</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>Just because you slap some feathers on it and put torches at the end of its eye-stalks, doesn’t make it not an abominable, grotesque horror. Or, well, that’s just my opinion – beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say, so you’re free to disagree!</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>The seraphic seer is a celestial being originating from the luminous realms of the cosmos, taking the form of a feathered, floating creature with a central, all-seeing eye. Possessing numerous tentacles that surround its body, this enigmatic entity is often tasked with guarding sacred artifacts and places of divine significance, ensuring that only the worthy approach.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Being of Light</h5><p>The seraphic seer’s eyestalks are capable of emitting potent radiant rays, which can awe, curse, and debilitate foes that dare trespass on its hallowed territory. However, the seraphic seer harbors a unique vulnerability: exposure to magical light renders it docile, temporarily binding its loyalty to the creature that created the illuminating magic.</p><p>Despite its imposing appearance and fearsome abilities, the Seraphic Seer is a devoted guardian, adhering strictly to its divine mission. It serves as an eternal sentinel, tirelessly watching over the celestial treasures it has been entrusted with.</p><h3>Sky Ferret</h3><p>Sky ferrets are ferret-like Celestials with tiny winged feet that allow them to soar through the air. Endowed with a keen sense of empathy, sky ferrets are drawn to creatures struggling with adversity, and provide them with companionship, guidance, and a touch of celestial luck. Although most sky ferrets reside on the heavenly planes, they can also be found at some sacred sites and in mountainous regions on the Mortal World, where the veil between the worlds is said to be thin.</p><h5>Guardians of Fortune</h5><p>While a sky ferret can bestow divine fortune on other creatures, those who would harm a sky ferret may invoke a potent curse, bringing calamity upon themselves as retribution for their cruelty.</p><h3>Shadow Blade</h3><p>A shadow blade is an animated weapon imbued with the essence of darkness itself. Often appearing as a sleek, ethereal blade composed of wispy shadows, a shadow blade possess no will of its own and follows only the orders imprinted upon it by its creator. While the secrets of forging a shadow blade is said to originate from the dark depths of Shadow Realm, these living weapons are also deployed as guardians of ancient tombs and other places of importance.</p><h5>Essence Leeches</h5><p>A shadow blade doesn’t cut the flesh of its victims, but targets the mind and essence of their being. Equally terrifying, shadow blades possess the ability to drain the strength and vitality of those unlucky enough to find themselves near its dark presence.</p><h3>Shilmaiphiel</h3><p>Shilmaiphiels are celestial guardians tasked with protecting sacred rivers, blessed streams, and even parts of the ocean. Shilmaiphiels appear as large, humanoid-like creatures with massive feathered wings, scaly armor, and snake-like hair cascading from their heads, giving them an aura of untamed power. Rather than engaging in combat with malicious intent, shilmaiphiels typically challenge those who venture near the holy waters they protect with tests of strength, wit, and courage, as well as riddles that probe the minds and hearts of those seeking passage.</p><h3>Soothsayer</h3><p>Soothsayers are eccentric individuals driven by a paranoid and unshakable belief in the imminent end of days. While many find their doomsday prophecies overwhelming and unwelcome, a soothsayer is undoubtedly a great ally in times of crisis.</p><h3>Soulsplinter Sprite</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>When priests attempted to bring the paladin king Horatius back to life, his soul was split into pieces instead. Seemed the old geezer had held onto a lot of greed and pride despite his claims to virtue. Can’t say I was too surprised, personally. Gave me some measure of satisfaction hunting down Horatius’ sundered soul – and even more when his followers decided not to attempt another resurrection.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>When a powerful soul is freed from its mortal vessel through violence, it sometimes shatters into smaller pieces. These fragments, which represent the deceased’s most prominent personality traits, can take physical form as ethereal soulsplinter sprites.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Guardians of the Soul</h5><p>In most cases, soulsplinter sprites remain close to the body that used to hold them – guarding it from harm and attacking anyone who tries to heal or resurrect it. In some cases, the sprites are formed as a creature is resurrected and must be caught or vanquished before the creature can become fully whole again.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Distinct Personalities</h5><p>Most often, a soul will split into several different sprites, each of which represents the deceased creature’s most prominent traits. The sprites all have the deceased creature’s likeness, but their colors and facial expression mimic the personality trait they embody. Soulsplinter sprites usually assume one of the following traits:</p><ul><li><p>Compassion or selflessness (Blue)</p></li><li><p>Greed or selfishness (Green)</p></li><li><p>Humility or patience (Yellow)</p></li><li><p>Pride or arrogance (Orange)</p></li><li><p>Temperance or abstinence (White)</p></li><li><p>Wrath or malice (Red)</p></li></ul><p>The soulsplinter sprite’s abilities are in part determined by which personality trait it embodies – not only can it inspire that same trait in other creatures, it also has distinct attacks or defenses based on that trait.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Soulsplinter Sprites’ Power</p><p>A sprite’s strength is determined by the power of the creature which soul it spawned from. The sprite uses the creature’s proficiency bonus (PB) to determine its own proficiency bonus, as well as its AC, HP, CR, and the damage dealt by its attacks and abilities.</p></blockquote><h3>Spirit Ward</h3><p>A spirit ward resembles a floating ball of almost-tangible light with long, wispy tentacles. Often Celestial protectors, spirit wards act with a single-minded purpose to protect the ideals of the deity to whom they have sworn their allegiance. A spirit ward sworn to the God of Nature may protect a forest or the wildlife in an area, while a spirit ward dedicated to the God of Death might protect a tomb or graveyard.</p><h5>Warped Wardens</h5><p>In rare cases, the presence of powerful magical energy can twist the essence of a spirit ward, turning it into a spirit ward weaver. These Celestial abnormalities feed off magical energy and are usually more concerned with sustaining their life essence than with upholding their original sacred duty.</p><h3>Spore Screecher</h3><p>Spore screechers are vile Plant monstrosities, a fusion of predatory instinct and fungal growth. Covered in fungal caps, these abominations are relentless hunters with an unnerving ability to climb walls, albeit at a slow pace, stalking their prey before engulfing them in a suffocating embrace. The most terrifying aspect of these creatures is their screech, a sound so painful and staggering that it can immobilize victims.</p><h5>Fungal Cap Weakness</h5><p>Three large fungal caps – a blue, a green, and an orange – grow prominently upon the spore screecher’s body, concealing a critical weakness. Inflicting damage upon any of these caps causes a cloud of spores to erupt and the spore screecher to suffer intense pain. A creature facing a spore screecher can identify this vulnerability with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check.</p><h3>Tinnare Sanctus</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>I wrote my first book, The Pious Art of Parchment Folding – not exactly a best-seller, surprisingly – with the aid of a tinnare sanctus. She hadn’t had hands for nearly a century, but even so, I’ve never seen anyone fold parchment and roll scrolls with such deftness. A true marvel to behold!</p><p>– the Scribe</p></blockquote><p>A tinnare sanctus most resembles a gilded church bell engraved with a stoic, humanoid face. Some accounts claim that a sanctus’ face belongs to a deceased cleric or priest who was posthumously transformed into the tinnare sanctus. Whether that is true or not, tinnare sancti are typically found in dilapidated churches, ancient temples, or derelict graveyards, which they protect from intruders with great fervor. They have, however, been known to offer shelter and succor to travelers with whom they share religious ideals – which can vary greatly from one tinnare sanctus to another.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Through the Ringer</h5><p>In combat, the tinnare sanctus prefers to keep its distance. It can use its Tintinnabulation action to push creatures away and Crescendo to keep them back while it assaults them with Psychic Toil. When an enemy does manage to get close, the tinnare uses Slam attacks and its Ring the Bell reaction to punish melee attackers.</p><h3>Valkyrie</h3><p>Valkyries are proud celestial warriors embodying the pinnacle of martial prowess, divine grace, and valor. Often appearing as striking female humanoids with winged helmets, their beauty is matched only by their skill in battle. Valkyries are renowned for their mastery of mounted combat, their presence a beacon of hope on the battlefield as they ride atop horses or pegasi, fearlessly charging their fiendish adversaries.</p><h5>Soul Shepherds</h5><p>Many valkyries serve as spiritual guides to the souls of fallen warriors, ensuring their safe passage to the hallowed halls of their deity’s eternal domain. In times of great strife, these celestial emissaries can be glimpsed on the battlefields in the Mortal World, their ethereal forms a comforting presence as they shepherd the spirits of the fallen to the afterlife.</p><p></p></div>"

On the following pages are a selection of those who have crossed that line.</p><h3>Blood Cultists</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>What is it with cultists and blood and sacrifice? If you’re so enamored with gore and death, why not apprentice as a butcher or become a mortician? Running around and conjuring demons just seems so.. unnecessary.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>Evil to their core, blood cultists typically pay homage to evil gods of chaos, darkness, death, evil, murder, tyranny, or war. They are what most would call classic cultists: simple people with simple goals, such as destroying the world, mass murder, demon summoning, and other similar activities. Usually amassed in small cabals with several acolytes, a few fanatics, and a single hierarch, Blood cultists can serve as dangerous and reckless foes in any adventure.</p><h3>Peace Cultists</h3><p>Somewhat ironically, cultists devoted to the God of Peace can sometimes be formidable martial artists – though one wouldn’t necessarily guess it from their subdued manner and humble presentation. Trained in martial arts, these cultists are proficient at pacifying and neutralizing threats, which makes them ideal bodyguards and – in the case of the disciple of peace – lethal assassins, when the situation warrants it.</p><h3>Shattered Sun Cultists</h3><p>Beholden to the God of Light, the cultists of the Shattered Sun are relentless warriors with priestly powers. Typically encountered in squads of a handful of zealots led by a single dawnbreaker, Shattered Sun cultists may not be natural foes for goodly adventurers – except if said adventurers don’t share the cultists’ fanatical view of evil and good. An adventurer who consorts with evil entities or oppose the cultists’ extreme methods may find themselves going head-to-head with the dangerous cultists</p><h3>Unbound Weave Cultists</h3><p>The cultists of the Unbound Weave are often regular people who’ve been touched by wild magic – either accidentally or by design. Some had wizardly powers already, others gained them through their brush with the unstable and dangerous magic. Whichever is the case, they employ their magical powers recklessly and take great delight in the havoc their magic can wreak.</p></div>"

The reason for the melodiel’s anger is up to you but could include:</p><ul><li><p>A priest of the melodiel’s patron deity was murdered and the angel holds the entire town responsible.</p></li><li><p>A group of townsfolk burned down a temple or shrine dedicated to the melodiel’s patron deity.</p></li><li><p>An acolyte summoned the melodiel to perform at a festival and the angel was driven mad by the spell.</p></li></ul><h3>Meeting the Melodiel</h3><p>As the characters pass through a small village, they are drawn to the town’s square by a beautiful yet somber tune. Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>At the center of the town’s square, a humanoid with angelic features sits on a bench, playing a beautiful dirge on a golden harp. A few dozen humanoids are seated at long tables in the square, their eyes fixed upon the angelic creature as if in a dreamlike state. Three bloody corpses lie near the celestial creature’s feet. You notice that everyone in the gathering seems unnaturally old – a handful of the gathered townsfolk even seem like nothing more than wrinkled husks of skin and bone.</p></blockquote><p>The <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.gg1PLc8PkGk3S3rZ]{melodiel}</strong> has been playing its Melody of the Ages for the past 24 hours – aging everyone in the town’s square by 24 years and causing several people to die of old age. The three corpses at its feet belong to townspeople who tried to oppose the celestial.</p><h5>Religious Knowledge</h5><p>A character proficient in Religion can make an Intelligence (Religion) check to remember the following about melodiels:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>DC 13.</strong> Melodiels are proud celestials revered as the musical virtuosos of Celestia. A melodiel can play a tune that rapidly ages any mortal who hears it.</p><p><strong>DC 15.</strong> Melodiels are creatures of passion, prone to strong reactions and easy to anger.</p><p><strong>DC 17.</strong> Performing music as skillfully as a melodiel distracts it and temporarily disrupts its magic.</p></div><h3>Engaging the Melodiel</h3><p>The melodiel sees the characters as they arrive in the town’s square but continues to play its melody. Once the party is about to come within 60 feet of the melodiel (and thus entering its Melody of the Ages’ area of effect), read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“Not a step closer, mortals,” the angelic creature hisses while continuing to play its harp. “I shall have my vengeance upon these cretins. Leave us be – or stay and listen until your hearts stop!”</p></blockquote><p>Driven to crazed anger, the melodiel is ready to die to exact its vengeance upon the townsfolk.</p><h5>A Peaceful Solution</h5><p>At your discretion, a character who attempts to convince the celestial that its judgment isn’t fair and that it shouldn’t hold the whole town responsible may be able to do so with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The celestial may insist that the culprits be held responsible and task the characters with ensuring that they are punished.</p><h5>Fighting the Melodiel</h5><p>If the characters can’t convince the melodiel to stop playing its deadly melody, they have no choice but to either leave the townsfolk to their fate or stop the mad melodiel using force. The celestial fights until it is destroyed. If its concentration is broken, its Melody of the Ages is brought to a halt, and the roughly two dozen townsfolk (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{commoners}</strong>) wake from their stupor, although they’re too confused and exhausted to assist the party.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>If the characters destroy the melodiel or convince it to spare the townsfolk, it leaves behind an <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.UeCXBsjgEoEwc7ic]{instrument of the heavens}</em> – and, if alive, it vows to right the wrongs it has committed to the townspeople.

          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h1\">Deceptive Devotion</p><p>In this encounter for a party of 3rd- to 6th-level adventurers, the characters join a religious ceremony overseen by a divine deceiver and must use their wit to avoid being exploited by the deceptive celestial. In the description below, the divine deceiver has disguised itself as a small town’s priest and is overseeing the town’s celebration of the Festival of Light. You can change the occasion and location as you see fit, using the @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.lQ2zIJu97ZbrlwCk.JournalEntryPage.7QC5R4BuvoIQpZka]{rituals and holidays} in Chapter 2 as inspiration.</p><h3>Running the Sermon</h3><p>As the characters arrive in the small town of Willowstone, either by design or because they’re just traveling through, they’re just in time for the town’s celebration of the Festival of Light. After a month of self-imposed deprivation, the townsfolk have gathered in the town square to partake in a feast to celebrate the gods. As the feast is about to begin, the town’s priest – a young man called Terkiel, who is dressed in white robes that denote him as a servant of the God of Light – rises to deliver a sermon. Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Once everyone has seated themselves at the long tables, a frail-looking young man rises. “Greetings, old friends and new – it is a great pleasure to see so many gathered for this holy festival,” he says in a surprisingly strong voice. The priest dives into a long sermon about devotion and duty that has the townsfolk nodding along in agreement. At the end of the sermon, he says: “And now, please come forward, kneel here before me, and offer a prayer to your god, so you can receive their blessing upon this most holy of days!” With only slight hesitation, most of the gathered townsfolk begin lining up before the priest, bowing down to receive his blessing in turn.</p></blockquote><p>At this point, the characters may realize something is amiss. Allow them to make the following checks:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>History or Religion.</strong> A character who is proficient in History or Religion or who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (History or Religion) check knows that this type of ceremony usually doesn’t involve being blessed by a priest.</p><p><strong>Insight or Perception.</strong> A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight or Perception) notices that the townsfolk who receive the blessing look pale and weak. The priest, conversely, seems to flush with vitality after blessing each petitioner.</p><p><strong>Arcana or Religion.</strong> A character who can sense magic or who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check realizes that the priest isn’t delivering any blessings but is instead employing some sort of fell magic on the townsfolk.</p></div><p>If a character steps forward to receive the priest’s blessing, they immediately feel a surge of warm, pleasant energy flow through them. The sensation is short-lived, however, and is soon replaced with a sense of fatigue; the character gains a level of Exhaustion.</p><h3>Confronting the Deceiver</h3><p>If the characters accuse the priest of foul play, Terkiel – who is in truth a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.iRX6ihrcMIbZKxlI]{divine deceiver}</strong>, a celestial creature that subsists on the prayers and divine magic of mortals – acts surprised and hurt at the accusation, claiming that it’s normal to feel fatigued after being touched by the divine. If the accusations are made publicly, you can have up to two characters make a Charisma (Persuasion) check against the divine deceiver’s Charisma (Deception) check. If one or more of the characters succeed, they manage to make the townsfolk suspicious of the priest.</p><p><em><strong>Fighting the Deceiver.</strong></em> If the characters manage to turn the townsfolk against the celestial, or they keep escalating the situation, the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.iRX6ihrcMIbZKxlI]{divine deceiver}</strong> drops its guise and reverts to its natural form. This display serves to prevent the townsfolk from intervening as it sets upon the party with murderous fury. It focuses its ire on characters who wield divine magic or those who made the strongest accusations against it. If the fight is too difficult or too easy, you can adjust the balance by having a few of the bravest townsfolk (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN]{bandits}</strong> or <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS]{guards}</strong>) assist either the party or the celestial.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>If the deceiver is reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, it unfurls its wings and attempts to flee the scene. Should it be successful, it may seek out the party later to avenge the indignity it has suffered at their hands.</p><p>If the characters expose and defeat the deceiver, the townsfolk are grateful and continue the celebration in their honor. At your discretion, the character’s may receive a <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.mu6KBzeHNJwCQWKG]{martyr’s amulet}</em> as a reward or be able to claim it from the celestial’s corpse.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Forcing a Confrontation</p><p>If the characters don’t see through the divine deceiver’s deception on their own, you can nudge the characters to confront the celestial in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li><p>To assume the local priest’s identity, the deceiver killed him and hid his corpse. Midway through the ceremony, one of the townsfolk finds the corpse and loudly proclaims their discovery for all to hear.</p></li><li><p>The divine deceiver arrived in town, claiming to have been sent as a replacement after the town’s aging priest died of natural causes. Midway through the ceremony, the real replacement <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{priest}</strong> shows up and exposes the celestial as an impostor.</p></li></ul></blockquote></div>"

The encounter can be used anytime you want to challenge the party with a fearsome celestial, but ideally you would run it if the party has done something that would incur the marithiel’s wrath. Some possible reasons that you can use as inspiration are:</p><ul><li><p>The party is intruding upon an ancient temple or another sacred site protected by the marithiel.</p></li><li><p>The party has incurred the wrath of a deity and the marithiel has been sent to hunt down the party.</p></li><li><p>Someone has enraged the marithiel while magically disguised as one of the characters, or the marithiel has been tricked into wanting to kill the party.</p></li></ul><h3>Encountering the Marithiel</h3><p>As the characters are taking a rest or traveling, the marithiel comes into sight and immediately notices the party. Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A humanoid figure with six arms approaches your group. Wearing a golden crown and holding a sword in each of its many hands, its shimmering golden eyes fix on you with a terrifying gaze. “It it time for you to pay for your transgressions.

The check is made with advantage if the characters invoke the ideals of the marithiel’s deity, which a character can deduce with a successful DC 10 Religion check by looking at the symbols on the marithiel’s equipment.</p><h5>Fighting the Marithiel</h5><p>If combat can’t be avoided, the <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.uA4CUMuRphQjv97m]{marithiel}</strong> initiates combat with Paralyzing Gaze, and uses Divine Jibe and Terrifying Glare to control the battlefield.

In this example, the monument is the Bridge of the Heavens, but you can replace it with another monument or holy site of your choosing. Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A beautiful, ancient bridge spans out before you, reaching more than 500 feet across a wide river. Ornately carved with gilded symbols and images, the bridge is a marvel of engineering and artistry. As you walk across, you notice that the scenes carved on its surface depict angels, joined together in battle or in joyous song, dance, or meditation. For a moment, it seems you can almost hear the angels’ serene songs ring out, eerily beautiful and calming.</p></blockquote><h3>The Old Sage</h3><p>Later on in their journey, the party meets a procession of acolytes. Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Further ahead on the road, a closed carriage sits by the side of the road. One of its wheels looks to be broken and has been removed. Four humanoids in brown robes surround the carriage, two of them hard at work repairing the broken carriage.</p></blockquote><p>The humanoids are acolytes of the God of Knowledge – or any other deity of your choosing – who are making a pilgrimage to the Bridge of the Heavens. As the characters approach, the acolytes hail them in a friendly manner. Hallura, a young half-elf woman, explains that the acolytes are transporting Archbishop Maltheus, a human <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{priest}</strong> well into his nineties, to see the Bridge of the Heavens before he passes, as that is his dying wish. The endeavor seems hopeless now.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“The Archbishop is not long for this world – I fear that even with your aid, he’ll be in the Lorekeeper’s embrace long before we reach the Bridge of the Heavens. It’s a shame – Archbishop Maltheus selflessly devoted his entire life to spreading knowledge and wisdom to those who needed it most, and now, at his life’s end, he’ll be denied that which he wanted to learn most for himself.”</p></blockquote><p>As the characters speak with Hallura, you can have the Archbishop’s frail voice sound from inside the carriage:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>“Hallura, dear, who is that I hear? Please, I would... I would see these new friends, if it pleases them.”</p></blockquote><p>Frowning slightly, Hallura allows the characters to enter the carriage. Read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>An old and frail-looking human man with a gray beard and a silver diadem on his furrowed brow lies on a comfortable bed that fills up almost half the carriage. His wrinkled face seems kind and his eyes shine with bright intelligence. “My thanks, Hallura. Now if you will, I would speak with these visitors, alone.” Hallura nods and leaves the carriage.</p></blockquote><p>The archbishop asks the characters who they are and where they are going. The topic soon falls on the Bridge of the Heavens and Maltheus’ wish to see it before he passes. If the characters don’t suggest it themselves, he asks if they can help him fulfill this wish. The characters may accomplish this by:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Telling.</strong> A character who describes the bridge, either with words, poetry, or song, does it justice if they succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drawing.</strong> A character can draw the Bridge of the Heavens in a way that matches its beauty if they succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check using artisan’s tools or similar equipment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Showing.</strong> The characters can also use spells such as <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{scrying}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.oIzA2MEHwxhtQneU]{minor illusion}</em>, or even <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV]{teleport}</em> to show Maltheus the Bridge of the Heavens before he dies.</p></li></ul><p>If all attempts fail, or the characters don’t try, Maltheus expires with a haunted expression on his face. If the characters succeed, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A satisfied smile spreads upon the old man’s face. “Thank you, friends,” he whispers, a tear trickling down his cheek. “I am ready to go now. But I have one more favor to ask of you. Please, take my diadem. It has served me well, granting me a cunning far greater than I ever deserved. I would rather you take it and speak not of its power to my acolytes – they are better off placing their faith in themselves and the Lorekeeper, than relying on magical aid as I did,” the priest says, the words weak and strained. As he removes the diadem from his brow, the spark of intelligence in his eyes dims, and his smile widens. “Ah, but I shall go to my God as I am – no less, no more. Farewell, friends,” he says softly, before his eyes close – never to open again.</p></blockquote><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>If the characters leave the carriage with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.vfWbzDBUNVhtl8xO]{diadem of acuity}</em>, Hallura may question them but quickly accepts a truthful explanation or a convincing lie delivered with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check. The acolytes are saddened by the Archbishop’s passing but less so if they learn that Maltheus’ dying wish was fulfilled. Only the knowledge that the Archbishop’s <em>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.vfWbzDBUNVhtl8xO]{diadem of acuity}</em> was the source of much of his knowledge can truly sour their mood.</p></div>"

All seems calm just until it doesn’t; with a sudden quickness – but uncanny silence – a monstrous figure rises from the river just 30 feet ahead of you. Humanoid but with massive, feathered wings, a scaly body, and tangled, snake-like hair, the figure seems to be an angel of some sort. Its glowing eyes focus on you and it booms with a dozen different voices at once: “Fate has brought you to this place – but only what’s in your hearts and minds will bring you past it. Before you pass, I must know their essence – either by your words or by your shattered skulls and broken ribs. Are you ready to prove yourselves worthy?”</p></blockquote><p>The river ceases flowing around the celestial, bringing whatever vessel the characters are sailing on to an unnatural stop and allowing them to speak with the mystical creature.</p><h5>The Guardian’s Questions</h5><p>The <strong>@UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.actors.Actor.EOBidKWWOPbhP2MN]{shilmaiphiel}</strong> does not attack, but instead poses the characters two questions, one at a time:</p><ul><li><p>“A member of the flock is carried away by the stream. To save it, the rest of the flock must put themselves at risk. Should the flock help their lost member or accept the loss?” <strong>Answer:</strong> As long as the effort isn’t doomed, the flock must accept risk to protect all its members – or it is no flock at all.</p></li><li><p>“Should a person’s spirit be most like wind, water, earth, or fire?” <strong>Answer:</strong> A spirit should be like water: persistent but malleable, powerful but flexible.</p></li></ul><p>Once the guardian has heard the characters’ answers, read or paraphrase the following:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>The angelic figure bows its head solemnly. “Like the gentle river, you can pass through and around me, but only if you leave one of your flock behind. Or, like the crashing wave, you can band together and move me with force.

She may say things like: “Why do you have an imp as a familiar? That’s a creature of the Nether Planes!” or, “You look like you ply your trade in the shadows, or am I mistaken?” To avoid a violent confrontation, the party must convince Emyra of the character’s innocence with an explanation and a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check.</p><h5>Fighting the Zealots</h5><p>If battle breaks out, either because the characters refuse the toll or Emyra takes a dislike to them, the zealots fight until slain, making no efforts to surrender.

That also means the ritual must either already be underway as the characters arrive, or begin as soon as combat starts. If you have the ritual begin as the characters arrive, you can paraphrase the following, adding in specific details as needed:</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>As it becomes clear to the cult leader that you’ve come to stop the ritual, they shout to their followers: “There’s no more time for preparation. Begin the ritual now!

At the end of every round, the Ritual Counter goes up by 1 for every cultist that is still chanting to fuel the ritual. When it reaches 20, the ritual is complete.</p><p><strong>Cultists.</strong> The encounter begins with 5 cultists who are participating in the ritual by chanting (which takes up their entire turn), 5 cultist guardians who are ready to protect them or take their place, and a cult leader who directs the battle.</p><p><strong>Events.</strong> Even before it is completed, the ritual can have an effect on the battlefield in the form of events that trigger when certain things happen:</p><ul><li><strong>Ritual Effects.</strong> When the Ritual Counter reaches 5, 10, and 15, a lesser effect is unleashed to underscore that the ritual is nearing completion. Use these events to make the battle harder if it is too easy, or hold back on them if the characters are struggling. See the “Who are the Cultists?” sidebar for examples.</li><li><strong>Ritual Implosion.</strong> When a chanting cultist dies, it explodes in your choice of radiant light, magical force, or searing blood. Each creature within 10 feet takes 2d8 Radiant, Force, or Fire damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be Blinded by the blast until the end of its next turn.</li><li><strong>Ritual Invigoration.</strong> As long as the ritual is undergoing, the cultist leader has a bonus to attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws equal to the number of cultists who are chanting.</li></ul><p><strong>Information.</strong> To help raise tension, you can let any character proficient in Arcana or Religion realize roughly how these mechanics work – and maybe even what the consequences would be of allowing the ritual to be completed.</p></div><p>The specifics of the encounter can be adjusted, based on how difficult you want the encounter to be.

As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the amulet. You gain the personality trait “I always act with perfect objectivity and rationality, without regard for my own or other’s feelings,” and have an irresistible urge to make the world a more lawful and orderly place, in whatever way you can.</p></div><h4>Bedlam</h4><p><em>Weapon (Shortsword), Legendary (Requires Attunement)</em><br />This magic sword was forged specifically to destroy divine agents and creatures of the Outer Planes, whether evil or good.</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Dormant.</strong> In its dormant state, the sword has the following properties:</p></div><ul><li><p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the sword.</p></li><li><p>When you hit a Celestial or Fiend with the sword, the creature takes an extra 1d8 Force damage.</p></li><li><p>When you hit a creature with the sword, you can choose to learn whether that creature has any immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are.

The Archgod rules over all the other gods, who otherwise have no formal power over each other – albeit some deities are significantly more powerful or influential than others.</p><h4>Divine Existence</h4><p>The deities are celestial spirits defined by Divine Sparks – literal, divine essence – that are transferable and can be stolen or given away. The deities live in extraplanar realms – most of them in the Upper Planes – some together, some on a plane of their own.</p><p>Deities are for all intents and purposes immortal and can only die under special circumstances. When it happens, the deity’s Divine Spark can be consumed by another deity to make it more powerful, or by a mortal creature who then ascends to godhood. Mortals can also be raised to become gods in other ways, though this usually involves either a god transferring its power to the mortal or direct interference from the Archgod, who has the power to create or destroy Divine Sparks.</p><h4>Divine Power</h4><p>Deities have a measure of innate power and gain additional power from worship, from the prominence of their Divine Domains, and from the souls they gather from their worshipers in the afterlife. The deities’ ability to interfere with the Mortal World is limited by decree of the Archgod; a deity that is caught interfering directly is cast down and stripped of its Divine Spark. Thus, the deities pursue their many varied schemes and goals through their followers, whom they in turn imbue with divine magic.</p><h3>Deities</h3><p>Below are the pantheon’s Archgod and twenty of the pantheon’s most prominent deities.</p><h5>The Archgod</h5><p><em>Greater God (Unaligned)<br /></em>The Archgod is a mysterious entity that is unknown to most mortals. Undisputed sovereign of the gods, it is believed that the Archgod created the gods, though not even this is known with certainty. Seemingly not dependent on worship or tied to any specific domain, the Archgod prefers to remain obscure, only making its presence known when a deity breaks the laws of divinity or a calamity threatens the Multiverse itself.</p><h5>The Black Blade</h5><p><em>God of Destruction, Murder, and War (Lawful Evil)<br /></em>The Black Blade is a tyrannical deity who revels in tyranny and oppression. Favored among the ruthless and callous, the Black Blade is often seen as the greatest of the evil deities.</p><h5>The Dawnbringer</h5><p><em>God of Light, Protection, and the Sun (Lawful Good)<br /></em>The Dawnbringer is a benevolent deity who brings light and warmth to the world. Worshiped by many as a protector and defender against darkness and evil, the Dawnbringer is popular among clerics and paladins.</p><h5>The Earthmother</h5><p><em>God of Fertility, Life, and Nature (Neutral Good)<br /></em>The Earthmother is a rural deity revered by farmers and hunters, but also by druids, rangers, and everyone else who enjoys nature. She symbolizes creation, nourishment, and the preservation of life and nature.</p><h5>The Forestfather</h5><p><em>God of Animals, Nature, and Plants (Neutral)<br /></em>The Forestfather is a mystical deity who embodies the spirit of nature itself. He is often worshiped by druids, shamans, and other folk who feel kinship with the more bestial and primordial side of nature.</p><h5>The Lady Luck</h5><p><em>God of Fate, Luck, and Wealth (Neutral Good)<br /></em>The Lady Luck is perhaps the most universally revered deity as she oversees luck and wealth – or the lack of it. Adventurers, merchants, and other risk-takers will commonly offer at least symbolic prayer to her.</p><h5>The Lady of Loss</h5><p><em>God of Darkness, Loss, and Pain (Chaotic Evil)<br /></em>The Lady of Loss is a dark and sinister deity who revels in loss and pain. Her worshipers are often cynical and evil, or have been deeply traumatized by their own griefs and seek solace with the Lady of Loss.</p><h5>The Lady of Love</h5><p><em>God of Beauty, Light, and Love (Chaotic Good)<br /></em>The Lady of Love is sister to the Lady of Loss, and her opposite in most ways. A benevolent deity who presides over matters of the heart, she is worshiped by lovers, poets, and artists.</p><h5>The Lady of Mercy</h5><p><em>God of Life, Mercy, and Peace (Neutral Good</em>)<br />The Lady of Mercy is a benevolent and nurturing deity who values the preservation of life above all else. She is often worshiped by healers, physicians, and other caregivers who sacrifice themselves for others.</p><h5>The Lady of the Moon</h5><p><em>God of Knowledge, Moon, and Night (Neutral)<br /></em>The Lady of the Moon is a mysterious deity who embodies the power of the moon. She is often worshiped by outcasts and loners, and provides guidance and wisdom to those who follow her.</p><h5>The Lady of the Weave</h5><p><em>God of Knowledge and Magic (Neutral Good)<br /></em>The Lady of the Weave oversees the weave of magic and thus holds immense power in the Mortal World. She is worshiped by sorcerers, wizards, and others who wish to unlock the secrets of arcane power.</p><h5>The Lawbringer</h5><p><em>God of Duty, Law, and Order (Lawful Good)<br /></em>The Lawbringer is a just and honorable deity who values order and protection above all else. Often worshiped by paladins, judges, and other guardians of the law who revere the god’s unyielding vigilance.</p><h5>The Lord of Battle</h5><p><em>God of Courage, Strength, and War (Lawful Neutral)<br /></em>The Lord of Battle is a stern and disciplined deity who demands loyalty and self-sacrifice from his followers. He is often worshiped by soldiers, knights, and other warriors who value strength and bravery.</p><h5>The Lord of Death</h5><p><em>God of Death and Fate (Neutral)<br /></em>The Lord of Death presides over the end of mortal life and the transition into the afterlife. He is an impartial deity who ensures that every soul is judged fairly and that the proper fate awaits them in the next world.</p><h5>The Lorekeeper</h5><p><em>God of Knowledge and Wisdom (Neutral)<br /></em>The Lorekeeper is a wise and learned deity who values knowledge above all else. He is often worshiped by scholars, sages, and others who seek to gather or preserve knowledge.</p><h5>The Maiden of Frost</h5><p><em>God of Death and Winter (Neutral Evil)<br /></em>The Maiden of Frost is a cold and distant deity who rules over the harsh and unforgiving realm of winter. She is often worshiped by those who fear death and seek to appease her in order to avoid her cold wrath.</p><h5>The Maker</h5><p><em>God of Knowledge, Invention, and Order (Lawful Neutral)<br /></em>The Maker is a deity dedicated to rational thought, invention, and order in the Multiverse. Patron deity of craftsmen and inventors, the Maker is also worshiped by those who appreciate intelligence and pragmatism.</p><h5>The Masked One</h5><p><em>God of Darkness and Secrets (Neutral)<br /></em>The Masked One is a mysterious and enigmatic deity who presides over the hidden and unknown aspects of the world. The Masked One is typically worshiped by assassins, spies, and others with secrets to protect.</p><h5>The Mother of the Waves</h5><p><em>God of Chaos and Water (Chaotic Neutral)<br /></em>The Mother of the Waves is a capricious and powerful deity who rules over the oceans and the creatures that dwell within them. She is often worshiped – or cursed – by sailors, fishermen, and other seafarers who seek her favor and protection.</p><h5>The Plaguebringer</h5><p><em>God of Decay, Nature, and Undeath (Chaotic Evil)<br /></em>The Plaguebringer is a black-hearted deity who spreads corruption and pestilence. Often portrayed as a grotesque, rotting corpse, the Plaguebringer is worshiped by evil druids and necromancers alike.</p><h5>The Stormbringer</h5><p><em>God of Chaos, Nature, and Tempest (Chaotic Neutral)<br /></em>The Stormbringer is a capricious deity who rules over the forces of nature. The god is renowned for being unpredictable and destructive, and is revered by those who wish to harness the raw power of nature.</p><h5>The Trickster</h5><p><em>God of Chaos and Trickery (Chaotic Neutral)<br /></em>The Trickster is a mischievous and unpredictable deity who delights in causing chaos and confusion. The Trickster is often worshiped by rogues, bards, and others who rely on cunning and improvisation.</p></div>"

        "Draconic Pantheon": {
          "name": "Draconic Pantheon",
          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h1\">Draconic Pantheon</p><p>The Draconic Pantheon is a dualistic pantheon consisting of evil chromatic dragon deities ruled by the greater god Tiamat and benevolent metallic dragon deities ruled by the greater god Bahamut.</p><h3>Pantheon Overview</h3><p>As the Draconic Pantheon is divided into two, there are some key similarities and differences between how the two pantheons operate, as described below.</p><h4>Divine System</h4><p>The two divisions of the draconic pantheon are ruled over by Tiamat and Bahamut respectively, who are greater deities that reside outside the Mortal World. The rest of the draconic deities, who range from lesser deities that oversee obscure Divine Domains to true deities with large followings, live in the Mortal World.</p><p>In total, five chromatic dragons and five metallic dragons are considered “chosen” – one for each color or metal – and each commands up to a dozen lesser draconic demigods. Further down in the hierarchy are dragons who have no divine powers – and, of course, the mortal humanoids that inhabit the Mortal World.</p><h4>Divine Existence</h4><p>While Tiamat and Bahamut themselves are more akin to celestial spirits, the rest of the draconic gods are more dragons than celestials. They may live for millennia, but they are far from invincible.</p><p>For a chromatic demigod to become a true god – one of Tiamat’s five chosen – it must slay its superior and assume its Divine Spark. Conversely, Bahamut’s chosen are elected from among the metallic demigods by a council which is held every 777 years. Only if a draconic deity is slain or shames Bahamut with its actions, does Bahamut take a direct hand in electing a replacement.</p><h4>Divine Power</h4><p>Though they are the most powerful, Tiamat and Bahamut are very limited in how they can wield their divine power. They can only pass it along to their chosen and the draconic demigods, and then offer guidance on how to use it. These lesser draconic deities are more free to use their divine power, which is further strengthened by the worship they receive from mortals. The draconic deities are powerful in their own right and can imbue their followers with divine magic, but can’t perform truly reality-bending miracles.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Draconic Deities &amp; Their Stat blocks</p><p>Aside from Tiamat and Bahamut, the draconic deities are all more-or-less regular dragons who have godly powers. To give statistics to these draconic deities, you can take a dragon stat block and give it divine enhancements and features (see @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.Py9SDRdC3odAguMc]{Designing Divinity}). As a rule of thumb, one of Tiamat or Bahamut’s chosen would typically be an ancient dragon with five divine benefits and three divine actions, while a draconic demigod would be a young, adult, or ancient dragon with three divine benefits and two divine actions.</p></blockquote><h3>Chromatic Deities</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>To have the opportunity to meet a true, living god in the flesh is such an amazing privilege. To stare into the face of divinity and have it stare back at you – it’s hard to imagine any experience would ever be able to top that! Which is probably good, since most encounters between a mortal and a draconic deity typically ends up being the mortal’s last experience. But still, what a privilege!</p><p>– the Scribe</p></blockquote><p>The chromatic deities in the Mortal World are all ancient dragons who have been imbued with divine power by Tiamat, the Queen of Chromatic Dragons True to her chaotic nature, Tiamat has few formal decrees but expects her subjects to divine her will – or suffer the consequences. She also encourages the dragons who serve her to rule through cunning and strength, and to impose their will upon others. Thus, for all their efficiency, the chromatic dragons are perpetually hampered by infighting and intrigue within their own ranks.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Tiamat the Chromatic</h5><p><em>Greater God of Chaos (Chaotic Evil)</em><br />The greater god Tiamat is chaos incarnate. Destructive, temperamental, and unpredictable, Tiamat rules through fear, intrigue, and brute force. Often believed to be an immense dragon in her own right, Tiamat’s main goal is to manifest in the Mortal World so she can bend it to her will – something her subjects work tirelessly to make happen.</p><h5>Araxia the Black</h5><p><em>God of Darkness, Death, and Murder (Chaotic Evil)</em><br />The black dragon Araxia became a true deity despite her relative youth through cold ambition and ruthless murder. As cunning as she is cruel, Araxia makes even her peers nervous with her penchant for sadism. Her dominion is relatively small and sparsely inhabited – the dragon actively encourages strife between her mortal subjects and makes no efforts to prevent the spread of pestilence – but her reach is vast. Araxia commands a large network of both draconic and humanoid assassins that wage a war of subterfuge against the metallic dragons and their minions.</p><h5>Azurelith the Blue</h5><p><em>God of Knowledge, Fate, and Time (Lawful Evil)<br /></em>The blue dragon Azurelith is the longest-serving deity in the pantheon aside from Bahamut and Tiamat. Blessed with the ability to see and even manipulate the past, present, and future, Azurelith is well-protected from enemies both foreign and domestic. Her dominion is vast, secure, and rich, and her mages and priests are among the most powerful in all the Mortal World.</p><h5>Viridian the Green</h5><p><em>God of Magic and Trickery (Chaotic Evil)</em><br />The green dragon Viridian is the most secretive of the chromatic dragon deities. With only a small following and no realm, one can almost forget that Viridian exists – which is what the dragon god prefers, as his followers infiltrate royal courts and use deception, illusory magic, and manipulation to subvert sovereigns and monarchs to Viridian’s will.</p><h5>Hathraxes the Red</h5><p><em>God of War and Wealth (Neutral Evil)</em><br />Strongest and oldest of the chromatic dragon gods who serve Tiamat, Hathraxes is a fearsome and tyrannical ancient red dragon who rules over a vast dominion. His vast treasure hoard fills whole mountains and his followers are always gathering more. Hathraxes is embroiled in a decades-long war with the minions of Gathriax the Gold, who rules the neighboring realms.</p><h5>Icialix the White</h5><p><em>God of Nature and Winter (Chaotic Evil)</em><br />Young and hale, Icialix the White rules over a large but sparsely populated region of forests, plains, and tundra. Known as the White Hunter to her followers, Icialix scours her domain tirelessly, always eager to demonstrate her physical prowess. Even so, there are many among the lesser dragon gods that follow her who dream to one day overthrow her and take her place – something that is done through ritual combat, as is tradition among the white dragons.</p><h3>Metallic Deities</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>Oh, that’s a great idea. Let’s take the most arrogant, self-centered, and spiteful mortal creatures we can find – the almighty dragons – and give them divine powers. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>The metallic deities in the Mortal World are ancient dragons who have been blessed by Bahamut with divine power. Five of these dragons are considered Bahamut’s chosen, and commune directly with the greater god to enact his will in the Mortal World. These true deities in turn command dozens of lesser dragons imbued with slivers of divinity that each oversee smaller Divine Domains. As a whole, the metallic dragon deities are focused on maintaining order in the Mortal World and preventing Tiamat’s servants from spreading destruction and death.</p><h5>Bahamut the Platinum</h5><p><em>Greater God of Order (Lawful Good)</em><br />Almost more concept than dragon, Bahamut is said to be as old as time itself. From his celestial realm, he channels divine power to the metallic dragons that serve him in the Mortal World. He prefers to be hands-off, trusting that his subjects will choose among themselves who should lead them – and that they, if given the power and opportunity, will act faithfully in his stead in the Mortal World. Bahamut has no desire to walk the Mortal World, but considers it his most sacred mission to ensure that Tiamat never does.</p><h5>Beriaxes the Brass</h5><p><em>God of Light, Freedom, and Peace (Chaotic Good)</em><br />The brass dragon deity Beriaxes is young – well, young for an ancient draconic god – and is serving his first tenure as the God of Light. Often viewed as frivolous and even naive by his peers, Beriaxes possesses an unquenchable and endearing optimism that has seen his flock of worshipers grow to rival that of Gathriax the Gold. Beriaxes does not rule over his own dominion but instead has followers across all the lands, as anyone who’s in need of a little light or hope is likely to offer prayers to the brass dragon deity.</p><h5>Othilia the Bronze</h5><p><em>God of Magic, Nature, and Water (Neutral Good)<br /></em>The bronze dragon Othilia resides in an underwater realm deep beneath the sea. The longest-serving metallic dragon deity, Othilia is renowned for her druidic powers and love for the natural world. She has avowed herself to protect all of nature but has a special fondness for the oceans, of which she is considered sole ruler. Her worshipers are numerous, and especially among farmers, who look to her for rain, and sailors, who rely on her to keep the waves calm. Othilia is the natural enemy of Araxia, whom she views as despicable and as an affront to nature.</p><h5>Jeeraxil the Copper</h5><p><em>God of Death, Joy, and Trickery (Neutral Good)</em><br />The copper dragon Jeeraxil is old even by the standards of draconic deities, though his youthful demeanor belies his advanced age. Always good for a jest or prank, Jeeraxil may not move as quickly as he once did, but his humor has not diminished. His duty as the overseer of death is one he takes very seriously and he has made it his mission to ensure that funerals are, as much as it is possible, occasions for fond remembrance and joyous levity, rather than somber and sad affairs. Jeeraxil has no realm he rules over, but his followers and minions are spread far and wide across the Mortal World.</p><h5>Gathriax the Gold</h5><p><em>God of Glory, Strength, and War (Lawful Good)</em><br />The gold dragon Gathriax is an ancient dragon of middling years – several millennia, but young relative to some of the dragon’s fellow deities – who strikes a majestic and imposing figure. Physically strong and with an aptitude for strategy and tactics, Gathriax holds sway over a large portion of the Mortal World, and the gold dragon’s armies are the foremost defenders against Tiamat’s servants. Though Gathriax’s zeal is sometimes frowned upon by the other metallic dragons, none can doubt the gold dragon’s prowess or dedication to Bahamut’s cause.</p><h5>Ailvarra the Silver</h5><p><em>God of Fate, Knowledge, and Magic (Lawful Good)</em><br />The silver dragon Ailvarra is possibly the most beloved of all the draconic deities. Almost omniscient in her wisdom, Ailvarra is always last to speak, but when she does, everyone listens. A powerful diviner even before she was elected to be a true deity, Ailvarra is often called the purveyor and protector of truth. She is also the matron deity of the elves, who are her most loyal followers.</p></div>"

There is also a summary of some of the sect or cult’s most notable members, quests that may see the characters become involved with it, and various locations and objects that are important to the cult.

While these definitions are used loosely – and often interchangeably – the rough definitions used on the following pages are:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Church.</strong> The main religious organization for a specific religion, i.e., the Church of Light is the widely recognized church of the Dawnbringer.</p><p><strong>Sect.</strong> A smaller branch or offshoot within a church, which adheres to the same overarching idea but interprets various tenets differently or has different opinions about how the church should act. The Shattered Sun is a sect within the Church of Light, because it has the same goals as the rest of the church (defend the weak and vanquish evil) but it advocates much more extreme methods.</p><p><strong>Cult.</strong> Even more than a sect, a cult’s beliefs, goals, and values differ from those of the church, if the cult even considers itself part of any organized religion at all. Typically, cults are smaller, more secretive, and centered around a particular object of worship or a charismatic leader.</p></div></blockquote></div>"

Because religious beliefs and spiritual practices trickle down over centuries and become parts of everyday life, even what might seem like a mundane act in your world could easily originate from religion.</p><p>You can use the Acts &amp; Signs of Devotion tables below as inspiration for how to make religion a present and physical part of your fantasy setting.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Signs of Devotion</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Municipal buildings are marked with symbols of the God of Order – usually a scale.</td></tr><tr><td>Mortuaries and graveyards use symbols of the God of Death such as a scythe or skull.</td></tr><tr><td>Establishments that allow gambling have a statuette – often shaped as a four-leaf clover or horseshoes – at every table and people must pay tribute to the God of Fortune before buying into the game.</td></tr><tr><td>Libraries and other places of study are decorated with symbols of the God of Knowledge such as a globe or an owl.</td></tr><tr><td>Gardens are decorated with wooden animal sculptures in reverence of the God of Nature.</td></tr><tr><td>Infirmaries display symbols dedicated to the God of Life such as a caduceus.</td></tr><tr><td>Ships, docks, and stables are decorated with various symbols of the God of Nature.</td></tr><tr><td>Banners embroidered with holy symbols are commonplace outside houses of the faithful.</td></tr><tr><td>Guilds incorporate holy symbols into their coats of arms as a way of showing reverence.</td></tr><tr><td>Weapons and armor often are often etched with the symbol of the God of War or Order.</td></tr><tr><td>Casks and barrels used to age ale and spirits are often branded with symbols of the God of Nature or Fortune to prevent spoilage.</td></tr><tr><td>Roadside shrines and holy symbols carved into rocks or trees are common sights when traveling the countryside.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Acts of Devotion</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Merchants always add an extra copper piece when there’s change to be had. Giving too little back may offend the God of Fate and bring misfortune to the business.</td></tr><tr><td>Followers of the God of Light ring a bell loudly at dawn and sunset.</td></tr><tr><td>Followers of the God of Life recite a prayer of gratitude whenever they see a newborn.</td></tr><tr><td>People in mourning wear a black rose as a sign of reverence for the God of Death.</td></tr><tr><td>People knock three times on a door before entering as a sign of peace — though this belief is so old that it has become an unconscious, cultural habit at this point.</td></tr><tr><td>Hunters often offer thanks to the God of Nature by leaving behind their prey’s liver.</td></tr><tr><td>Travelers usually leave a small token — such as a pebble or piece of cloth — at roadside shrines in the hopes of a blessed journey.</td></tr><tr><td>The sick wear a red ribbon, a symbol of the God of Life, as a plea for blessed health.</td></tr><tr><td>Popular drinking songs contain religious folklore such as stories about charming the God of Fortune or tricking the God of Death.</td></tr><tr><td>Competitive sporting events often feature a prayer or display to honor the God of War.</td></tr><tr><td>Winning in a game of chance without giving away some of the prize in tribute to the God of Fortune is said to bring bad luck.</td></tr><tr><td>A common way of saying goodbye is “Peace be with you.” More than a well-wish, this is a prayer used by followers of the God of Peace.</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Why Devotion matters</p><p>Even if divinity and religion play only a small part in your campaign or setting, shining the spotlight on it – no matter how briefly – can help make the world feel more real to the players. It can be as simple as describing how the characters see a group of chanting priests walking down a busy city street or that they hear the Temple of Light’s bells ringing at dawn. It can also be woven into dialogue with NPCs, who may use phrases such as “only the Lorekeeper knows!” or “by the Black Blade, you’re an aggressive one, aren’t you?” Small elements like these, carefully sprinkled throughout an adventure, go a long way to make divinity – and thus also the world – matter.</p></blockquote></div>"

I can't knock the feasts, though – even I will mutter a half-hearted prayer to the Forestfather if it means I get to gorge myself on boar roast.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>Holidays are an essential part of society and go a long way in communicating what ideas or values are held by a culture or group of people. Most holidays bring people together for the purpose of recognizing significant ideas or events, which allows you, the DM, to relay the world’s history and culture in a way that is not only entertaining but also makes the world feel more real.</p><h3>Types of Holidays</h3><p>While holidays can vary greatly in terms of the occasion, most are either commemorative, idealistic, or transitional. It should be noted that these categories are not mutually exclusive, especially as time goes on and the meanings attached to holidays evolve – often, a holiday will fit into multiple categories at once.</p><h5>Commemorative Holidays</h5><p>Commemorative holidays are holidays that celebrate events, people, or deities. These celebrations are meant to bring attention to and help pass on stories, be they theological, historical, or somewhere in between, so that the memory of an event is passed from generation to generation. Dwarves in your world might have a holiday that venerates the Maker, the patron deity of blacksmiths and miners, and the day a particularly powerful artifact was forged. Similarly, a clan of orcs may hold a feast in the Lord of Battle’s honor on the day when the clan won a special battle.</p><h5>Idealistic Holidays</h5><p>Idealistic holidays celebrate ideas or themes and are symbolic celebrations of concepts that are deemed important to society. Concepts like freedom or love that are held as core values are celebrated and re-committed to via ritual and display. Idealistic holidays are oftentimes thematic and aim to promote a specific behavior or belief. A shamanic culture may have a holiday that focuses on being in harmony with nature, while a society of settlers or pilgrims may have a holiday centered around gratitude and gift-giving.</p><h5>Transitional Holidays</h5><p>Transitional holidays are some of the most common holidays because they are often associated with regularly observed phenomena. Solstices, changes in seasons, the ascendance of a mortal to godhood, and rites of passage that signify entering a new stage of life are all examples of transitional holidays. These transitions can also be metaphorical in nature and frequently different types of transitions are used as symbols for one another, such as the transition from spring to summer being associated with the transition from childhood to adulthood.</p><h3>Holiday Traditions</h3><p>Traditions guide the ways in which holidays are celebrated. While there are endless ways to celebrate a holiday, there are some rituals and traditions that are almost always a part of holiday celebrations.</p><h5>Fasting &amp; Feasting</h5><p>Most mortals require food to survive, and when they celebrate they often do so by indulging their stomachs. Sometimes, specific special meats, sweets, or drinks are reserved almost exclusively for specific holidays. These meals are often emblematic of the season that the holiday takes place in but may also be symbolic of events or actions (such as only eating foods of a certain color or refraining from consuming leavened bread).</p><p>Along with feasting, fasting is frequently used as a method of spiritual cleansing and a sign of gratitude and commitment to a faith. Ritualistic fasting for holidays frequently either comes just before or after a holiday dedicated to revelry and over-indulgence.</p><h5>Gifts &amp; Sacrifices</h5><p>Gift-giving can occur during any type of holiday, but the purpose of the gift may have different meanings depending on the origin of the tradition. Gnomes in your world may celebrate holidays by offering handmade gizmos and trinkets while elves may favor gifts that demonstrate thoughtfulness and skill, such as poems or art.</p><p>Likewise, sacrifices can be an important part of a holiday celebration. Though the word sacrifice often conjures violent images of daggers and blood-letting, most sacrificial offerings are benign, such as a harvest holiday including an offering of grain to the Earthmother. Of course, some sacrifices are bloody; a holiday commemorating a great prophet’s sacrifice may call for participants to sacrifice livestock or commit acts of self-harm.</p><h5>Reenactment</h5><p>Holiday reenactments can range from plays or performances to games or festive activities which playfully or symbolically represent stories or past events. A holiday that commemorates a long-ago battle may include warriors painting their faces and wearing ceremonial garb as they perform a dance to reenact the battle. Children borrowing pots and pans and running around at night beating them together to scare demons of the night the same way a fabled hero did would be another form of reenactment. Reenactments can be solemn and grand or they can be playful and pedestrian — it depends entirely on what is being reenacted and by whom.</p><h3>Ready-to-Use Holidays</h3><p>Below are an assortment of festivals and holiday celebrations you can use as inspiration for your own holidays – or plug directly into your own world to bring some color and life to a region or settlement.</p><h5>Asar ath Daione (Festival of Stars)</h5><p>Traditionally an elvish holiday, Asar ath Daione marks the longest night of the year and celebrates the birth of the night sky. The holiday has gained popularity outside elven society, and often also celebrates deities associated with darkness, nature, or the moon, such as the Earthmother or the Lady of the Moon.</p><p>Regardless of which exact ideals it commemorates, the holiday begins at sundown when all work ends and towns that participate are festooned in black and silver decorations. Sweet drinks and foods are common during Asar ath Daione and while not strictly ceremonial, it is common to see people dressed in black or dark-green cloaks or shirts. Asar ath Daione is also a coming-of-age celebration for young women (or people who have recently come into their womanhood regardless of age), who decorate their hair and clothes with sprigs of holly and pine before taking part in a traditional dance under the stars.</p><h5>Asar ath i’Anor (Festival of Dawn)</h5><p>Similar to its sibling holiday, Asar ath i’Anor is an elven holiday that marks the year’s longest day and celebrates the birth of the sun, and typically also deities associated with light, nature, or the sun, such as the Forestfather or the Dawnbringer.</p><p>Celebrations begin at first light, although many will wake before dawn to get preparations underway, and will continue until sundown. Asar ath i’Anor is commonly celebrated with savory dishes of meat, vegetables, and ale, and participating towns or households often decorate with white and gold. Young men who have come of age (or people who have recently come into their manhood regardless of age) wear crowns of clover and lantana flowers and participate in a traditional dance at dawn.</p><h5>Feast of Devotion</h5><p>The Feast of Devotion is a solemn occasion for the pious and devout to realign themselves with their gods and their beliefs. The feast itself takes place after a full month of near-total fasting and lasts for five days. During each day of fasting, participants write an entry in a journal detailing their meditations on their weaknesses and ways they can improve. The Feast is opened with a ceremonial parade with attendees dressed in white. At the end of the parade, a massive bonfire is lit and throughout the duration of the feast, people commit their meditation journals to the fire so that the ash can carry their words to the god or gods they worship.</p><p>Many who have made sacred vows choose to reaffirm them during the Feast of Devotion, and others who have reached a new connection to the divine may enter into a new vow as well. See @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.H78vV8M0qsPFxPiR]{Sacred Vows} for more information on these vows and how they can be implemented in your game.</p><h5>Hart’s Flight</h5><p>Hart’s Flight is a festival of competitions aimed at gaining honor with the gods. To commemorate the time the Forestfather (in the form of a great hart) lost a foot race to a folk hero, foot races are held annually with winners being granted a prize. The prize can change from place to place, but it is often something that incorporates the image of a stag, the sigil of the Forestfather, or is composed of antler. While the primary foot race is a large sporting event that draws crowds, oftentimes there are smaller races organized for children or games which designate one child as the hart that all of the other children must attempt to catch or beat to a designated place.</p><h5>Soulseek</h5><p>Soulseek takes place in autumn, when the veil between the worlds of the living and the dead supposedly grows thinner. It is a time when ghosts are said to make appearances to seek vengeance — or absolution. Many people visit the graves of loved ones and leave offerings of the person’s favorite foods or drinks. It is also the prime holiday for necromancers who find their ability to harness the energies of life and death elevated. Offerings of fresh flowers and honeyed wine for the Lord of Death at altars or temples are common, and the living can ask for mercy for souls who have passed. A path of candles is commonly lit leading away from homes and towns to draw spirits towards places of rest and children tell each other stories of ghosts and spirit hauntings.</p><h5>Winter’s Bloom</h5><p>Celebrating a miracle gifted by the Lady of Mercy during a battle long since past, Winter’s Bloom is a time to let go of old grudges. Winter’s Bloom decorations are red and white and potted roses are kept on windowsills or on tables in homes. Temples dedicated to the Lady of Mercy conduct ceremonies that include lighting incense and accepting the prayers of congregants before marking them with the Lady of Mercy’s symbol to cleanse their hearts. People typically celebrate with their families rather than in large groups and parents will speak with children about the importance of releasing anger and bitterness to instead focus on growth and healing.</p><h3>Creating Your Own Holidays</h3><p>When creating your own holidays there’s no real right or wrong way to do it. Traditions manifest over time from a bunch of different sources and are carried across borders and between cultures as a result of groups of people migrating, so they can take many different forms. That said, there are a few guidelines for making a holiday or festival your players will enjoy.</p><h5>Take inspiration from real life</h5><p>There are thousands of cultures over tens of thousands of years to take inspiration from. Read books or articles on folklore or read up on the practices of followers of past gods and cults. You don’t have to re-create real-world holidays, but taking a few elements from one holiday and mashing them with another is a good way to build the foundation for a fun new fantasy holiday.</p><h5>Don’t be afraid to be silly</h5><p>While some holidays are solemn, quiet, and serious, holidays can also be absolutely bonkers! Don’t be afraid to be goofy and have holidays that are primarily just for kids but that child-at-heart adults can enjoy taking part in as well. Remember that legends are sensational and so the stories that get told and things that get practiced to reenact them can be sensational as well.</p><h5>Keep Symbolism in Mind</h5><p>A lot of what makes a holiday are actions that symbolically represent concepts being celebrated. Think about which images, colors, items, or other symbols would be associated with certain deities or domains, and find ways to incorporate these symbols into holiday rituals and practices. A holiday held in reverence to a God of Peace may include releasing white doves and followers of a God of War may carry ceremonial weapons on their deity’s holiday.</p><h5>Your World’s Story</h5><p>If you have already told players stories about gods or heroes in your game, use those stories to establish holidays and festivals! This may sound odd, but you can also establish holidays or festivals based on falsehoods. The players or characters may even know the festival is based on a fake story – such as a holiday centered around a long-forgotten champion’s heroic sacrifice, which the characters have learned never happened – but that doesn’t mean they can’t still enjoy the party. In fact, it can be very fun to have them buy into a celebration they know is based on a lie!</p></div>"

In this section, you’ll find advice and inspiration to aid both players and DMs in how to facilitate common religious rituals and ceremonies.

The more successful checks, the bigger the reward.</p></li></ul><p>Each of the rituals described in this section come with an example scenario to showcase how to do this.</p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Funeral Rites</h3><p>An adventurer’s dangerous life will inevitably involve either the loss of their own life or the lives of friends and companions as they venture into dungeons or fight fearsome dragons. When tragedy happens, it is only natural that a devotee of the gods will perform funeral rites. Below are suggestions for how that could look, tips on how to describe the funeral so it feels special, and guidelines for how you can let a well-performed funeral ceremony provide tangible benefits to the player characters.</p><h5>Funeral Methods</h5><p>There are almost as many funeral rituals as there are deities in the pantheon. The Funeral Methods table holds an assortment of different methods and suggestions for which Divine Domains might be most closely associated with each of them.</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Funeral Methods</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Method</strong></td><td><strong>Divine Domains</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Burial</td><td>Earth, Nature, Plants</td></tr><tr><td>Cremation</td><td>Fire, Light, Magic</td></tr><tr><td>Cryonics</td><td>Magic, Winter</td></tr><tr><td>Dissolution</td><td>Darkness, Death</td></tr><tr><td>Mummification</td><td>Death, Life, Undeath</td></tr><tr><td>Sky Burial</td><td>Light, Sun, Wind</td></tr><tr><td>Tree Burial</td><td>Light, Nature, Plants</td></tr><tr><td>Water Burial</td><td>Travel, Water</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>As if the gods really care about how you’re lain to rest. Trust me, as long as you’re willing to be a slave for all eternity, there’s room for you in whatever celestial jail you want to go to.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Burial.</strong> One of the most common funeral methods is the traditional burial: digging a hole in the ground and placing the deceased within.</p><p><strong>Cremation.</strong> Also common, cremation is when the body is burned. Often, the ashes are scattered after the burial or kept in a vase or other container.</p><p><strong>Cryonics.</strong> In arctic regions – or in a society that has access to magic – encasing the body in ice can be a way to prevent decomposition and even allow others to see the deceased as they looked in life.</p><p><strong>Dissolution.</strong> Like cremation, dissolving the body in acid leaves little – if anything – behind. Not quite as common, this method may be employed specifically to prevent resurrections.</p><p><strong>Mummification.</strong> If preserving the body is a priority (such as to make resurrections easier), special liquids or even magic can delay or halt decomposition.</p><p><strong>Sky Burial.</strong> Most common in mountainous regions and among winged species, a sky burial is when the body is left to decompose as close to the sky as possible, such as on a mountaintop or atop a tall spire.</p><p><strong>Tree Burial.</strong> Almost a compromise between a ground burial and a sky burial, a corpse may also be placed in a tree. This can be because of an affinity with nature (or because the ground is too hard to dig in).</p><p><strong>Water Burial.</strong> This type of burial, where the body is placed in a water vessel and set to sea, or weighed down to be submerged, is popular in coastal cultures.</p></div><h5>Funeral Rituals</h5><p>Traditionally, funeral rites have two goals: to allow the living to say farewell to the deceased and to give the deceased’s spirit the best possible conditions for reaching the afterlife. The funeral can (but doesn’t have to) involve some or all of the following components:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Funeral.</strong> The funeral itself – whether it’s physically placing the body in the ground or freezing it in a block of ice – is at the center of the ritual. This can also include waiting a prescribed amount of time before the funeral or performing acts of anointment or blessings before, during, or after the actual funeral.</p><p><strong>Speech.</strong> One or more characters may deliver a speech for the deceased, remembering who they were in life and offering farewells.</p><p><strong>Prayer.</strong> If the deceased was committed to a certain faith, or the character overseeing the funeral is, they may pray for the deceased’s soul or to ask that the god will accept them in their divine realm.</p><p><strong>Commemoration.</strong> It is also common for participants to commemorate the life of the deceased before or after the funeral – either through subdued conversations, a funeral reception, or even enthusiastic celebration.</p></div><h5>Example Funeral Rites</h5><p>To help facilitate a funeral in your game, you can use the example here as inspiration. See the From Roleplay to Roll-Play sidebar above for more information on how scenarios like these can work.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Aimon bows his head solemnly and closes his eyes. The cleric’s brows are furrowed in pain and frustration as he feels Lycea’s dried blood on his hands. Placing the lithe elf in the shallow hole he’s dug for her, he begins reciting the Lorekeeper’s prayer. Despite his exhaustion, the words tumble from his cracked lips with surprising strength and volume, filling the air around him with a mixture of melancholy and hope for a better tomorrow.</p></blockquote><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Setup.</strong> The party’s close ally, the elf Lycea, has died in combat on an important quest. The party can’t bring her body back to her elven home, so they decide to give her a proper funeral where they are.</p><p><strong>Ritual.</strong> The party’s cleric, Aimon, makes a DC 10 Intelligence (History or Religion) check to see if he knows what funeral ritual Lycea’s people, who worship the Forestfather, would prefer. He succeeds and believes that she would like to be buried and have a tree planted in the soil above her.</p><p><strong>Speech.</strong> The wizard Erina was closest to Lycea and offers a moving speech of farewell in her honor with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check.</p><p><strong>Prayer.</strong> Aimon makes a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check to see if he can recall a prayer to the Forestfather, Lycea’s patron deity, but fails. Instead, Aimon easily recalls a prayer to the Lorekeeper, his patron deity and makes another, successful, DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check to speak it.</p><p><strong>Commemoration.</strong> The party has no time for a celebration in Lycea’s honor, so they skip this check.</p><p><strong>Result.</strong> With three out of four attempted skill checks successful, the party has done enough to warrant a reward; a breeze blows through the area, carrying the vague fragrance of honey and morning dew – Lycea’s scent – and the Forestfather blesses each character in the party with a @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.Vy0G6JFW7QGBAF6l]{Divine Boon of Vitality} that lasts for 24 hours. If the party later recounts to Lycea’s elven kin how they buried her, they may receive a pair of <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.KKWBLKQIWHtcpymp]{boots of elvenkind}</em>.</p></div><h3>Wedding Ceremony</h3><p>Few milestones bring more joy than the joining of two souls in matrimony under the watchful eyes of the gods. Whether the match was made through love or as a matter of convenience, it is typically a cause for celebration. In this section, we have a collection of suggestions for how to craft a marriage ceremony fit for your fantasy world.</p><h5>Wedding Venues</h5><p>The starting point of any wedding ceremony is the venue. Below are three of the most common venues for a wedding in a fantasy setting:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Municipal.</strong> It is not uncommon for a wedding to be held at a courthouse, town hall, or in the city square, followed by a reception with close family and friends.</p><p><strong>Holy Site.</strong> Many weddings are held at or near a holy site and overseen by a priest or other religious authority. Typically, the holy site is one dedicated to a deity representing love and unity, or the deities favored by the betrothed couple.</p><p><strong>Nature.</strong> Also common, a nature wedding ceremony is held outdoors, typically in a garden, forest, beach, mountaintop, or another location of importance to the couple or the faith they most associate with.</p></div><h5>Wedding Traditions</h5><p>Wedding ceremonies are some of the most enduring traditions known to mortals, in part because they commemorate a bond that serves as the foundation of families for generations. Whether a couple is declaring their undying love for one another before the gods or brokering peace to settle a blood feud, the wedding ceremony is bound to include certain traditions.</p><p>Generally speaking, a wedding ceremony can be broken down into four phases: the engagement, the ceremony, the prayer, and the reception. Certain phases may be longer or more involved than others, and in some cases, one or more phases get skipped.</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Engagement.</strong> Some couples exchange gifts or symbolic tokens as part of a formal engagement ceremony that declares their intention to wed one another. These ceremonies can be conducted by the couple or be mediated by a religious authority or the families of the betrothed.</p><p><strong>Ceremony.</strong> This is the big event at the center of the wedding. It typically involves the couple wearing traditional clothes, performing symbolic acts, and speaking certain words to one another. See the Wedding Traditions table for examples of traditions for each of the core @UUID[JournalEntry.QAbImx68KceRTOVF.JournalEntryPage.PiBlBddbRPw4BE0I#divine-domains]{Divine Domains}.</p><p><strong>Prayer.</strong> Once the couple has been joined in marriage, an attendant such as a religious leader, or a family member, often says a small prayer in their honor.</p><p><strong>Reception.</strong> The reception is when the couple meets with loved ones as newlyweds for the first time after the wedding ceremony.</p></div><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Domain Wedding Traditions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Domain</strong></td><td><strong>Tradition</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Chaos</td><td>No rings are exchanged, no ties are bound, and vows embrace the unknowable future.</td></tr><tr><td>Darkness</td><td>The wedding ceremony takes place during a moonless night.</td></tr><tr><td>Death</td><td>The couple climbs into a ceremonial crypt and lie together to symbolize their undying love.</td></tr><tr><td>Fate</td><td>A coin is flipped by the officiant and caught by the couple. If it comes up heads, the couple will be blessed with good fortune in their lives together. Many officiants use a double-headed coin.</td></tr><tr><td>Knowledge</td><td>The couple answers trivia questions to demonstrate how well they know one another.</td></tr><tr><td>Life</td><td>An egg or seed is gifted to the couple upon their engagement and the couple must care for it.</td></tr><tr><td>Light</td><td>The couple burns their clothing in a bonfire before dressing each other in white garments.</td></tr><tr><td>Magic</td><td>Arcane symbols of guidance and protection are painted on the couples – sometimes these are actually magical <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{glyphs of warding}</em>.</td></tr><tr><td>Nature</td><td>The couple is nude or sparsely clothed during the ceremony and crown one another with flowers symbolizing love and resilience and/or mix opposite elements such as fire and water.</td></tr><tr><td>Order</td><td>The wedding ceremony ends with the couple signing a marriage contract, agreement, or license and stamping it with the seal of their new, joined household.</td></tr><tr><td>Peace</td><td>A large blanket made by the loved ones of the couple is wrapped around the pair to keep them safe. In some cases, a magic cloak of protection is gifted.</td></tr><tr><td>War</td><td>The officiant slices the couples’ palms and places them together, binding the couple by blood.</td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Example Wedding Ceremony</h5><p>To help you run a wedding ceremony in your game, you can use the example below as inspiration. See the From Roleplay to Roll-Play sidebar at the top of this page for more information on how scenarios like these work.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>A spring breeze ruffles the leaves overhead and Levi grins as he sees his shirtless beloved shiver. “Don’t start,” Hadair whispers, but Levi sees through his grumpiness as the fighter lifts the crown of snow crocus blooms to place on Levi’s head. “You’re the one who didn’t want to wait until summer,” Levi points out as he pulls his husband in for a kiss while their gathered friends cheer.</p></blockquote><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Setup.</strong> The party’s fighter, the human Levi, wants to be married to the elf Hadair before the party takes off to war against the Army of Darkness. The wedding is held in an outdoor venue, such as a flower-filled garden.</p><p><strong>Engagement.</strong> The party’s cleric, Aleira, makes a DC 10 Intelligence (History or Religion) check to see if she knows how the engagement should proceed. She succeeds and knows that the couple should crown each other with flowers while saying their vows to honor Hadair’s patron deity, the Earthmother.</p><p><strong>Ceremony.</strong> The couple confirms their wish to be betrothed while crowning each other with flowers. Both the cleric Hadair and Levi make DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion or Performance) checks during the ritual – Hadair fails and doesn’t quite find the right words, while Levi succeeds and delivers a passionate wedding vow.</p><p><strong>Prayer.</strong> Aleira makes a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check to see if she can recall a prayer to Levi’s patron deity, the Lady of Mercy, and succeeds.</p><p><strong>Reception.</strong> During the reception, which is a regular party with delicious food and dancing, Hadair’s family wraps the newly wed couple in a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.lvaMqEhfidfHDGf5]{cloak of protection}</em> in reverence of the Lady of Mercy. At some point, the party’s bard, Kallan, decides to perform a song to honor the couple. Unfortunately, the drunken bard fails his DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check and delivers an unforgettably bad performance.</p><p><strong>Result.</strong> With three out of five attempted skill checks successful, the party has done enough to warrant a reward. After the wedding ceremony, each of the characters is blessed with a @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.items.Item.AjqotHgJ7hvZW4jS]{Divine Boon of Fortune} that lasts for 7 days. Pleased with the ceremony, Hadair’s elven kin allow Levi to keep the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.lvaMqEhfidfHDGf5]{cloak of protection}</em> and bring it with him to battle. If you want a more unique type of reward, you could also permit the married couple to use half of their proficiency bonus (rounded down) on checks for skills their spouse is proficient in but they are not.</p></div><h3>Resurrection Ritual</h3><p>Adventurers’ lives are fraught with danger and loss, but when tragedy inevitably strikes, it is only natural for the faithful to seek a way to resurrect their fallen comrades. The risk of dying is an integral part of the tension and excitement of the world’s greatest roleplaying game – no risk, no reward as they say. Yet, as the player characters level up, the risk of dying can end up feeling like little more than a mere inconvenience as the characters learn to hand-wave death with a sprinkle of diamond dust and a 3rd-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify}</em> spell.

Below are some easy-to-follow rules for making resurrection spells less of a sure success:</p><ul><li><p>To successfully resurrect a creature, the character who casts the resurrection spell must make a spellcasting ability check (d20 + proficiency bonus + spell ability modifier) plus the level of the spell against a DC equal to 10 + the character’s level or the creature’s Challenge Rating.</p></li><li><p>If the check fails, the spell and any material components involved in casting it are wasted and the resurrection fails.</p></li><li><p>Whether it succeeds or fails, the DC for resurrecting that creature again permanently increases by 1.</p></li></ul><p>If you combine these alternate rules with the resurrection ritual described in this section, you can have each success in the skill challenge grant a +2 bonus to the resurrection check (and have each failure impose a −2 penalty to the check), or you can decide that an overall successful ritual grants advantage on the resurrection check.</p></blockquote><h5>Resurrection Methods</h5><p>If you decide that a resurrection involves some sort of ritual, aside from the spell used and its material costs, the Domain Resurrection Methods table provides an assortment of different methods a common resurrection ritual can include depending on the faith of either the deceased or the person performing the resurrection.</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Domain Resurrection Methods</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Domain</strong></td><td><strong>Method</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Chaos</td><td>The resurrection must be performed blindfolded.</td></tr><tr><td>Darkness</td><td>The resurrection must be made during the night or under a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.S7VbUetIfVT7B6Eq]{darkness}</em> spell.</td></tr><tr><td>Death</td><td>Another living creature must be sacrificed to fuel the resurrection.</td></tr><tr><td>Fate</td><td>Two coins must be placed on the eyes of the dead and a four leaf clover must be burned.</td></tr><tr><td>Knowledge</td><td>A secret about the deceased must be shared or a story about them must be told.</td></tr><tr><td>Life</td><td>Something living, such as plants or a newborn animal, must be placed on the body.</td></tr><tr><td>Light</td><td>The resurrection must be performed at dawn or under the light of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{daylight}</em> spell.</td></tr><tr><td>Magic</td><td>The resurrection must be performed in a place of arcane power.</td></tr><tr><td>Nature</td><td>The deceased must be covered in foliage, ashes, or soil, or submerged in running water.</td></tr><tr><td>Order</td><td>The ritual must be conducted in a specific order at a specific time of day.</td></tr><tr><td>Peace</td><td>The resurrection must be performed in complete silence.</td></tr><tr><td>War</td><td>The resurrection must be sealed with a sacrifice of blood.</td></tr></tbody></table><h5>Resurrection Traditions</h5><p>A resurrection ritual has a single goal: to give the deceased’s spirit the best conditions for returning to life. This ritual can (but doesn’t have to) involve some or all of the following components:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Spell.</strong> Typically, a high-level spell with a material cost is at the heart of the resurrection ritual. See the Alternate Resurrection Rules sidebar above for rules that make the act of casting a spell of resurrection more challenging.</p><p><strong>Method.</strong> Aside from the spell itself, the resurrection may require certain acts depending on the faith of either the deceased or the creature who is casting the resurrection spell.

Luckily, the party’s cleric knows the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz]{raise dead}</em> spell and has the diamond dust required to cast it.</p><p><strong>Method.</strong> The party’s cleric, Raishoma, makes a DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check to see if she knows what resurrection method Tamit, who followed the Dawnbringer, would prefer. She succeeds and believes that his corpse should be bathed in sunlight while the ritual is performed. As a result, the party waits for the sun to rise the next day.</p><p><strong>Speech.</strong> The party’s ranger, Ashin, was closest to Tamit, and offers a moving speech as the resurrection spell is cast, pleading for Tamit’s soul to return with a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check – which is, unfortunately, a failure.</p><p><strong>Prayer.</strong> Once more, Raishoma makes a DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check to recall a prayer to the Dawnbringer, Tamit’s patron deity. The check fails. Instead, Raishoma recalls a prayer to her own deity, the Lady of Mercy, but bungles the DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check to deliver it.</p><p><strong>Result.***</strong> With only one out of four attempted skill checks successful, the ritual isn’t completely successful. This could impact Raishoma’s resurrection check (see the Alternate Resurrection Rules sidebar above), potentially causing the resurrection to fail, or, the clumsy ritual may spawn forth evil spirits that the characters must destroy before their friend can be fully resurrected (see the @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.VGtnPKF9BD1kVTt3.JournalEntryPage.iShtYUZFWycrF9Pr]{Resurrection} encounter).</p></div><h3>Battle Rite</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>Beholden to the Mountain Mystic – a dwarven god of chaos, secrets, and war – dwarven clans in the north paint their beards in bright colors, scream prayers to their god, and perform a wild dance where they shove and punch each other. “Utterly bestial. Grotesque. Barbaric!” is what the orc king Ynk’rosh the Torturer, had to say about the rite before vacating the battlefield with his army.</p><p>– the Scribe</p></blockquote><p>While battle can occur suddenly and without warning, there are times when adventurers know that they are headed for combat and have time to prepare. When time or circumstance allows for it, a character or party of characters can attempt to perform a battle rite to try to gain the favor of the gods before a battle starts.</p><h5 style=\"clear:none\">Battle Rite Types</h5><p>Battle rites usually fall into one of three categories, although each of these types of battle rites may be performed in concurrence leading up to a battle – or all be part of the same, larger battle rite.</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Communal.</strong> Communal battle rites usually involve larger groups of people and takes time to plan and perform. The ritual typically consists of numerous elements, such as a feast followed by a tribute, which could be a sacrifice or the application of warpaint, and a speech, song, or other type of performance.</p><p><strong>Private.</strong> Exactly what it sounds like, private rituals are meant to be individual commitments between the participant and their god. A private battle rite typically involves meditation, prayer, and a tribute of some sort, such as a sacrifice. In general, this type of battle rite is rewarded only with a minor benefit and only for the individual performing it.</p><p><strong>Intimidation.</strong> The purpose of this type of rite is to intimidate an enemy force with a spectacular display, usually right before a battle begins. These rites often focus on a performance – such as chants, music, or dance – but can also involve other elements, such as sacrificing a captured enemy in tribute to a god, carrying a religious banner on the battlefield, or painting troops with ceremonial symbols in tribute to a god and to strike terror into their foes. It can also help bolster the morale of those who perform it.</p></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Battle rite Rewards &amp; Penalties</p><p>You can reward a well-executed battle rite with a @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.Qm2Avy1SZIVsYsdO]{Divine Boon} or you can concoct your own reward, taking inspiration from the options below. Typically, a reward lasts for 24 hours or for the duration of a single combat encounter.</p><ul><li><p>Advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws against spells and other magical effects, or on saving throws to end or avoid certain conditions.</p></li><li><p>The effects of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8dzaICjGy6mTUaUr]{bless}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3MYDjS6k9IYL0aTj]{calm emotions}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.9eOZDBImVKxbeOyZ]{enhance ability}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ge3Saet9zPTDyaoL]{heroism}</em>, or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{protection from evil and good}</em> spell.</p></li><li><p>A fixed number of d8s that a character can roll and add to the result of any attack roll or saving throw.</p></li><li><p>1d10 + character level temporary hit points.</p></li><li><p>Non-magical weapons are temporarily blessed to function as magical <em>+1 weapons.</em></p></li></ul><p>Below is inspiration for which penalties a group of enemies may suffer from witnessing a successful battle rite meant to shatter their morale:</p><ul><li><p>Disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws to avoid or end certain conditions.</p></li><li><p>The Frightened condition.</p></li><li><p>The effects of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.95K2aUhAGV9qXjnf]{bane}</em> spell.</p></li></ul></blockquote><h5>Battle Rite Elements</h5><p>While battle rites can be as diverse as the gods themselves, they often incorporate at least some of the following elements:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Feast.</strong> Ceremonial food or intoxicants are consumed in a specific order or setting.</p><p><strong>Meditation.</strong> Done privately or as a group, meditation is sometimes used to bring balance to the mind and soul before battle.</p><p><strong>Performance.</strong> Whether used to work up adrenaline, bring the participants into a specific state of mind, or strike terror into their foes, battle rites often involve a performance that combines dance, songs, chants, or displays of physical prowess.</p><p><strong>Prayer.</strong> If the battle rite is dedicated to a specific faith, one or more characters may say an appropriate prayer during various stages of the ritual.</p><p><strong>Speech.</strong> A battle rite often involves speeches, typically delivered by a priest or warrior-leader to motivate the participants and calm their fears.</p><p><strong>Tribute.</strong> Many battle rites involve some sort of tribute to the gods, such as painting religious symbols on equipment or even literal sacrifices.</p></div><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Choosing The Reward</p><p>When deciding how a deity would reward a successful battle rite, balance and flavor are key elements.</p><p><em><strong>Balancing Rewards.</strong></em> It is up to you to choose any reward for a battle rite, and its duration, but as a rule of thumb, it should match the effort put into the ritual at the table, and how successfully the ritual was performed, if you run it as a skill challenge. While a battle rite is meant to provide a tangible benefit, the reward should never be too powerful, lest the party decides they ought to perform one before every combat. Limiting the rewards is especially important when it comes to private rituals that a single character can perform. In general, these rituals should only be rewarded when a character goes out of they way to perform it – i.e., a cleric spending an hour in prayer before a battle might just be considered an everyday activity with no extraordinary benefits.</p><p><em><strong>Flavoring Rewards.</strong></em> Another thing to consider is how each god would reward a successful battle rite. A God of Life may for example reward a communal ritual with temporary hit points, while a God of Magic would be more inclined to grant advantage on saving throws against magic or imbue the participants’ weapons with magical power.</p></blockquote><h5>Example Battle Rite</h5><p>To help guide the player characters through a battle rite, you can use the example below as inspiration. See the @UUID[.7QC5R4BuvoIQpZka]{From Roleplay to Roll-Play} sidebar for more information on how scenarios like these work.</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-phrase\"><p>Ungar’s chest rises and falls in time with the drum as he grits his teeth, putting his tusks on prominent display. He stamps the ground hard, the force of his movements juddering up his legs and making the traditional symbols painted across his thighs and torso twist and contort as he raises his weapon, shouting. The war cry is answered by the people at his back and the beat of the drums pound louder. A stampede of footsteps joins the rhythm as they advance on the enemy, their hearts rising up with whoops and cries, shouting to the gods a promise of blood!</p></blockquote><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Setup.</strong> The party has been tasked with protecting a town from an invading force that will arrive in a few hours. The characters decide to prepare an intimidating battle rite to scare the invaders and bolster the defenders’ morale.</p><p><strong>Tribute.</strong> The party’s fighter, the half-orc Ungar, suggests paying tribute to the Lord of Battle by painting the defenders’ shields with symbols of war, using sheep’s blood as paint. Since the Lord of Battle is Ungar’s patron deity, it isn’t hard for the half-orc to get the symbols right – he succeeds on his DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to paint them.</p><p><strong>Prayer.</strong> The party’s cleric, Eliana, then leads the town’s warriors in prayer before the invading force arrives. Eliana makes a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check and remembers a prayer to the Dawnbringer that might help shore up the defenders’ morale. She then makes a DC 13 Charisma (Performance) check to deliver the speech but fails, and is unable to deliver a truly inspiring speech.</p><p><strong>Performance.</strong> As the invaders come over the horizon, the party’s bard, Petri, makes a DC 13 Charisma (Performance) check while playing a war-drum and leading an ominous chant. He succeeds.</p><p><strong>Speech.</strong> Ungar then steps in and tries to further rile up the chanting townspeople and instill fear in the invading force with a short speech finished with a loud war cry as he leads the charge against the invading force. He makes a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) check and succeeds.</p><p><strong>Result.</strong> With four out of five attempted skill checks successful, the party has done enough to warrant a reward. A suitable reward could be to have each of the invaders be subjected to the Frightened condition for 1 minute, but allowing them to a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></div></div>"

          "name": "Sacrifice",
          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h1\">Sacrifice</p><p>Sacrifices have played a significant role in many religions, and the act of offering something valuable to a deity in the hopes of gaining its favor is a common theme throughout history. In a fantasy setting, sacrifices can be used as a way to deepen a character’s connection to their faith, create moments of tension, or provide tangible rewards and blessings, at a cost. While a sacrifice may be a ritual unto itself, and involve specific actions or prayers, sacrifices are also often components in other religious rituals, such as a battle rite or a resurrection ritual.</p><h3>Types of Sacrifice</h3><p>Broadly speaking there are three types of sacrifices:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Blood Sacrifice.</strong> The offering of life and all of the power contained therein, blood sacrifices are often used as a sign of sincerity to seal prayers, oaths, and rituals. Anything from a pinprick to several liters of blood may be needed, depending on what is being asked for (and which deity it is being asked of).</p><p><strong>Material Sacrifice.</strong> Be it expensive liquor poured on a grave, rare incenses burned, or the dust of precious gemstones, material sacrifices are quite common. They may be symbolic in nature, seen as tokens or gestures by mortals to gods who have no need of material things, but may also be highly valuable.</p><p><strong>Spiritual Sacrifice.</strong> The sacrifice of one’s skills, ego, or ideals to appease the will of a god, spiritual sacrifices often demand a person prove their dedication by giving up something that defines them.</p></div><h5>Sacrifice Examples</h5><p>Below are different types of sacrifices a character might make and suggested mechanical consequences. Often, the consequences of a sacrifice – such as an expended spell slot or a level of Exhaustion – is felt for 24 hours, but the consequences may be felt for longer, at your discretion. Some sacrifices, such as sacrificing an object of value or a soul, are typically permanent.</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Ability.</strong> One of the character’s ability scores is reduced by 1 or more.</p><p><strong>Feature.</strong> The character loses the ability to use a feat or class feature.</p><p><strong>Hope.</strong> The character gives up hope, suffering disadvantage on Constitution, Wisdom, and death saving throws.</p><p><strong>Knowledge.</strong> The character loses proficiency in one or more skills, tools, or saving throws.</p><p><strong>Life.</strong> The life of the character or another creature.</p><p><strong>Magic.</strong> The character expends a spell slot.</p><p><strong>Memory.</strong> The character loses a fond or useful memory.</p><p><strong>Soul.</strong> The character surrenders their soul. When they die, the deity this sacrifice was made to claims their soul and they can’t be resurrected by any means short of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{wish}</em> spell.</p><p><strong>Value.</strong> The character gives up an object or a magic item of practical or sentimental value.</p><p><strong>Strength.</strong> The character suffers disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks and saving throws.</p><p><strong>Vitality.</strong> The character suffers one or more levels of Exhaustion or spends one or more Hit Dice, and their hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount.</p></div><h3>The Nature of Sacrifice</h3><p>While the type of sacrifice that is made and the prayers and methods involved may vary, there are some common features that characterize most sacrifices.</p><h5>Has to matter</h5><p>The point of a sacrifice is to give up something in exchange for getting something in return – and doing so should never feel easy. For a sacrifice to be meaningful, and thus be worthy of divine reward, it has to be something that matters to the character.</p><h5>An Equal Exchange</h5><p>As a rule of thumb, you should think of a sacrifice as an equal exchange. While gods can, in theory, fulfill any request and grant any type of blessing for any amount of time, it works best if the reward corresponds somewhat to the value of the sacrifice that was made.</p><p>For example, sacrificing one’s own soul to the Lord of Death in exchange for having a deceased comrade be resurrected could be considered an equal trade. If a character is only willing to sacrifice something lesser, such as gaining a level of Exhaustion, it may only be enough to reduce the cost of the required material components of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO]{resurrection}</em> spell, or to gain advantage on the resurrection check (see the @UUID[.7QC5R4BuvoIQpZka#resurrection-ritual]{Alternate Resurrection Rules} sidebar).</p><blockquote class=\"hgdd-info\"><p class=\"rift\">Spontaneous Sacrifice</p><p>While a sacrifice is often planned in advance, it doesn’t have to be so. In a dire situation, a character may call upon their deity of choice for help – promising to repay their debt with a sacrifice in the future. At your discretion, such a request may immediately grant the benefits of the sacrifice that was promised – but should be followed up with a @UUID[.EPJvW6wAPOGaCQjh]{Divine Punishment}, if the character decides not to make the sacrifice in the future.</p></blockquote><h5>A Relevant Offering</h5><p>Just as different gods favor different behaviors, they also prefer different sacrifices. An ardent follower of a specific deity may know exactly what an ideal sacrifice to their patron deity would be, but otherwise, you can have a character make an Intelligence (Religion) check with a DC of 10 to see if they can determine the type of sacrifice that would be favored by the god(s) the party is trying to appeal to.</p><p>The Domain Sacrifices table provides suggestions for the types of sacrifices that are thematically associated with each of the core @UUID[JournalEntry.QAbImx68KceRTOVF.JournalEntryPage.PiBlBddbRPw4BE0I#divine-domains]{Divine Domains}.</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Domain Sacrifices</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Domain</strong></td><td><strong>Sacrifice</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Chaos</td><td>Prefers sacrifices that may foster chaos, such as giving up navigation tools, a crucial memory, proficiency in Wisdom saving throws, or the Survival skill.</td></tr><tr><td>Darkness</td><td>Life, hope, and vitality sacrifices are valued highly, as are material sacrifices of sources of light and items made of silver.</td></tr><tr><td>Death</td><td>Appreciates life, soul, and vitality sacrifices, but also other sacrifices, such as the memory of a deceased friend or material sacrifices of objects such as medic kits and healing potions.</td></tr><tr><td>Fate</td><td>Appreciates sacrifices of material objects, such as gold, gemstones, and lucky charms.</td></tr><tr><td>Knowledge</td><td>Sacrifices of treasured memories or secrets are valued highly, as are sacrifices of objects such as tools, books, and poetry – though not if it means the knowledge within is lost forever.</td></tr><tr><td>Life</td><td>Strength or vitality sacrifices are preferred, as they are seen as giving one’s life force for another.</td></tr><tr><td>Light</td><td>Prefers sacrifices of material objects, including sources of light or rare incenses.

          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h1\">Faith or Fact?</p><p>In contrast to the real world, the DM gets to ultimately decide whether the divine really exists, and whether mortals can base their beliefs on faith or fact. Whether divinity is definite, assumed, or dubious is likely to have an impact on how widely, how fervently, and for which reasons mortals worship.</p><h3>Definite Divinity</h3><p>Imagine a world where you know, with absolute certainty, that the gods exist. Not only do you know, but everyone around you knows as well. It’s a cold, hard fact. Not only do you know that the gods exist, but you have also seen them invest mortals with power. In such a world, it’s quite likely that you would feel encouraged to pray to your deity of choice when the situation calls for it. It’s also likely that you would avoid doing anything that might provoke the gods’ ire.</p><p>Assuming that religion in your world is represented by a pantheon of deities that clearly and irrefutably exist and wield divine power, this is the world your characters live in. In such a world, it is not hard to see why most folk would worship and revere the gods.</p><h3>Assumed or Dubious Divinity</h3><p>In a world where nobody truly knows whether the gods are real, devotion is a matter of faith. Because mortals need to interpret and define deities on their own, there may be vast differences in how the divine is worshiped, if it is even worshiped at all.</p><p>If your world has clerics and others who wield divine power, it may be hard to see how their powers wouldn’t be definite proof that the divine exists. But if there’s no direct communication with gods, even the cleric can’t be certain where their power comes from – for all they know, it may not come from the gods at all.</p><h3>Motivations for Worship</h3><p>At its core, there are typically three main reasons mortals devote themselves to the gods: power, love, and fear or desire. Below is a quick explanation of each of these reasons, which can often overlap.</p><h5>Power</h5><p>Worship can grant power to mortals in several ways. Sometimes it can be indirectly, as becoming a priest may make you a leader in your community and give you sway over others. In a world where the gods can imbue their followers with divine magic, worship can also more directly empower the individual.</p><p>In the latter example, where gods are real and grant divine power to their most fervent worshipers, it’s usually more complicated than just asking a deity for divine power. Unless you decide otherwise, most gods prefer to only grant power to those who embody their divine tenets and worship them for “the right reasons.” The Lord of Battle may see a mortal who worships them only to gain strength in battle as worthy, but it is less likely that the Lady of Mercy will see fit to grant an arrogant and selfish mortal divine power just because they say the right things.</p><p>Thus, while the pursuit of power can certainly be a reason for mortals to worship the gods, it is rarely the only reason.</p><h5>Love</h5><p>One of the strongest motivations for worship is love, adoration, and gratitude. For many mortals, the kinship they feel with the ideals of their preferred deity or deities is enough to inspire devotion.</p><p>The ranger prays to the Earthmother not because they expect something in return, but because they see the god as a creator and nourisher that is worthy of love. Likewise, a retired soldier prays to the Lady of Mercy because they realized they vastly prefer peace to war, and the sage may offer fealty to the Lorekeeper because they wholeheartedly agree with the god’s tenets of disseminating and preserving knowledge.</p><p>Love is typically the purest motivation and thus also the one that is most likely to be rewarded with divine favors (much to the dismay of those who worship for power), at least when it comes to deities that put any stock in love and adoration. That also means that in a world where the gods truly exist, the most powerful members of a god’s clergy may actually be the mortals who most embody the god’s ideals and worship it most selflessly.</p><h5>Fear or Desire</h5><p>Probably the most common motivations for worship are fear and desire. These motivations are bundled together because they mostly represent the same thing: worshiping to make something happen or to avoid something happening.</p><p>The farmer who sacrifices to the Earthmother at the end of summer does so because they want a good harvest – and because they fear that if they don’t worship correctly, the harvest will fail. The same is the case for the rogue who offers a prayer to the Lady Luck before attempting to disarm the trap or the warrior who prays to the Lord of Battle for courage.</p><p>In a world where the gods exist for certain, this form of worship is likely even more frequent and universal. It would make sense for most mortals to offer at least a quick word of favor to any deity related to whatever challenge is in front of them.</p></div>"

          "text": "<div class=\"hgdd-text\"><p class=\"hgdd-h1\">Defining Devotion</p><p>Just as much as divinity is about the gods, it is also about the mortals who are devoted to them – and how the mortals congregate and worship. In this section, you’ll find an examination of the roles religion can play in society in a fantasy setting, and how your players can engage with divinity in your world.</p><h3>Religion’s Role</h3><p>In a fantasy world where the gods are known (or at least widely believed) to exist, organized religion is likely to play a large part in how society functions, as it assumes some or all of the following roles:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Worship.</strong> Religion can provide a way for people to worship and show reverence to their preferred gods. Even if multiple gods exist, people have personal preferences and beliefs about which gods they want to worship.</p><p><strong>Community.</strong> Religion provides a sense of community and belonging to its followers. It is a way for people with similar beliefs and values to come together and share their experiences and knowledge, or get support during difficult times.</p><p><strong>Rituals.</strong> Religion provides a set of rituals, ceremonies, and traditions that its followers practice to worship their deity.</p><p><strong>Power.</strong> Religion can also provide power and legitimacy to its leaders and followers and shape cultural norms and societal values. In some societies, religious leaders may have significant influence.</p></div><h3>Religious Organizations</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>One can make the argument that it isn’t the gods themselves – at least not the “good” ones – that are the issue, it’s mortals who misinterpret and corrupt their tenets for their own gain. There’s certainly some truth to that – few things are more dangerous than a persuasive divine message in the hands of a ruthless, power-hungry mortal with a devoted following.</p><p>– the Heretic</p></blockquote><p>Religions often require organization to manage worship gatherings, sermons, holidays, and the upkeep of temples and shrines. A religious organization can represent an entire religion – i.e., every cleric or paladin who draws power from the Lorekeeper is a member of the Keepers of Knowledge – or it can be more akin to a cult or a sect, where the organization represents just one of many ways to worship a particular deity or set of deities. Regardless of what the specific organization’s purpose and form is, there are some common traits that define nearly all religious organizations – and which you may want to consider when describing them:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Tenets.</strong> At the center of most religious organizations is a set of principles or tangible tenets that guide how worship is practiced and which ideals are upheld as most important. While the specifics of how a ceremony or holiday is held can vary from region to region, the core tenets of a religious organization are typically the same everywhere.</p><p><strong>Hierarchy.</strong> Some religious organizations are led by a single individual such as a high priest or a prophet, while others may have multiple tiers of leadership, including acolytes, priests, deacons, and so on. Each of these may have diverging ideas of the best direction for the religion. The leadership may be determined by merit, seniority, or divine appointment, with a deity directly overseeing the religion through an avatar – or there may be no central leadership guiding the organization at all.</p><p><strong>Presence.</strong> As soon as devotion becomes a communal endeavor, it also begins to establish a presence in society. In some cases, members of a religious organization proudly display holy symbols or wear specific clothing or build majestic temples where devotees can gather to worship. Other religions may have less of a physical presence and be more subtly embedded in the views and code of conduct of the organization’s members, such as a clan of warriors who follow a certain creed based on their faith.</p><p><strong>Resources.</strong> Depending on the size and presence of a religion, it must obtain funding and other resources, which can include donations from followers, tithes or offerings, grants from the government or wealthy benefactors, or management of land, agriculture, and other types of business. A religion may also have vast resources at its disposal in the form of skilled labor, soldiers, or divine magic. Some religions may also require their followers to undertake quests as a form of worship – and to gather wealth or objects of interest for the organization.</p></div><h3>Religion &amp; Power</h3><p>Religion and politics are often closely intertwined, with religious organizations playing a significant role in the political power structure. Below is a quick rundown of the three archetypal ways religion and government coexists:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Theocratic Rule.</strong> In a theocratic rule, religious leaders hold the highest positions of political power, and the government is based on religious law and principles.</p><p><strong>Secular Rule.</strong> In a system with secular rule, religion is separate from political power, and religious organizations, ostensibly, do not involve themselves in politics and governance.</p><p><strong>Mix of Power.</strong> In between a theocratic and secular rule is a mix where religions may hold positions of political power or have significant influence over political decision-making through their support of the ruling system. On the other hand, the political system may also be able to influence religious organizations and beliefs, for example by favoring some religious organizations over others.</p></div><p>These examples are not set in stone and can be adjusted. A theocratic rule devoted to a specific deity may still allow the worship of other deities and even take advice from a council of representatives from other religious organizations. Likewise, even in secular rule, religious organizations may still be able to influence decision-making, simply because they represent a vast number of people or have vast resources at their disposal.</p><h3>Religion &amp; Law</h3><p>Whether a democratic city-state or a monarchy ruled by a single individual, rules and laws govern almost every society. While fleshing out a legal system for a fantasy setting can feel like a daunting task, it can become much easier by using religion as a guideline. Every religion – whether dedicated to one or more deities – is centered around a set of moral and ethical values, a certain notion of what’s believed to be right and wrong – which can often be converted into actual laws with relative ease.</p><p>Religion may literally be the law in some societies, but even if religious organizations have no sway over a society’s laws and rules, the fact that a large group of people there has certain moral values derived from their faith can be helpful when determining which laws would exist. In a society where the Lady of Mercy is the most important, capital punishment would likely not exist. Likewise, a society beholden to the Trickster probably has very different, and much less strict, laws than a society where the Lawbringer is the dominant god.</p><h3>Religion &amp; Conflict</h3><blockquote class=\"hgdd-quote\"><p>I’ve read accounts of a nation far to the south, where seven faiths take turns governing the nation for 1 year. A splendid example of how religious organizations can cooperate and share power, but also – or so the accounts say – quite frustrating, especially for the populace, as laws and policies are constantly being written and rewritten One year, begging is a crime – the next year, it’s criminal to not freely giving to the poor what they ask for!</p><p>– the Scribe</p></blockquote><p>If you have a vast pantheon of different gods, it’s likely that religious organizations coexist side by side within the same societies. Conflicts between – or within – religious organizations, which may vary from peaceful debates to holy wars, typically happen for at least one of the following reasons:</p><div class=\"neg-indent\"><p><strong>Domains.</strong> It’s only natural that followers of one deity may clash with the followers of another deity whose ideals are vastly different. Most of the core @UUID[JournalEntry.QAbImx68KceRTOVF.JournalEntryPage.PiBlBddbRPw4BE0I#divine-domains]{Divine Domains} have natural counterparts – life versus death, light versus darkness, and so on – that can lay the basis for such conflicts.</p><p><strong>Political Power.</strong> Like any other type of organization, different religions may also clash as they struggle for political power. Even in a theocratic rule where the dominant religious organization has banned the worship of other deities, the suppressed religious organizations may be working in the shadows to overthrow the religious tyranny.</p><p><strong>Internal Strife.</strong> A religious organization – especially one that is dedicated to more than one god – may have internal disputes. While this could be limited to philosophical disagreements on the interpretation of certain tenets, it could also turn into a violent conflict about the direction of the religion as a whole. @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.FlfoZuqH3ZHOJ72z.JournalEntryPage.7VNTgA0wUkWAJiMT]{The Shattered Sun} and @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.FlfoZuqH3ZHOJ72z.JournalEntryPage.8RUeLQZ0sCKVKfDU]{Spear of Peace} sects in @UUID[Compendium.heretics-guide-to-devotion-and-divinity.journals.JournalEntry.icWq2MV3bOu6RTFa]{Chapter 4: Divine Agents} are good examples of how internal strife can manifest and what it looks like.</p></div></div>"
