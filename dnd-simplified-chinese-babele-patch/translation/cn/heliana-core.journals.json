But this isn’t just a weapon capable of crushing a wyvern’s skull, it also contains… information. I know what you’re thinking: “Heliana, you don’t read books; you spend hours futilely trying to move immovable rods and develop as-yet-undiscovered muscles.” Well, you’re not wrong. I get Peeper, my faithful companion and scribe of this here tome, to read books to me. Those immovable rods aren’t going to not move themselves.</em></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><em>Information can be deadly. And it can be useful. Did you know the Ravenous Slugblatter Beast of Sraal thinks that if you can’t see it, it can’t see you? That could save your life. As my favourite bard quartet, Fume Against The Construct, says: Know Thy Enemy!</em></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Sidebar_Quote-Last-Signoff\">— Heliana, Immover of Rods</p></blockquote><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\">While the lack of any bladed edges prevents this book from being used to carve up a critter, it will teach you how!

Monster names (“a <strong class=\"Bold\">roper</strong>”), dice calculations (“<strong class=\"Bold\">1d6 + 3 </strong>fire damage”), check modifiers (“<strong class=\"Bold\">+7</strong> to hit”), conditions that are being applied (“fall <strong class=\"Bold\">prone</strong>”), and areas &amp; distances (“a <strong class=\"Bold\">30-foot cone</strong>”) are bolded.

Checks and saving throws use a <span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">coloured bold </span>format. Saving throws are always fully bolded (“<span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</span>”), while only the DC, ability, and skill is bolded for checks (“<span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">DC 15 Strength (Persuasion) </span>check”).</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Language. </span>The content herein is written in British English. Prepare yourselves for the <i class=\"Italic-8\">colourful armour of paralysing</i>, for referring to ‘the party’ as interchangeably 3rd-person singular (“the party has been killed”) and plural (“the party are in trouble”), and archaic language like “wont”, “whilst” &amp; “amongst”. Where items and creatures have established names, like <i class=\"Italic-8\">armor of invulnerability </i>or a <strong class=\"Bold\">gray ooze</strong>, those remain unchanged.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Non-standard Ability Checks. </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">Heliana’s Guide </i>breaks from the standard association of abilities and skills, allowing you to be creative in how you mix and match them. For example, Intimidation is usually a Charisma check. However, if a character states that they break a femur with their bare hands to scare a bandit, you might ask for a<span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\"> Strength (Intimidation) </span>check. All this requires the player to do is make a Strength check and, if they have proficiency in Intimidation, add their proficiency bonus to the result.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\">Tool proficiencies are referenced just like skill proficiencies: a <span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">Strength (smith’s tools) </span>check means that you must make a Strength check and, if you have proficiency in smith’s tools, add your proficiency bonus to the result.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\">If something, perhaps a magic item, says that you gain “<strong class=\"Bold\">advantage </strong>on <span class=\"None\">Stealth</span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\"> </span>checks”, this means that you gain advantage on all checks that use the Stealth skill, regardless of which ability is used. When checks use the word ‘or’, this indicates either skill/tool or ability can be used in any combination. For example, a <span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">Dexterity or Strength (Athletics or</span> <span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">woodcarver’s tools) </span>check means you can use any one of the four check permutations: <span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">Strength (Athletics)</span>, <span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">Dexterity (Athletics)</span>, <span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">Strength (woodcarver’s tools)</span>, or <span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">Dexterity (woodcarver’s tools)</span>.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Combined Checks. </span>Combined checks involve one or more creatures making two or more checks, and combining the results. For example, a Harvesting check is the combined result of a Carving check and an Assessment check (see Chapter 4). A roll of 20 on the d20 is never an automatic success on checks for Tracking, Harvesting, and Crafting.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Optional Rules. </span>Some people like detailed rulesets, while others like them streamlined. Optional rules, like volatile components, add risk to your game by allowing a dragon’s <i class=\"Italic-8\">breath sac</i> to explode during harvesting. Others, like harvesting supplies, suit survival-type games, where players must watch their encumbrance and contend with limited supplies. By introducing or removing the optional rule sets, you remain in control of how your game flows.</p>"

          "text": "<p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\">The adventures in this book are referred to as hunts. They’re a type of adventure in which you find clues, prepare for the fight ahead, and then have a big battle. These hunts, as well as the random encounters, are all runnable at a variety of different average party levels (APLs), listed in the hunt’s introduction. Each hunt uses the following structure:</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-4\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Introduction. </strong>The name and level of the hunt, as well as a brief synopsis.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-4\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Background. </strong>The information the GM needs to know about why a monster needs to be hunted! This includes:</p><ul style=\"margin-left:1rem\"><li><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-6-Bullets-Inset\">A summary of the monster</p></li><li><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-6-Bullets-Inset\">Three quest hooks: curiosity, morality, and compensation</p></li><li><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-6-Bullets-Inset\">Monetary and XP rewards</p></li><li><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-6-Bullets-Inset\">Brief biographies of key NPCs</p></li></ul><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-4\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Location. </strong>The location the hunt takes place, sometimes containing descriptions of unique flora and fauna or on how to use the Tracking rules to find the monster.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-4\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Know Thy Enemy. </strong>Clues about the monster that, if discovered by the player characters, help them prepare for the battle.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-4\"><strong class=\"Bold\">The Battle Ahead. </strong>The creature’s lair actions, any environmental effects, the composition of each wave, and the trigger for moving between waves.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-4\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Aftermath. </strong>This section wraps up each quest hook of the hunt and suggests ways this story can continue and shape your world.

In this book, it is a little <i class=\"Italic-8\">more</i> inevitable than usual, especially if your party doesn’t pick up on the clues and prepare accordingly.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\">If you have fewer than four player characters or a lower APL than that for which the hunt is balanced, consider lowering the difficulty. This can be achieved by removing some creatures, replacing them with lower CR versions, or using the ‘Helping Hand’ paragraphs within each hunt to reduce the difficulty. The hunts’ boss fights are designed to use a party’s entire resources for a day’s adventuring, which exceeds the daily XP budget at higher levels.</p><h5 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-5--Table-\"><span class=\"None\">Average Daily XP Budget per Hunt</span></h5><table id=\"table001\" class=\"Basic-Table\" style=\"text-align:center\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Level</strong></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Daily XP Budget Used per Hunt</strong></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures\">1-4</p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"Left-Align\">100%</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures\">5-10</p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"Left-Align\">130%</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures\">11-16</p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"Left-Align\">160%</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures\">17-20</p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><span class=\"Left-Align\">200%</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Clues. </span>Each hunt contains at least three clues that can be conveyed to the players before combat starts. Understanding the clues is the key to your players preparing for the fight ahead and feeling empowered when their prep pays off. Every clue has at least one example of how you can convey the information to your players. Note, these are examples! It’s still up to you as the GM to make any necessary changes to the story and roleplay interactions to make sure your players understand these clues.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\">Be obvious when delivering clues. The more you can repeat and illustrate a clue, the more the players will understand it. In addition, prompting the adventurers to summarise what they’ve learnt by using an NPC to ask questions can engender a much-needed dialogue between players. Furthermore, player characters need time to prepare in a way that allows them to meaningfully act on the clues. It is often both enjoyable and less deadly for players to take a long rest to recover resources, prepare spells, and design a plan that exploits a monster’s weaknesses. Be sure to give them the opportunity to prepare!</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Variable Statistics. </span>To ensure the challenge is maintained across differing levels of play, you’ll see references to <span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">VDC </span>(variable DC), <strong class=\"Bold\">Vmod</strong> (variable modifier), and <strong class=\"Bold\">Vdam </strong>(variable damage).

And, of course, for the more daring adventurers, a horde of monsters in need of slayin’! Fancy yourself a hunter? Ready to do the research, find the clues, and prepare for battle against fearsome foes? No? Well, have a firewhiskey and then let me ask you again…</p><p>— Heliana, Director of the Monster Hunting Guild</p></blockquote><p>The Loot Tavern: a bastion of tax-free alcohol, a hub for monster hunters, and the venue of the annual danceathon extraordinaire. This section details the lore, characters, and services offered by the Loot Tavern, an inn perched on an island that drifts through the Astral Plane. This chapter details how this adventuring hub can be used to offer the amenities required by the new harvesting, crafting, and cooking rules presented in this book. In addition, by using Heliana as a questgiver, you can stitch the hunts together into a single story arc. The chapter concludes with new rules for drunkenness.</p><h1>No Fixed Address</h1><p><span class=\"None\">Drifting through the myriad nebulous bodies of the Astral Plane, the Loot Tavern is a sanctuary for adventurers, astral-farers, and vagabonds alike. Its exact origins are unknown, but when Lutecia saw the listing in The Cosmic Times, she persuaded her adventuring pals, Humperdink, L’Arsène, and Heliana to invest in the venture. Atop the magically-warded rock, a grandiose, multi-tiered tavern was constructed. With spaces for each of the friends’ endeavours, the edifice also contains a transient number of guest rooms that appear, clean and furnished, as and when needed.</span></p><section class=\"sidebar right\"><h3><span class=\"None\">Tavern Tales</span></h3><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Sidebar_Sidebar-Para-Last\"><span class=\"None\">On one of their adventuring forays, L’Arsène and Heliana found themselves trapped in The Low. In a desperate attempt to escape, the pair created a makeshift pub: Rock Bottoms Up. Brewing a noxious and not-particularly pleasant beverage from local mushrooms, the pair waited until a group of passing deep gnomes stopped for a lunchtime whistle-wetter. As soon as money changed hands, Heliana and L’Arsène dashed out of the bone-and-canvas tent, downed their </span><span class=\"Italic\">port ale</span><span class=\"None\">, and stepped back through— to the safety of the Astral Plane. Rumours still abound of a group of deep gnomes seeking compensation for food poisoning at the hands of an unscrupulous orc and a scruffy racoon.</span></p></section><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Arriving.</span><span class=\"None\"> Getting to the Loot Tavern can be achieved from any plane of existence with only two requirements. The first is a tavern; the second, an indigo-hued beverage known as </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">port ale</i><span class=\"None\">. A creature that steps through the door of a tavern within </span><strong class=\"Bold\">1 minute</strong><span class=\"None\"> of imbibing the beverage is transported to the exterior of the Loot Tavern. How the </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">port ale </i><span class=\"None\">ends up in the players’ hands is up to the GM: perhaps Heliana hears of the adventurers and sends them a bottle. Maybe a black market dealer sells it to the party as a ‘quick getaway’ potion. Or maybe the party finds a recipe detailing how to craft it!</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Leaving.</span><span class=\"None\"> One does not simply walk through the garden portal to leave the tavern, not if you want to end up somewhere specific. The tavern’s portal is a permanent </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV]{teleport} </i><span class=\"None\">spell, with a twist. This is one of the tavern’s unique selling points that contributes to its continued commercial success.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">One must first imbibe a specific combination of drinks, known as a teleportation flight, to have any chance of arriving at a desired location. After consuming this flight, a group of creatures uses the ‘Very Familiar’ row of the spell’s table when determining the accuracy of the destination. A creature that walks through the portal without having consumed a beverage since it last finished a long rest is teleported to a random location on a random plane.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">For example, drinking a </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">cosmopolitan</i><span class=\"None\">, a </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">muskroe mule</i><span class=\"None\">, and a </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">piney colada</i><span class=\"None\">, a combination that represents urban, arctic, and forest biomes, respectively, directs the portal to teleport a creature to a city in the tundra. See the services offered at Lut’s bar on @UUID[.SYL5pIQ7KHwZtVWM]{1 Lut's Bar} for more info.</span></p><h1>The Tavern's Tenants</h1><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/Tamer_Tournament-Background-Loot_Tavern_WEBP.webp\"><p><span class=\"None\">Although many faces frequent the tavern, there are some characters that are almost guaranteed to be present. Its four proprietors, Heliana, Humperdink, L’Arsène, and Lutecia; the bouncer, Granny Weathertax; Heliana’s faithful scribe, Peeper; the tavern’s cat, Feviline; the resident bard, Cacophonics; and the oft-teased adventuring group, the Fearsome Five (a.k.a. Fearful Five). This section looks at those characters, providing tips on roleplaying the characters in the form of behavioural traits, motives, values, secrets, and stories linking the various tenants. The NPC summary sections throughout this chapter provide guidance on how to roleplay the tavern’s various staff members and regulars.</span></p>"

This hotel, the Hallow’s Inn, bears a dark secret: once you enter the inn, you can’t leave except for one day a year, the year of its anniversary: Hallow’s Eve.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Sidebar_Sidebar-Para\"><span class=\"None\">However, the inn also holds innumerable treasures, the flotsam of travellers that found themselves stuck in this undead-infested lodge. For this reason, Hallow’s Eve attracts all manner of adventurers keen to get their hands on this treasure and escape the hotel’s clutches before the curse prevents them from leaving. A dungeon delver that does not manage to escape becomes a prisoner of the inn and must survive its hallways that crawl with the unliving for an entire year.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Sidebar_Sidebar-Para-Last\"><span class=\"None\">It was here, on Hallow’s Eve, that Heliana first met L’Arsène, who had become trapped in the inn’s larder (and decided to take a well-earned nap). Showing his ingenuity, L’Arsène crafted Heliana an armoured ballgown, whose pleats rattled with scythes of sharpened steel. With devastating pirouettes, Heliana cut her way through hordes of zombies, L’Arsène trotting along in her bloody wake. And thus, when brains met brawn, a lasting friendship was born!</span></p></section><p><span class=\"None\">Heliana is a hard-headed LN half-orc hunter in her late thirties. She rises early in the morning for callisthenics workouts, often running around the tavern with great, thumping footsteps, much to Humperdink and Lutecia’s chagrin. She has an extraordinary metabolism, which is responsible for her chiselled physique and propensity to become hangry. Luckily, both Peeper, and Heliana’s partner, a female golynn named Amber, have a steady supply of monster jerky to deal with this. For the purposes of combat, she is a barbarian, with a few levels in tamer.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Motives &amp; Values.</span><span class=\"None\"> After one-too-many close calls, Heliana has learnt to always be prepared, and now values knowledge as much as brute force. She can often be heard saying “Know thy enemy!” to adventurers that take one of her monster hunting contracts. For her, a monster hunt can only be successful if she knows enough about her quarry to prepare the relevant magical meals, learn the monster’s weaknesses, and equip herself with efficacious spells. Beyond all else, Heliana fears bureaucracy; paperwork, taxes, and contracts are eternal sources of terror.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Secret.</span><span class=\"None\"> Instead of releasing her old companions into the wild, Heliana has an extra-dimensional room in the tavern, accessed via a secret door. She can’t and won’t let them go, despite Amber’s chastising looks.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Interpersonal Relations.</span><span class=\"None\"> Here are some tidbits of information you can use to flesh out Heliana’s relationship with the other tenants:</span></p><ol><li class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-3-Bullets\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Granny Weathertax</strong><span class=\"None\"> is revered by Heliana as a beacon of honour and a masterful sensei of hand-to-hand fighting.</span></li><li class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-3-Bullets\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Humperdink</strong><span class=\"None\"> is Heliana’s enabler when it comes to her familiar addiction.</span></li><li class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-3-Bullets\"><strong class=\"Bold\">L’Arsène</strong><span class=\"None\"> and Heliana have been in many close encounters.

Legend says the Pale Aleomancers, led by famous brewer Jan Smyth, titrated themselves to reach the perfect level of drunkenness. In the short time thereafter, conflicts between long-warring nations were resolved, a universal healthcare system was established that delivered free care at the point of need, and the eternal question of why the gobboc crossed the road was answered. To celebrate their achievement, they finished their pint. In the slightly-more-inebriated aftermath, all their hard work was undone and the world descended into chaos once more.

Drunkenness is measured in six levels.

Finally, you choose a DC based on how likely their suggestion is to succeed.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Sidebar_Sidebar-Para\">On a failed check, the party has a hostile encounter. On a successful one, they have a narrative encounter, or no encounter at all (GM’s choice). You can use the @UUID[.gM53N2BSTOFWVMbE]{random encounter} tables to help randomly select the encounters.

Increasing either of these parameters increases the difficulty of the tracking experience. The minimum number of checks represents a combination of the distance the party has to traverse and the density of possible encounters; a greater distance or a more populated area requires more checks. The number of successes represents how difficult it is for a creature or location to be found, or for terrain to be safely traversed. The minimum number of checks can never be less than the number of successes required.</p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">Determining Checks and Successes</span></h4><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">You can </span>determine how many Tracking checks a journey requires in the following way.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-4\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Step 1: Areas.</span><span class=\"None\"> Separate the journey into related areas.

Encounters include both interesting environmental features and the presence of friendly or unfriendly creatures. Assign a number of Tracking checks to each area (minimum 1), with 1 representing a very low chance of an encounter and 5 extremely frequent encounters.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-4\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Step 3: Successes.</span><span class=\"None\"> Assign a number of Tracking successes (minimum 0) required to reach the next destination.

As the hostile encounters are balanced to be very deadly, you should consider running them one or more levels lower than your average party level (APL).</p></section><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Duration.</span> A Tracking check can encapsulate any period of time from a minute to a month and is up to the GM to interpret. The more encounters the GM envisions the party experiencing in a given time, the shorter the duration each check should take. Sequential Tracking checks can even take different amounts of time from one another.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\">For example, in a vast and open expanse, such as crossing a desert bereft of life, a single Tracking check might represent 30 days’ travel. In a particularly hostile environment, such as an ancient battlefield filled with undead, encounters might occur frequently and each Tracking check might represent 1 hour of searching. In a densely packed urban chase scene, a single Tracking check might take only 1 minute!</p>"

However, if a character states that they chase a wolf pack across 10 miles of snowy terrain, you might ask for a <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\">[[/check ability=constitution skill=athletics]]</span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\"> </span>check. All this requires the player to do is make a Constitution check and, if they have proficiency in Athletics, add their proficiency bonus to the result.</p><p>When checks in this book use the word ‘or’, this indicates either skill/tool or ability can be used in any combination. For example, <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\">[[/check str intimidation]]{Strength}</span> or <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\">[[/check cha intimidation]]{Charisma (Intimidation)}</span> means the player can choose to make either a Strength or Charisma check and, if they have proficiency in the Intimidation skill, add their proficiency bonus. A <span class=\"heliana-core Checks-and-Saves\">Strength or Dexterity (Athletics or woodcarver’s tools)</span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\"> </span>check means you can use any one of the four check permutations: [[/check strength athletics]], [[/check dexterity athletics]], [[/tool strength woodcarver]], or [[/tool dexterity woodcarver]].</p></section><p>This part of the tracking mechanics throws the narrative element of the game back to your players (which can be a fun dynamic shift!). You ask them how they’re approaching the tracking process and work with them to choose an ability and skill (or tool) for the Tracking check. Then you decide an appropriate DC for the check based on how likely the player’s proposition is to succeed.

Their remit was to protect travellers, hunt monsters, and maintain the lodgings that provided much-needed shelter in the depths of the wildlands. For a brief period, a golden age of flowing information and bountiful wealth bloomed. Before long, however, nefarious elements rose to the highest echelons of the organisation and subverted its once-noble goals.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">Gaia’s Hearth had tamed the monsters. Gaia’s Hearth had mapped the terrain. Gaia’s Hearth had the ability to turn a bodyguarding job into a full-blown protection racket. For years thereafter, the re-named ‘Gaia’s Teeth’ plagued the wildlands, fragmenting the once-thriving and interconnected communities into mistrusting and fortified towns.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">As is often the case when individuals vie for power, Gaia’s Teeth devolved into bandit gangs run by brutish and cunning warchiefs. Pockets of these morally-defunct outcasts can still be found roaming the wilds, flying their banner of a world with teeth, and pillaging the innocent and defenceless. It is rare that such warchiefs ever aid one another or leave their preferred habitats.</span></p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">The Fathomless</span></h4><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">In sunken caves and briny depths, followers of the Fathomless drink salt water and plot to bring about the drowning of the world. Lured by the prospect of great power, the cult’s followers perform rituals beseeching the Great Deep One for power and attempting to create portals to the endless oceans of the Plane of Water.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Mutation.</span><span class=\"None\"> Those that receive the Great Deep One’s blessing have their physiology altered; gills, webbed digits, and fish-like skin are often associated with the cult’s leadership. In fact, those that naturally have such morphological features are regarded as the ‘Deep One’s Chosen’ and tend to progress through the hierarchy more quickly. Followers of the cult have taken to altering their appearance through the magic of biomancy in order to gain more piscine appearances and raise their station in preparation for The Great Flood.</span></p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">The Lost Sphinx</span></h4><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">Sunny is a genderfluid, CN </span><strong class=\"Bold\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.nEC1BRwM8Lx9hLXW]{Androsphinx}</strong><span class=\"None\"> </span><span class=\"Squeeze_99-\">who uses any pronouns, often to the confusion of those that try to describe them. Magical experiments in his lair have untethered him from the normal flow of time and space. Accordingly, she always acts like she’s met the party before; from their point of view, they have!

For example, “Autumn”, “High noon”, and “Three days before my birthday” are all correct answers for “When am I?”. “Where am I?” could be answered by “To my left”, “The northern hemisphere”, or “In my personal space”. As is their riddling habit, Sunny always asks a third, more complex riddle. If all three questions can be answered correctly within </span><strong>[[/roll 2d6]]</strong> <span class=\"None\">minutes (after which Sunny disappears), he rewards the party with a small gift.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Quest Solution.</span><span class=\"None\"> To become tethered to the normal dimensions, Sunny needs an object from their lair.

Closer inspection reveals that the reflections of the party members are… odd. The reflections move out of sync with the party, carry no items, and wear only basic clothing. The reflections attempt to communicate with them; they can’t speak, but gesture and beckon, as if asking to be given something.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">The reflections are a form of extra-dimensional storage.

The cosy interior is richly furnished with beds and warm furs.

A successful </span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">VDC</span><span class=\"None\"> </span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\"><strong>[[/check int investigation format=long]]</strong></span> <span class=\"None\">check reveals a hidden cellar, which contains an empty pile of clothes and the diary of the igloo’s owner. The diary details a slow descent into paranoia and fear of the outside world, until the writer’s pen strokes deteriorate to faint scribbles before ending entirely.</span></p><p><span class=\"None\">A creature that takes a short rest inside the igloo gains the maximum number of hit points for each Hit Die it spends to regain hit points at the end of the rest, and a creature that takes a long rest inside of the igloo regains all its Hit Dice, instead of half. When a creature finishes a rest in the igloo, it must succeed on a </span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">VDC <strong>[[/save wis format=long]]</strong></span><span class=\"None\"> or be <strong>&amp;reference[frightened]</strong> of everything outside the igloo for as many hours as the creature spent resting.</span></p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">5 Frigid Waterfall of Meditation</span></h4><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">In a hillier part of the tundra, the party comes across a rushing waterfall that pours into an icy lake. A shirtless silver dragonborn (LN male </span><strong class=\"Bold\">monk</strong><span class=\"None\">) sits cross-legged on a large flat stone beneath the cascade. This is Sterly, a meditative and faintly condescending hermit. He explains that meditating under the waterfall can help one attain focus and spiritual enlightenment… if they can stand the cold.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">A creature that tries to meditate under the waterfall for at least </span><strong class=\"Bold\">1 minute</strong><span class=\"None\"> takes <strong>[[/roll 1d6 cold]]</strong> damage and must make a </span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">VDC <strong>[[/save con format=long]]</strong></span><span class=\"None\">. On a success, the creature gains temporary enlightenment, gaining </span><strong class=\"Bold\">advantage</strong><span class=\"None\"> on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws until they finish a short or long rest. This meditation can be attempted multiple times, repeating the damage and save for each attempt.</span></p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">6 Lost Sphinx: Arctic</span></h4><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">Sunny, the time-travelling sphinx (see @UUID[.UiP2561OK7HZqgDO]{Recurring Encounters}), appears before the party, muttering about how she should’ve taken a left turn at the North Pole.

They cautiously offer the party a seat by the fire and a share of their food—though they would prefer if the group left their weapons at least a few yards away. If the party is polite and nice, Finch eventually opens up, telling stories about some of their best hunts, and even offers to sell preserved monster components to the party. At the end of the meal, Finch offers advice on whatever the party is tracking, granting </span><strong class=\"Bold\">advantage</strong><span class=\"None\"> on the next Tracking check the party makes.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">If attacked or threatened, Finch gives up their wares as a bribe before fleeing, knowing they’re outnumbered.

When the sun sets, this Spirit Market awakens; dozens of ghosts appear, bringing with them an assortment of very real merchandise with which to stock their shops. A few living shoppers arrive, already aware of the market’s existence and keen to partake of its cheap prices: all items purchased at the Spirit Market cost half their usual price.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">The market sells all sorts of useful and unusual magic items. However, there’s a catch—their magical properties don’t function in sunlight (GM’s discretion whether this is divulged).

A remarkable menagerie of predators and prey—lions, gazelles, hyenas, and buffalo—exist side-by-side, unbothered by each other’s presence and making no attempt to eat one another.

They move fast, and prefer to use their tamed creatures as mounts to get in and out quickly, outpacing any pursuers. Acquiring new mounts is of great interest to them, sometimes more so than gold. They gladly let the party pass if offered a gold tithe equal to 20 times the APL in gold pieces, and flee if half their number are killed.</span></p><table id=\"table051\"

A successful </span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">[[/check int inv dc=14 format=long]]</span><span class=\"None\"> reveals a leather sack in a hidden alcove. It contains gold and gems worth 70 times the APL in gold pieces, and several pamphlets extolling the virtues of the many-headed dragon queen. It’s free for the taking, as the cave is clearly long abandoned—though it’s possible the original owners may come looking for it some day.</span></p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">6 Golynn Trader</span></h4><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">The party comes across Adelaide (NG female golynn </span><strong class=\"Bold\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc]{Noble}</strong><span class=\"None\">) riding on the back of a muscular, tame brown bear. She is a talkative, elderly trader and she carries an absurdly large, overstuffed pack. Adelaide attempts to sell her wares to the party, which include explorer’s packs, </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of Healing}</i><span class=\"None\">, hand-carved wooden trinkets, and any uncommon magic items the GM sees fit to include.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Memorable. </span><span class=\"None\">She initially sells everything at a slightly inflated price; however, if the whole party listens to her verbose, rambling stories about the adventures of her fifteen great-grandkids, she will cut them a deal and sell at normal prices. For a true test of the players’ patience and memory, the GM can create a list of fifteen names, recite them all, and, if the players can remember them a couple of minutes later, have Adelaide reward them with a generous discount!</span></p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">7 The Fast and The Fury of The Small</span></h4><p><span class=\"None\">Stationary on a wide, meandering trail through the hills are two donkey-drawn carts. The right-hand cart is occupied by a pair of playfully bickering goblins—the jovial Glambog (CG male </span><strong class=\"Bold\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.TjWQOgI3A4UAl7lC]{Goblin}</strong><span class=\"None\"> and pedantic Hambog (NG male </span><strong class=\"Bold\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.TjWQOgI3A4UAl7lC]{Goblin}</strong><span class=\"None\">)—while the left-hand cart is empty. Glambog silences Hambog as the party approaches and challenges the party to a race down a half-mile-long stretch of road. If the party accepts, they choose two characters to board the empty cart. To race, one rider makes a </span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">[[/tool dexterity land format=long]] (Land Vehicles)</span><span class=\"None\"> to steer the cart while the other makes a </span><span class=\"Checks-and-Saves\">[[/check wis per format=long]]</span><span class=\"None\"> to spot obstacles. The highest result of the party’s checks is contested by the highest result of the goblins’ checks. The goblins have </span><strong>Vmod</strong><span class=\"None\"> modifiers to these checks. Repeat this contest three times.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Consequences.</span><span class=\"None\"> If the party loses all three contests, their cart crashes and each rider takes </span><strong class=\"Bold\">[[/damage 2d6 bludgeoning]]</strong><span class=\"None\"> damage; in addition, the goblins demand payment of 15 gp from the party so they can repair their damaged cart. If the party loses only two contests, they lose the race—to the jeers of Glambog and Hambog—but suffer no other consequences. If the party wins at least two contests, they win the race, and the goblins offer to provide the party a home-cooked meal. If the party accepts, they eat well that day. If the party wins all three contests, the goblins offer to escort them through secret paths on the carts, reducing the minimum number of Tracking checks required to reach the destination by 1.</span></p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">8 Statue Circle</span></h4><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">The party comes across a circle of seven 15-foot-tall stone statues of hill dwarves. Each holds both a weapon and a tool for navigation—an astrolabe, compass, map, sandglass, sextant, spyglass, and sundial. The statues are old and weathered, and look as if they’ve been there for a very long time. In the centre of the circle is a large marble plinth, littered with carvings of constellations, and the following message written in Dwarvish:</span></p><blockquote><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Riddle-me-this\"><span class=\"None\">“Rest, weary traveller, and let the spirits of the Great Wayfinders guide you.”</span></p></blockquote><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"None\">If the party takes a short or long rest within the circle, the next Tracking check is made with </span><strong class=\"Bold\">advantage</strong><span class=\"None\">.

For example, you might decide that a severely damaged aboleth can only yield 1 eye and 1 tentacle, rather than its usual bounty.

A creature finishes harvesting a component if it meets the Harvest DC for that component in the harvest list.

Below are ideas to help you describe how harvesting might look when performed on different creature types.</p><p><em><strong>Arcana: Aberration, Elemental, and Fey.</strong></em> These creatures are so wild and magical that only knowledge fostered by the study of the arcane can help preserve and store them. Figuring out which bits do what is part and parcel of dealing with these evolutionarily unique creatures.</p><p><em><strong>Investigation: Constructs.</strong></em> Whether fleshy or made of stone and metal, these things were made ‘by hand’ and can thus be unmade in the same way. Loosening screws, picking apart stitching, and deciphering how to correctly disassemble these creatures results in neat piles of undamaged goods.</p><p><em><strong>Medicine: Giants, Humanoids, and Undead.</strong></em> Dissecting a humanoid is just like surgery; sharp tools and deft movements sever muscle from bone. While most humanoids yield little in the way of magical components, the flesh of giants is infused with the primordial elements themselves. Most undead yield&nbsp;materials similar to humanoids, albeit that these components have been magically enhanced by necromantic magic and are way smellier.</p><p><em><strong>Nature: Oozes and Plants.</strong></em> Harvesting plants is second nature to any green-fingered folk—pruning, combing roots, and skinning bark. Once an ooze has been defeated, gathering the few components it yields has much in common with collecting naturally occurring moulds, fungi, and primordial slimes.</p><p><em><strong>Religion: Celestials and Fiends.</strong></em> The souls of celestials and fiends alike return to their home planes to find new forms upon death. For this reason, knowing the correct religious practices can recall shreds of their soul into the ashes they leave behind. However, to fully harvest such creatures, they must be slain on their home plane, or killed within a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.y8A4HfTwd93ypdEz]{magic circle}.</p><p><em><strong>Survival: Beasts, Dragons, and Monstrosities.</strong></em> Don’t ever say this to a dragon, but when it comes to internal anatomy, they’re not that different from beasts and monstrosities. Although beasts tend to yield the least innately magical components, a dragon is descaled in an almost identical manner to a crocodile or medusa.</p></section><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Ritual Carving.</span><span class=\"None\"> For some creature types, magical rituals can be performed instead of getting elbow-deep in grisly viscera. When making a Carving check to harvest an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, a carving harvester with a spellcasting ability can make the Carving check using that ability instead of Dexterity.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Spells and Buffs.</span><span class=\"None\"> For a spell or magical effect to</span><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"> </span><span class=\"None\">have any influence on the outcome of harvesting, it must affect a harvester for the entire duration of the Harvesting check (see Creature Size and Harvest Time table in @UUID[.FjNUqa1xJBnORq5y]{Duration &amp; Degradation}).

This includes temporary vulnerability imposed by spells or other magical effects. Damage types to which a creature is resistant aren’t considered destructive damage types for that creature. Resistance trumps vulnerability; if a creature has both vulnerability and resistance to a damage type, then it isn’t considered a destructive damage type for that creature. Damage types to which a creature is immune are moot as the creature can’t take this damage.</span></p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">Damage Quantity</span></h4><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">There are two options for deciding how much damage of a destructive type is enough to ruin components: the killing blow (simplified method) and the percentage of hit points (detailed method).

However, sometimes harvesters get lucky. If a creature rolls a ‘natural 20’ on one of its checks to gather a mundane ingredient, consider awarding it something more valuable: a gemstone, a nugget of amber, or a rare truffle with a value in gold pieces equal to ten times the player’s level.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Material Value &amp; Rarity.</span><span class=\"None\"> Silver, gold, platinum, adamantine, mithral, silk, spidersilk, exotic woods, and xyxlwood are rarer, more valuable ingredients that can be found in the wilds.

          "text": "<p><span class=\"None\">Despite an adventurer’s best efforts, they’re probably going to end up with one or two pieces of nonmagical gear. Someone needs to make those items, and the following manufacturing rules put that power in the players’ hands. To manufacture a mundane item, a creature needs three things: materials, a tool, and time. In some cases, at the GM’s discretion, a creature might also need auxiliary equipment. Let’s take a longsword as an example.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Materials &amp; Cost.</span><span class=\"None\"> </span>As a rule of thumb, the material cost of an item is one-third of its purchase value. Thus a 15-gp longsword requires 5 gp of raw materials. The GM has great latitude in deciding what these mundane materials might be. The tables below summarise the material cost of different mundane items.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\">Potion and spell scroll bases are unique in that there is no base item to compare the material cost to. The cost of these magic items’ nonmagical materials is 2 gp and 3 gp, respectively.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Optional Rule: Difficult Materials.</span><span class=\"None\"> </span><span class=\"Squeeze_97-\">Some materials are harder to work with than others. For example, dragon scales are especially tough, requiring leatherworkers to employ advanced techniques. When using a difficult or unusual material in the manufacture of an item, the GM can add </span><strong class=\"Bold\">+5 </strong><span class=\"Squeeze_97-\">to the DC. Examples of this might include armour made of bark, monster hide, or dragon scales; weapons made of bone or silver; and anything made of mithral or adamantine.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Abilities &amp; Tools.</span><span class=\"None\"> Manufacturing an item requires a tool. The tool required depends on the item’s type. The GM has great latitude in deciding if a tool is applicable or not, and has the final say on the tool required for any item. In addition, different tools require different abilities to use them. Some tools, like carpenter’s tools, grant a choice of abilities, much like how finesse weapons let you choose Strength or Dexterity when making an attack roll. See the table below for a breakdown of tools, abilities, and item types.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Tool Proficiency. </span>Proficiency with a tool isn’t necessary to attempt a Crafting check that requires that tool. If a character does not have the required proficiency, it can still make the check, albeit with <strong class=\"Bold\">disadvantage</strong><span class=\"None\">. At the GM’s discretion, this disadvantage can be avoided if the character </span>receives guidance from a book or a creature with the requisite proficiency.</p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Difficulty &amp; Flavour.</span><span class=\"None\"> Mundane items have a manufacturing DC associated with their item type; the more complex the item, the higher the DC. See the @UUID[.Ynq9RWIiRIwykZAK#manufacturing-dc-and-time]{Manufacturing DC &amp; Time} table for the full breakdown.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Check. </span>To manufacture an item, a creature must gather the required equipment, materials, and tools, and spend the requisite time crafting the item. This time need not be continuous. At the end of the crafting time, a creature <span class=\"Squeeze_97-\">makes a Manufacturing check using proficiency with the appropriate tool</span>.

rarer essence than required for a particular item, the item gains the rarity of the essence used, affecting the time and DC required to make it (see below). For example, if you make a </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.EJVaAvNfCq6gn6VG]{helm of telepathy}</i><span class=\"None\"> using a </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">robust essence</i><span class=\"None\">, it would be rare instead of uncommon, requiring 80 hours instead of 20 hours to craft. At the GM’s discretion, the power of the item can be increased accordingly, perhaps by increasing the DC of the saving throws to match the new rarity (from DC 13 to 15), or even adding other effects.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Difficulty &amp; Time.</span><span class=\"None\"> The DC and time required for the enchanting check depend on the rarity of the magic item being crafted and whether or not it has attunement; the rarer the item, the more difficult and time consuming it is to craft. This is broken down in the Enchanting Rarity, DC, and Time table above. Enchanting doesn’t have to be done all in one go—a typical enchanter might only work for 8 hours each day.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Spell Scrolls.</span><span class=\"None\"> Spell scrolls are unique in that the creature crafting the spell scroll also needs to know the spell they are crafting. For wizards, this means having the spell in their spellbook; for bards, rangers, sorcerers, tamers, and warlocks, this means having the spell in their list of known spells; and for clerics, druids, and paladins, this means any spell in their list.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\">Skills.</span><span class=\"None\"> As with harvesting, the skill associated with the enchanting check depends on the creature’s type.

Instead, several crafters can form a team that takes turns at crafting an item. While a single enchanter might work for 8 hours a day, a team of three can alternate shifts to work a continuous 24-hour cycle, reducing the number of days it takes for an item to be finished. For example, three enchanters working sequentially could fulfill the 40-hour requirement for a </span><i class=\"Italic-8\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.bcv7J9culilK68zp]{+2 longsword}</i><span class=\"None\"> in exactly 40 hours, a little under two days.

For each boon or flaw an item has, additively increase or decrease its value by 10%, respectively. A flame tongue longsword with 3 manufacturing boons (+30%) and 2 enchanting flaws (-20%) would cost 10% more, overall. Note: commissioning an item is a gamble; the cost a character pays doesn’t change if the item ends up with quirks.

The exceptions for this are manufacturing flaws with results of 1-10: Handiwork, Fragile, and Unwieldy. If the Handiwork flaw is rolled more than once, the effects are cumulative (-1/-2/-3 penalty). If the Fragile or Unwieldy flaws are rolled more than once, the number on the d20 required to trigger the associated effect increases by 1 for each subsequent iteration of the flaw. For example, a longsword with 3 Fragile flaws would break on an attack roll of 1, 2, or 3.</span></p><h5 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-5--Table-\"><span class=\"None\">Manufacturing Flaws</span></h5><table id=\"table145\" class=\"Basic-Table\"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures\"><strong class=\"Bold\">[[/r 1d20]]</strong></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Flaw</strong></p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Item types</strong></p></td></tr><tr class=\"Basic-Table\"><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures\">1-6</p></td><td class=\"Basic-Table\"><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Tables_Tables-and-Figures-Left-Align\"><strong class=\"Bold\">Poor/Shoddy/Abysmal Handiwork. </strong>This item is not well made.

But, if you accept this contract, you will explore virgin lands, you will track ghastly monsters, and you will harvest rare components. And then... then, we’ll drink. </p><p>— Heliana, Recruiter and Theatre Enthusiast</p></blockquote><p>This book introduces several new themes to 5th edition: tracking, harvesting, crafting, cooking, and the magical school of biomancy. The classes and feats presented in this chapter each expand on those themes, allowing your players to better integrate themselves into the world you build using this book.</p><p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Tracking.</strong></em> The @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.dvsiXoo6BaYLyguv]{cleric’s hunt domain} and the @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.AOj4V2OcP2Exszhe]{trapper ranger} both revolve around finding and pursuing prey. You can think of the hunt domain cleric as a full caster version of a ranger that expands on the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.0xmXiPiuYws1OGcX]{hunter’s mark}</em> spell to focus a party’s attention on a single enemy. The trapper’s strength is in preparation; their ability to set and conceal traps rewards parties that plan their ambushes ahead of time!</p><p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Harvesting, Crafting, &amp; Cooking.</strong></em> The college of @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.3Af1SiqbBlkPawBQ]{cuisine bard} and @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.hnUtZNxtA8FzBnUq]{oath of the harvest paladin} play on the theme of supporting your party through food and sustenance. The bard interacts directly with this book’s cooking mechanics, allowing you to add additional effects to magical food. The paladin focuses on the time between combats, enhancing the nourishment their allies receive to better prepare them for the challenges ahead.</p><p><em><strong>Biomancy.</strong></em> The circle of the @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.LvfTmSROTsefxNAu]{hive druid} and @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.oLTw0n59FmXOHxgw]{parasite warlock} both derive their unique powers from symbioses with other organisms. From enhanced senses to natural defences, these symbiotes are invested in their host’s survival, allowing for innovative roleplaying opportunities. The @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.9R0aPfrKmLO03mlU]{skinshifter sorcerer}, @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.GYWOqI1yy9FjUaMj]{splicer tamer}, and school of @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.oJoqCAHCPYP1dqWZ]{biomancy wizard} all change their (or in the case of the tamer, their companion’s) biology to best suit the obstacles they face. Where the tamer and wizard pick and choose their abilities ahead of time, the sorcerer gains adaptations with unpredictable consequences. All of these classes draw from new spells contained in the Spells compendium.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Monster Tamer.</strong></em> The tamer class relies on their companions like no other class in 5th edition. Without a companion, a tamer has few ways of dealing damage. They are a support class whose ally-augmenting abilities are enhanced when they focus on their own companions. The subclasses achieve this in a variety of ways: @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.5kazvv1NLEkEm8Fb]{the infuser} through elemental enhancements, @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.GOE2aWpPt5W8xIXP]{the leader} with bard-like encouragement, @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.GYWOqI1yy9FjUaMj]{the splicer} through biomantic alterations, and @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.kYyi9EH8SBM69APt]{the necromancer} with hordes of living dead.</p><p class=\"p1\">A tamer’s strength lies in the variety of companions it can accumulate; no one companion is likely to ever be as powerful as a player character. However, this is hardly a weakness when you consider the breadth of abilities a roster of up to six companions has at its disposal.</p>"

A couple of drops of unique blood and he’ll be able to make you a companion unlike all the others </span><span class=\"No-Break\">out there</span><span class=\"None\">.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Sidebar_Quote-Last-Signoff\"><span class=\"None\">— Heliana, Doesn’t Have A Problem</span></p></blockquote><h3 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-3\"><span class=\"None\">Find-a-Friend</span></h3><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">This section details new familiars that can be crafted from the remains of the unique boss monsters found in this book, as well as other, exotic creatures. Using any of the creature’s components, Humperdink, Loot Tavern’s resident Warlock and Biomancer, can craft a new, smaller, cuter creature. While generally friendlier than their monstrous counterparts, these familiars often also have annoyingly adorable flaws.</span></p><h3 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-3\"><span class=\"None\">Crafting Familiars</span></h3><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">To craft a familiar, Humperdink (or another biomancer) needs one of the unique monster’s components, a drop of the player character’s blood, and a fee equal to 20 times the player character’s level in gold pieces. After 24 hours, the familiar is crafted and is immediately bonded to the character from whom the blood was donated. When that character casts the </span><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{Find Familiar}</em><span class=\"None\"> spell, they can choose this crafted familiar instead of one of the normal options.</span></p><h3 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-3\"><span class=\"None\">Bespoke Companions</span></h3><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">These crafted familiars are primed to be trained by monster tamers (see @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.AdhKjscGYHBmfaap]{Tamer}). A creature crafted in this way can be tamed by its bonded tamer without requiring an ability check. Upon being tamed, the creature can no longer be summoned by the </span><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{Find Familiar}</em><i class=\"Italic-8\"> </i><span class=\"None\">spell and becomes a bespoke companion.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Shared Resilience.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"Squeeze_98-\">When a crafted familiar becomes a companion, it gains the ‘Bonus Tamer Improvement’ listed in its section without requiring the tamer to spend one of its improvements. Furthermore, as a tamer increases in power, its link to its bespoke companions emboldens them. When a character reaches 3rd, 5th, 11th, or 17th level in the tamer class, each of its bespoke companions gain 1 additional Hit Die. Each time this happens, the companion’s hit point maximum increases by a roll of the Hit Die plus the companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). These increases are also applied retroactively, should the tamer gain a bespoke companion after they have reached these levels.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Bespoke Improvements.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">These crafted creatures gain new ways to benefit from the improvements granted by a tamer’s Monster Trainer feature. When a tamer gains a level, they can choose to grant these creatures an improvement from the creature-specific options listed in their familiar’s monster trainer section instead of the normal ones available to all creatures tamed by a tamer.</span></p><h4 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-4\"><span class=\"None\">Pact of the Chain</span></h4><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-1\"><span class=\"None\">If you’re using a bespoke familiar as the familiar for a warlock’s Pact of the Chain, you might want to make it slightly more powerful so that it compares with the other availbale options. To do so, simply give it an extra three Hit Dice (and adjust its hit points accordingly), the 1st-level improvement on its skill tree, and your choice of one of the 3rd-level improvements.</span></p><h3><span class=\"None\">Foundry VTT Note</span></h3><p>To find all these familiars you will need to import the hunts they come in.</p><p>Aboling - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-shadow-of-the-broodmother.Adventure.nOkO7Ho6h1NcodGy]{Shadow of the Broodmother}</p><p>Dragonling - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-reign-of-iron.Adventure.urfoCHT13ZsUr8LY]{Reign of Iron}</p><p>Gelatinooze - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-gelatinous-polyhedrooze.Adventure.T3U7fquqUkB4mi6Z]{Polyhedrooze}</p><p>Hyphan - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-the-veiled-lady.Adventure.7sKWL0zcZHgDsrk7]{The Veiled Lady}</p><p>Mechakobold - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-mecha-koboldzilla.Adventure.hYXe27dOi2fRo7Y1]{Mecha Koboldzilla}</p><p>Minimic - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-dread-and-breakfast.Adventure.WwxJ2xyqsJwgw8hA]{Dread and Breakfast}</p><p>Peeper - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-dream-weaver.Adventure.p6IxJuq6n1PsMBjA]{Dream Weaver}</p><p>Rakitten - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-a-tale-of-two-tails.Adventure.f3rnyfpaUgsuxHqz]{A Tale of Two Tails}</p><p>Sunsnacker - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-the-shining-shrine.Adventure.ClNaP7AAZ6sn9Dkb]{The Shining Shrine}</p><p>Tarling - @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.adventure-heliana-tarchaeology.Adventure.2LqiX8NdIuqKE8Sj]{Tarchaeology}</p><h2 class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Titles_Title-2\"><span class=\"None\">Aboling</span></h2><img src=\"modules/heliana-core/assets/images/familiars/Heliana%20v1.09%20-%20Familiar%20-%20Aboling_result.webp\"><blockquote><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Sidebar_Quote\"><span class=\"None\">A little bit of ze aboleth’s knowledge lives on in ze aboling’s biomantic code.

Perhaps it was emotionally traumatising, or perhaps it was simply a mere inconvenience.</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p class=\"p2\">You can make a tamer by following this suggestion: Choose Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma to be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.</p><blockquote><h2>Optional Rule: Multiclassing</h2><p>If using the optional rule on multiclassing, use the following prerequisites, proficiencies, and spell slots if you choose the tamer as one of your classes.</p><p>Ability Score Minimum: As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you’re already a tamer.

This addendum, <em>Humperdink’s Biomancy Boutique</em>, delivers the seven extra familiars unlocked as part of the stretch goals for the <em>Heliana’s Guide to Monster Hunting</em> Kickstarter campaign. The familiars are listed alphabetically, and their bespoke improvements are listed first by level, then alphabetically.</p><h3>Crafting Familiars</h3><p class=\"p3\">To craft a familiar, Humperdink (or another biomancer) needs one of the unique monster’s components, a drop of theplayer character’s blood, and a fee equal to 20 times the player character’s level in gold pieces. After 24 hours, the familiar is crafted and is immediately bonded to the character from whom the blood was donated. When that character casts the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{Find Familiar}</em> spell, they can choose this crafted familiar instead of one of the normal options.</p><h3>Bespoke Companions</h3><p class=\"p3\">These crafted familiars are primed to be trained by monster tamers (<em>Heliana’s Guide</em>, @UUID[Compendium.heliana-core.journals.JournalEntry.14Ex7C0XPOFuBv2o.JournalEntryPage.AdhKjscGYHBmfaap]{Tamer}). A creature crafted in this way can be tamed by its bonded tamer without requiring an ability check. Upon being tamed, the creature can no longer be summoned by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JGT5bNqu9REL7Fuz]{Find Familiar}</em> spell and becomes a bespoke companion.</p><p><em><strong>Shared Resilience.</strong></em> When a crafted familiar becomes a companion, it gains the ‘Bonus Tamer Improvement’ listed in its section without requiring the tamer to spend one of its improvements. Furthermore, as a tamer increases in power, its link to its bespoke companions emboldens them. When a character reaches 3rd, 5th, 11th, or 17th level in the tamer class, each of its bespoke companions gain 1 additional Hit Die. Each time this happens, the companion’s hit point maximum increases by a roll of the Hit Die plus the companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). These increases are also applied retroactively, should the tamer gain a bespoke companion after they have reached these levels.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Bespoke Improvements.</strong></em> These crafted creatures gain new ways to benefit from the improvements granted by a tamer’s Monster Trainer feature. When a tamer gains a level, they can choose to grant these creatures an improvement from the creature-specific options listed in their familiar’s monster trainer section instead of the normal ones available to all creatures tamed by a tamer.</p>"
