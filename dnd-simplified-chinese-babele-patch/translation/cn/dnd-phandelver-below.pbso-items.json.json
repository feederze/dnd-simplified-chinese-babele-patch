Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.</p><p>Whenever it expands, the mudslick tower merges with any natural stone it touches, awkwardly tipping and wedging itself to touch as much natural stone as it can.</p><p>The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action.

While merged with natural stone, the mudslick tower has immunity to all damage. Only a wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower).

In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge called the Forge of Spells, where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby town of Phandalin prospered as well. But disaster struck when bandits swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.</p><p>A powerful bandit force reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and knowledge of the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.</p></blockquote>",

If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.</p>\n      <hr /><h3>Tongues (Level 3)</h3>\n      \n      <hr /><p>This spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands what it says.</p><hr />\n      <h3>Scroll Details</h3><hr />\n<p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make a DC 13 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.</p>\n<p>The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Save DC</strong>: 15<br /><strong>Attack Bonus</strong>: +7.</p>\n<p>A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p>",
