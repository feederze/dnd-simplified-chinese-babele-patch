      "description": "<p><em>Cunning Corsairs</em></p><p>Traversing the seas can be a dangerous venture where even the most skilled seafarer can be overwhelmed by a sudden violent tempest, ambushed by deadly creatures that lurk beneath the waves, or waylaid by pirates, raiders, and privateers. Life asea is hardly for the faint of heart, and even merchant vessels travel well-manned and well-armed to resist any potential threats.</p><p>Corsair ships often navigate into and out of well- known shipping lanes, raiding unsuspecting and ill- prepared vessels. Nimble and swift upon the waves, such ships are low profile, rigged with sky blue sails by day or dark grey by night to avoid detection by keen sailor eyes. At times, the only hint of a corsair ship among the waves in the distance is their wooden masts, often overlooked by all but the most observant lookouts perched in a crow’s nest. Corsair ships are crewed by fearless buccaneers also known as the pirata.</p><p>The pirata are often lured into pirating through a combination of fear and greed. Some sought escape from scrounging a meager living working in the docks of coastal port cities and took up with a pirata crew that smuggled their way ashore into the rowdier, less law-abiding taverns that litter the docks, others were skilled sailors taken captive from previous corsair raids and given the choice of service or a swift watery grave, and others still chose pirating for the lure of plunder and freedom from the law.</p><p>Regardless of their motivation for pursuing the path of piracy, pirata are eccentric and suspicious unless their senses are lost to a bottle of rum. They are suspicious of anyone not of their crew, never trusting their ill-gained spoils to a bank or lender but rather choosing to spend as soon as they can trade or sell their plunder. Many corsairs choose to spend lavishly when ashore; what they cannot spend is often invested in gold jewelry, golden teeth, or a fine new rapier or sabre.</p><p>Despite their suspicious nature, corsairs tend to be quick-witted and engaging with those they come across ashore. At times they will take on passengers seeking covert passage or take to smuggling if their raiding of shipping lanes becomes too risky. In these cases, those bartering with a corsair will find them difficult negotiators, and their prices steep.</p><p><strong>Agile and Fearless Combatant.</strong> The nature of their work naturally selects for individuals who are both fearless and reckless. Corsairs recklessly charge into battle, be it on a boarded ship or in a tavern brawl, with no regard for their own safety. Perhaps their time raiding at sea has given them an uncanny sense of balance, as they are surefooted and not easily unbalanced. Their fighting style is precise, but equally as reckless as their attitudes; vicious thrusts of their rapier interspersed with a few dirty tricks that no formal weapon trainer would likely teach a pupil.</p><p><strong>Bawdy Performers.</strong> Corsairs ashore can be found in the seediest of taverns where drink is strong, harsh, and inexpensive. Seeking to make the most of their time ashore, they are often found leading others in singing bawdy sailing songs into the wee hours amongst dockworkers and ruffians or instigating brawls with those inebriated enough to pick a fight with them.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Sea Seers</em></p><p>The open oceans can be a treacherous place, where sudden squalls and ever changing weather can capsize the sturdiest of ships captains by experienced crews, to say nothing of the dangers of corsairs and dangerous sea creatures. Traversing the coastal waters and open waves with relative safety requires a skilled navigator as well as steel nerves.</p><p>Many humanoids settle along the coast, as shallow waters provide a bounty of food and allow relatively efficient trade by sea as opposed to much lengthier trips over land. Over generations these often simple folk have developed an intimate bond with the sea, knowing the best times to harvest fish and molluscs and when to begin their trade missions. These coastal denizens have learned to read weather patterns, navigate ocean currents, and are more than able seafarers.</p><p>As with other humanoids, at times a gift of magical abilities can be found within certain familial lines among the fishing villages and trading ports that dot the coast. While often these magical abilities go untrained due to a lack of knowledgeable tutors, nonetheless these magic users are able to perform minor arcane feats. Most often they are able to glimpse premonitions and auguries, foreseeing weather changes and prophesying raids by pirates. These accurate premonitions have lent the name mareviden to these individuals, who are also known as the sea seers.</p><p>Members of smaller fishing villages that are more isolated from larger ports tend to be a superstitious lot, untrusting of magical powers. Hence the mareviden tend to be more solitary individuals, often dwelling in small houses constructed on bluffs overlooking the waves. There the mareviden peer into the distance, content to study the waves and cloud patterns that indicate coming storms. Other mareviden see their premonitions in the patterns of sea shells or bones of sea creatures.</p><p>Mareviden are regarded with a mixture of curiosity, wariness, or even mistrust amongst those who do not understand their gifts. Those who are more often found asea than ashore often bestow a sea seer with gifts and trinkets in the hopes of obtaining favorable trade winds. While their crews are often found in taverns, ship captains will frequently venture forth to locate a mareviden with the aim of gleaning information about an upcoming voyage. Some regard the mareviden as mortal messengers of the sea gods.</p><p><strong>Fickle Premonitions.</strong> Much like the sea is fickle, so too are the premonitions of the mareviden. While simple auguries are cast with relative ease, they are often little more than fleeting glimpses of the most likely outcomes that may take place in the coming days, perhaps weeks, at most. Yet at times the mareviden are beholden to visions of great clarity and detail, perhaps a gift from the sea gods indeed.</p><p><strong>Water Manipulator.</strong> The sea seers are able to manipulate water with relative ease. Rumor has it that through their powers they can alter the ebb and flow of currents, thereby even affecting surface weather and causing great gusts of wind to blow inland from the sea. A favorable encounter with a mareviden may cause a vessel’s sails to fill as they sail away, perhaps a parting gift from a sea seer.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Observers of Fate</em></p><p>The immortal and powerful gods, benevolent and sinister, are known to walk among the lands of lesser mortal beings from time to time to observe their actions and pass judgment upon them. However, the existence of gods often dictates that their presence may be required elsewhere, and therefore they may send forth their trusted servants to observe, record, and report on the actions of the mortals over whom they watch. On rare occasions, the gods may deem that divine intervention is required to shift the balance of power toward either good or ill, but such actions often have significant consequences.</p><p>The observer of fate is one such being, tasked with watching the actions and struggles of mortals. They may be called upon by the gods to specifically observe one mortal or a whole group in order to judge their intent and actions at a crucial point in time. The judgment of the spectatrix fati may one day dictate the fate of the soul being observed - when that soul has departed, are they worthy of ascension into a higher plane of existence, will the soul be given another opportunity to prove its worth, or will it be cast into the chill abyss where await others whose deeds and actions in life were less than noble?</p><p><strong>Mortal Form.</strong> In their true form, the observer of fate is a beautiful, winged, angelic celestial being that both frightens and inspires mortals who gaze upon them. However, they rarely appear in their true form before mortals. The spectatrix fati will often disguise themselves as mortals to gain a better, first-hand understanding of their activities. While they can assume any form they choose, often they appear as beings of fair and noble demeanor to those creatures of an altruistic nature, or powerful and forceful to those beings with a more evil character. Their features are refined and handsome as males, and as females they have regal and beautiful appearances.</p><p>When interacting with mortals, an observer of fate will rarely offer advice or guidance, instead choosing a noncommittal approach. They will offer facts and observations, but rarely advice or opinions, as their duties generally preclude them from influencing the activities of mortals. They will, however, engage in other activities with mortals, even reluctantly entering combat where necessary to achieve their goal of observing their subjects. In combat, however, they will never land the killing blow upon a mortal, as it is forbidden for them to send another soul for judgment prematurely.</p><p><strong>Divine Intervention.</strong> The observer of fate, as their name suggests, generally does not interfere with the fates of mortals. If it is time for one’s soul to pass for judgment, it is not for the spectatrix fati to decide otherwise. They are, however, given a certain limited license to interfere in cases they deem unnatural, though this is entirely a subjective judgment on behalf of the observer. They have been known to interfere in subtle ways, such as nudging a band of adventurers along a more virtuous path or magically guiding the hands of a healer treating a mortal of great potential. It is questionable whether they have interfered to a greater extent in the affairs of mortals, and yet, at times, wars have been averted or started seemingly when the opposite was likely, potentially through the subtle interventions of a greater being.</p>",

Some choose to focus on peering into the future and divining great secrets, others on how to enchant and manipulate other beings, and others focus on how to harness the raw destructive elemental forces of nature. These elementalists, known as the elementur, may also choose to specialize even further. Those who focus their learning on summoning frigid storms and casting jagged bolts of ice against their foes are called the alsiumagi, more commonly known as cryomancers.</p><p>The alsiumagi are not solely focused on the offensive use of ice magics, as they also have a keen interest in weather patterns and storms that they are able to subtly influence, either shifting their direction or lessening the impact of an otherwise brutal blizzard. They are able to withdraw heat and energy from a variety of sources, turning water to ice in short order, crafting great walls of ice. Using this ability they can siphon and dissipate heat from a living being, turning the blood in their veins to ice and chilling them to the bone.</p><p>As individuals the alsiumagi tend to be much more hermit-like compared to other magic users, and often make their homes far away from civilization in frozen tundras, windswept mountaintops, or within glaciers.</p><p>They prefer a life of quiet reflection and solitude where they can delve into their chosen profession, and as a result seldom venture forth into civilization.</p><p>When they do, it is often to barter for required goods in small frontier settlements. Locals often describe the demeanour of an alsiumagus as cold, calculating, and impatient, their ice blue eyes betraying no hint of warmth or humor. Despite their demeanour, cryomancers are not without emotion, they simply choose to regard it as unnecessary given their chosen existence. Their inherent curiosity can entice them to join adventuring bands or aid parties traversing northern climes, where their dispassionate, logical, and analytical minds may set them at odds with those of a more fiery disposition.</p><p>Perhaps owing to their solitary nature, in addition to their magical abilities, the alsiumagi are intrepid survivalists and students of nature. They are often found wandering and exploring their local terrain, leaving their well warded cabins or glacial caves for perhaps weeks on their expeditions. They are more than capable of finding scarce resources in even the most desolate and bitter of environments, and also to protect themselves against any predators and dangerous creatures that would challenge them.</p><p><strong>Frozen Souls.</strong> Cryomancers are able to permanently ward themselves against frigid temperatures that would freeze most other creatures in minutes. Some have said that ice flows through their veins, for the alsiumagi can resist the full brunt of a burning inferno.</p><p><strong>Essence of Frost.</strong> The alsiumagi possess a number of unique magical abilities. They are able to summon forth long, crystalline blades of ice that are as hard as steel and yet much lighter, and can also encase their bodies in the same. Creatures that are normally able to withstand the cold find themselves chilled by a cryomancer’s castings. They are also able to summon and cast much larger bolts of glacial ice than other conventionally trained magic users are capable of.</p>",

Yet in reality, existence is neither good nor evil, it simply is a matter of perspective. This perspective is a reflection of the choices made and actions taken by any being possessing free will - an action taken by one being may well be regarded as “good” by those it benefits, or as “evil” by those it negatively affects.</p><p>True peaceful and harmonious existence may only occur in a state of equilibrium or balance. The keepers of the balance, or praestrutinor, represent a secretive sect of impartial beings whose purpose is to ensure balance is maintained and living beings can exist with some semblance of peace.</p><p>Wherever the scales of balance tip toward what other beings may consider evil or chaos, such as times of persecution, subjugation of free will, domination, and dishonorable war, the praestrutinor may be found striving to aid those in need while laying waste to those agents of chaos sowing discord. Likewise, where extreme lawfulness exists, choices are dictated, and free will is no longer tolerated, the keepers of the balance will disrupt such behaviors to ensure all beings are capable of choosing their own paths.</p><p>Similarly, whenever demonic, undead, or other creatures of darkness and chaos spread their influence, the praestrutinor will oppose them, as they will any significant overt interference conducted by celestial beings. Once either forces of law or chaos are brought into check, praestrutinors take their leave.</p><p>Balancing the light and darkness requires great wisdom to avoid becoming corrupted toward one extreme or the other. It is rumored the praestrutinor’s teachings are passed from one caretaker to another when they themselves perish, though it has also been speculated that the praestrutinor descend from a long line of defenders, their powers inherited through a pure bloodline of guardians tracing back millenia.</p><p>The keepers of the balance are solemn in their demeanor and solitary in their existence. They will seldom interact with any other being, save those who also seek balance. Creatures whose actions reflect bias toward either good or evil, chaos or lawfulness, are regarded with quiet skepticism.</p><p>In maintaining their unbiased guardianship over balance, a praestrutinor will not enter into a formal allegiance with any creature, though they will at times intervene on behalf of others to prevent the scales of balance from tipping too far in either direction.</p><p><strong>Keepers of Light and Darkness.</strong> In serving the balance, the praestrutinor is capable of wielding both holy and unholy magical powers. While most lesser beings would become tempted by pathways to the light or the darkness, the keepers of the balance in their great wisdom remain untempted by such inclinations toward either. They are both bringers of light and darkness incarnate.</p><p><strong>Banisher of Angels and Demons.</strong> In seeking to restore balance to wherever they tread, the praestrutinor will seek out and banish any beings of great power, such as celestials or demons, that they encounter. It is their belief that such undue influence in the realms of mortals is antithetical to maintaining balance, and thus such beings must be sent back from whence they came.</p>",

These kings ruled seven city-states and in their time had ushered in an era of peace and prosperity. As they began to age, they became convinced that the era of prosperity would end once they all died and their hard fought for peace would crumble to dust.</p><p>In an attempt to stop that eventuality, the kings sought ways to ensure the peace they had garnered continued. There was talk of alliance through marriage and trade agreements. There was talk of laws and traditions, but none of these, they knew, would stop the inevitable fallout. It might take generations, but eventually laws would be changed, alliances would crumble, and trade agreements would be renegotiated.</p><p>One of the kings, whose name is lost to the annals of time, lamented that there was no way they could remain ruling so as to keep the peace. It is said that a cold wind swept the room, blowing objects around and temporarily blinding everyone present. When the wind had settled, a man stood before them. He had an aura of power so great it almost dimmed the candles and turned the sun dark. He told them of a way they could do exactly what they wished to do. The being convinced them he was an ancient learned sage. That he himself had used this ability and now lived through the centuries guiding and teaching. He appealed to their egos, telling them that they ruled wisely and he was impressed by their achievements and that he too wished to see their era continue.</p><p>In short, the being convinced them with subtle enchantments and honeyed words. He bade them each gather a bird from the palace garden as it would be the vessel of their ascension. Once they had done so, each king stood at the point of a seven pointed star, with the sage in the center. Each held their bird aloft as the chanting began.</p><p>It was only in their last seconds that they realized their error. Stripped of his humanoid form by the magic he had tricked the kings into weaving, a powerful lich before them completed his spell, placing the souls of the kings within the birds.</p><p>That is how they live even now. The bodies of the great kings, now immortal undead, feast on the living to grow an undead army to serve their dark lord. Ever present are the souls of the cursed kings, flitting about and chirping in horror and frustration.</p><p><strong>Glamorous Undead.</strong> The kings appear now as they did then; in the prime of their lives, hale and hardy. Their eyes are devoid of even the slightest warmth, however, and the glamour that keeps them looking young fades when they attack, revealing them as grey corpses with taut skin covering to yellowing bone. The only things that remains untouched are their crowns, as if to mock these kings.</p><p><strong>The Birds!</strong> The birds that circle around the seven mindless kings serve as vessels for their souls. Anyone with the ability to understand the speech of birds will realize, to their horror, that the souls inside the birds are fully aware of what is going on. Whether by design or as a side effect. They are cogent of events. They can be heard endlessly screaming, “Help me”, as they watch - horrified at what their bodies are doing.</p><p><strong>Undead Nature.</strong> The consiliumregis, as well as the bird to which it is bound, doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>",

Great predators, such as lions and leopards, were revered as symbols of strength and power, and to possess one was considered a great sign of wealth. Even smaller domesticated cats were regarded as protectors, warding their owners against evil spirits that were said to prowl at night.</p><p>Over time, magi and priests of these ancient civilizations began to dabble in transmutations that would enable them to resemble what they believed were the gods. Eventually they amassed a cult-like following, who also chose to undergo such transformations. Their incantations slowly changed not just their physical appearance, but also the minds of affected beings - over time, they lost the ability to control magic and became much more savage and predatory than initially intended. Eventually, their feral tendencies overcame their human nature, and conflict arose between the altered worshippers and other humanoids. Despite their newfound savagery, eventually all but a handful of the vastly outnumbered former magi and their followers were slaughtered - those who survived were driven into the wastelands.</p><p>The descendents of these beings still live on, prowling the dunes they have made their home. Now known as the harenaepraedor, these plunderers and pillagers of the sands have regained some of their former humanity, but are still shunned and often attacked on sight by other beings. Resembling a cross between human and great predatory cat, the sand plunderers are often lightly furred with tawny colors that enable them to blend in seamlessly with their surroundings.</p><p>The harenaepraedor will seldom interact with other humanoids. On the rare occasion they do it is because something piqued their inherent feline curiosity. They are distrustful of other beings, and will regard them with a great deal of suspicion. Very little entices them, and their motivations seem fickle and unpredictable. They have been known to capture other humanoids, though very seldom do they survive to return to their own civilization except through some cunning means of escape. Survivors have reported the harenaepraedor releasing their captives, only to chase them down once again as though simply for the sport of it.</p><p><strong>Keen Senses.</strong> The senses of the harenaepraedor are unnaturally keen, their eyesight able to detect movement from great distances. Similarly, their over-large ears are adapted not just to dissipate heat, but also to hear the slightest sound above the whistle of the desert wind gently blowing grains of sand.</p><p><strong>Adapted to the Desert.</strong> Unlike many other humanoids, the harenaepraedor are perfectly adapted to life in the desert. They are ferocious and cunning predators, known to set elaborate ambushes at oases and the few waypoints travellers use to rest during their long journeys. The long, razor sharp claws of the harenaepraedor are often dipped in potent venom harvested from poisonous desert vipers. Their attacks are sudden, brutal, and seldom leave any survivors.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Lycanthrope Bloodsingers</em></p><p>The Lupinocaedar are a sub-caste of the lycanthrope praeliar, or warrior caste, that are reviled, revered, and respected in equal measure by their clan. Lycanthrope society is centered around the demonstration of strength, much like wild wolves, to assert dominance and social hierarchy to maintain order. Therefore, martial prowess and savagery are respected while any signs of weakness are challenged and eliminated. Bloodsingers fall outside the standard social order in that while many challenges end in bloodshed but both parties survive, a challenge with a bloodsinger almost always ends in a grisly death. Then, once their opponent has been vanquished, the lupinocaedar will harvest the spilled blood of their foes to power their fearsome abilities.</p><p>Other lycanthropes within a clan often view and have often accepted their status: cursed with an ancient affliction that grants them unnatural powers, but also holds sway over their actions and has led them to be shunned by other civilizations for the most part. But the bloodsingers view lycanthropy not as a curse, but a blessing that allows them to potentially dominate and conquer other beings. Thus, while relatively rare in lycanthrope society as their bloodlust often leads them into mortal combat, their influence over others within their clan can lead to open internal revolt. They are only tolerated insofar as the apha can maintain their control over the clan and also the bloodsinger, as they have their purpose if managed correctly.</p><p>Unlike other lycanthropes that often choose to maintain their humanoid form day to day, the lupinocaedar proudly exist in a hybrid form almost indefinitely. They craft their own arms and armor, and often adorn it with the grisly remains of their slain foes - skulls of the vanquished adorning their belts as chalices or sharpened bone jutting outward from their pauldrons. They bear massive double- bladed war axes constructed with humanoid bones as handles, their blades permanently stained with gore. Thus the lupinocaedar are a gruesome and intimidating sight to behold, one that may cause even the most seasoned warrior to quake in their boots.</p><p>While other lycanthropes may at times cautiously interact with other humanoids, bloodsingers seldom interact with those they view as inferior. If they do so, the lupinocaedar will seek out any excuse to attack those they perceive as weaker than themselves or goad those who may be their equals or more powerful, casting thinly-veiled insults amidst their open scorn. Within their own society bloodsingers are arrogant and borderline insubordinate to their betters, doing the bare minimum to avoid challenging those above them in station while regularly taunting those of lesser station into combat. They will often speak in grudgingly respectful tones to their clan alphas, a hint of scorn barely concealed. Intelligent alphas will do their best to avoid a challenge with a bloodsinger while maintaining their own status within a clan, knowing that a bloodsinger as alpha will without question lead to open war with other species, and perhaps the extermination of their clan.</p><p><strong>Blood Magics.</strong> The magics of the lupinocaedar are dependent on the blood they collect from their slain enemies that is held in a bag crafted of the flayed skin of other humanoids. With a flick of a blood- soaked claw they can cast forth clouds of corrosive acid to liquify their enemies.</p>",

The ocean allows rapid trade and transit between nations and provides all manner of food to those who know how to harvest it. Cultures that inhabit island archipelagos, in particular, are peaceful explorers, traders, and fishers known to worship a plethora of water-dwelling gods and deities with rituals that may seem unusual to those not familiar with them. However, it is thought that such rituals protect them from powerful tropical cyclones and other potential disasters.</p><p>Even the gods could not prevent a massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami that would devastate an entire region. Knowledgeable as they were about storms and the ebbs and flows of the sea, when the ocean receded past the protective reef surrounding their island home, island priests knew only a matter of minutes remained before their entire civilization would be scoured from the earth. So they retreated to their temples, beseeching their gods to allow their people to survive.</p><p>The gods beheld their prayers and took pity on the islanders, and as the tsunami passed far above the island, its denizens were transformed - hidden gills sprouted along their necks to allow them to breath beneath the waves as well as above water, and webbing formed between their digits. Despite these augmentations quickly bestowed by their gods, most of the islanders perished due to the sheer savage force of the tsunami, and their archipelago was lost beneath the waves for all time. A once proud and peaceful civilization was no more, and those few who survived began the long process of rebuilding anew. These survivors became known as the viataequor - the travelers of the sea.</p><p>Viataequor are a proud people, still inhabiting the underwater ruins of their once mighty cities and temples. Much like their ancestors they continue to explore the ocean depths, sometimes crossing vast distances but always staying within the warmer tropical waters they love so dearly. They remain peaceful and curious, and will often emerge from their watery homes to interact with merchant ships and fisherman that traverse their waters, guiding them to safe waters or directing them to the best fishing grounds - provided the fishermen are not excessive in their harvest. They will not tolerate piracy however, and abhor bloodshed. That said, they are powerful fighters that will take up sword or harpoon to drive off pirates or any number of dangers lurking in the ocean depths.</p><p><strong>Walking Among Us.</strong> Viataequors may also fully emerge onto land, exploring other islands they come across or coastal regions to sate their curiosity and thirst for exploration. In such cases though, they prefer not to reveal their true nature, hiding the adaptations that have allowed them to survive for so long. They are often clad in lightweight scaled armor crafted from the fish they hunt, and will possess any number of ornaments and decorations upon themselves as a symbol of their status - rings, bracers, earrings, necklaces, or medallions are commonly worn, either crafted themselves or found within shipwrecks.</p><p><strong>Storm Summoners.</strong> Another gift from their gods, the viataequor are said to be able to either summon or calm ocean storms and quell turbulent seas.</p>",

Black markets and thieves’ guilds thrive in less affluent regions of cities, particularly those that are commercial centers or trade hubs where any number of individuals travel to and from, bringing with them their unique talents or exotic goods.</p><p>While generally a vile service, there are times when one might need a threat eliminated with the utmost discretion. Rather than hiring a band of ruffians or thugs to to send a warning, crime lords may prefer a more subtle approach and enlist the services of a sicariar. These master assassins are highly skilled at entering even the most well-protected and secure locations with ease, eliminating their target by whatever means their contract decrees, and escaping with no one the wiser to their presence. Their methods vary from the gruesome - a garrotted rival gruesomely displayed as a warning to a rival - or the subtle, where their target appears to simply pass into the void in their sleep.</p><p>As their profession requires the utmost discretion, sicariar are found only when they want to be, and are often contacted only through intermediaries to protect both their identities and those of their employers. Only when final negotiations have come to fruition will they meet with their employer to obtain critical information regarding their target - the nature of the defenses surrounding them, their habits, tendencies, and any scraps of knowledge that can help the sicariar plan an appropriate course of action. They are very focused, no detail overlooked in planning their attack, and leave nothing to chance. As a result, a sicariar may come across as overly paranoid, however the results of their work are a testament to their attention to detail. Their approach is methodical as the master assassin’s mind formulates their plan, and they are patient as well; as part of their contract, employers must acknowledge that a flawless assassination may take weeks or even months to execute to perfection. However, anyone employing a sicariar may rest easy knowing that the deed will be carried out flawlessly and to their precise specifications.</p><p><strong>Nimble Fingers and Mind.</strong> While a sicariar disdains common thievery, they will at times acknowledge that their unique skills allow them to not only carry out assassinations but also allow them simultaneously obtain documents or items that may be of use to their employers. They are incredibly adept at opening even the most complex and well- crafted of locks, and they almost have an additional sense for the presence of traps that the less than wary might be ensnared by. Caution and discretion are two words a sicariar lives by.</p><p><strong>Master of Poisons.</strong> Sicariar are highly knowledgeable regarding the alchemical brewing of and application of poisons and toxins.

      "description": "<p><em>Purveyors of Antiquities</em></p><p>Any being can simply walk into a merchant’s store and procure any manner of basic goods including tools, rations, crafting materials, or weapons. Such stores are commonly found throughout many settlements and proprietors are more than happy to relieve folk of their coin. Even alchemist’s shops are relatively common where one can purchase basic recipes, potions, and ingredients for their own concoctions. Few are merchants who deal with more refined taste - magical scrolls, enchanted items, rare and exotic gems such as jade or opals or unique, one-of-a-kind artifacts. These shops are managed by elegant and knowledgeable owners who are well connected with both legitimate suppliers, and perhaps even shadier black-market dealers to supply their customers with the finest of goods. These purveyors of antiquities, also known as copiantiquitas, are selective in their goods they choose to offer to their distinguished buyers, displaying their wares in an elegant magical emporium - but often saving their choice pieces for their valued return customers in private rooms warded by all manner of magical enchantments.</p><p>The shop of a copiantiquitas is well organized with items, potions, scrolls, jewelry, weapons, and other items on display or hanging on walls. Ornate boxes and jars contain all manner of oddities, sometimes including preserved body parts of rare creatures used by alchemists when creating rare potions.</p><p>The copiantiquitas themselves are often elegantly dressed in fine cloth or even silk, and they themselves may appear to be from distant lands. Some of their goods may even be completely unknown to their visitors, but the purveyor of antiquities is more than delighted to educate interested parties in the details of their object of interest. Those who visit the emporium of a copiantiquitas find them to be an excellent source of information, knowledgeable about all manner of artifacts - moreso if one is willing to part with good coin for an item. They are elegant, well educated, refined in manners, and courteous, however they will not tolerate would-be thieves - such beings often find themselves magically restrained before they can escape the emporium, either by the copiantiquitas themselves or by the numerous wards triggered by illicit activities. Once a copiantiquitas’s shop is breached and knowledge of the fate of those responsible becomes known, thieves will give a wide berth to such dangerous targets.</p><p>Copiantiquitas have been known at times to commission adventurers to procure artifacts rumored to be held in ancient ruins or forgotten places of power. In such cases they will offer a top value for their contracts, in gold or even an exchange of one of their pieces. The word of a copiantiquitas is their bond, for in such business reputation and trust in their suppliers and customers alike is essential to the success of their emporium.</p><p><strong>Dragon-like Mind.</strong> The knowledge of a copiantiquitas is vast, as is their ability to know precisely where each one of their goods is in their shop. This has led their customers to joke that the copiantiquitas has a dragon-like mind when it comes to treasure, a rumor they are more than happy to propagate. They also have subtle magical abilities, and are able to identify the rarest of items, even at times scrying out potential locations to send their procurers to explore.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Dune Dancers</em></p><p>Hot desert sands and arid grasslands are inhospitable places, where both food and water are scarce. Even shelter from the glaring sun can be difficult to come across, as trees and rocky outcroppings are sparse. Life in such environments is largely dictated by the best adaptations to the heat and glare of the sun, and only the hardiest and most ingenious humanoids may thrive. Resources are scarce, thus inhabitants of these regions utilize everything possible to aid their survival. Bones are collected and used for tools, weapons, and decoration, twisted desert plants and animals are consumed or used for their medicinal qualities, and even dried dung is used for campfires to keep the cold of a desert night at bay.</p><p>Wind dancers, or ventusaltator as they are known, are swift and deadly desert trackers and hunters. Members of nomadic warrior clans that range from watering hole to oasis to deeply set stone well searching for migrating animal herds that are their primary source of food, these clever hunters are as resourceful as they are dangerous. Their eyesight is incredibly keen, capable of detecting even the slightest movement of a creature from hundreds of feet away, even amidst the intense heat haze that radiates off sand and rock. This keen eyesight makes a wind dancer incredibly difficult to fool, and they can detect all but the most perfectly constructed illusions and images.</p><p>The hunts of a wind dancer may lead them to range far from the encampments of their tribes. Often a tribe will send out individual wind dancers in different directions, the better to track their migratory prey and bring home much needed meat. These lone scouts may be gone for many days, even weeks at a time, where they must survive using finely honed survival skills. In order to travel as efficiently as possible, they are unencumbered but for their weaponry, clothing, meager rations, and a skin of water. On occasion they will send out larger hunting parties, where a rare flash rain draws and concentrates desert animals near short-lived pools, and these hunts will often feed the tribe for weeks.</p><p>Desert tribes are superstitious lots, and distrustful of outsiders. A ventusaltator may track rival tribes or caravans traversing their territories, yet will hesitate to approach and openly engage. They are rarely surprised, and often travelers are unaware they are being tracked. However, a lone wind dancer may warily approach beleaguered desert travelers, offering what little they have to share.</p><p><strong>Desert Marksman.</strong> Thanks to their incredible vision, a ventusaltator is also a superb marksman. Bearing white bone shortbows crafted from the remains of their prey, they are capable of striking even distant and moving targets at ranges most other archers would not consider possible. They know how to precisely account for the slightest of desert winds that may throw off their aim, and also the most vulnerabilities of their prey.</p><p><strong>Wind Dance.</strong> Wind dancers are named not only for their innate swiftness, but for their innate ability to predict and control the hot desert winds. To conceal their approach, a soft gust of wind may conceal the sound of their steps or blow away their scent from wary prey. Some wind dancers may even summon forth sand storms, which they use to obscure a hasty retreat if they are detected by enemies.</p>",

While not necessarily evil in and of themselves, such practitioners delve into magics with a morbid curiosity while others will hesitate to pursue such knowledge. One such subgroup of magic users are known as the exossomagi, more commonly known as bone mages. As their name suggests, bone mages are fascinated with the skeletons of dead creatures, and will often go to great lengths to obtain the bones of rare creatures or historical figures and use them as tools to channel their necromantic energies.</p><p>As avid archaeologists with a thirst for knowledge of events long past, exossomagi are often found in ancient crypts, ziggurats, burial grounds, or tombs where they will use their powers to compel the spirits of the dead to once more inhabit their former remains and attempt to glean ancient knowledge of events long past. However, they must carefully listen for the true voice of the deceased, for any number of souls may attempt to speak amidst each other in their effort to be known to the world of the living once more. Either through persuasion or coercion the exossomagi will excise the information they desire, and leave with yet another bone as a keepsake from their latest object of study.</p><p>Over time, an exossomagi will obtain a unique collection of bones from various creatures they craft into a gruesome armor that serves as their arcane focus. Other beings can thus easily identify a bone mage, and the more diverse the bones in their collection and more elaborate their armor, the more experienced the mage. They do however abhor rotting remains, and will scour and clean a desirable piece before adding it to their collection.</p><p>Owing to the fact that their activities are perhaps viewed as less than savory by a majority of other beings, exossomagi tend to be loners. This suits them well, as few beings would willingly choose to enter long forgotten crypts and tombs without the temptation of riches. For the bone mage, riches are of little use, so should they enlist with other creatures in exploring such dark places they will instead choose to pursue the knowledge of the ancient spirits inhabiting such places. They often possess a wealth of historical knowledge obtained from the dead, and thus despite their unsettling appearance are sought out for their knowledge.</p><p><strong>Power over Bone.</strong> Exossomagi possess many unique abilities obtained from the dead that are completely unknown to those who have not spoken with the ancients. They can read potent and reliable auguries by reading specific patterns of cast bones, hurtle needle-sharp bone fragments toward their enemies, or even raise legions of skeletal servants to aid and serve them. These servants are no mere mindless rabble, however, and are intelligent undead possessed by the spirits summoned by the bone mage and compelled to serve them.</p><p><strong>Undying Nature.</strong> The exossomage can hold its breath indefinitely, and doesn’t require food, water, or sleep. Also, it seems to age at a much slower rate, showing the effects of only a single year after roughly ten years have passed.</p>",

Liches are a common feature of most folklore and make up the large majority of intelligent undead, at least as far as most commoners know. However, there are other rituals for those that lack the magical ability to transform themselves and for those that certain powerful practitioners of magic choose to turn against their will.</p><p>One of these methods has been used to create the bilantus. Undead creatures that were once humanoid, but chose to live the unlife of a mummy. Many of those who choose this path do so for a chance at revenge against those that have done them wrong, who they might otherwise not be able to face, lacking the gifts needed. Some are terminally ill, those that cannot afford for a cleric to heal them of their ills, but are not ready to meet their gods. Others have their own reasons, whatever they may be.</p><p>The procedure itself is horrendous, a mixture of magic and science, which sees the subject embalmed while they still live, all of their blood replaced with a magical embalming mixture that turns them from one of the living into one of the walking dead. The screams from the process have to be magically muted, otherwise people in the streets above might run for their lives.</p><p>Once they are embalmed, they are buried in full regalia, face mask and bandages. Should the process take, they will rise within a month as one of the bilantus. Should the process not work, they will die. Some few have apparently been stuck in a state in between, neither alive nor dead, their souls trapped forever in their rotting bodies, unable to move or speak.</p><p>Once they rise, they generally keep the mask and bandages in place. It adds to their ominous appearance and keeps their greyed flesh from being visible. The mask itself holds enchantments and the process gains the embalmed certain magical powers, even if they did not have them in life.</p><p>Once embalmed, they are generally free to do as they wish, as long as they promise to faithfully serve whatever church or cult turned them in the first place. Many spend their eternities as temple guardians, while others join the ranks of the armies of the churches as fearsome soldiers that carve up the battlefields and sow fear in the hearts of their enemies. Some manage to break away and travel the lands, usually still in bandages and masks, however, usually hidden under other travel wear so as not to reveal their undead nature.</p><p><strong>Not All Evil.</strong> Being intelligent undead, most of the embalmed are the same person they were in life and have the same values and virtues or lack thereof. While most would not be considered anyone’s idea of the virtuous; not all are inherently evil either and many a party of adventurers have found themselves helped by an enigmatic cloaked figure, Some have even had one join their party as a valued member.</p><p><strong>Magical Regalia.</strong> The mask worn by the embalmed is a magical artifact, giving them the ability to see in any environment and even to see through many illusions and to perceive the invisible. Some have claimed that the older embalmed can even use the powers of the mask to create the illusion that they are flesh and blood, helping them to integrate back into society, if they so choose.</p>",

To the victor go the spoils, whatever remains of the conquered —land, gold, and resources. Those who have been defeated are often left with a choice: to attempt to rebuild under the watchful eyes of those who defeated them, or to flee and attempt to rebuild in a new area, free from whatever consequences might arise from their defiance. Often such groups will seek refuge in the wilderness where they can either attempt to lead in insurrection and strike at their foes, or where they may attempt to live in relative peace once more.</p><p>Inevitably, leaders must arise from those who flee into the wilds or seek refuge in ancient hidden ruins. The survival of refugees often depends on the will and guidance of a praexsul who offers both hope and strength where otherwise there might be none. These groups may be overburdened with the elderly, infirm, or children, as many able-bodied individuals may have been lost in the fighting that preceded their flight. As a result, praexsul are business-like and efficient, with little time for idle chatter or frivolities, and are ferociously protective of their wards. They are highly regarded leaders of their communities, able to carefully influence and negotiate with others, as they know any internal strife or discord could jeopardize the fragile morale of those whom they lead.</p><p>Praexsul place the interests of their group above all else, even their own self-interest. Often they possess modest magical abilities, and are able to carefully evaluate and predict whatever is next required to ensure the survival of their group. They use their magical abilities to keep careful watch over their wards, and they may sense when danger approaches. Due to their highly protective nature, they are quite suspicious of outsiders, and thus may take additional precautions to protect their groups. Outsiders are often met by scouts well before they are near to the newly constructed settlements led by a praexsul, and such visitors are muffled, gagged, blindfolded, and disoriented some distance away lest they deliberately or inadvertently reveal the location of a hidden camp.</p><p>As with many individuals that find themselves in a position of power, praexsul are often convinced in their own path and decision making. While they may solicit advice from others within their group, in the end their decision is final. They are highly intelligent and can tactfully navigate delicate situations in a mostly firm and respectful manner.</p><p><strong>Observant Leaders.</strong> Often a praexsul never anticipated being in a position where the lives of others depended on them. Their skills come from a keen and analytical mind, capable of anticipating issues before they arise and directing settlement members according to their strengths and abilities. Despite never having received a formal education, praexsul are efficient and competent, directing daily activities with ease while shouldering the burden of whatever issues may arise. They know the survival of their group may well depend on them.</p><p><strong>Rebuff Their Charms.</strong> Praexsuls are so in-tune with their thoughts and emotions that they are unable to be charmed by another. Should someone try and persuade them through magical means, they could soon find themselves under the praexsul’s influence instead.</p>",

This is not the case with the Knights of the Sacred Gun. For centuries now, they have focused on the combination of standard weaponry and firearms to create a combined fighting style that makes them foes to be feared on the field of battle.</p><p>Wielding a gun blessed by celestial beings in one hand and a melee weapon in the other, the Knights combine the two in a deadly display of blade and bullet. Theirs is an unorthodox fighting style that uses both weapons to great effect, both as weapons and for defense. Their blessed weapons were created to withstand all blows and can be used to parry as well as any sword.</p><p>The Knights train from a young age in their very particular fighting style, learning marksmanship from the time they can hold a training gun and swordsmanship even younger. They eschew the use of heavy armor for lighter chain shirts, which allows them to still move freely and fluidly in their deadly dance.</p><p>It is considered a great honor to have a family member join the order. The order sends out its Master of Names once per year to roam the countryside in order to find those deemed worthy by the book of names. According to popular folklore, the book contains all of the names of those who will be chosen, updated by celestial beings every year. Each year when the Master goes to choose, he does not look. He and his loyal hands will simply ride into a town and call out the names of every three-year-old child deemed worthy. On very rare occasions, parents will refuse this honor. This usually brings such shame to the family that they are forced to move, to find another village to live in that does not know of their refusal. There are those that whisper that most of these families do not make it to new towns and those who do swear to have seen unmarked graves along the routes they traveled, others still have claimed to see the children of these families serving in the ranks.</p><p><strong>Celestial Weapons.</strong> The firearms wielded by the order are blessed by celestial beings, giving them unerring accuracy and the power of the celestials themselves. Some say any projectile placed in the firearm becomes a blessed bullet, smiting the enemies of the order with righteous fire.</p><p><strong>Holy Mission.</strong> The Knights of the Sacred Gun have a holy mission to smite all those who would do evil be they humanoid, fiend, or fey, any the order deem law breakers, or any who refuse to bow to their will. Some see the order as a force for good, while others claim their adherence to law has made them arrogant and, in some cases, evil.</p><p><strong>Firearm Extraordinaire.</strong> The fortisigni are able to reload their firearms as naturally as an archer notches an arrow, and they wield their firearms with deadly accuracy, even if their target has closed the distance between them. Where a novice would struggle, fortisigni can operate their firearm with grace under pressure.</p>",

While they are present, commoners board windows and band together in the dark of night, huddling together and fearful for their lives as blood-curdling screams and primal howls break the stillness of the night. Unless driven away or slain, such creatures run amok and can cause untold damage. However, there are those beings who defy creatures of the night, making darkness their ally as they seek to exterminate any such threats. These beings are known as the noctivenacticus - the Nighthunters.</p><p>Noctivenaticus often pick up their chosen calling due to some tragic oath sworn as the result of some vile deed - often they themselves are orphans, made so by the very beings they have sworn to hunt down and eliminate. As a child, they may have witnessed the massacre of their family or village at the hands of the undead or by night-prowling lycanthropes and survived only by remaining silent and concealed. Perhaps they witnessed some other atrocity as an adult and swore vengeance and retribution for the slaying of innocents. Whatever their tragic motivation, the noctivenaticus have trained long and hard to have the skills to fulfill their oaths and now travel throughout lands plagued by terrors that lurk in the night.</p><p>A nighthunter is easily identified, as they are clad in pure black and often are openly and heavily armed with all manner of specialized equipment, such as silver-edged weaponry and silver-embossed studded leathers. Due to the dangerous nature of their work, they will often travel alone, perhaps fearing bringing harm to others much like that which they witnessed previously, or perhaps out of a sense of survivor’s guilt. Whatever their reason, noctivenaticus are often viewed as aloof and cold toward others, but those close and astute enough may find traces of long lingering pain and guilt behind their carefully guarded eyes. They are, however, quite caring individuals, freely offering their services to villages in need of their protection and beset by unknown threats that lurk in the darkness. If a threat is large enough, they may ally with like-minded individuals, if only for a short time before eliminating the regional threat and moving on.</p><p><strong>Allies with Darkness.</strong> While most adventurers and would-be monster slayers fear the darkness and are wary of the unknown, the noctivenaticus have chosen to make darkness their ally instead - for what better time to hunt down their prey than when they are active and unsuspecting to be hunted themselves? Nighthunters have exceptionally keen senses and are known for their ability to conceal themselves to stalk even the most powerful of creatures of the night. Even if discovered or cornered, they are more than capable of melding back into the darkness to escape and carry on their hunt another night.</p><p><strong>Silvered Weapons and Armor.</strong> Knowing as they do that many creatures of darkness cannot withstand silver, the weaponry of the noctivenaticus is especially crafted - crossbow quarrels heavily barbed and coated in a layer of silver and silver blades finely crafted and jagged. They often carry a thin whip embedded with silver thorns to immobilize their prey, perhaps to withdraw any information from their targets before delivering a killing blow.</p>",

These often consist of stone fragments, pottery, and other artifacts that allow these scholars a mere glimpse into what civilizations once existed. Additionally, ancient ruins are periodically uncovered, long forgotten and in remote areas of the world, perhaps rediscovered as shifting dunes allow ancient temple columns to emerge from the sands or receding ocean waters give way to reveal once glorious ancient cities long lost beneath the waves.</p><p>As they pore over meager scraps of ancient parchments and dusty scrolls in their libraries and studies, scholars have uncovered vague references to a caelestextinctio - thought to be the cause of at least one ancient civilization being removed from the annals of history. Scattered ancient texts throughout the world have been deciphered, and have allowed scholars to piece together what they believe is a loose description of an ancient celestial being or beings that at points throughout their history have wrought destruction down upon the world of mortals.</p><p>Based on what archaeologists have pieced together, at various points in history, great and enlightened civilizations have emerged. Over centuries, these civilizations became the beacon of hope and an example for others to follow. However, in their enlightenment, these ancient civilizations over time became arrogant. Rulers became self-important and forgot whom they served, commoners became selfish and exploitative themselves, and gladiatorial blood games became more important than following paths of virtue. These civilizations began to worship greed rather than virtue and began straying from the path intended by those whom they once worshipped, and the civilizations began worshipping fiends, demons, and false gods.</p><p>In response, the gods sent a harbinger of death, an angel of annihilation to first observe these civilizations in person and walk among them as a mortal. If the angel of annihilation, in the course of one mortal’s lifetime was convinced the civilization was worth saving and redeemable in the eyes of the gods, they would aid them in turning bath to virtuous paths. If irredeemable, the angel of annihilation would rain calamities upon the civilization, all but erasing even the memory of its existence.</p><p><strong>Mortal Form.</strong> Throughout history, the caelestextinctio have walked among mortal lands, appearing as they choose and keeping an ever watchful eye on corruption of civilization. They may appear as a beggar in the streets, a pious priest in a temple, or a wandering traveller seeking shelter from the cold - any form in which they may travel and observe the lives of mortals. At times they will destroy particularly evil threats, but for the most part they maintain, as with other celestial beings, that mortals be free to choose their own paths. While they may interfere in minor mortal affairs at their discretion, such as offering guidance, wisdom, or succor to beings in need, they will seldom, if ever, reveal their true nature.</p><p><strong>Holy Wrath.</strong> The angel of annihilation is a veritable engine of destruction if it’s holy wrath is unleashed. They are capable of raining holy fire down upon their enemies, razing entire buildings to the ground in mere seconds.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Miststalkers</em></p><p>The wild can be a treacherous and deadly place, where any number of calamities can befall an unprepared traveller or ill-equipped adventurer.</p><p>Dangerous creatures lurk within the wild waiting to prey upon the unwitting, and all manner of hidden and invisible hazards await those not wary enough to stay on well-protected and maintained routes.</p><p>Patrolling throughout the wild are intrepid rangers who keep an everwatchful eye upon both creatures and humanoids who may pose a threat to civilization.</p><p>The rangers are well studied in survival, tracking, and navigation. Over years of honing their skills in the wild, some of these individuals are selected to train as an elite cadre of rangers known as the caligosilvae, or the miststalkers. These elite rangers are named such for their ability to seemingly fade away unnoticed as a mist blows away with a gentle gust of wind.</p><p>The miststalkers are not only trained to survive in the harshest of conditions, but they are also trained in more subtle and nefarious arts - that of marksmanship, the crafting and identification and distilling of poisons, venoms, and toxins, setting and laying traps, and stealth. These skills, along with a minor education in basic magical arts, make the caligosilvae highly sought after as assassins, scouts, and spies.</p><p>While they are often found wandering the wilds carrying out their duties and prefer to remain in these settings, miststalkers are also equally adept at navigating urban environments, navigating alleys and taverns with the same ease by which they navigate woodlands and mountain passes.</p><p>Miststalkers are generally clad in rough black or grey leathers; their clothing often simple, durable, and in decent repair from long periods of time spent in the elements. While they prefer to wield the elegantly curved bows that are their trademark, in close combat they are equally adept with a blade. However, a well-placed arrow is considered by the caligosilvae as a much more simple and elegant way to bring down their quarry.</p><p>The caligosilvae are hardly noted for their conversational skills, preferring instead to let their actions speak for them. When they do speak they do so in calm, measured, and thoughtful ways, each word carefully weighed and considered. They are highly knowledgeable regarding a variety of settings, with a keen memory for navigating city streets or wild game trails alike.</p><p><strong>Arcane Arrows.</strong> While much of a miststalker’s training is focused on their ranging and more nefarious martial skills, they do possess a rudimentary knowledge of the arcane. They use these skills to conceal themselves, escape difficult situations, or even augment their already impressive archery skills with a minor infusion of elemental magic.</p><p><strong>Misty Presence.</strong> Much like their name suggests, a miststalker is elusive and difficult to find. Often they observe their subjects carefully and for a lengthy period of time before making their presence known through a well-placed arrow or willingly revealing themselves. They leave little discernible trace suggesting their presence, and if detected they will simply fade away into the underbrush or the press of civilization.</p>",

Creatures that come in the night and steal babies; who make the cows’ milk go sour; who hate iron; and sow chaos wherever they go. They come from over there, in that other place...</p><p>While these stories are wildly inaccurate, they do have a sliver of truth to them. There is a group of beings out there, possibly from that other place, but most likely from any place at all, that cause chaos wherever they go, who are charming and use their abilities to beguile and disrupt.</p><p>How they appear, none know, though stories of them dropping in on windy days abound. Some have them carried down from the clouds by a babbling flock of birds that always seems to hover around them, only to leave again once they have sown chaos and confusion.</p><p>These paracletus, as they call themselves, are here to help. They are, by their own declarations, harbingers of change, turning the world upside down to show people what they have been missing and never wanted, or never knew they wanted, or never wanted to know that they wanted?</p><p>A common story is one where a family will be moving through their lives as one parent provides for the home and one for the family. They will have children that are growing, the normal bit rowdy and unruly. In comes a paracletu, to turn the children into pure chaos, all the while convincing them they are doing good. Before too long, the paracletu moves onto the parents. The provider is suddenly convinced they need to be free of the burden of providing; the carer that they need to care for themselves, and where a short while ago you had a cohesive household, you now have nothing but chaos. It is then that the paracletu feeds, growing strong off the pure chaos it has sown.</p><p>There are whispers, here and there, that some have been so powerful, or that enough have worked in concert, so as to destroy whole civilizations; that the fall of ancient empires, lost in hedonism and decadence, may be attributed to the work of ancient paracletus. If true, the amount of chaos they created would have been a feast for the paracletus.</p><p><strong>This Way Comes Chaos.</strong> While not all evil, all paracletus are creatures of chaos. However, that does not mean they always act rashly. Any student of chaos could tell you that the chaotic quite often appear to be well-grounded and serene. They have been known to join adventuring groups, posing as anything from a travelling salesperson, to a nanny on their way to a new job, or a simple traveller on their way to a new life. They then work on sowing chaos in the group and feeding off the fallout.</p><p><strong>The More Chaotic, the More Powerful.</strong> The more chaos a paracletu has to feed on the more powerful they become. Not to be trifled with at any stage, a fully fed paracletu is a terrifying sight to behold. At this point, they shed their serene outer appearance and become the epicenter of chaos. Thair chaos magic can easily manipulate friends to fight friends or to fall in love with foe. Betrayal and madness follow closely on the heels of a well fed paracletu, if someone is foolish enough to try and stop them.</p>",

As populations grow, so do the demands on food supplies and as resources are consumed, new sources must be found and exploited. Inevitably, some individuals will migrate away from civilization, seeking a simpler life where they may take up plow and shovel to work as yet untamed lands or to seek work in distant mines to delve for iron, silver, gold, or coal. These individuals often care little for the damage they may wreak upon the natural world and its fragile ecosystems.</p><p>Yet there are individuals who have spent their lifetimes learning about and revering the wild, exploring and bonding with nature’s children. While many shun society or even seek to stop its advance, there are those who take a more patient approach - to educate settlers ignorant in the ways of the wild and those who would exploit the natural world on the responsible harvesting of resources. These patrosilvestri, or protectors of the wild, believe that civilization and nature can coexist in peaceful harmony, provided there is a balanced approach.</p><p>The patrosilvestri are patient, calm, wise, soft spoken, and respectful of others who would seek their knowledge, yet ever vigilant against those who would cause wanton destruction without pausing for thought. They will wander through vast forest ranges, ensuring the safety of the forest and its denizens and coming to the aid of good beings in need. Should they come across evil beings, the patrosilvestri become less than patient, knowing that some beings simply are not open to peaceful coexistence. To their woe, such beings will find the patrosilvestri to be formidable foes.</p><p>Patrosilvestri will form unique spirit bonds with wild creatures, most often bears or wolves. Some believe they are benevolent shapeshifters, capable of assuming the form of wild creatures as they will. Indeed, some travelers within dark and tangled forests report being followed by bears that are unfearful of the presence of humanoids, remaining in cover and calmly escorting travelers of caravans through particularly dangerous regions. It is said the eyes of such bears are unusually intelligent, and if provoked will withdraw rather than attack.</p><p><strong>Bridge Between Worlds.</strong> The patrosilvestri view themselves as a bridge between worlds. On the one hand, they revere and would protect nature to their last breath, but on the other they know the inexorable and relentless pressure of civilization will always be a danger to the wild. Thus, rather than put their own lives at risk to stop it, they have chosen instead to encourage respect for nature and guide them toward a more harmonious relationship with the natural world. Humanoids are, after all, a part of nature as well.</p><p><strong>Animal Companion.</strong> In addition to being shapeshifters, patrosilverstri are frequently found in the company of other wild creatures, most notably bears. Such wild creatures treat the patrosilverstri as kindred spirits, and are affectionate and respectful toward them. The patrosilvestri themselves are similarly bear-like: stoic, strong, fiercely protective, and capable of great violence when severely provoked.</p>",

Toward that end, the most powerful of demons will often lure magically gifted mortals into their service with the lure of forbidden knowledge and power beyond measure. These beings are often known as warlocks. Warlocks who in turn prove their mettle and fealty to their masters may choose the path of the daemonium- that is, to become the living vessel through which their demon master may inhabit the realm of mortals.</p><p>Inhabiting the body of a mortal, even for a time, is excruciating for both the mortal and demon. The mortal’s mind may become ensnared within the twisted soul of the demon, and likewise the demon’s essence may become trapped within the limited and weak flesh of the mortal. Thus the two beings can only remain conjoined for a short period of time, often to provide orders and counsel to allies and other evil beings enlisted into the demon’s service.</p><p>When not possessed by their patron, a daemonium is incredibly manipulative and charismatic. They will often delight in toying with other less insightful beings, and those they cannot manipulate they will instead choose to ensnare into their master’s service through magical means. Often a daemonium is used by a demon master to start amassing a cult of followers to spread their nefarious influence throughout a region.</p><p>Each time they are possessed by their patron, a little more of their sanity ebbs away. Within a few short years of service as a daemonium, a warlock becomes little more than a shell of a being, gibbering away incomprehensibly between catatonic states.</p><p>Eventually the warlock’s body becomes so decayed and twisted that it is no longer useful, and it is cast aside by the demon in favor of another loyal servant.</p><p><strong>Demon Companion.</strong> Like many other warlocks in service to demons and fiends, smaller, lesser demons or fiends may be found within their company that have been summoned forth from the abyssal depths to serve at the demoniac’s pleasure. These creatures maintain a psychic link to the daemonium and are able to telepathically communicate with them over long distances.</p><p><strong>Gifts of Demonkind.</strong> In exchange for their service and fealty, a demon master may bestow a daemonium unique physical attributes to reflect their importance to their master. Powerful bat-like wings sprout from the demonaic’s shoulders, ending in sharpened clawed pinions capable of piercing even the toughest of steel. Horns often sprout from the forehead of the daemonium, resembling those of demonkind. Perhaps most unsettling is their garb, which magically flows about them and bears the semblance and scent of blood-soaked silk.</p><p><strong>Mental Conjoinment.</strong> In rare times where the daemonium may need assistance, they are able to summon forth a manifestation of their patron. For a time, this allows the demon to augment the demonaic’s already formidable array of magic, empowering their spells beyond that which most mortals are capable of.</p>",

Creatures must survive blistering winds, scouring sands, and relentless heat, as well as dangerous creatures specialized to living and competing in such a harsh environment. Even navigating among sand dunes is difficult, as the wind and elements are constantly shifting.</p><p>Yet there are nomadic tribes that thrive in such a harsh environment. These wasteland nomads, also known as eremudacia, travel amidst the dunes from oasis to watering hole, driving herds of livestock before them and always searching for food and water. They are wiry, hardy, and tanned by the desert sun, with intelligent dark eyes that peer from beneath their turbans or headdresses. Clad in lightweight, lightly-colored layers of fabric that protect their skin from the harsh sun and dehydration, eremudacia are easily identified even by those not familiar with desert lands. Often, they will bear long, curved ceremonial daggers as well as short, recurved hunting bows and scimitars, prized possessions that denote their status as not simply nomads, but as warriors as well.</p><p>At times, eremudacia will enter the few cities that dot the outskirts of deserts or lie within, trading and bartering for copper and bronze goods and weapons in exchange for goods they have crafted during the cold desert nights. Sometimes, wasteland nomads may be enlisted as guards for trade caravans passing through the desert, as they know well the dangers that lurk amidst the sands, as well as how to deal with such threats.</p><p>Generally, these nomadic tribes are wary of outsiders, regarding them with suspicion, but desert hospitality decrees that any being in need is welcome at the table of an eremudacia and that so long as weapons are peace-bonded, all may partake in whatever meal is to be had. Once bread is broken at such a table, guests are considered members of the tribe, if only for a time, and given their full protection. Eremudacia have a strict code of honor that they abide by at all times and they expect any they interact with to act similarly. Honor is held in such high regard that to dishonor another is considered a great shame, and a perceived slight may result in drawn weapons if one is not respectful and careful with respect to their customs. As much as the eremudacia are generous and hospitable, so do they have long memories for perceived insults.</p><p><strong>Wary of Magic.</strong> Eremudacia, much like many other desert dwellers, are highly suspicious of magic and anyone who wields it. As a fiercely proud and independent people, they fear magic may taint their minds, thus they are particularly wary of enchantments.</p><p><strong>Spiritual Connections.</strong> While they shun arcane magic, eremudacia are a deeply spiritual people, worshiping deities devoted to sand, sun, wind, and fire. They will construct elaborate tombs and ziggurats of sandstone to honor their dead and carry their belongings to the afterlife, rigged with clever traps, false walls, doors, and pitfalls to protect their earthly belongings. The location of such burial chambers is a closely guarded secret known only to members of the eremudacia.</p>",

However, ancient texts and lore describe a plethora of all but forgotten deities, some of whom no doubt would delight in spreading their influence once again through the realms of mortals.</p><p>One such being has become known only as the Secret One, whose name and memory is all but lost.

Those who do not meet the approval of the Secret One are never heard from again.</p><p>The calator ex silendonus have been tasked with restoring the knowledge of the Secret One to its former glory. Thus, the Servants of the Secret One travel the world, visiting temples, museums, libraries, and other repositories of ancient knowledge seeking the incantations and rituals that will empower their patron. In exchange, a portion of the Secret One’s essence has been in a magical blade that allows the calator ex silendonus to commune with their patron as well as granting them unique abilities that empower them in battle.</p><p>The motivations of the Secret One beyond becoming known once again are unknown.

For the most part, they are reluctant to commit any heinous acts that may draw attention to them, knowing such actions would hinder the Secret One’s ultimate goals, however, nor are they opposed to taking matters into their own hands should it meet their objectives.</p><p>Those who encounter one of the calator ex silendonus describe them as unerringly driven by their task - they may join forces with others so long as it suits their aims, but will not hesitate to leave and pursue their own goals. Stoic in nature, they are powerful fighters and magic users, battle-tested and uncompromising. They are insatiable scholars, often leafing through crumbling tomes and ancient manuscripts by firelight deep into the early hours of day. Such scholarly pursuits do not, however, prevent the calator ex silendonus from also pursuing other knowledge, and they are well-travelled, knowledgeable, and speak a plethora of languages.</p><p><strong>Pact of the Secret One.</strong> The pact of the Secret One grants the calator ex silendonus tremendous physical and magical strength when called upon, enabling them to smite their foes with great fury, but can leave the servant drained and requiring significant rest after. Very few creatures can stand before the fully unleashed might of the Secret One, and those who feel the Secret One’s full presence are often left cowering in fear before it.</p>",

They see themselves as guardians and protectors of the dense forest and all those that dwell within, and over many centuries have built many scattered villages, settlements, and outposts concealed deep within green hidden valleys. These villages are loosely organized, and while communication with each other is fairly amiable and common, for the most part they tend to prefer solitude more than socialization.</p><p>In peaceful times, elven culture is advised by a village council. Rangers, druids, and other lovers of the wild come and go as they please, though the location of elven villages are a closely guarded secret not shared with outsiders. Harmony, pursuit of artistic endeavours such as crafting, music, and integration of their architecture with nature are the primary pursuit of wood elves.</p><p>However, when orcish warbands threaten their borders, undead beings defile nearby woodlands, or a green dragon chooses to expand its territory, wood elven warriors gather under the leadership of an elected warrior, the Lord of the Forest.</p><p>The Lord of the Forest, or coppicedon, is elected from the numerous nearby village counsellors, and is respected due to their prowess in battle, careful and methodical strategic mind, and depth of knowledge regarding nature, tactics, and diplomacy.</p><p>When negotiating with outsiders, the coppicedon casts a regal bearing as the designated speaker for the unified elven forces. Clad in finely wrought glimmering mithral plate and wielding a magical blade, the coppicedon speaks in measured and careful tones, weighing each word carefully and always with respect. While slow to anger and well in control of their emotions, if provoked sufficiently the offender may well meet the keen blade of this protector of the wild.</p><p>When patrolling the woodlands on a scouting mission, ranging about gathering intelligence on enemy forces and location, or otherwise unencumbered by the duties of their elected office, the coppicedon is a clever and adept woodsman capable of tracking the most elusive quarry.</p><p><strong>Druidic Ancestry.</strong> Much like other council members and wood elves, the coppicedon’s ancestry and deep bond with nature allows them to wield primal magical forces. They draw their powers seemingly from the life force of their forest home itself, and are able to summon forth spirits of the rock, stone, root and vine to lash out against their enemies. During less turbulent times the coppicedon provides more benign services, such as those of a healer giving succor to those in need and aiding woodland creatures within their domain.</p><p><strong>For the Greater Good.</strong> While many followers of the druidic calling are bound to ensure the balance of all natural forces remain in equilibrium, the lord of the forest has no compunctions about relentlessly and mercilessly destroying those that threaten the homes of those that are under their protection. Sometimes the greater good dictates that equilibrium be disrupted for a time to ensure balance is maintained in the longer term. The balance of nature be damned should innocent lives be at stake.</p>",

Vicious creatures and sinister humanoids are perhaps the most obvious, but there are also dangers that are more subtle. There are those beings who would cheat, lie, and exploit others for their own selfish gains before simply disappearing and never to be heard from again.</p><p>Such con artists, frauds, and charlatans are known as the sycophantor, and are reviled wherever they are found. They care little for the troubles of others, instead choosing to exploit the goodwill of naive and well-intentioned beings. A scyophantor will never dally in one place too long, for when their activities are at last discovered, they leave a trail of angry victims swindled of coin and treasure.</p><p>To most beings who encounter them, a charlatan is incredibly charismatic, charming, and debonair. They may have the appearance of a wealthy noble, dressed in elegant garb and speaking as would an aristocrat. Those around them are often impressed by their knowledge of current events and clever tales, encountering them by what appears to be nothing more than random chance. Yet those in the sycophantor’s presence rarely realize the truth: that the charlatan has intentionally set up the situation, and that they have already selected their mark. Thus begins an elaborate deception that often ends with a furious victim swindled of their belongings and a newly wealthy, but vanished, sychophantor cheerfully moving on to their next scheme.</p><p>The deception often begins with a tale of misfortune, with a series of unfortunate events and calamities having befallen the sycophantor, who is now seeking the aid of powerful and reputable beings. Perhaps a family heirloom has been stolen by vagabonds, or the synchophantor was itself the innocent victim of a horrible tragedy. They add just enough detail into their schemes to seem plausible, and inject enough misfortune to draw in a softhearted fool who may wish to aid them. Weaving such lies is not without risk, however, as a sychophantor had best remember each detail lest their scheme be revealed. Often several initial truths will be woven in so that the charlatan’s marks come to believe the truth of their tale, and so even the more suspicious targets begin to trust them.</p><p>Eventually, the charlatan’s targets will come to completely trust the sycophantor, and the trap is now set. The marks will find themselves bound in some unfortunate situation while their hard-earned gold and treasures are “safely” stowed, and only once they have navigated out of whatever scheme will they return to discover both gold and sychophantor vanished.</p><p><strong>Selfish and Impulsive.</strong> The true nature of a charlatan is impulsive, selfish, and cowardly. They feel no regret for the harm their actions may cause, believing the world is divided into those clever enough to earn a living, and those clever enough to take a living. They are highly intelligent and capable of devising elaborate schemes, but often compulsive gamblers heavily in debt to collectors, thieves’ guilds, or other crime bosses, who are often introduced to the sychophantor’s new “friends” just when it is time to disappear.</p>",

The honorable are honored and the dishonorable are reviled. That somewhere is in the scrolls of the narratoresexmortu, more commonly known as the Chroniclers of the Dead.</p><p>They are difficult to identify, but if one looks carefully at the aftermath of a battle, one might see the faintest of signs of their passing - a footprint here, a disturbance in the air just there. Silently they wade through the battlefields gathering the names of the fallen and rarely gathering those who don’t wish to pass to their side as servants, to aid them in their work.</p><p>Who appoints these chroniclers is unknown. Some cultures talk of a great god - some being that sits neutral on all things simply chronicling the passage of time. Some even go so far as to say that this being writes time into existence and that on the day they stop writing, history will stop.</p><p>Whatever the truth, the narratoresexmortu, continue to do their work. For those that know how to find them, they can be a great source of comfort, a way to get closure. Often the fate of a loved one remains uncertain, but the narratoresexmortu can be relied upon to give an impartial account of the names of the fallen, even an account of their last word. These words are given after death, to the narratoresexmortu themselves, as they walk the field collecting the names, places of birth, family names and finally the method of their demise.</p><p>There is no grand temple of the narratoresexmortu. They tend to work alone, in secluded areas, although the fact that they can quickly arrive at any field of battle, makes it most likely that they have many varied ways to get wherever they need to go as quickly as they need to.</p><p>Finding one of these narratoresexmortu also depends on whether they want to be found. They are secretive by the nature of their work, and even those who know of their existence will honor their privacy.</p><p><strong>Illusion and Necromancy.</strong> Much of the magic that people have seen employed by the narratoresexmortu come from either the schools of illusion or necromancy. That they can talk with the dead is well known and more than one person has spoken at length about their ability to raise those who wish to serve from the dead. They also have the ability to hide and beguile those that would wish to interfere with them or do them harm.</p><p><strong>In Times of Great Need.</strong> There have been occasions where a narratoresexmortu have called upon adventurers to aid them - either when a battle has been especially large, or a body or bodies have been stolen. Sometimes, an evil wizard will steal bodies for experimentation and while the narratoresexmortu have no real feelings on that subject, they do wish to get information from the deceased that they would be denied without the help of adventurers aiding them in returning a body so that their journey may be chronicled.</p>",

However, a few have what it takes and quickly find a niche where they can help.</p><p>Some have ended up as the leaders of local thieves guilds, forming the ragtag dregs of a town or city into a group to be reckoned with, bringing those that had nothing up from the gutter and giving them a slightly better lot in life. Others have gone out into the wilderness, to the uncivilized lands, and become the leaders of groups of goblins or kobolds. Those creatures are often considered the true dregs, most less than monsters in the eyes of the civilized.</p><p>When they first arrive in these groups, they are met with resentment and fear, this is when many simply leave. Those with the spine to stay find that instead of the evil creatures, they find mothers, fathers and children. Miserable, pushed to live on the fringes, forced to survive on scraps. Most of those considered evil are actually desperate, trying to simply live their lives at the bottom where they were placed by civilization, for not fitting in, for not being normal according to those in charge.</p><p>Once a matercondemnabitur wins over the trust of their charges, they are fair leaders that look to care for all of their charges, mourning their losses and celebrating their victories. In some cases, they have managed to work their charges into society itself, becoming merchants, artists, bards, and even in some rare cases, living in towns alongside the other “civilized” races. In many cases, however, they raid and pillage caravans, taking what they need from societies that still consider them monstrous.</p><p><strong>Students of the Arcane.</strong> Matercondemnabitur are magic users, sent to the finest schools at a young age to learn to master the arcane. Most focus on the arts of divining, out of necessity, to keep ahead of those that would do them and their charges harm. They also possess an impressive array of spells designed to stop their enemies in their tracks and can employ magic to hide and harm. The matercondemnabitur are more than willing to protect, not just themselves, but their charges, even if it means laying down their lives to do so.</p><p><strong>Absolute Power.</strong> Unfortunately, the corrupting influence of power can be seen even amongst the matercondemnabitur, for even starry-eyed dreamers of years before come to love the power and are loath to give it up, even should it be in the best interest of their charges. Sometimes, this leads to a more tyrannical rule, although a matercondemnabitur always remains committed to protecting their charges.</p>",

At times like these, there needs to be somewhere they can be taken, somewhere capable of housing beings that can punch through solid stone. A special prison made for those who can bend bars and leap high walls.</p><p>Such a prison exists on a remote island, as far from civilization as possible, surrounded by cliffs where crushing waves repeatedly crash against the weathered rocks. Rumor has it that the only way on, or off the island is via magical gateway, controlled from offsite. It is also said that on the other side stand ten trained archers, all with bows knocked and ready. Should the wrong person walk through the portal, ten arrows will fly true straight for their hearts and then ten more would follow soon after.</p><p>However, there have been reports of escapees from this island prison —powerful monks, driven crazy by the isolation and wanting nothing more than to get back to the world. These monks in their desperation have reached new levels of power, tearing the magically enhanced chains from the walls of their cells.</p><p>Driven mad by the captivity and now in possession of a strange new power, these monks have made good their escape. Some use lesser monks to act as cannon fodder for the archers on the other side of the gate, others still moving with blinding speed so that those on the other side see only a blur. One report speaks of a monk that managed to run on the water, disappearing into the distance, after leaping from the cliffs to the sea below.</p><p>Once they have escaped, most of these insane monks choose to keep their chains, as they seem to become horrifying new conduits for their powers, crackling with force and channeled ki energy. An etfugit can easily sweep across a battlefield wielding these chains that they whip viciously beyond the range of most melee attackers.</p><p>They will ally themselves with others at times, although their unpredictability makes them treacherous companions. Above all, they wish to avoid going back to the prison, so they will attack anyone who even suggests arresting them on site, usually in a fight to the death.</p><p><strong>Magical Shackles.</strong> The chains wielded by the etfugits are magical in nature, given a sort of insane basic sentience by the monks’ efforts to escape. Some of the escaped have been seen grappling two foes at once, using their fists to beat the restrained creatures they were fighting into unconsciousness.</p><p><strong>Unpredictable.</strong> Most etfugit bear permanent marks on their psyche from their imprisonment. As companions they are hard to be around, constantly accusing people of wanting them dead, or trying to turn them in. Most parties that have one along quickly grow tired of them and some have been known to turn them in. Facing one as a foe across the field of battle is a harrowing experience, as they lash out with their chains, attempting to dismember and crush their foes.</p>",

Merchants can be found selling all manner of goods, from the mundane gear required by individuals of all walks of life to fine weaponry and armor, potions, herbs, or adventuring gear - whatever they find profitable. Whatever sort of business they run, merchants are always clever negotiators with a keen eye for a bargain, calculations of profit and loss ever in the forefront of their minds.</p><p>Mercator, as they are commonly known, are a diverse group of individuals. For those in less affluent regions, they are found in bazaars and crowded marketplaces, their voices drowned out by the constant chatter and bustle of such places. Often these mercator are offering goods of a lower quality, and are wary of thieves and pickpockets pilfering their goods as they attempt to earn a modest, but honest, living. Such individuals may only rent a space for a time to determine if they can make sufficient profit - if business is slow they can simply travel on to see if more profitable ventures may be found. In wealthy cities, perhaps enriched by trade or valuable local resources, many mercator set up permanent shops, their windows displaying top quality goods for passersby in an attempt to entice them to part with their coin. Such shops are often protected at night by sturdy locks and guards to ensure they are no easy target for thieves. While most mercator have honest operations, some will dabble in black market dealings and will often have their finer goods stored in back rooms or secret compartments, choosing only to show them to customers of more refined tastes.</p><p>Whatever business they choose to run, mercator are universally wary of potential thieves, knowing one incident may cause them to lose their whole livelihood. The cost of being insured by brokers is often prohibitive, thus security is often their number one concern. Similarly, ensuring their reputation as reputable merchants is equally as important to a mercator, as a steady stream of clientele is required to ensure a robust business succeeds. Mercator are therefore polite and accommodating individuals and know that a quality customer experience means referral clients may come by and that word of mouth spreads quickly. They are, however, tough negotiators with a keen eye for a bargain and must balance the needs of their business along with the needs of their customers.</p><p>At times, mercator may approach groups of individuals who appear to be of an adventuring sort to contract them for their services - guarding a shipment of recently purchased wares from another city or escorting a key item to an important client, for example. Other times, they themselves may enlist adventurers to seek rare goods for their clients, acting as intermediaries of a sort - for a profit, of course. Such mercator are well connected to business groups, or even, at times, the operations of thieves’ guilds.</p><p><strong>Well Connected.</strong> Through their dealings with clients, mercator have developed an extensive network of associates and contacts. Being the astute business people that they are, they may also at times trade information as well.</p>",

Their tribes slowly follow millenia old migration patterns long trodden by their ancestors. Despite their reluctance to interact with other species, centaur tribes do at times seek out the company of elves, druids, and other nature- revering, like-minded creatures.</p><p>Being inherently curious explorers and wanderers who value freedom above all else, centaurs are natural explorers. Often their curiosity will lead them to secluded and hidden places in the wild where dwell fey creatures - faeries, sprites, pixies, and other tiny mischievous creatures that delight in playing pranks on unsuspecting visitors. While perhaps they might seem opposites - tiny magical trickster and large, stoic nomad, it appears there is a deep bond between certain fey and these curious students of nature.</p><p>While centaurs greatly prefer the company of their own kind, those who encounter the magical fey tend to develop deep friendships with such creatures and may choose to resist their ancestral urges. Rather than follow the ancient paths, these centaurs choose instead to guard the wild forests, fens, and grasslands where dwell wild and fey creatures, aligning themselves with elves, druid clans, and other wild-worshipping beings. These centaurs fiercely guard their beloved wild places alongside these other like-minded beings, becoming known as the guardians of the fey.</p><p><strong>Stoic Personalities.</strong> Owing to their origins, guardians of the fey tend to be stoic and solemn in personality, which makes them an ideal target for the pranks and tricks of their wards. Their lack of a sense of humor makes it all the easier to trick them, however the fey’s pranks are always taken in stride. Similar to the centaur tribes from which they hail, the guardians of the fey regard outsiders with an inherent distrust, particularly if they do not show an appropriate respect for the wild. Outsiders are readily confronted and strongly encouraged away from the places where fey creatures dwell, though violence is used only as a last resort.</p><p><strong>Ever the Nomad.</strong> Despite their choosing to settle and protect a certain wild region, a centaur cannot fully ignore the urge to roam. Thus the guardian of the fey is constantly patrolling and exploring the wilderness based on knowledge provided by their wards. They seek out other fey creatures and wild beings throughout a vast territory, ensuring their safety. Together with their loose alliance with other protectors of the wild, the guardians of the fey ensure the integrity of their borders and investigate any instances of trespassing.</p><p><strong>Fierce Protector.</strong> Much like their kin, a guardian of the fey is a fierce warrior, charging fearlessly into battle to spit their enemies upon a pike, or spraying arrows into enemy ranks from afar. Their ability to cover great distances makes them ideally suited to scout enemy forces and intercept unsuspecting trespassers who dared disrupt their borders.</p><p><strong>Reluctant Mounts.</strong> While asking a centaur to act as a mount is regarded as a great insult to these proud creatures, there are times when it is appropriate. A guardian of the wild may offer its back to a ranger or druid if a grove is in danger, or a healer if a creature is in dire need.</p>",

In an effort to avoid such a calamity befalling their people once again, the eremita have adapted by ensuring their people are highly skilled not only in martial combat as well as the magical arts, but also in stealth and tracking any threats they may come across.</p><p>Those few eremita who venture forth to interact with other species do so out of their own inherent curiosity, perhaps believing that the time has come to reveal themselves once more. At times they may simply yearn for new experiences and adventures, and may join with small bands of adventurers provided their need for solitude and silence is respected. They prefer to avoid loud, boisterous types, believing that fewer words selectively spoken are much more powerful than many words spoken without thought. Whenever such bands enter towns and settlements for a well-earned warm meal and soft bed, the eremita will prefer to remain well outside, distrustful of all but their chosen companions and preferring the company of themselves. They may on rare occasions be enticed into roles as assassins, but generally eremita find such activities distasteful.</p><p>The eremita have an infallible sense of direction and, once they have explored an area before, can unerringly retrace their steps, though it is unknown if this trait holds true in caverns beneath the earth. They are also exceptional trackers, marking their quarry magically before tracking them over long distances to dispatch them. Darkness and brutal weather are no hindrance to the eremita, and some even claim that the weather bends to their will and shields them from detection by their prey.</p><p><strong>Ancient Origins.</strong> Scholars and historians have uncovered shreds of evidence, largely from scraps of ancient tomes and recorded oral fables, of a great conflict between members of elvenkind. Prior to their enlightenment and close association with nature, elves were more aggressive and militaristic, which led to the fracturing of the species into distinct groups that over time became distinct subraces - some preferring forests, others fled underground, and others still escaped to remote colder climates. These latter were thought to be extinct until the inexorvenator began emerging once again.</p><p><strong>One with the Darkness.</strong> The eremita are almost always clad in black and mottled greys. They are naturally silent hunters that prefer to operate in darkness to the light of day, but find their home in the shadows - all but the keenest of senses overlook their presence.</p>",

Within their private halls and villas deals are brokered between rich merchants and the nobles whose favor they seek, peace treaties and trade agreements are negotiated, and alliances forged or disrupted. Such are the ways of the wealthy that very few of the common folk have even the slightest inkling as to the deals signed and shaken upon behind closed doors.</p><p>Politicians and statespeople are often found in such courts where they hope to curry the potential favor of the rich and well connected; for where flows gold shall flow power. Amidst these individuals and more the cociators, or cunning courtiers, must navigate. Unlike those born into privilege, a cociator has risen to a place of power not through their birthright, but rather through their wits, their powers of observation, and their uncanny ability to observe what holds sway over other beings.</p><p>A cociator often rises to their position at court through slow and subtle means, first gaining favor through loyal service to a lesser noble. Over time, gaining the trust of their patron and obtaining intimate information regarding the affairs of state, a cunning courtier becomes more than adept at navigating within political circles. Before long, they are able to carry on their patron’s business affairs independently, eventually even becoming able to stand in for their sponsor at more clandestine meetings. Over time, a cociator becomes more than a subtle influence, and is able to manipulate business dealings and treaty negotiations toward their advantage with little effort, such is the influence they hold at court.</p><p>A cociator seldom speaks in direct, certain terms. More often they voice their intentions and aims in the subtlest of terms, offering only hints and nuances of their true objectives. These cloaked statements are often missed by those not carefully paying attention or or quick wit, and seldom will a cunning courtier have the patience to make their will known a second time. A cociator can make a powerful ally should they take another into their service, or a potent foe should their schemes and machinations be disrupted. Adversaries are often dealt with quietly and quickly, never to be heard from again.</p><p>The cociator is methodical in approach, their inquisitive and cold eyes carefully and rapidly surveying a scene before them. Having moved rapidly through circles of nobility they are excellent conversationalists, and have superb memories capable of retaining even the most seemingly insignificant facts. They are also highly knowledgeable, being well informed as they are, and can often provide a wealth of knowledge to those willing to offer either coin, knowledge of their own, or some other valuable exchange.</p><p><strong>Master of the Subtle Arts.</strong> In addition to their already formidable powers of observation and keen intellect, a cociator also possesses some modest magical powers to augment their dealings. On occasion the faintest traces of magical powers may follow them, as though the cunning courtier was ever so slightly weaving enchantments upon unsuspecting guests and fellow courtiers.

The general thought is that mastery in one area requires such an intense degree of honing a being’s natural abilities that it precludes training or mastery in another. Magic users often value intelligence to the exclusion of training in physical combat and vice versa. However, magical ability and physical prowess are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</p><p>While uncommon, some creatures naturally have both the physical strength and agility to be powerful warriors as well as magical abilities that are often passed down from prior generations and If taught by knowledgeable tutors, these beings can become formidable warriors able to augment their combat skills with twists of magical energies. While some of these beings choose subtle schools of magic to study, others instead choose to focus their mental energies toward the harnessing of destructive forces of fire.</p><p>Known as the ignisversutor, or firecrafters, these beings are capable of wreaking havoc upon their enemies. Immensely strong, firecrafters are highly skilled in the use of blade, axe, or polearm. Often they will use their magical abilities to ignite their blades in intense flames, which requires them to utilize magical weaponry capable of withstanding the intense heat given off by their craftings. Unlike other warriors, however, the ignisversutor tend to shun the use of heavy armor, preferring instead lighter leather armor that allows them to be more agile and carry out any precise somatic movements required of their craftings. Further, wearing lighter armor allows them to flaunt their more elegant fighting style, which also contrasts the more simple and efficient style used by other warriors.</p><p>The ignisversutor by nature are confident if not arrogant, knowing that should an interaction come to blows they are more than capable of burning their enemies to a crisp while walking away completely unscathed. Many find firecrafters intimidating and this only adds to their arrogance. Further, they tend to be quick to anger, and will seldom make any effort to disguise their feelings as their blood runs as hot as their craftings. Firecrafters, nonetheless, are admired and sought after, and finding work is seldom an issue for an ignisversutor - they often serve as bodyguards to nobility, in the vanguard of armies as mercenaries, or as adventurers.</p><p>Despite their high level of intelligence and physical strength, firecrafters tend to be rash and impulsive, rushing into situations where wiser heads may prevail. This, along with their arrogance, often leaves them vulnerable to subtle, suggestive manipulations often used by enchanters. Further, due to the intense energy required to maintain their craftings, the ignisversutor may require a longer period of rest after a prolonged period of magical castings not due to physical limitation, but rather due to the combination of physical and mental exertion required of them.</p><p><strong>Magical Prowess.</strong> Perhaps owing to the powers bestowed by their bloodline, the ignisversutor can manipulate its castings in subtle ways. Magically summoned flames are often woven into fearsome visages to impress and intimidate opponents, and the firecrafter may carefully sculpt their spells to shield any allies from the full brunt of their castings.</p>",

Sometimes these may be mundane, such as escorting a trade caravan across dangerous brigand-infested regions, or more personal - such as a desperate search for a kidnapped loved one. Some advertisements will offer a bounty or reward for the capture or elimination of some infamous criminal.</p><p>Precivenandum, or bounty hunters, are lone mercenaries who excel at taking on such assignments. Traveling from settlement to settlement, bounty hunters take on whatever assignments they can, hoping to make a name for themselves while earning good coin and notoriety while doing so. As they themselves may often have a less than virtuous past, they have minds that often think similarly to criminals - thus they understand what actions and motivations may drive such beings, allowing them to more easily anticipate their actions and track them down.</p><p>There is no mistaking a bounty hunter when they venture forth into a new town - they carry themselves with an arrogant swagger, demonstrating their weapons and tools of their trade openly for all to see. The reputation of a bounty hunter will often precede them, and a precivenandum will go to great lengths to preserve their notoriety. In taverns, they often find themselves inundated with requests for aid, yet desperate pleas will fall on deaf ears - they only choose the richest rewards to pursue. Precivenandum thus appear uncaring toward the plights of the common folk, which offer little other than satisfaction, and will leave such quests for those of a more noble and altruistic nature. Yet they will boastfully tell any and all within earshot of their latest exploits, further bolstering both ego and reputation. Each scratch, scar, and mark has a tale to tell, and one can seldom tell if their outlandish tales are gross embellishments or genuine truth. Despite their cleverness, the arrogance and attitude of a bounty hunter may blind them to danger, yet for the most part they have survived due to their skills which allow them to navigate out of many vicious situations. They lack subtlety, yet on rare occasions can be discrete if absolutely required.</p><p>Bounty hunters tend not to associate themselves with other adventurers, preferring to operate alone. Perhaps this is to avoid sharing in the spoils of a bounty, though on rare occasions where a particularly handsome reward is offered or a perceived threat is too large, they may make exceptions. Those who engage their services or associate with a precivenandum will find them difficult individuals to deal with, as they tend to be arrogant and condescending, more concerned with gold and reputation than any purpose. To a precivenandum, the end - gold - will always justify the means, and thus their methods are often brutal yet efficient.</p><p><strong>Master Tracker.</strong> Bounty hunters excel at tracking down their quarry, particularly humanoids. They understand how a criminal mind works, and take great joy in toying with the minds of their targets before making a grand entrance to take their bounty.</p>",

The horrors of battle and its aftermath may break the minds of even the strongest of warriors, causing them to flee before their enemies. Most soldiers, should they survive, are forever changed and never regarded the same by those they once knew. However, there are some who, when faced with carnage and mayhem, are veritable engines of destruction, their rage powering their arms and allowing them to shrug off even the most devastating of blows. These crazed warriors are feared no matter where they go, and are dubbed the saevar - berserkers.</p><p>Many saevar started out as nothing more than common soldiers - commoners conscripted into wars they knew little of and serving lords who cared little for them and whom they gave little thought to in return. Given nothing more than a pair of blades and the tattered remnants of armor of whatever poor unfortunates wore them before, they were thrust into combat without any preparation. Perhaps it was seeing their boon comrades or those they were conscripted alongside with slain or the realization that they needed to take a life to preserve their own that caused their minds to break, but whatever the cause the saevar’s inner rage was released to the woe of those facing them.</p><p>When not in combat, saevar are known for their fondness for excess - for excess drink, excess pleasure - anything to avoid acknowledgement of the horrors they have witnessed. They are frequently found in taverns or wherever they can soothe the remnants of their sanity. They, therefore, live as though their next day might be their last, which it very well may be as they never know when they will be called upon again. Berserkers will gamble freely and openly, spending whatever meager coin their service has provided them and may take whatever work they can find. That said, they are notoriously unreliable for any work other than fighting and are prone to random outbursts of aggression. Their attitudes are uncaring and selfish, yet within their shrouded eyes reveal a deep pain, and that they are haunted by the horrors they have witnessed.</p><p>Saevar are found in vanguards and serve as shock troops to advancing armies, sowing chaos and fear amidst their enemies. When not pressed into service, but rather on whatever mission will allow them to refill their cups, they are rash and aggressive, prone to rushing into battle whereas cooler heads may find other solutions.</p><p><strong>Berserker Rage.</strong> Whenever battle is to be joined, a saevar will enter the fray without hesitation or consideration for their own safety, often with a maniacal glint in their otherwise cold and empty eyes. They attack with reckless abandon; their strikes so wild and powerful they will often overpower even well- trained and battle-hardened warriors. When their full rage overcomes them, their blows are so devastating they often outright slay their opponent, yet those that can withstand the berserker’s onslaught will find the saevar vulnerable to counterattack. While in their rage, saevar feel neither pain nor fear, and are immune to any mind-altering effects that would stop most creatures in their tracks.</p>",

These less than savory folk are all too willing to alleviate the hardworking or wealthy alike from their hard-earned gains.</p><p>The name ereptor is often spat out by those who pass through crowded markets only to find their purses or other valuables missing. Regarded by many as the lowest and laziest of society, they are in fact anything but - it takes an uncanny amount of skill and nimble fingers to be able to pilfer another’s valuables without being noticed, never mind the ability to foresee potential escape routes or come up with convincing alibis should they be noticed or even caught. It is simply that the ereptor finds their chosen pursuits and skill set to be far more lucrative than what others may deem an honest days’ work.</p><p>Often dressed in unassuming common garb that does nothing to suggest their true nature, the ereptor are perceptive observers of other beings. They know precisely which target to select and which to avoid, and have a quick mind to calculate potential risks. They are masters of blending in with the common folk amidst who they gather, and at disguising their deeds. While at times daring to conduct their activities in broad daylight, they will primarily choose other means of concealing their deeds - often they are found at local festivals where large crowds congregate, when troubadours and other performers are distracting the masses, or in crowded markets amidst the press of humanity.</p><p>The motivations of different ereptor may vary widely - some may have learned their craft having been orphaned and needing to survive through whatever means possible, others may have been taken in by larger thieves guilds. Others still may act out of desperation, having been indebted to card sharks and crime lords, while others still may view it as their duty to steal from the rich and redistribute their wealth. Whatever their motivations, ereptor are nonchalant and generally unremarkable individuals, camouflaging their words as easily as their actions. When caught, they are silver-tongued and devious, using whatever means they can to slip out of potentially dangerous situations. They are difficult to imprison, and often have any number of lockpicks concealed upon themselves - some of which are intentionally easy for captors to find.</p><p>At times, ereptor may take up with a group of others - performers act as superb distractions, for example. Adventuring parties seeking an able lockpick may be able to entice an ereptor to join with them with the lure of riches, yet such bands had best be wary - the loyalty of an ereptor is often fleeting, and their sense of self-preservation overpowers any altruistic urge to aid others in need.</p><p><strong>Master Acrobats.</strong> The activities of an ereptor necessitate a certain degree of agility to pick a pocket or escape. Their urban territories are often crowded and difficult to move about in, thus they have adjusted by taking to rooftops and sewers that they may easily travel about. As a result ereptor are incredibly adept at leaping, tumbling, and knowing precisely where to put their feet. They are fearless at doing so, though they know well one flimsy shingle may cause them to tumble many stories down.</p>",

However, the last remaining members of some of these civilizations may still carry on, the few survivors of once proud and glorious cultures.</p><p>One of these species are members of what are known as the felisvulga, or panthera folk. Members of this race are thought to be the descendants of lycanthropes, supposedly cursed beings able to assume either the form of a humanoid or that of a ravening creature, who at some point became unable to assume either form but rather remained in a hybrid in between. In the case of the felisvugla, this meant resembling a hybrid tiger/humanoid.</p><p>Long ago, the felisvulga were driven to the brink of extinction, mistaken for more savage lycanthropes by prejudiced mobs of humanoids who slew them out of fear without considering other alternatives. Their remnants fled deep into jungles and forests, fearful for their existence.</p><p>As a race, the felisvulga are benevolent and empathetic in nature, able to innately sense the emotions of other sentient beings around them. As such they are empathetic, generous, and generally choose to coexist peacefully with other races. That said, they are deeply distrustful of others due to their brutal past and deep behind the eyes of older felisvulga lies deep regret, pain, and sadness for those bold enough to meet their eyes. Only consistent good deeds will eventually earn the trust of a felisvulga, and those who earn it will find them fiercely loyal to those they would call family. They are fearless and possess an indomitable spirit, and those who would seek to subjugate them or betray their trust will find them ferocious warriors as well.</p><p>The felisvulga are not known for their skill in crafting arms and armor, so they are clad in ill-fitting and mismatched armor salvaged from the battlefield or bartered for along their travels. Often they will remove it completely, trusting their instincts as stealthy hunters and their own inherent swiftness as defense enough against harm. They do, however, have a fondness for massive great weapons such as mauls, greatswords, or warhammers; their inherent power allowing them to wield such armaments with relative ease. In particular the felisvulga will covet magical weapons, perhaps feeling comforted by knowing that should ill befall them they will be able to protect themselves and those they care about through strength of arms and will. In addition to their massive strength, the felisvulga also possess long, razor sharp retractable claws and a mouthful of fierce canines that many humanoids not familiar with them find more than slightly intimidating.</p><p>The felisvulga possess highly sensitive senses of hearing and smell, and prefer silence to the sounds of civilization that can quickly overwhelm their senses. Loud sounds are prone to startle them, and they inherently dislike being wet and cold and thus prefer not to reside in rainy environments. They also dislike fire as it reminds them of the burning torches and brands used by those same humanoids who almost exterminated their race.</p><p><strong>Bloodrage.</strong> Despite being a civilized and peaceful species, they still possess animalistic traits.

In most societies darkness is therefore associated with fear, death, and even more terrifying - the unknown. The deepest fears of mortals dwell in the shadows, awaiting an opportunity to strike into their minds and souls. Many myths and legends have spawned from a fear of the darkness; some more truthful than others.</p><p>To other beings, darkness represents safety and seclusion from a world that would otherwise shun them should they fully emerge from the shadows. Such creatures choose to dwell in the darkness, such as in the deep places of the world that have never been touched by the light of day. Whether their deeds and intentions are malevolent or not, many beings still choose a life in darkness. The undead in particular embrace the darkness.</p><p>The umbratextor, or shadoweavers, are undead beings that tread in both light and darkness. These beings have a deep fascination with undeath, believing them to have the answer to the greatest of mysteries - the fate of the soul once the flesh is no longer capable of containing it. As such, the umbratextor are often found where dwell the undead - in vast underground caverns, catacombs, necropoli, burial grounds, and graveyards. There the shadoweavers study their subjects, believing the undead have a tale of infinity to share if only they could be properly understood.</p><p>At times the umbratextor will venture forth into “civilized” realms to interact with the living. Often warily regarded, yet tolerated as outsiders, shadoweavers are clad in inky black robes that swirl around them as would shadows dance in the gentle flicker of candlelight. Peering from behind cowls, their milky eyes are unsettling, often mismatched, inhuman, and burning with arcane energies that hint at a depth of knowledge few other mortals can comprehend. The fleeting glimpses of an umbratextor’s skin reveals grey, mottled, and withered flesh that grasps weaponry carved out of black ebony wood or blades crafted of obsidian. When they speak to others they do so in dry raspy voices that make those who hear it question whether or not the shadoweavers yet remain alive.</p><p><strong>Embrace of the Shadows.</strong> The umbratextors are powerful magic users, their natural aptitude allowing them to bend both light and darkness to their will with a trivial flick of their hand. Even the brightest torches are snuffed out by the will of an umbratextor, and even magically summoned light is muted in their presence. Those around them are protected from even the most intense of radiant and holy lights.</p><p><strong>Agent of Undeath.</strong> Perhaps more unsettling is their ability to summon forth and command legions of undead servants, the remnants of undead souls brought forth from the abyss to inhabit the deceased remains of other creatures for a time to serve the umbratextor before they are released once again. Those undead beings who exist in a permanent state often acknowledge the presence of a shadoweaver, even potentially aiding them - such is the sway they hold over the undead.</p>",

There is a middle ground, an area where many exist, unaware of their untapped power until a triggering event, or observant master comes along and reveals the hidden power within.</p><p>Such is the case with the Storm Channelers. Most appear to have no connection to any sort of power at all and for all intents and purposes, they do not. At least not in the normal sense. They are not themselves powerful practitioners of magic, they are a vessel that channels great magical energy and redirects it.</p><p>The most common form of this power is the ability to channel and redirect the energy of storms, which is what the storm channelers do. However, they are so good at it and have become so powerful that they can use the underlying energy of the world itself to draw in such energy, shooting devastating bolts of lightning from their hands on even the clearest of days.</p><p>While lightning is an impressive use of their abilities, it is not the only use. Many practitioners have been known to tap into the actual weave and draw energy directly into themselves and then channel that energy into other practitioners of magic. This ability seems to work for most forms of magic; bystanders swear they have seen a channeler empower a priest’s spells to heal the wounds of an injured soldier that the priest had declared beyond any hope of recovery, even growing back a missing arm in the process.</p><p>Their ability to channel energy makes them fierce opponents, some claim that they have even seen the channelers draw in the energy of a spell in flight and take it into themselves, only to direct it back at the caster. In one case, the bystanders claim a wizard had cast a fireball at the channeler, only to be consumed by his own fireball seconds later!</p><p>Like any other form of power manipulation, there are drawbacks. Manipulating the flow of a spell mid-flight has been known to cause it to actually do double damage to its original target, or target the fulmenaris themselves. One story tells of a fulmenari redirect the attempts of a bard that was charming a local lord with his enchanted words. Instead of redirecting the spell back on the bard, they redirected it onto themselves.</p><p><strong>No Preparation.</strong> Unlike other magic users, Channelers do not need to prepare spells, as they do not actually cast them. They use the energy around them to create spell attack blasts that can be used either as ranged or melee attacks. They can also redirect other spells, causing them to fly at another opponent, to do this they actually re-cast the spell, just without having to use any components. At times this effect goes wrong and the Channeler themselves is damaged by the feedback of a spell gone awry.</p><p><strong>Pump up the Volume.</strong> Should a group of adventurers include a Channeler, they can often use their abilities to pump up the power of the spell, granting the wizard, warlock, priest, or sorcerer the ability to cast a spell as it were a much more powerful version of the same spell from a much more experienced wielder of magical energies.</p>",

They are not seen sporting full plate armor or riding great warhorses, nor will they be found praying at temples. Many other knightly orders, in fact, look down upon the Knights of the Eagle as an aberrant order and refuse to acknowledge their knight status when they cross paths. The Knights of the Eagle seldom care however, as their only focus is their holy mission.</p><p>They have sometimes been called the Knights of the Green, as well, for the green cloaks they wear and also for their focus on nature. Some have, in fact, claimed that they are closer to a druidic order than an order of knights. The knights do indeed have an affinity for nature and count many woodland spirits as their allies. However, their order is divine in nature, not attuned to the spirits of nature.</p><p>Their main focus is on weeding out corruption and aberrations that occur in the natural world; hunting down evil creatures that would corrupt the land as well as those who have turned against the land, corrupted by evil spirits or their own warped sense of right and wrong.</p><p>They are an order dedicated to keeping the balance of nature and so tend less towards the saving of innocents and more about the careful application of the right amount of effort to keep things properly balanced.</p><p>Wielding their eagle-shaped swords, with which they can use to call upon an eagle companion to fight by their sides, they wade out into the wilderness, at home as any ranger or druid, and battle any that would put the balance of nature in jeopardy.</p><p>When not in nature, they can be found in many large towns and cities, often looking to join other adventurers on their quests, especially those that are heading out into the wilds. To these, they can offer a wealth of knowledge on the world around them. Many a party has spoken of being saved by the inclusion of a Knight of the Eagle from an ignominious death in the wilds, due in large part to their great skill at surviving in the wilds and their way with the beasts of the wild.</p><p><strong>Nature and Divine Magic.</strong> While equitesaccipitres wield the magic granted to them by their gods like most holy orders, they augment this with the magic of nature and many amongst their numbers have been known to be able to summon creatures such as dryads or satyrs to come fight at their sides. This also augments their healing spells, as they combine natural magic with that of the upper planes.</p><p><strong>A Sacred Balance.</strong> The Knights of the Eagle focus on maintaining balance. This means that the high flung ideals of other lawful orders of knights do not work here. Much like the trees of the forest, the Knights of the Eagle ebb and flow like the seasons, always maintaining the balance, always in tune with it. For this reason, they have aroused the ire of many people over the years. Possibly stopping groups of loggers from entering a forest only to allow others to do so years later. To them it is not a matter of stopping humans from being part of the natural order, just directing them to the right use. Sometimes trees need to fall to make room for more and sometimes a human needs to suffer the cold to learn when not to interfere with the balance of the natural world around them.</p>",

While some despoil and destroy out of selfishness, revenge, entertainment, or even for reasons that aren’t discernible to the outside observer, others of a more calculating nature sow chaos and discord as part of a grand strategy.</p><p>The apophiprael, or warriors of chaos, are disciples who pay homage to the gods of chaos, trickery, and deceit. While to others it may seem a huge risk to honor such deceptive beings, it suits the apophiprael perfectly, for neither mortal nor deity trust one another - creating a delicate balance where the patron god provides just enough of their secrets to tantalize the servant, and in return the servant’s thirst for power and lust for destruction furthers the aims and satisfies the ego of the god.</p><p>The apophiprael themselves by nature are selected by their patron gods due to their cunning, their unpredictability, and their excessive egos. Often the gods will whisper promises of untold power in exchange for service in their sleep, slowly driving an already unstable mind into more and more chaotic and irrational patterns. Over time, dreams turn to reality, until the warriors of chaos eventually are able to converse with their deity during their waking hours - or so they believe. As a result, the apophiprael are at times found conversing seemingly with themselves, and those around them cannot decipher the truth.</p><p>An overinflated ego is often the hallmark of an apophiprael - they have an unhealthy view of their own prowess while dismissing other beings rather nonchalantly. Self-centered and egotistical, they make no effort at all to hide their true nature, and therefore are widely distrusted and disdained by other beings of any belief system - the apophiprael are just as likely to stab a “friend” in the back as they are to share a tankard of ale. Often their egos lead to open conflict with others who take offense to them, and many times one party or the other walks away with grievous wounds, if they can walk away at all. But to an apophiprael, everything is taken in jest, or as they would describe it, “good fun”.</p><p>The gods of chaos and trickery do not distinguish between races when choosing their disciples. Their only criteria appears to be self-centeredness and a predisposition toward violence. They tend to blend into society and groups rather well, and at first may seem rather charming. However over time those around them may notice odd occurrences happening - a missing coin purse here, a misplaced weapon, or flickers of unusual magic deceiving their senses even when no other creatures are present.</p><p>If an apophiprael does join forces with a band of adventurers, it is to further their own self-centered goals, and before long they will become bored and disengaged before eventually deciding to leave - many times at the most inopportune moments, and in spectacularly violent ways.</p><p><strong>Chaos Fighters.</strong> The apophiprael have no code of conduct nor reason behind their unpredictable behavior. However, they have the martial prowess to back their egos, and are both fearsome warriors and capable magic users. The magical abilities locked away in their minds are both powerful and unpredictable, capable of both comical and devastating outcomes. Their blades are the manifestation of their powers, vibrating with the forces of chaos simply waiting to be unleashed.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Moon Worshippers</em></p><p>The worship of the celestial bodies is perhaps the oldest known religion practiced by what many beings now view as pagans. These beings had a deep reverence to the spirits of nature, worshipped the sun and moon for their influence on the cycles of nature - influencing everything from the seasons to the ebb and flow of tides, and even somewhat influencing the behaviors of beings to an extent.</p><p>While such pagan worship has largely died out in favor of the devotion to newer gods, there are those who still adhere to the old ways. Often these individuals will conceal their true nature rather than face the scrutiny and judgement from other religions, and meet in secret gatherings to conduct their ceremonies and continue time-honored traditions during equinoxes and solstices, and more rare events such as celestial alignments.. These individuals are known as the lunacultricem, or moon worshippers.</p><p>Lunacultricem are powerful magic users, said to be able to fully wield their powers during the full moon. It is during these times when they are able to harness the powers of nature to influence weather, summoning forth gentle and consistent rains to aid in the growing season, prevent devastating hail from ruining crops and thus preventing famine, or mitigating the worst impacts of massive wind storms. They will gather at ancient barrows, druid circles, or other places of power to conduct their rituals or simply discuss if current events necessitate intervention on their behalf. Often their deeds go unnoticed by beings who would be affected by them.</p><p>When not gathering and conducting their rituals and ceremonies, lunacultricem often lead rather mundane lives. Unlike other druidic peoples that may prefer to avoid civilization, the lunacultricem may choose to live at the outskirts of civilization where they can be closer to the hustle and bustle of common folk, yet also remain close to nature. They are often respected healers and herbalists sought after for their wisdom on matters both great and small. Also unlike many other druids, they seldom turn others away, but freely offer their expertise and counsel to those who seek it.</p><p>Perhaps the only thing the lunacultricem truly revile would be creatures of darkness who would wreak havoc upon beings seeking a peaceful existence. The presence of evil lycanthropes and undead in particular are not tolerated by moon worshippers, and are sought out and driven away by lunacultricem that band together to confront such threats. However, they would largely prefer a peaceful existence rather than pick up arms against other beings.</p><p><strong>Strength in Numbers.</strong> When gathered in their groves, lunacultricem are able to fully harness their collective powers. While an individual moon worshipper is a powerful magic user by themselves, when gathered together their powers are significantly amplified. A grove of lunacultricem conducting their rituals at ancient places of great power are mighty indeed, capable of great deeds - summoning the greater forces of nature, causing massive regeneration of great swaths of devastated forest, changing weather patterns for weeks to come, or event resurrecting the dead.</p>",

Nomadic spirits who thrive on adventure and exploration, they are inherently curious by nature and find great joy in exploring and observing the wilderness. They have a particular fondness for creatures of the woods, many of whom will accompany a mysticusilva on their many adventures.</p><p>While ferociously loyal to their friends, family, and allies alike, mysticusilva are known as pranksters, and will spend much of their time contriving elaborate tricks and schemes to play on their “victims”. A melodious cackle will echo amidst the forest glades where they remain hidden, having watched an unsuspecting target fall for yet another scheme.</p><p>However, when the need arises mysticusilva will challenge evildoers without hesitation. Their clever nature allows them to set elaborate traps and challenge much more powerful foes than they would otherwise be capable of, and in combat they are strong, cunning, and determined. Few enemies are capable of withstanding the onslaught of the twin enchanted blades that are infused with the very life force of the woods, and in dire times mysticusilva can summon forth woodland allies to aid in the defense of the forest they love so dearly.</p><p><strong>Aerial Combatant.</strong> From a young age, mysticusilva are incredibly agile and a studious learners. They spend little of their time idle, preferring instead to leap amongst treetops via vines, ropes, and swings; their feet seldom (if ever) touching the ground. Few creatures can hope to match their agility and even those who can are often met with merely shadows by the time they think they have a mysticusilva cornered.</p><p><strong>Cunning Assassin.</strong> Mysticusilva are typically patient and observant, at times tracking their opponents silently from the shadows, observing and noting any potential weaknesses. Once the timing is correct, they will drop from the trees, rapidly dispatching an enemy before fading away into the tangle of the forest once more. At times, a mysticusilva has been known to set elaborate traps for her foes.</p><p><strong>Mischief Managed.</strong> Particularly mischievous individuals, mysticusilva are typically labeled as pranksters. Not only will their traps target enemies, but friends and family as well. Mysticusilva are often several steps ahead of those they have targeted, and at times the only clue a bewildered victim has regarding the prankster’s identity is a good-natured and melodious cackle echoing in the distance.</p><p><strong>Arcane Blades.</strong> The mysticusilva wield a twin set of finely crafted blades, etched with ancient elven runes of power. Crafted for by a legendary elven artificers, the magical symbols on these blades glow and crackle with fury whenever evil creatures are near. Beyond keen, any evil creature who feels the caress of these blades also feels the wrath of nature when in skilled hands.</p>",

Rather than taming the wild, they have adapted to it and grown stronger as a result.</p><p>A vulpesnix is actually two creatures living in symbiosis. One is a humanoid; the other is a fey fox- like creature. The two form a bond for their mutual survival which becomes permanent —often the bond occurs when both creatures are quite young. Among the tribes and towns of their lands, it has become a great honor to be chosen to become a Vulpesnix.</p><p>The fey fox rests on the recipient’s shoulders, looking for all the world like a fox shawl, which has caused contention amongst those in more populated lands that have issue with that sort of thing. That is at least until they notice that the fox is actually blinking and that it can speak!</p><p>The bond is permanent and neither can live without the other once it occurs. This works well for the foxes as they have only a very short life span without a host, no more than five years. For the humanoid, they gain a number of advantages from the bonding, including a slightly increased life span and a resistance to the cold.</p><p>Much like any other creature, the snow foxes are neither predominantly good or evil, but a spectrum ranging from those that pursue truth and justice to those that wish only to serve themselves. The fey fox decides who they want to bond with, so a parity of mind is essential, meaning that the fox will seek out those like itself.</p><p>Vulpesnix have been seen helping the poor and the sick. Some hit the road to seek adventure and make great companions with their many varied gifts, and many spend their lives meditating, attempting to gain insight to the secrets of the universe.</p><p><strong>Dual Nature.</strong> Due to their blended nature, the snow foxes have the benefits of two minds instead of one. This makes them very resistant to any magic, charms, or controls. They also have heightened senses of both sight and smell. All four eyes function and the fox can move its head, , so it is almost impossible for a snow fox to be surprised. The bonding also gives the snow fox great endurance and they find it easy to run for greater distances than most without tiring.</p><p><strong>Foxy Magic.</strong> The vulpesnix also have some innate magical abilities, which come from its fey heritage. It excels in using those magics that help to disguise and beguile, the fey part of it preferring to trick its enemies than face them directly. Because of the blending, as well, the snow foxes count as fey regardless of what their humanoid form was before the blending.</p><p><strong>Fey Lands Hideaway.</strong> Harnessing their fey ancestry, a vulpesnix can magically enter a pocket dimension, which serves to rejuvenate them for a short time.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Metalcrafters</em></p><p>From a young age, many creatures are tested for the ability to manipulate the energies that are intertwined in the universe. A select few are chosen and trained in the mystical arts, becoming powerful sorcerers and wizards. Most individuals fail such tests and go on to live more mundane lives. However, sometimes an individual may fail all the assigned tests but one - the ability to sense and manipulate a simple metal spoon. While rare, this ability has become known as metalcrafting. Individuals possessing this unique attunement are especially trained as elite warriors, as their ability to sense metal allows them not only to wield such weaponry with an elegance and prowess that few can match, but also allows them to sense and anticipate strikes made against them before a blow is dealt.</p><p>Through their rigorous training these individuals become powerful and agile fighters, bearing even the heaviest plate armor with relative ease. Known as the ananciteques, or metalcrafters, often they find service in elite military units or special corps. They are often found in the vanguard of advancing armies, deployed as shock troops to wreak havoc upon opposing forces, intimidating them into submission.</p><p>Other ananciteques find service as bodyguards to higher nobility, their innate metalsense allowing them to sense hidden daggers and other weaponry while protecting their employers. Some even take up adventuring, seeking fame and fortune. After a long career, those metalcrafters who survive often seek a quiet life and take up blacksmithing - often they are regarded as some of the finest blacksmiths in the world, their blades perfectly balanced and edges keen, their crafted armor intricate and light despite providing excellent protection.</p><p>Metalcrafters are seldom seen out of their gleaming and well-maintained plate that they don as though wearing a second skin. Despite being so heavily armored, the move with a grace and fluidity seldom seen in any but the best trained warriors. Those closest to them may jest that they even sleep in their armor and only remove it to relieve themselves, to which the ananciteque may simply smile in response.</p><p>By nature these warriors tend to be loyal and true, though they are often also somewhat overconfident, even bordering on arrogance. As they are only highly possessive of their arms and armor, they will rarely comply with a request to hand over their blade, preferring instead to peace-bond them as a concession, knowing however through their metalcrafting abilities they are more than capable of removing such a lock. Should their hosts insist, a metalcrafter will often stubbornly refuse admittance rather than be parted from that which makes them who they are.</p><p><strong>Metalsense.</strong> The nature of the ananciteques metalsense is mysterious, as it appears to defy common knowledge of magic. What is known is that it allows a metalcrafter to innately sense the orderly arrangement of a metallic structure. This ability appears to be stronger with more refined metals such as steel and adamantine, though it appears this ability is less potent with raw or unrefined ores found naturally. This allows them to sense incoming metallic weapon blows with uncanny anticipation, yet they remain unaware of weapons made of wood, bone, or any other material.</p>",

As a result, magic users are seldom found within these tribes, as bloodlines that grant such gifts have historically been driven away or slain due to fear and prejudice. Paradoxically these tribes are however quite spiritual, believing in gods of sand, wind, fire and death as their primary deities. They will worship these gods in rarely observed religious ceremonies that few outsiders have been privy to.</p><p>The religious leaders of these nomadic tribes will lead ceremonies and incantations to their deities, who rarely respond. However, on occasion these gods do see fit to bestow their faithful with gifts, doing so in front of all members of the tribe to ensure that the vessels for their divinity are respected and worshipped. It has been said that these sand priests are bathed in a mystical light and the voices of the gods boom forth, decreeing the mystasaburra as their representative in the lands of the mortals. Whether or not true, the eyes of a sand priest radiate an inner light that those bold enough to meet their gaze may see. The mystasaburra are forever changed if called upon to serve their gods, speaking no more in earthly voices, but rather in the grave otherworldly tones.</p><p>As very few nomadic tribes record their history in text, preferring to pass down ancient knowledge and legend via song and fable instead, only a few mystaburro who are truly vessels of the divine are thought to have existed. These are often precursors to times of great wars waged upon others by nomadic peoples - other tribes, upon hearing word of the presence of the gods among them will rally to the tribe of the mystasaburra and create fierce and deadly armies of nomadic warriors. Such great armies are directed forth to conquer neighboring lands, and only through great sacrifice have they been resisted.</p><p>Those who are fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to be in the presence of a mystasaburra will find them to be utterly convinced in their own divinity, and possessing of knowledge most mere mortals could not possibly understand. They are charismatic and cruel, their tribes entirely subservient to their every order, and they do not tolerate disobedience. Those before them had best show appropriate respect, else the wrath of the mystasaburra’s god-granted powers fall fall upon them.</p><p><strong>Powers of the Desert Gods.</strong> Mystasaburra are said to have knowledge from beyond the grave, capable of raising the dead to serve them or resurrecting members of their tribe. Wind, fire, and death are theirs to command however they see fit, and it is not unusual for them to create mummies and other undead. However, such unsettling powers may raise alarm among desert tribes, and it is not uncommon for a mystasaburra to lose their grip on power should they choose such dark paths.

While under construction and even when fully inhabited, dwarvenholts are favored targets of less than noble beings who would seek to plunder dwarven riches for their own. Thus dwarves must remain even vigilant against invasion.</p><p>Dwarven society is highly structured and members of individual clans bear a strong sense of loyalty and identity with other members of their clan.

The collimperator are elected by their clan, and are often selected for their age, experience, courage, loyalty, and acts in service to their clan. Seldom are adventuring dwarves selected for such an honor as they are viewed as seeking their own glory as opposed to glory for the clan, though should war befall the clan it is not uncommon for a dwarven warchief or a warrior of great deed to be elected as a collimperator.</p><p>Lords of the mountain are easily distinguished from others in dwarven society not just through their demeanour, which is particularly commanding, but through their finely wrought armor that is both intricate and functional. Often inlaid with gemstones and crafted to the finest specifications, the armor of a collimperator is a wondrous sight and may have taken a full decade to craft. Whenever a great deed in service of their clan is performed, the collimperator’s armor is inlaid with runes telling the story of their great deeds. Equally impressive are the weapons they bear - massive warhammers crafted in the likeness of fearsome beasts or even double-bladed battle axes etched with scenes of battles past. When a collimperator passes into death, these cherished belongings are entombed in stone with their body, and the crypts of dwarven lords are carefully guarded.</p><p>As with most dwarves, collimperator are loyal, true to their word when it is given, and decisive in their actions. They do tend to be wiser in their maturity however, and younger dwarves may be more impulsive. They listen carefully and give weight to each word spoken, but listen more to deeds. They are particularly stubborn, even for dwarves, when they have made a decision and seldom will they stray from their path once decided. They are quite skeptical of unknown individuals, and will often ask for actions to prove the trustworthiness of outsiders.</p><p><strong>Generous and Loyal.</strong> To their allies, collimperator are generous and loyal, often sharing resources with other nearby settlements in times of need. They respect industriousness, and those who earn their respect and loyalty earn that of their clan so that in times of need allies need only ask for their aid.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Beastmasters of the Wilds</em></p><p>Some humanoids prefer to spend their time in the company of wild, feral beasts rather than in the realms of other sentient beings. To those who have learned the ways of nature, wild creatures are often more predictable than so-called civilized beings, and more trustworthy. Often beings of a magical bend and a deep respect for nature will choose to enter the wild, often for years at a time, learning the ways of survival,bonding with the spirits of nature, and delving into the mystical energies that bind all life together.</p><p>While many of these magic users derive their powers from ancient druidic rituals and teachings, the feradomnus, or beastmasters, will tap into the living essence of wild fauna as opposed to being bestowed power from a greater spirit of nature.</p><p>Unlike necromantic magics which siphon such life energy, these animal bonds instead become a mutual sharing of life force, binding a beastmaster to its chosen animal spirit, or even several. This allows both man and beast to assume traits similar to each other - a lithe but muscular feradomnus bound to the spirit of a wolf may have elongated canines, develop a keener sense of smell, move in patient, predatory motions, and be prone to becoming impatient during particular lunar cycles, for example.</p><p>In turn, the spirit-linked beast becomes more than a mere trained animal companion or hawking bird - they develop a greater intelligence, are able to direct others of their kind with greater cunning, and can strategize to hunt prey. Many creatures unfamiliar with a feradomnus-linked beast will often mistake them for a druid in animal form.</p><p><strong>Eyes of the Beast.</strong> The feradomnus is capable of peering through the eyes of its companion, and likewise its companion can behold whatever the beastmaster senses. This ability appears to be of unlimited range, though few have actually tested this — often the linked pair of beast and humanoid are found in close proximity with one another. Should they be separated by a great distance, it would be akin to having a portion of one’s soul ripped away, and both their mystical bond and their shared strengths melt away.</p><p><strong>Feradomnus Bonds.</strong> A feradomnus can bond with any creature that is a beast with a CR of 2 or less by completing a ritual that takes 1 hour. When bonded, both the feradomnus and its beast companion gain additional traits, as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The feradomnus gains the Paladin’s Lay on Hands ability, which can restore up to 20 hit points. This ability can only be used on its beast companion.</p></li><li><p>The beast companion has the maximum number of hit points for its Hit Dice, instead of average hit points.</p></li><li><p>The feradomnus and the beast companion have advantage on attack rolls if they can see or hear each other.</p></li></ul>",

However, the future is an ever shifting tangled mess of branches that reality might take, and as such, predictions and foresight of the future is notoriously unreliable. Often diviners will only offer a glimpse of a potential future rather than that which is immutable.</p><p>More reliable is the ability to peer into the past and obtain knowledge of events that have already happened, yet this ability is not so coveted as being able to foresee the future. Often diviners are able to accurately describe past history, providing minute details that allow the reconstruction of an event or occurrence that is the object of the diviner’s study.</p><p>Studying the art of divination with respect to time requires an intensive amount of training and care, for the glimpses a diviner can obtain may be unreliable or tell an incomplete picture. A seer can go many weeks or even months without catching the slightest premonition. Over time they can learn to control these visions and delve deeper into them. However, delving too deeply into either past or future is not without dangers, as one can easily lose track of what is past, present, and future.</p><p>The aestaveneficus are well-studied seers who have peered long and hard into both the past and the future. As a result, time to them is all concentrated into a single instant, and past, present, and future all overlap. Their utterances are seldom understood by those they interact with, and teasing desired information out of a manipulator of time is nigh impossible. To those who do not understand the intricacies of divination, the aestaveneficus might seem quite insane, their statements all of equal urgency even if the event they are observing has passed and can no longer influence the present. Their cryptic speech is often regarded by layfolk as raving madness, so the aestaveneficus will often live as hermits, rarely visited except by those wise enough to seek their counsel and clever enough to decipher it.</p><p>Adding to the perceived eccentricities of the aestaveneficus are their odd dress and mannerisms.</p><p>They are often clothed in a strange assortment of fashions, many from the past and some undoubtedly from the future, perhaps crafted by the manipulator of time (though some speculate the aestaveneficus have in fact traveled to the future to bring such clothing back).</p><p><strong>Peaceful by Nature.</strong> Having seen the atrocities of the past as well as those that have not yet come to pass, the aestaveneficus are pacifists who will take no direct action to harm another being. They will utilize their magical powers only to seek the truth, though they will protect themselves and others from harm if they should deem other creatures worthy, having observed their past and potential futures. The aestaveneficus have witnessed enough spilled blood to last a thousand lifetimes.</p><p><strong>Time Manipulators.</strong> As the aestaveneficus have an intimate knowledge of both past and future events, they are able to warp reality around them and those nearby.

An order of wizards dedicated to the manipulation of the very stuff that makes up the cosmos. As such, they tend towards magics that call upon the forces of the heavens and the manipulation of time and space.</p><p>Wizards of the school of Galaxy magic that have the skill to manipulate the very fabric of space and time typically become aristocrats. Well dressed, arrogant, and above all else, powerful; used to being treated as above the rest of society.</p><p>While their powers have never been fully documented, those who have borne witness to displays of their power attest that spatiumnecdivinos have power over not only the elements, but time itself; able to slow or speed its flow or to call down meteors from the heavens to smite their foes.</p><p>They, along with a select few of their rival schools, are considered above the law in their lands and tend towards either decadence and debauchery or worse. Some have been known to conduct experiments on their fellow, but mundane humanoids, knowing that they will not face any repercussions because the law does not apply to them.</p><p>They look down on those without magic and even those who perform magics they consider base, such as the druidic or sorcerous schools of magic. Even clerics are held in low regard as the wizards of spatiumnecdivinos consider themselves one very small step removed from gods and could never imagine being subservient to one. For those who have no magic, they have pity at best and violent disdain at worst, and consider those as sometimes less than human.</p><p>To meet a member of the order is to meet a powerful practitioner of magic, one in touch with the very cosmos. It is also to meet someone devoid of common decency and any feeling for their fellow man, if that fellow lacks magical ability. When one considers the very gods to be little more than peers, one does not consider other humanoids to be members of the same species.</p><p><strong>Aristocratic Bearing.</strong> Wizards of the spatiumnecdivinos are the epitome of style and grace. They expect to be treated as they are accustomed, as the pinnacle of society, and will become incredibly offended should someone not do so.</p><p><strong>Magical Endowments.</strong> While many look exactly as they appear, some (especially those who are getting along in years) turn to magic to endow them with the youth they have lost. A few even go so far as to magically enhance their hair or other features, pulling them up into impossible shapes, all in the name of vanity. Should someone cast dispel magic on a member of the spatiumnecdivinos, it is even money whether they would still see the same person, or a much changed and chagrined wizard in front of them, stripped of their youthful grace.</p><p><strong>Galaxy Globes.</strong> When the spatiumnecdivino extends its hand, it can manipulate the very fabric of reality and bring forth a globe of stellar particles. Any creature hit by these particles is assaulted by the extreme cold of space and the extreme heat of a star at the same time.</p>",

Arguably greater dangers lie within, particularly for the unsuspecting or naive. Most creatures will pursue an honest living, yet there are some choose instead to prey upon others.</p><p>The sacculari are not known for their subtlety, their cunning, or their foresight. Rather, they are direct and impulsive, using brute force to obtain whatever coin and valuables they can. Often found in areas of cities less frequented by members of the law, these cutpurses skulk in hidden alleys, waiting for drunken tavern patrons to stumble forth into the night. Once outside, away from tavern bouncers and the relative safety of numbers, sacculari find easy prey in lone targets or even small groups - at times these ruffians will band together and form loosely allied bands to better relieve their victims of coin. Should one particularly clever and coercive member step forward they may even begin to form criminal organizations, but owing to the nature of their members, such groups are fragile, prone to infighting, and tend to have rapidly changing leadership as their former bosses conveniently disappear rather frequently.</p><p>There is no mistaking a sacculari - burly and ill-kept, their clothing is usually grubby and in poor condition. They are boorish and threatening toward others, particularly when they consider themselves at an advantage over their targets. While initially they may firmly request a target simply hand over their coin, things rapidly escalate should they not get their way - cutpurses have no issues with making open threats against those they view as weaker than themselves.</p><p>The only possessions a sacculari appears to value are their weapons - crossbows are oiled and well maintained, and daggers are kept sharpened and ready for use. These they will carefully conceal, preferring the threat of fists to intimidate their enemies at first. Knowing the repercussions of drawing weapons may be severe if caught or if their potential victims are up for a fight, they choose to not play their hand too aggressively - at first.</p><p><strong>Cowardly Nature.</strong> Despite their aggressive and uncultured approach, sacculari are cowards by nature and will hesitate to actually engage in combat. They greatly prefer bluffing and intimidating other beings into submission, and will flee if opposed by stronger creatures they may have misjudged. They have a strong sense of self preservation, and if unable to escape they quickly yield and become much more acquiescent - at least until they are able to slip a dagger into the back of whomever embarrassed them.</p><p><strong>Dirty Tricks.</strong> Cutpurses are not known for their virtuous ways - they may lure their unsuspecting victims into blind alleys, where their allies may encircle them before violently beating and mugging them. Other times, for more rich or dangerous- looking creatures, they may choose to encircle them and use the threat of several well-placed crossbow bolts to intimidate. At times they may attempt to deceive their victims into simple traps. Should they fail to intimidate their victims, a sacculari may employ any number of dirty tricks on their targets. Such a lifestyle cares not at all for honorable combat, so they may blind their opponents with handfuls of dust.</p>",

In a chaotic and dangerous existence, few have the courage to stand firmly for their righteous beliefs, and fewer still are those who have the power and fortitude to also take up arms to aid those in need.</p><p>The equesanctus, also known as the holy knights, belong to an order devoted to protecting the less fortunate. These knights are oathbound to protect and provide succor to the common folk: from the diseased outcasts to the desperate beings whose life is a daily struggle the equitisanctus are their patient guardians, their benevolent protectors, and their sword of vengeance should those they have sworn to protect be mistreated.</p><p>The equesanctus by the very nature of their oath are destitute themselves, their only earthly possession of value being the well worn but finely wrought armor that they themselves crafted. Their armor is elaborately engraved by the holy knight themselves, a representation of the folk they have had the honor witnessing. Rather than tell the tale of their own numerous glorious deeds performed in the service of others, these engravings instead recount the witnessed noble actions of those who the history books will inevitably neglect - the stories of a starving boy giving their last crust of bread to a fellow urchin, of a humble priest tirelessly treating plague victims even as their own strength drains away, or the countless other selfless acts that go untold. When donned, the armor of the equesanctus not only protects the holy knight, but also represents their unerring devotion to others.</p><p>Often members of the equitisanctus themselves were orphans and runaways, taken in by benevolent priests and clerics who taught them the righteous ways of justice for all. Turning away from a life of vengeance and retribution while knowing precisely what treading along that path means the equitisanctus possesses a level of empathy for others seldom found in an often harsh and unforgiving world. They speak their truth firmly, clearly, and in such a tone that stirs the like-minded to action, granting them courage and fortitude to take on the path of righteousness. However, they may be infuriating to those of less than altruistic motives, which suits the equesanctus perfectly - they would greatly prefer to drive away such beings rather than even tolerate a hint of any ulterior motive.</p><p><strong>Seekers of Justice.</strong> Clad in their earth-soiled cloaks and grasping their well-worn blades in hand, the equesanctus are well travelled, their unending pursuit of a path of virtue for all driving them forward. They will be found travelling wherever injustices are found, and they never shy away from challenging those who would oppress the helpless. Such travels are fraught with peril, and the holy knights bear more than their share of scars as they seek to heal others of the same. They are steadfast, loyal, and possess a commanding inner peace.</p><p>Oath of Justice. The conviction of the equesanctus is so tangible that all those within their presence feel their strength. The fearful feel emboldened, the weak feel the strength returning to their limbs, and the diseased are cured of their afflictions. Evil beings in the presence of such a pure and noble soul are often driven away, as the aegis of the holy knights wards those who are worthy of their protection.</p>",

Their spite is so powerful that they refuse to pass into the void, and instead will remain and attempt to latch onto another being that they may carry out their dark deeds once again.</p><p>These dark spirits have lingered, potentially for millennia, perhaps even aided by the most evil gods themselves to spread their malignant woes. While for the most part they remain in a greatly weakened state and can only subtly influence the minds of other beings - often in the form of nightmares and fleeting sinister thoughts, they will at times encounter a like-minded being - remorseless murderers, corrupted wizards, or even soldiers who through countless battles and horrible deeds witnessed have lost the last vestiges of their sanity. These beings are particularly susceptible to the bitter influence of such dark spirits, which find a corner of a vulnerable mind to begin spreading their corruption. Over time, this dark spirit completely subjugates their victim thereby taking over its host that it may sow chaos upon the world once again.</p><p>Known as the caculanox, these servants of darkness are the embodiment of pure evil. Their knowledge of the occult magical arts is deep, perhaps gleaned from examining or even inhabiting the minds of potentially countless beings. Thus their intellects are vastly superior to those of any mere mortal, and the caculanox have an ego to match. They regard any other being as inferior, and make no effort to hide their disdain for others. They may at times take servants from those they deem as lesser, provided that they offer sufficient value to the caculanox, though they view such beings as disposable and may slay them on a whim.</p><p>The caculanox are unmistakable, clad in fine pure black garb and surrounded by grovelling slaves. Perhaps the most undeniable identifying feature is their eyes, which emit an eerie, cold otherworldly light from within that indicates their true nature. Despite their formidable array of magical powers and keen intellect, the full possession of another requires a vast amount of energy. Thus while a caculanox may inhabit a vigorous and young being, it rapidly drains the body of its vitality over time - perhaps a year or two, before the body falls into ruin. At this point, the body becomes infirm, and the caculanox spirit will relinquish its control to leave a shattered husk behind and go in search of another - a process that may take decades. However, to such a long lived spirit, this is well worth the wait to unleash chaos upon the world once again.</p><p><strong>Dark Magics.</strong> The caculanox possesses a knowledge of black magic deeper than that of any necromancer. With a mere flick of its finger, it may drain the vitality from any nearby living being. Darkness, shadows, and the undead all fall under the command of a calculanox, who can summon forth legions of such at will. Perhaps most terrifying of all, they can summon forth a blade of pure shadow that they wield with great glee, slaughtering any foolish enough to challenge them.</p>",

Secret demon worshipping cults will slowly preach teachings of lust for power, greed, and that it is the birthright of mortals to subjugate nature and other lesser beings to their will.</p><p>Diabolists are magic users who, inherently following their own selfish pursuits, have been seduced by such teachings. Also known as the beluasusurro, these beings have bound themselves into a pact with the darkest of evil creatures - those hungering for the souls of others. Their patrons will often give a diabolist just a hint of forbidden magic unknown to all but a few of their most loyal servants, promising unrestrained power. Blinded by their lust for such powers, the beluasusurro seek the fastest methods to accumulate power, and will often perform actions and rites that make even other evil beings hesitate.</p><p>The path of the beluasusurro requires a being to demonstrate their unwavering fealty to their patron. Often these involve rituals of self-mutilation and sacrificial rites that corrupt the soul of the beluasusurro so completely it also warps their body - turning them into mortal effigies of their masters.</p><p>Despite their natural intelligence, the beluasusurro lack wisdom - they are rash, impulsive, and follow their base instincts where other beings would perhaps hesitate. They are also quick to anger and lash out if provoked, making a diabolist difficult to predict. Their hunger for power drives them ever deeper into depravity, a path that can only end with their souls being forever bound to the eternal pain and torment their master has deceived them into. Despite this they are also quick-witted and smooth talkers whenever seeing an opportunity to gain personally from whomever they interact with, though this facade can instantaneously turn to conflict.</p><p>Through their rituals and desire to serve their masters, diabolists are easily identified. Demon-like horns curl outward from their heads, goat-like eyes with red irises bulge from their heads, and their cloaks will often cover a body riddled with scars from the rituals directed by their patrons. Some beluasussuro have more noticeable deformities, such as missing limbs or even an eye, the ultimate demonstration of their devotion to their master.</p><p><strong>Unholy Pact.</strong> The beluasussuro are granted the ability to infuse their castings with necrotic energy that drains their targets and can be used to rejuvenate the diabolist. As part of their pact, the beluasusurro gain the ability to peer through even the blackest of magical darkness and are resistant to all but the most potent of magics directed at them. Any flames, magical or otherwise, are nought but a gentle caress of warmth to a diabolist’s skin.</p><p><strong>Self-immolation.</strong> The most powerful of the diabolists - those who have demonstrated their unwavering loyalty to their patrons - are capable of channeling the flames of demonkind.

Many focus on perfecting their martial skill, others on leading others, still others mix magic and weapons together in a magnificent display of whirling death.</p><p>The necrotic warriors fall into the latter category. They fuse magic with their weapons to create a deadly display of necrotic energy that saps the strength and life from anyone they face; a display of sentient claws and steel that promises swift death to all who face them. How they go about this is one of the most unique ways ever imagined.</p><p>Anyone can join the necrotic warriors no matter their birth or station. All one needs is a willingness to fight and a willingness to die to achieve the goal of becoming a necrotic warrior. Even known murderers who have fled justice have joined the order. When those hunting them came upon the order to claim them back, they were turned away. Once someone is a member, their past is gone and only their future, no matter how short, remains.</p><p>Once their training is complete, they are sent out into the world to hunt down great beasts. Without any help, they must slay these beasts so that they may claim a single claw; prestige is gained within their ranks by gaining multiple claws. While they only need one claw to join, those who manage to kill three or more great creatures earn a place of honor with the ranks.</p><p>Once this phase of their initiation is over, they take the claws gathered back to be prepared in a ritual of foul magic and undeath. The claws are imbued with necrotic energy and attached by a chain to the necrotic warrior’s weapon. These claws gain sentience and the ability to act on their own.</p><p>The little talked about and most closely guarded secret of the order is the last part of the initiation and one that claims the most lives. In order to wield their new weapons, the initiates must fight a battle of wills with the sentient claws, overcoming their mental attacks and taking control of them.</p><p>One in ten initiates that make it this far survive the process. Those that do go on to be necrotic warriors. Wielding their necrotic weapons with a fury that stops many in their tracks, necrotic warriors make puissant allies and terrible foes.</p><p><strong>Necrotic But Not Chaotic.</strong> Many view the order as an evil organization and while there are members that fall into that category, they are not the only ones. Anyone may join, from criminal to saint. So while a large portion of them may be evil, many of them are good people that felt called to become necrotic warriors.</p><p><strong>Sentient Weapons.</strong> The weapons wielded by necrotic warriors are sentient, acting on their own at times. Fighting a necrotic warrior is akin to fighting a small army, especially if they have three or more claws attached to their weapons. They are almost impossible to surprise and even when the warrior is incapacitated, the sentient part of the weapon is still capable of fighting on. Only the warrior who has crafted the weapon may use the claws to attack.</p>",

Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.</p><p><strong>Combat.</strong> The familiar is an ally to you and your allies.

A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p><p><strong>Disappearance of the Familiar.</strong> When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p><p><strong>One Familiar Only.</strong> You can't have more than one familiar at a time.

Where do they come from? Were they always leopard people? Where do they get their extra powers from? All is unknown.</p><p>What is known is that to a claw, they are all musically gifted. Most playing multiple instruments, all gifted vocally. Watching the bardic stylings of a pardusnisl performing, many often wonder how they so quickly pick the strings of a lute with claws in the way.</p><p>Off the stage they are stalwart companions. Often travelling with groups of adventurers, looking for that elusive song that will grant them a spot on the eternal stage.</p><p>The eternal stage is the one other thing known about pardusnisl. Whoever their god, or gods are, they rule over something the pardusnisl call the eternal stage. Those that perform well in this life are granted a spot on the eternal stage, entertaining for eternity at their gods’ side.</p><p>Because of this drive, pardusnisl have created some of the most epic songs and poems in existence. To hear a master loutist play Pardus Agit Canticum Laetitiae, considered by many to be the greatest song ever written, is to hear a room full of people break down in tears at the sheer beauty of such a masterful song.</p><p>There is a tale of the battle of Mors et postea amicitia, where two fearsome armies had fought for many times many days. The piles of dead on both sides were said to have created new mountains that blocked out the sun and created a permanent dusk on the battlefield.</p><p>On the fifty-fifth day of battle a pardusnisl happened upon the scene and began playing their most famous song. Before long the entire battlefield was silent apart from the song and the sobs and tears of those listening. Once the song was over, rather than resume the battle, both sides joined together and killed their evil overlords. After that both lands were at peace for a hundred years and more.</p><p>In combat the pardusnisl is a fearsome opponent. Able to use not only their bardic skills, but also their ability to change shape into a full leopard and to teleport around the field. Both supporting their allies and dealing damage in kind.</p><p><strong>Limited Shapeshifters.</strong> A pardusnisl can only turn into one creature, a blink leopard and while it is a powerful shape it can only be used a limited number of times a day, requiring the pardusnisl to rest in between in order to replenish both their own energies and those of the focus. In their humanoid form they fight like any bard, wielding a rapier and their music with skill and precision.</p><p><strong>Blink Leopards.</strong> The pardusnisl ability to teleport makes for an even more dangerous adversary than normal, as they have been known to blink around the field of battle, swinging at one opponent, only to appear seconds later behind another, surprising them and keeping everyone on the battlefield in a constant state of fear, for where the next blow will come from. They have even been known to climb a sheer cliff, twist and leap towards their prey, only to teleport mid air and appear behind them, finishing the leap from an angle for which their prey was not prepared.</p>",

Many cultures worshiped a blessed mother figure, an earth mother, responsible for the seasons and the cycles of nature. Many philosophers believe that these deities were all the same, all facets of one being —while others believe that they were separate entities, responsible for their small sphere of influence and nothing more.</p><p>Sometimes, these philosophers turn explorers and go looking for the evidence to back their claims; many return empty handed, while some never return. An even smaller number of those that return, come back changed. Through luck, knowledge, or perhaps providence, they find what they were looking for and become something more than they once were.</p><p>The relics of the mother still retain her power. When the mother deems someone worthy of attention, a portion of that power is transferred to the curious traveler, changing them from a mere traveler; from a philosopher, into one of the sacerdosmatris, or priests of the Mother.</p><p>These priests travel the land, speaking of the mother, attempting to get those they meet to understand the balance of all things, tending to the sick, helping where needed. It is not uncommon to see a sacerdosmatris tending a herd, or helping a farmer with their crops, or simply sitting in the middle of a meadow and contemplating the beauty of existence.</p><p>Sacerdomatris tend to be slow to anger, like a placid lake. They remain calm in even the worst of situations, preferring to weigh their options before acting. They can erupt like a volcano when needed however, and act when required.</p><p>Because none know how the mother chooses her acolytes, there is a great range of differences between her adherents. They come from all walks of life and one is just as likely to see a goblinoid or orcish priest, as a human or elvish one. While they may all be from different paths, they share a love of the mother and work all their days to protect her and her children, most having left whatever life they lived prior behind.</p><p><strong>Druidic Priests.</strong> Due to their attachment to nature, they draw some of their power from the earth itself. However, their power is still divine in nature and spells they wield that would normally be considered of the earth, have their roots in divine magic.</p><p><strong>Protecting the Mother.</strong> Everything in nature works by symbiosis; each creature supporting each other, whether it is as prey, or predator, helper, or helpless. Humanoid races are the only ones that can move outside of this system, should one of the sacerdomatris come upon someone acting outside of nature; be it a lich who blights the land with their presence or woodcutters cutting beyond that which is sustainable. The sacerdosmatris will take steps to rectify the problem and restore balance.</p><p><strong>Branch of the Forest.</strong> Bestowed as a gift, sacerdosmatri carry a Nature’s Branch, which symbolizes their love for the very place they hold dear. While is can be wielded as a weapon, these branches allow for a quick identification of their carriers.</p>",

These secluded sanctuaries are so chosen at locations where the subtle ki energies of the universe seem to align and concentrate, hence their isolation from civilizations. At times, when these energies align perfectly, and should a monk be properly attuned with them, the monk may have an epiphany - a sudden burst of understanding that allows a monk to reach a higher plane of consciousness. These monks became known as the monsinveniet, or mountain wayfinders.</p><p>This epiphany may lead the monsinveniet to seek a pilgrimage. Drawn to leave the relative security and peace of their cloisters, these individuals pursue their calling with an unwavering passion, knowing only that the path ahead has been decreed by a greater power. It may be that they have a clear and distinct objective, or it may simply be that they know vaguely what direction the universe is directing them toward.</p><p>While a monsinveniet generally pursues their pilgrimage alone, they may at times join with bands of other like-minded adventurers who share a common purpose. As astute individuals, they tend to scrutinize others carefully for ulterior motives and will simply move on from less than altruistic individuals. But should an individual or band of travellers meet their approval, a monsinveniet is an easy companion who shares their knowledge, wisdom, and other information gleaned from their pilgrimage. But should a party act counter to the monk’s beliefs, they may switch allegiances in pursuit of more noble callings.</p><p><strong>Inner and Outer Calm. T</strong>he monsinveniet, through their epiphany, possess a deep sense of inner peace and contentment that emanates from within. They never raise their voice in anger, never strike out of rage, and never flee out of fear.

The image of a figure reaping souls, like a farmer reaps wheat, is fairly common imagery and a poetic way of describing the moment of transference from this life to the next.</p><p>The messores have taken this imagery to heart and have created a clerical order, of sorts, based on this. Whether or not they worship a particular deity has never really been determined. It is said by many that they worship the idea of death itself and of determining that moment when life must escape, as well as ensuring it does.</p><p>Using spells of divination, they attempt to determine when the creatures around them must leave this mortal coil. They will then send out one of their order to ensure that the mortal in question meets their appointed time. Once given a mission, they will stop at nothing to achieve it. Anyone who stands in their way will be removed. They assume anyone foolish enough to try and stop them from completing their work has also reached the appointed moment.</p><p>While not clerics in the normal sense, they will heal the sick and wounded, as long as they have not determined it is that person’s time to die. Many are the times when a loved one has watched their husband or wife, son or daughter, breathe their last because a messore has determined it was their time. No amount of cajoling will change their minds, bribery has no effect, and harvesters are relentless in pursuit of their faith.</p><p>Many have questioned the veracity of the messores use of divination to determine whether or not someone lives or dies. None know for sure and the messores themselves refuse to entertain such questioning of their faith. They are fanatical, driven, and determined to make sure everyone meets their death at the appointed time. They will rarely ever resurrect someone, assuming that if someone died, it was their time. The only cases where they might relent on that rule, is if someone who was bound to die at a preordained time did not, and then killed another. At that point, they may relent because the natural order was been disturbed by allowing someone that should already have passed on to continue on and wreak havoc.</p><p><strong>Diviners of the Moment.</strong> Messores make great use of divination magic, especially auguries, which they use to determine the correct moment of someone’s death. Before they heal anyone, they will cast an augury; should it say it is that one’s time, they will stay their hand and prevent anyone that attempts to prevent death from doing so. More fanatical members of the sect have been known to actually hasten the moment by calling down holy fire to destroy a body.</p><p><strong>Always a Loophole.</strong> There have been a few occasions where a member has been convinced to allow someone to live, but these only occur very rarely and always follow a very specific set of circumstances. They require the dying person to swear to serve the church and to become a messore themself. Those of the order consider themselves outside of humanity and already of the realm of death.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Empowered Enchantresses</em></p><p>The empowered enchantress is one who, owing to an ancient, noble, and fair bloodline, possesses a rare combination of both unique innate beauty, keen intelligence, and natural magical ability. Brought up in familial country estates wanting for nothing and having servants cater to their every whim, the enchantress was schooled by the finest tutors and most learned scholars their family could procure.</p><p>Curriculum by day consisted of the fine arts - music, poetry, and performance; while by night the enchantress pored over tomes of history, languages, and magic. An adept student with an unrelenting thirst for knowledge, their intelligence rapidly exceeded even the wildest expectations of their teachers. From these intensive studies emerged a brilliant being, learned in the ways of enthralling others be it through spoken word, strum of a lute, or through the subtle weaving of enchantments upon an unsuspecting victim. Though a remarkably quick study at magic of many schools, the enchantress focused her fascinated attention upon spells that beguile the mind and ensnare the senses. Alarmed with their pupils expanding magical powers and ability to manipulate the unsuspecting, the enchantress’ magical teachers became concerned that they would soon be unable to best a thirst for power and propensity to bend others to their will. In an attempt to restrain and focus their pupil, the teachers attempted to weave mental constraints and psychic chains within their student’s mind - never knowing, in fact, that they were the ones being manipulated.</p><p>Their attempts at controlling the enchantress backfired, the enchantress using the subtle psychic linkages to their tutors to siphon their knowledge and wisdom, thereby expanding and magnifying the enchantress’ powers - at a cost to their sanity. They are prone to take offense quickly, and other beings note the quick temper and outbursts of anger from them. Their actions and speed are notably impulsive, as though different personality traits were absorbed from the minds of their former tutors. No longer constrained by the limitations placed upon them by their teachers, the enchantress amplified their abilities, becoming empowered. Such empowered beings have become known as the silvasirenis.</p><p><strong>Beguiling Senses.</strong> Whether or not through magical means, the silvasirenis appears to always be surrounded by beauty. A nearby creature may catch an elusive whiff of an enticing smell, the sun may always appear to shine when they are around, food may taste that much more succulent, and the drink may flow more freely. Some say that the appearance of the silvasirenis subtly varied to any who view them, perhaps caused by a carefully constructed magical illusion that surrounds them. Nonetheless, the silvasirenis is constantly attended to by a veritable horde of admirers, though the intent of the enchantress may be less than virtuous.</p><p><strong>Naive Spirit.</strong> Despite their unpredictable and uninhibited nature, the silvasirenis still spent the majority of their time sheltered from the outside world. Despite their propensity to cause havoc through their subtle manipulations, the silvasirenis remains naive and curious as would a small child, and at times they may pause whatever schemes they may concoct in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>",

First, through bloodline, where magical gifts are passed from one generation to the next. Such gifts may also spontaneously arise, though perhaps in such cases some ancestor possessed magical abilities that then skipped multiple generations. The second way creatures are granted magical powers is through divine intervention of a greater being. In either case, learning to control and focus such energies requires rigorous training and experience, or dangerous bursts of power may erupt and cause untold devastation by an unskilled practitioner.</p><p>Regardless of the source of their powers, magic users are diverse individuals who pursue different fields of study - the closing of wounds, beguiling of senses, weaving complex illusions, or casting protective barriers to ward other beings. One such speciality is learning to manipulate and concentrate magical energies that manifest as powerful elemental effects. Perhaps the most direct and dangerous form of magic, wielding such powers requires an extreme focus to control the direction, intensity, and effect of such castings. Those who successfully learn to control these energies are known as the elementur, more commonly known as elementalists.</p><p>The training of an elementalist is rigorous. Many elementur acolytes fail to sufficiently control their energies and cause significant harm to themselves or those around them, hence why such training is best done away from populated areas and where such energies can be suppressed by more experienced magic users. As magical energies may have a link to the emotional state of the wielder, the elementur tend to strongly suppress their emotions in favor of a more reasoned and logic based approach lest a burst of anger cause a spontaneous burst of flame or sparks of lightning to emit from them. As a result the elementur’s mind is warded against mind-altering.</p><p>Elementalists are highly regarded for their sheer destructive abilities, and are sought after to join military brigades where they offer crucial fire support against opposing forces. Other elementur may choose to join adventuring bands and seek fame and fortune. Many beings will shun a lone elementalist, for perhaps a lack of control over their powers is the reason for their solitude.</p><p><strong>Engines of Destruction.</strong> The spells utilized by the elementur are not necessarily unique to them, however through their studies and training they have learned to more effectively wield and control these spells. Rather than simply causing a burst of magical energy in the form of an elemental force, the elementalist can hone the effect of their castings, focusing these energies into more specific shapes. This increases their destructive potential while shielding allies from the most devastating effects of their castings. Even creatures resistant to flames, extreme cold, or bursts of lightning find their defenses bypassed by the castings of an elementur.</p><p><strong>Elemental Protection.</strong> In order to better protect both themselves and those around them from the elements, elementur often shield themselves and others from such energies. Wrapping their allies in a warm cocoon can protect allies from frigid arctic nights or a blazing inferno of a dragon’s breath. Despite this protection, very powerful effects can still penetrate the elementur’s wards.</p>",

These individuals often band together, adhering to the age old adage of safety in numbers.</p><p>One such grouping of planes travellers, many years back, led to the formation of the viatoresinplanos. Their organization is composed of merchants and mercenaries, the latter generally protecting the former during their travels.</p><p>Most of the members are descendants from the original members, which has led to some interesting changes to the individuals in question, due to overexposure to the varied planes of existence. One of these changes is that many of the mercenaries can now channel the power of the planes into themselves.</p><p>The leaders of the group decreed that there should be a parity of power within the group and so, with the work of many puissant wizards, designed a way for those mercenaries to focus their power. This created a uniformity in said powers, making them more like an army and less like a ragtag group of mercenaries.</p><p><strong>Coordinated Fighters.</strong> The viatoresinplanos are more like a military unit than a mercenary company. When they work together, they work as a single well-oiled machine. Many who have seen them fight have commented on the fluidity with which they work together, both defending each other from enemy blows and aiding each other in striking at an enemy.</p><p><strong>Magical Weapons.</strong> The weapons the viatoresinplanos wield are magical in nature. The staff, while appearing to be simple wood, is able to withstand even the mightiest of blows from any weapon, and has even been known to be able to absorb significant magical damage, while the trident can be willed in and out of existence as the traveller sees fit. This has created a situation where an enemy has swung an attack, expecting to meet resistance, only to end up missing entirely, because the weapon was no longer there, putting themselves in a position where the viatoresinplanos would have a clear shot with their staff, at their now off-balance opponent.</p>",

For many of these knights, death would be a much more deserving sentence; the powers that be have, however, decided that they should repent their sins. When a criminal is brought before certain justices that work for the powers of good and is found wanting, then a determination will be made to place an enchanted crown upon their brow, thus beginning their life-long repentance.</p><p>The crown is enchanted and confers powers of both healing and smiting upon the wearer. It also holds a powerful curse, that nothing short of a wish spell can remove.</p><p>The curse is twofold. Firstly, the wearer can commit no evil deed, regardless of the desired outcome.</p><p>Secondly, the equescoronam must render aid to those that need it, whether they wish it or not. Should the equescoronam not obey this imposed troth, their body is wracked with waves of pain. Those who have endured such pain describe it as being struck by lightning, but emanating in the mind. Additionally, they become fatigued —but even rest won’t cure this tiredness. Eventually, if they keep refusing to render aid, they will die from sheer exhaustion.</p><p>Thus cursed and equipped the equescoronam travels the land rendering aid whether they want to or not; doing good deeds and fighting brigands and evil men until they inevitably fall in battle. The Knights of the Heavy Crown story is not a story with a happy ending, as most equescoronam fall within the first two years, either from refusing to help, or simply going into battle again and again until they are slain.</p><p><strong>Crown Magic.</strong> The equescoronam have similar powers to paladins, even though they are only granted spells by the crown upon their brow. They do not use spell slots to cast these spells however, and simply have a number of uses per day for their spells after which they must rest to regain those uses. Any offensive spell they attempt to use against an innocent will backfire causing damage to the equescoronam instead of the intended target.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Nightbringers</em></p><p>Most mortal beings have a healthy fear of pain, death, and the unknown that awaits them once their bodies succumb to the ravages of disease, time, or violence. Many seek ways to prolong their existence, often through a cautious existence with rigorous attention to diet and training. Others choose to experiment with extending their lives through magical means, some of which many others would view as unnatural.</p><p>While necromantic magics are often associated with the raising and controlling of corpses and skeletons and binding them to a necromancer’s will, such dark arts also involve the leaching of vitality and energy from other living beings, thus sustaining the caster’s youth and vitality well beyond the span of other humanoids. Such lengthy lifespans also allow a necromancer more than ample time to delve into yet darker secrets and uncover yet more sinister magics.</p><p>Over time, however, the leaching of another being’s vital essence can forever damage both body and soul of the caster, leaving them corrupted and requiring a constant sustaining life force drawn from their victims. While not quite living and not quite one of the undead, these beings developed an unexpected side effect in that they are repelled by the light of day.</p><p>Such practitioners of necromantic leeching magic, due to their sensitivity to light, have become known as the tenebralator, or nightbringers. To avoid detection, the tenebralator will often summon an unnaturally quiet and inky stillness to cover for their foul actions.</p><p>In appearance, the tenebralator appear as thin, almost skeletal, pale-skinned humanoids shrouded in fine black silks and regal vestments befitting their own self image of an ancient and terrifying being. Jet black, pupil-less eyes peer coldly from behind ceremonial masks crafted in the terrible likenesses of long-forgotten deities of death. When they speak, the voice of a nightbringer rattles with power, confidence, and the authority of one who has little patience for anything other than their own selfish existence.</p><p><strong>Unending Hunger.</strong> In their thirst for immortality and the life force required to sustain it, the tenebralator possesses a terrible unending hunger for the essence of living beings. With the merest flick of their finger they can leave even the strongest being a sunken husk, feeble and ailing while the nightbringer is rejuvenated and empowered.</p><p><strong>Visage of Darkness.</strong> It has been said that a veil of darkness and silence heralds the arrival of a nightbringer. On such nights, villagers and commoners will often huddle together in terror, stoking hearth fires in a vain effort to ward off the darkness that slowly envelopes a poorly protected settlement. The few beings who have survived an encounter with a nightbringer describe them as cloaked in darkness and able to rapidly blink from shadow to shadow with nary a sound but the tenebralator’s cold and soulless laugh.</p><p><strong>Mask of Terror.</strong> What lies behind the ceremonial mask of a nightbringer remains a mystery, for those who gaze upon the true face of such desperate hunger and darkness are driven beyond terror. Only the most stout-hearted of beings can withstand the visage of such depravity, their memories are scoured for they bear no recollection of the face behind the mask.</p>",

It is the solemn vow of many self-proclaimed do-gooders to eliminate the perceived threat of undeath, and these individuals will seek out and destroy them wherever they stalk the earth.</p><p>However, there are those that view the undead differently. Rather than evil threats to be feared, the morcustos sees the undead for what they truly are: tormented souls doomed to seek revenge upon those who did them wrong in life; misguided beings who sought and found the forbidden promise of everlasting life or beauty, husks of rotting flesh that crave and feast upon the living, or clattering skeletons bound into unending servitude.</p><p>Morcustos, or keepers of the dead as they are commonly referred to in outside circles, view all undead creatures in one of two categories: those whose undeath is not of their own cause, and as such have no free will; and those whose undeath either is of their own making or who have sought to utilize their powers to dominate the living.</p><p>For those undead creatures whose condition is not of their making, keepers of the dead prefer to observe, study, understand, and eventually guide the undead through their fate. Should a tormented being crave final release, a morcustos views it as their duty to aid them in this process. If a ghost seeks rest by completing some yet unresolved task, the keeper will often choose to aid them when possible. However, a keeper of the dead is selective in providing their aid - compensation must be adequate, be it material, wisdom, or their favored payment: arcane knowledge.</p><p>However, morcustos detest those who have bent undeath toward selfish, evil, and sinister ends. Sentient undead who retain their own free will and yet still choose dark paths of their own volition are viewed with disdain and unworthy of their existence. They are to be hunted and terminated with extreme prejudice. Vampires who torment the living in their search for fulfilment of their dark desires, wights driven by promise of reward from their dark patrons, or mummies who spread their tyrannical reign upon the lands of the living are among the sworn enemies of the keepers of the dead.</p><p><strong>Insight into Undeath.</strong> Throughout their travels and observation of the deceased, morcustos have gained an intimate knowledge about the objects of their study, allowing them to recite obscure lore and history regarding the undead. As careful observers of undead behaviour, keepers of the dead are able to consistently predict their behaviours and actions in advance. Through keen surveillance, they are able to rapidly identify both strengths and weaknesses of undead beings so that if needed these beings are cut down with a precise and brutal onslaught.</p><p><strong>Sense Undead.</strong> Morcustos have an uncanny ability to detect the presence of undead creatures in their vicinity, as if they possess a sixth sense to sense their vile existence within 100 feet. While unable to discern the exact identity of the undead, they know when the dead are in motion.</p><p><strong>Spirit Summoners.</strong> By fulfilling their quest in aiding helpless incorporeal beings, morcustos are able call upon those they’ve helped, summoning them forth for a short time should the need arise.</p>",

Most of these are full of surface dwellers, mounted on majestic steeds riding into the sunset, out of the gloom saving the day, or the beacon righting all wrongs —whether or not those wrongs want to be righted.</p><p>The militesaquas are a bit different. They are an order of aquatic-dwelling races that have banded together to protect themselves from their greatest threat - the surface and those that dwell there. Apart from the obvious dumping of refuse and other horrendous acts the surface perpetrates against the underwater realms, the fishing industries of the surface take their toll on many sentient dwellers of the oceans depths.</p><p>To combat this ever present and ever rising threat, many of the underwater realms came together to fight back the surface dwellers’ evil. At least, that is their take on it. Some among them feel that it is more a reflection of apathy and ignorance. In the end, however, for most it amounts to the same. The dwellers in the depths need to do something to fight back against the surface before their habitats are forever destroyed.</p><p>With the blessing of their deep-dwelling sea gods, they banded together and created their order, wielding the power of the sea against any surface dweller they run into without mercy or care. Pirate ships, merchant vessels, coastal towns; none are safe from their onslaught. The only respite for the surface seems to be that they won’t travel more than a mile or so inland and so those not living in coastal areas seem to be immune to their advances, at least for now. The other thing that works in the favor of the land dwellers, is that the militesaquas numbers are relatively low and many of them cannot live for long out of water. Only the foolish assume that this means that they are safe.</p><p>Day-by-day and year-by-year, the underwater knights grow in number and one day they may be strong enough to wage a full scale war on the surface.</p><p><strong>Underwater Magic.</strong> Most of the underwater knights wield the power of the sea, as well as martial abilities. Whether it is the ability to send forth crushing waves, or to use the water of the seas to heal their allies; they have the favor of the gods of the depths. Many merchant vessels have found themselves becalmed, unable to move, sails hanging loose and useless, while others only a handful of miles away have been washed overboard by torrential rains that seem to be centered only on their vessel.</p><p><strong>Save the Oceans.</strong> Most on the surface would call the underwater knights an evil organization, however, they have been the subject of what they consider centuries of abuse at the hands of a surface that uses their homes as a dumping ground for rubbish, refuse, and even their dead. They have simply grown tired of this and most consider themselves to be liberators. Many militesaqua feel that the surface dwellers are the true oppressors.</p>",

Instead, they wield the magic of the lower planes to charm and deceive the wicked and the gullible, as well as to spread their message of love.</p><p>While worship is not the right word, the sisters do have an allegiance or an understanding with those known as succubi. Much of their power is derived from these magical creatures and other creatures that use charm and enchantment to affect the minds of other living creatures.</p><p>While they are called the Sisters of Enchantment, their order does not stop any who pass their doors from joining. Only a willingness and interest in the arts of enchantment and the urge to spread the order’s message of love to all is necessary to join the order.</p><p>Those initiated in the secrets of the order, spend many years traveling the world, giving the gifts of love and friendship to all they meet. Many have tried to point out that the love and friendship are false, generated by means most magical. But the sisters have a saying: “It matters not where the love comes from, just that it be felt.”</p><p>They believe that there is a dearth of love and friendship in the world and that if everyone could just be convinced to follow the dictates of their hearts then the world would be a better place. They are fanatical in this belief, always happy to the point of being giddy. This has led at times to their enemies underestimating them. But do not be fooled; they are deadly adversaries when confronted with violence.</p><p>Some have tried to point at the apparent destruction the order tends to leave in its wake, as the villages it goes through have a tendency to head towards debauchery and forget that simple things like growing food and raising children are important, but the order shrugs these off as no more than bumps in the road on the path to enlightenment.</p><p><strong>Beauty is Only Skin Deep.</strong> While many use their magic to affect the way they look to the outside world, the Sisters of Enchantment instead use their powers to affect the minds of those they target. Making room in their minds to appreciate those around them for more than that which is only skin deep. Many vain humanoids have been brought to heel by the sisters and made to see the beauty in the world around them.</p><p><strong>For the Greater Good.</strong> While many would correctly view the Sisters as chaotic creatures, they view theirs as the only true path. They see the chaos they sow as the seeds that will one day flourish into a beautiful forest, a world where love and understanding, and not violence, are the prevalent attitudes. They do not really wish power for themselves, but equality through love for all, and are prepared to use whatever means necessary to achieve that lofty goal.</p><p><strong>Sorcerous Origins.</strong> The sororincantation’s magical gifts come to them innately, and as such they are able to bend the very workings of their arcane touch to empower spell effects beyond what my be expected.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Lightning Born</em></p><p>The term barbarian is often used when describing members of distant tribes or from lands foreign and strange, quite often used to incorrectly label someone as being “less than” or so alien that normal standards don’t make sense. For the nobility of more civilized lands, it is a term describing tribes and nations that live on the outer rims of the world, enduring conditions those nobles could never survive. For military units, it describes the warriors of those tribes. Warriors who lack the iron discipline of more civilized warriors, who may be deserving of grudging respect, even admiration for the individual skill, but who, as a whole, lack something the better trained warriors have.</p><p>These barbarians do not call themselves barbarians most of the time, nor do they think themselves uncivilized or undisciplined. They know that there are different forms of civilization and different ways to be disciplined.</p><p>The fulgurnatusest, or lightning born, prove that this is true. Whether a magical accident or some sorcerous bloodline has caused the basis for their abilities, none know. What they do know is that the fulgurnatusest are possibly one of the most disciplined forces on the planet, wielding powers that if left uncontrolled could wreak havoc and cause many injuries, even death to those around them.</p><p>The power of lightning runs through their veins, which manifests itself at a young age. Once a child is determined to have the power, they are placed into the care of the elder fulgurnatusest and their training begins. Firstly, to train a new warrior to protect those in need. Most importantly, however, to protect an uncontrolled magical conduit from damaging those around them.</p><p>While many of these come from the communities around and travel to the fulgurnatusest nation to be trained, it is not uncommon for those from even further afield to come and train. The fulgurnatusest do not look upon those of other cultures as unworthy of training and take any who show the power into their own, turning them into one of the most disciplined fighting forces there is. Those who have fought against them on the field of battle have rethought the word barbarian when describing what they can do. A disciplined force of lightning-wielding warriors descending upon you in an organized rage can make one question many things. Chief among them, whether they made the right career choice.</p><p><strong>Lightning Fury.</strong> The fulgurnatusest is fueled by rage while on the battlefield, allowing them to channel lightning incarnate. While engaged, they manifest a magical link between their shield and their weapon that acts as a lightning whip under their control. They use this to great effect, such as pulling creatures towards them before raining blows down upon their target with a battleaxe.</p><p><strong>Reactive Skin.</strong> Because of the lightning flowing through their veins, the fulgurnatusest have a mild repulsion field that emanates from their skin. This often causes projectiles thrown or fired at them to arc lightning back at their assailant, adding another layer of protection in normal combat for the fulgurnatusest.</p>",

Many that do are capable of manipulating very minor amounts of arcane energies. Those who can wield more powerful forces are often either highly revered and sought after or shunned and avoided entirely. While attuning oneself to magical energies, knowing the language of the spell and being able to properly channel its forces does require a certain degree of intelligence, though these two factors are not always correlated.</p><p>There are many beings who do not possess a single iota of magical ability, but their natural intelligence leads them along a different path - that of an alchemist, engineer, inventor or tinker, for example. Such professions require both an equally keen mind and nimble fingers, for often such trades are inherently dangerous as they hone their craft and produce a myriad of devices and inventions. These tinkers and dabblers are frequently regarded with bemusement by others, for some of their inventions are often unusual and serve little apparent use. However, wealthy patrons may identify these individuals and fund their curiosities, often with the aim of using their newfound employees to craft all manner of possibly useful devices.</p><p>The illaqueator, or trapsmiths, dabble in a wide variety of pursuits - they possess knowledge of both alchemy and engineering which they use to design, construct, and install any number of traps, triggers, trammels, and other devices for their employers. They tend to be highly curious, somewhat antisocial, and eccentric in nature. When exploring new ideas in their workshop they seldom tolerate interruptions, brusquely dismissing those who disrupt their train of thought. Trapsmiths tend to be impatient and scattered in their thoughts, but will incessantly chatter about their inventions to any who will listen to them. They tend to lack social skills that would allow them to navigate other echelons of society, and as such are primarily found in their workshops surrounded by their contraptions and other creations, whether successful designs or not.</p><p>The inventions of the illaqueator vary from relatively benign, such as cleverly designed locks that only the most skilled lockpick can decipher, to sinister, such as traps designed to inflict pain, maim or dismember those unfortunate enough to be caught within it. They distill a variety of acidic, caustic, noxious, or otherwise foul gases and chemicals and design ingenious ways of delivering such compounds. Trapsmiths also design and craft more simple and less subtle traps, such as pitfalls, murder holes, and the like, though devices such as these often require additional hired brawn.</p><p><strong>Magical Trap Construction.</strong> While not capable of using magic themselves, the inventions of the illaqueator may be imbued with magical energy if crafted of the correct materials. Metals, crystals, and other specific materials may, with the proper invocations and structure, contain arcane energies within that can be released upon a specific activating trigger. These devices are rare however, as their construction requires both a skilled illaqueator knowledgeable in metallurgy and gem crafting as well as a powerful artificer capable of weaving and containing enchantments within the device.</p>",

Whether simply to observe and learn, spread their influence through means both subtle or overt, or to outright change the course of history, their motivations remain their own. Yet spending too much time amongst humanoids can, over time, begin to affect such powerful being’s perceptions - even those near-perfect celestial beings may find themselves enamored with the imperfections of humanity they observe, or may find themselves slowly corrupted by malignant influences over time.</p><p>The caelillustratum are thought to be ancient celestial beings sent long ago by their masters to observe and potentially influence mortals toward paths of righteousness, valor, and virtue. Others were sent to stamp out the baleful influence of demons and fiends who were seeking to sway mortals toward paths of domination, power, and subjugation of free will. Whatever their purpose, the caelillustratum began to become less god-like and more human. Over time, they became more focused on what it meant to be mortal - the brutal struggle to live yet one more day, the depths of despair and pain, the unfathomable highs of love, affection, and achievement. These celestials began to reject their perceptions of perfection and virtue and chose to embrace what it meant to be flawed and mortal. They chose to forsake their divinity and live amongst the flaws, beauty, and horror of the moral realms forever.</p><p>These enlightened celestial beings gave up much of their divine power to walk among mortals as one of them. Unlike their immortal brethren, they are susceptible to poison and corruption, though only the most virulent of diseases may affect them. They retain much of their righteous might, though they use it sparingly and only in self-defense or to protect those in need. The caelillustratum may die as any mortal would, by disease or blade, though it remains unknown if old age would eventually take them as well. However, they retain their sense of serenity, and while they will strive for each breath to survive as any creature would, when death comes to them they fully embrace it - for that is what it means to be mortal.</p><p>The caelillustrum are fair to behold, androgynous beings able to subtly shift their appearances at will often to avoid revealing their heritage. Often the only clue to their true identity is a holy symbol they bear in homage to their past existence, and they seldom carry any items nor wear anything other than simple, but elegant garb. They are perceptive and speak in riddling tones, guiding beings to come to their own conclusions and choosing their own path to tread.</p><p><strong>Wisdom of the Ages.</strong> Having witnessed countless millennia as a celestial being, they are wise beyond what many mortals can comprehend. Often they are found in temples and retreats where they choose a simple life of reflection and meditation, or perhaps acting in service to others - healing the sick and infirm or offering guidance to lost and broken souls.</p><p><strong>Holy Powers.</strong> Choosing a simple mortal life does not mean the caelillustratum have completely forgotten their sacred charge - to ensure that demonic influence and corruption does not take root in the realms of mortals, and ensure free will for all. While they abhor physical violence, their holy powers are more than capable of destroying such baleful influences while leaving the righteous in awe.</p>",

While some paladins might seek to redeem themselves, these knights went even further, seeking out new darker powers to fuel their rage and thirst for vengeance against the gods that forsook them.</p><p>Where once a warrior of light once stood, now stands a being of almost pure darkness. Where once their spells brought peace and healing, they now bring pain and madness. Yet they still have an allure and many find themselves drawn to dark warriors; as people are drawn to marvel at the spider, while still afraid of its venom.</p><p>The morsestanimae generally favor darkened armor with horns and other adornments on their helmets to give them a more sinister appearance. As with the more traditional paladin, morsestanimaes most often wear full plate armor and either a sword and shield or a two-handed weapon.</p><p>Morsestanimaes are expert strategists and can be found leading many armies, mercenary companies, and even the odd adventuring party. They rule through fear and have little regard for the lives of their comrades or the soldiers under their commands, caring only about achieving their goal. Even the cries of anguish from their allies fill the morsestanimaes with a sense of a job well done, as all suffering is holy to them.</p><p>Although there are many different sects of morsestanimaes out there, many take what is often called an oath of suffering. An oath of suffering paladin seeks to instill into others the concept that life is pain, that any fleeting happiness is simply to accentuate the pain around them, and that the only way to exist is in a state of constant suffering, that through suffering, power is gained and a dark freedom of sorts.</p><p><strong>Tenets of the Wicked.</strong> Although these change slightly from sect to sect, the tenets of suffering are generally along the lines of the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Erode Hope.</strong> Hope is a salve for many, but it is a false one. Only once hope is gone can one see the true path and once suffering is embraced as the one truth above all, power will be yours.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dominate the Weak.</strong> The weak are there to be used. If they seek not the power to defend themselves, then why should you care for their lot? Use them as you will; discard them when you are done.</p></li><li><p><strong>Suffer no Goodness.</strong> The paladin of good is a lie unto themselves; they must be brought to heel. Destroy them or convert them, but suffer them not. For in their good deeds they give hope to the hopeless, robbing them of their strength.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aid in Suffering.</strong> If you see someone injured or in distress, do not offer them solace, to do so is a disservice. Instead, help them to understand their suffering and grow more powerful because of it. If they have not learned through their suffering, aid them to fully understand suffering, even if this means causing them pain. For in that pain they will grow and become free.</p></li></ul>",

Abandoned for whatever reason - ecological disaster, massive earthquake, depleted and infertile soils, erupted volcanoes - the wild inexorably reclaims what was once carved out of it. Any number of ancient and forgotten ruins therefore remain waiting to be rediscovered, perhaps with clues to their fate, ancient knowledge, and riches waiting to be uncovered.</p><p>Amidst these ruins are often cultural centers as well, such as temples or mosques once devoted to the worship of long-forgotten deities. The presence of these deities may linger on still, bound to the places where they were once revered, and seeking to be known once more. These forgotten deities, or obliviodeus, are but an echo of their former selves, a shimmering visage bound to a once glorious pantheon. It may be that their presence was summoned to prevent whatever calamity caused their civilization to crumble and be abandoned, that the being feels compelled to watch over the ashes of their congregation, or that simply they yearn to be worshipped once again. Whatever the reason for their presence, they are unable to leave and either completely disappear into the void or join with whatever gods may have once existed.</p><p>An obliviodeus may appear in any shape it so chooses - appearing as a gentle, benevolent, and beautiful woman, a hideous and wrathful demon, or anything in between. They may be indeed benevolent in nature, seeking nothing more than to pass into the void and be released from their summons or deceptive and cruel, seeking instead to be worshipped and restored to their former glory and power. They are unpredictable, however, as over perhaps centuries of isolation the forgotten deity may well have lost any sense of what once made them worthy of praise and worship. As a result, they may come across as patient and gentle in one moment, only for a dark shadow to fall over them and lead to ominous threats of raining destruction down upon those who defy them. Unpredictable as they are, a forgotten deity remains but an echo, their once awesome powers depleted and bound to the ruins of their place of worship. They are unable to leave the confines of their temple, though their magical powers may extend outward. If confronted and their physical manifestation destroyed, it will coalesce in a matter of days and remain bound until whatever conditions required for its release are met. They may harbor deep resentment toward any beings who cause them pain or those who have bound them to the physical world, thus they may hold deep anger toward mortal beings and blame them for their continued lonely existence devoid of worship.</p><p><strong>Ancient Knowledge and Wisdom.</strong> For those fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to explore ancient ruins and come across the presence of an obliviodeus, and also careful enough to entice them with either praise or final release, a forgotten deity is a fountain of ancient knowledge. Long forgotten magics may be learned from an obliviodeus, if only one is brave enough to bind to them as a patron. However the cost of such knowledge may be higher than what a mere mortal may wish to pay, and servitude to such an unpredictable being is not without significant risk.</p>",

They talk down to everyone and treat commoners and servants like slaves at best. Often they get away with this as they are the children of those almost as self-important as they are.</p><p>Somewhere in the universe there exists a most puissant practitioner of magic, who has devised a just punishment for those it deems most deserving of punishment for their mistreatment of others and general awfulness.</p><p>The Enthroned, or dicatnunc as they are called, awaken one morning to find a strange throne in their room or nearby, ornate and with a crown built into it. Most are so vain that they sit without even considering the implications, assuming the throne to be some sort of gift.</p><p>However, the object holds a most powerful curse. The second the intended target sits in the throne, they find themselves fixed to the seat, unable to move or to speak. The crown sitting above moves down to fix itself permanently on their heads and they cease being able to control their bodies. They are able to move, using their minds to guide the chair, although the chair seems to be at least semi-sentient, for it will not move them off cliffs or otherwise allow harm to come to the throne’s occupant.</p><p>Engraved within the throne are a series of small figures, extensions of the chair itself and the only way the enthroned is able to communicate. The statues are also sentient. One of them repeats the words that the Enthroned intends to say, the other repeats the thoughts that the enthroned is thinking.</p><p>Often, the dicatnunc start out as quite rude individuals. However, over the years this begins to change as their every thought is spoken by the sentient figures within the throne for all to hear. Eventually the being learns to control how they think... or are driven mad and enslaved by their own arrogance.</p><p>Many people have come forward claiming to be former enthroned. Quite often they become monks or clerics. They are usually quite humble people and kind to all. When asked about their experiences, they tend to be quite tight-lipped about it. One thing is apparent from the looks in their eyes - being enthroned is a harrowing experience and one to avoid at all cost.</p><p><strong>Chair Magic.</strong> The throne gives a dicatnunc some powers with which to defend themselves, although it will not allow them to harm themselves or the innocent. They can cast an array of wizard spells, and they also have the ability to teleport short distances to stay out of harm’s way.</p><p><strong>Unable to Commit Evil.</strong> The dicatnunc are unable to commit any acts of evil, either to themselves or others. Even if requested by someone else, they cannot do so. Many have tried in the past to utilize the power of the chairs to further evil schemes. Those enthroned who have tried to do evil in this way, have simply sat there and silently screamed. The chair, it appears, has the ability to inflict pain on its occupant, although it will not kill them.</p>",

In their tellings, the jealous god actually kills, or attempts to kill the good god. The good god’s lover often brings them back to life, albeit in a changed form.</p><p>Where once they held sway over life and abundance, they now also hold sway over the dead and their immortal souls.</p><p>The order of clericivitaeetmortis’, also known as the clerics of life and death, are the mortal embodiment of these forces; holding sway over the worlds of both the living and the dead.</p><p>A cleric of the order is responsible for the lives and deaths of their flock, often tending to everything from the birth of a child to death and beyond. They also perform the funerary right, including preservation of the body, to ensure the eternal soul’s earthen vessel is kept free from the ravages of time.</p><p>The clerics of the clericivitaeetmortis are mostly found in towns, villages, and cities, although they do number a small contingent of healers that travel the land, offering aid where it is needed, healing the sick, and passing judgment in both mundane matters of law and spiritual matters of the eternal.</p><p>One of their domains is the dwellings of the dead, which they protect from the ravages of time and from the tomb thieves, who sometimes endeavor to steal the earthly belongings of the departed. At times like these, they have been known to employ adventurers to aid them in their task.</p><p>An adventuring party that tries to loot the tombs they guard should take heed, as the clericivitaeetmortis are able to call upon the dead to aid them, using the powers of life and death to aid them in fighting off looters and desecrators.</p><p><strong>Power of Life.</strong> The powers that the clericivitaeetmortis wield over life are so great they can bring back from the brink those that most orders would consider well and truly beyond help.

Commoners look forward to distraction from the mundane drudgery of their life and the wealthy nobility wish to be entertained for sheer frivolity. While many individuals can pick up a lute or set of pipes to busk or play in taverns for the entertainment of all, the most highly sought after performers are those who have studied and trained diligently with other master performers. These individuals are well-read and have studied great theatre works of tragedy, comedy, and drama.</p><p>Scaenicus, or troubadours, are a group of wandering performers often commissioned by wealthy merchants or nobility to perform at their events. Their patrons, ever seeking to climb the social ladder and demonstrate their wealth and influence to their peers, spend exorbitant amounts of coin to ensure the highest level of entertainment they can as they negotiate dealings with their peers. As such, troubadours will often spend long months perfecting a unique theatre piece for their patrons, designed to delight the senses of those who watch their masterpieces.</p><p>Traveling from city to city, a scaenicus will often stop at smaller villages along the way, offering entertainment in exchange for food, drink, and a warm bed for a few nights. Inns and taverns will often scramble to secure such offers, for nights on which a scaenicus troupe performs will pack a tavern and allow the owners to reap perhaps a months’ worth of coin on a single night. At times they will travel with carnivals, circuses, or other entertainers for safety and the promise of consistent coin during difficult times or in less affluent regions, but the scaenicus can navigate any social circle effortlessly. They may travel with an entourage along with a number of draft horses; the better to haul their props and numerous trunks of clothing and costumes with them.</p><p>The scaenicus are quick witted by nature, but careful with both thought and spoken word - an ill-advised word toward a patron could potentially devastate the career of a troubadour, and reputations spread much more quickly than one can travel. They are therefore exceedingly courteous, their manners refined enough to impress even the highest of noble circles, and they treat even the lowliest beggar with the same courtesy as they would a great lord.</p><p><strong>Enchanting Performances.</strong> The performances of the scaenicus are brilliantly executed, their tragedies leaving not a single dry eye amongst their audience and their comedies having revelers roll about in mirth, roaring with laughter. Their masterpieces often incorporate twists of magic, illusions confusing the eye and just the faintest of scents or enchantments bringing the tales of the scaenicus to life.</p><p><strong>Story Weavers.</strong> Seldom will a troubadour encounter trouble of any kind. However, there are rare occasions when a jilted lover or a jealous spouse of a past fling may take issue with the actions of a scaenicus, or a drunken ruffian may deem them to be an easy target. In most cases, the scaenicus is able to weave their way out of such situations by clever word alone, but if not a would-be foe will find to their woe that the scaenicus often has any number of daggers hidden amongst their often outlandish clothing.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Lycanthrope Alphas</em></p><p>Beings afflicted with lycanthropy, whether through bloodline or via contact with one so cursed, are often shunned by society. Being marginalized as they are some lycanthropes, particularly those that reject their curse and are revolted by their own existence, choose to live solitary and often miserable lives. Those that embrace their affliction or eventually come to accept their state may band together with other lycanthropes to form packs or clans of like-minded beings. These packs offer security, companionship, and a sense of belonging. The social structure of such packs closely resembles that of the wild creatures they call kin.</p><p>Lycanthrope society can be loosely divided into several distinct castes. The upper caste consists of the Alphas, also known as the lupinantesiganus. There is only one alpha per pack, and they serve as leaders and strategists. The warrior caste, or lupinopraeliar, is comprised of mature lycanthropes that are hunters and defenders of the clan. These warriors often battle amongst themselves for supremacy, and the victor decreed the alpha. Young, the old or infirm, or laborers comprise what other societies would describe as civilians - lycanthropes who have not demonstrated sufficient strength to fit within the hierarchy of lycanthrope society, but who nonetheless are valued and defended as kin.</p><p>Lupinantesiganus are selected primarily for their strength in battle, having overcome countless challengers to lead the pack by right of arms. However, it requires more than simple prowess in combat to maintain their coveted position, as numerous warriors continuously seek to challenge their station. Alphas tend to also be charismatic, able to navigate and influence the perception of others with the goal of both maintaining their position as well as leading the pack effectively.</p><p>Lupinantesiganus are seldom found in their animal or even hybrid form, preferring the stately appearance of a noble humanoid. While their features are vaguely animal-like - elongated canines, wolf-like smile, coarse and thick hair that smells like a canine when wet - the features of alphas are refined and chiselled, their eyes piercing. While within their clans they are unmistakable, on the rare occasions they interact with other societies alphas will choose to wear fine clothes befitting their rank, and bear elaborate weapons often taken from defeated opponents as a subtle threat to any who might challenge their clan. Lupinantesiganus speak in direct and refined tones, but with an undertone that suggests impatience with frivolities and a barely restrained rage, particularly when interacting with outsiders.</p><p><strong>Lycanthrope Society.</strong> Lycanthrope society is based around respect for power and strength of arms, thus any beings interacting with werecreatures had best demonstrate sufficient strength. Any hint of weakness is likely to be met with violence, and any challenge to the strength of others is met in kind. Much like animals that communicate a great deal based on body language, one’s stance and bearing is critical when interacting with lycanthropes - prolonged eye contact can be regarded as a challenge to an alpha’s station, however too little eye contact is regarded as submission. Turning one’s back on a lycanthrope is regarded as dismissive and disrespectful, and thus keen observers will note thatequals in lycanthrope society back away a distance before turning direction.</p>",

Race was pitted against race, religious wars left cripples and beggars of once glorious civilizations, and it seemed as though the cunning and powerful would prey upon the weak and unsuspecting. Observing this and more over the span of many long years, the wizened one stood tall and decreed that this endless struggle must end - and so let it begin with them. Thus were born an order devoted to enlightening other beings toward a better way of living - through peaceful coexistence and cooperation: the seekers of the divine peace, or the ariolcupitora.</p><p>The ariolcupitora possesses a deep sense of peace and calm, yet also a deep sorrow at observing the trials and tribulations of others. Those who encounter a seeker of the divine peace describe them as being open to the suffering of others, as they are motivated to convince other beings of a better way to live. Often the ariolcupitora are deeply spiritual, possessing a profound connection to whatever noble and altruistic god they serve - such connections granting the ariolculpitora divine magical powers. Often the ariolcupitora consist of long-lived species who have had the opportunity to learn much about the ways of the world, and they too have said boldly that it must begin with them.</p><p>Often the ariolcupitora travel amidst the drudgery and chaos of an unsafe world as bards, warriors, and priests, offering comfort and solace to the unfortunate and offering their service as protectors. They yearn for freedom and free will, believing in the inherent goodness of all beings and that, given the choice, life will cooperate to become more than the sum of their individual pieces.</p><p>The seekers of the divine peace appear as would any being from any walk of life, dressed as the lowliest beggar to being clad in moonlit silks and satins. However they appear, they share a deep and genuine empathy toward others as they tirelessly seek to sway other beings toward their virtuous cause. They are careful in their speech and yet firm in their convictions, never hesitating from delivering their message to all who might listen.</p><p><strong>Masterful Performers.</strong> In many areas being taught to read and write is considered a luxury that few can afford in their daily existence and so the spoken or sung word is a means through which many tales are told. The ariolcupitora are therefore masters of performance, singing rousing tales of noble pursuits and stirring those who listen to their tales to action. Often they will be found amidst travelling troupes that offer companionship, protection, and the opportunity to travel across the lands while spreading their gospel of peaceful coexistence between all beings.</p><p><strong>Divine Warrior-Priests.</strong> There are times where the message of peace offered by the ariolcupitora is less than welcome, or that they may be called upon to defend the weak. In such situations, the ariolcupitora are more than capable of defending themselves, even summoning forth the divine wrath of their gods. Even the most noble and peace-loving of beings must at times raise their blade to defend a virtuous cause.</p>",

Many rumors, some with and some without a grain of truth, have been spread about them over the years. Most do not know the truth from fiction, however, and this has caused some distrust when the barbarians do pass through more civilized lands, as some of the tales talk of outlandish deals with demons to gain their steel-like skin.</p><p>In truth, the steel barbarians are the recipient of a divine gift from their, ofttimes, unfeeling gods. The lives of barbarian tribes are often hard and their gods represent that hardness. At some unknown time in their past, one such deity reached down and bestowed a gift of sorts on his charges. While their skin is not truly metallic, it has certain properties in common with metals used in the production of weapons, armor, and other more mundane items. It has hardened the steel barbarians’ skin making them impervious to most normal weapons; it has also made the steel barbarians resistant to both extreme heat and extreme cold.</p><p>A curious side effect of the gift given to them means that members of the tribe are born with a range of metal characteristics. Variations include steel skin, mithril skin, and adamantine skin. Once again, no one else outside of the tribe itself knows whether this is simply a variation in tone, which is normal amongst all races, or something that imparts other gifts to the barbarians.</p><p>Those members of the tribe that are seen outside of their ancestral lands are quite often either following on the trail of those who have done great wrongs to the tribe, or are on their quest to be accepted as an adult member of the tribe.</p><p>The barbariferros are stalwart companions to those they join in battle and feared adversaries to those they face across the field of battle. Their preferred fighting style is wielding two weapons, usually a hammer and war pick. These they wield in a swirling display of skill and grace.</p><p><strong>Not Only Steel.</strong> To those in more civilized lands, the steel barbarians make up the only members of the tribe they have ever seen and, therefore, are what they see as the standard member of the tribe. They are, however, only the warriors of the tribe. There are many other groups within the tribe, such as the Iron Rangers. There are even rumors of a group called the Metallic Clergy, who make up the priesthood of the barbarian tribes.</p><p><strong>Rage is Best Served Cold.</strong> Whether it is a gift that has grown from their metal heritage or something that was part of the gift of steel, barbariferros enter something they call a cold rage. Unlike most barbarians who must stay in combat to maintain their rage, steel barbarians can maintain theirs for its entire duration. Their skin also grows even tougher when they rage, making them even harder to hit and making their swings hit harder still.</p>",

However, reality seldom follows the path of legend and lore - many would-be adventurers toil to find meaningful employment and travel from settlement to settlement, seeking the opportunity to earn their keep in yet another rickety inn while risking life and limb to earn their place in the tales they grew up upon.</p><p>Many of these youthful adventurers take up the blade without knowing the true horrors of combat, and yet it seems there is a never ending supply of willing individuals to take up the cause, much as there seems to be a never-ending list of adversaries to face. Many of these individuals never return from their first few forays into adventure.</p><p>The gladiuravit, or keepers of the blade, are members of a loosely organized fellowship of the blade that recruits would-be adventurers into their ranks, offers them basic martial training, and provides contracts their recruits across the land. Recruits are trained, well-fed, and provided with a safe base of operations. In exchange, the bladesworn recruits provide a hefty fee to the fellowship that often makes its way upward into the pockets of the nobility, and an endless supply of opportunities to earn the renown they so desperately crave.</p><p>Those few who survive long enough to pay off their debt to the fellowship of the blade are often offered advancement and further training by weapon masters employed by the brotherhood. These more able-bodied members are highly respected and often their reputation precedes them across the various settlements they have served in.</p><p>Despite being provided with the basic necessities to ply their trade, the gladiuravit are often ill-equipped to survive in the harsh wilderness they may find themselves within. Often all they have to rely upon is their trusted sword, a few tatterings of leather cobbled together to protect them. The gladiuravit are often found plying their trade in frontier settlements, often in service as bodyguards, merchant caravan escorts, hired muscle, or even just toiling in a field during times of relative calm. Outside of their work, the keepers of the blade are often found in taverns and alehouses, spending their hard-earned wages regaling locals of their exploits, boasting about their prowess with their sword and seeking to carve a name for themselves that they might earn their next contract. They are often arrogant in their youth, brash, and quick to anger.</p><p><strong>Master of the Blade.</strong> The training of a gladiuravit is intensely focused on their skills with a sword, to the detriment of their development in other areas. As a result, bladesworn tend to be ignorant in other areas of their schooling and yet are exceptional warriors capable of cutting their way through most adversaries.</p><p><strong>Prone to Anger.</strong> Perhaps due to their prowess with a blade, the gladiuravit tend to be overconfident and prone to seeking confrontation. They rarely let even the slightest affront to their ego slide, and as a result, can find themselves in difficult situations that may often be resolved only by cutting their way through. They often have the ability to do so however, or at least the confidence to intimidate others.</p>",

      "description": "<p><em>Lycanthrope Warriors</em></p><p>The warrior caste of lycanthrope society is the lupinopraeliar. Consisting of adult lycanthropes who have reached maturity and demonstrated their competency in combat either by defeating another member of the praeliar or slaying an enemy outside their clan, this caste is the second highest one can achieve other than the clan alpha.</p><p>The lupinopraeliar are highly regarded within their society, responsible as they are for the protection of their civilian caste - the young unproven, the laborers, and the infirm. The praeliar caste is also responsible for hunting and ensuring a sufficient supply of food for the clan and will regularly create hunting parties to send forth into the wilderness.</p><p>In humanoid form, praeliar are lithe, muscular beings larger than the average humanoid. They have features that are vaguely canine, such as elongated canines, coarse dense hair, slightly larger nasal cavities, and a distinct musky scent. They tend to speak in soft, low tones when contented or unthreatened, but their tone begins to growl from deep within their chests if they see the need to assert themselves. To many, lycanthropes seem much more prone to violence than other beings. Seldom do peaceful times last whenever a lycanthrope clan is near another civilization, and this often leads to conflict or even short wars between lycanthropes and other species. Such wars are short, bloody, and may lead to the complete destruction of either side.</p><p><strong>Lycanthrope Body Language.</strong> The importance of body language to lycanthropes cannot be emphasized enough to those who interact with them. The slightest perceived weakness leads to disrespect and subtle body language cues often lead to challenges by them. A smile, while a sign of warmth and friendship in many cultures, is considered a mild threat to a lycanthrope, and a grin even more so - the baring of teeth regarded as a direct challenge to one’s station. An outsider grinning at a lupinopraeliar will be directly challenged and combat initiated, perhaps without provocation from the challengers perspective. Turning one’s back on a lycanthropraeliar is a sign the being is about to flee or demonstrates disregard for them, and may trigger an attack. Those interacting with a prealiar or any within lycanthrope society would be best advised to speak in clear, firm tones, not show weakness in their body language, and be perpetually ready for a skirmish with a praeliar.</p><p><strong>Strict Warrior Hierarchy.</strong> Within the praeliar caste, power and ferocity are valued above all. A strict hierarchy within this caste means that some warriors are more highly regarded than others, and one can advance within the caste by challenging their betters. Should a praeliar challenge one of higher standing, the more senior warrior is obligated to meet such a challenge or lose their role, being replaced by the challenger. To outsiders, challenges are often sudden and not easily noticed, but a subtle threat, inappropriately timed eye contact, or insufficient submissive body language are cues a lesser praeliar is challenging the greater. Such challenges are met immediately with a ferocious scuffle - sometimes with fists or blades, other times with tooth and claw. Combat is short, brutally violent, and often ends with one combatant wounded and left with a lesson on how to respect their betters.</p>",

While commoners are often taught the basics - arithmetic, reading, and other skills required for daily life, obtaining a higher education is often prohibitively expensive for all but the wealthiest of families, or those who have sufficient talent and luck to have a patron willing to sponsor them.</p><p>Those individuals who can afford more advanced teachings often pursue fields in demand, such as history, tactics, navigation, commerce, logistics, or diplomacy - very few choose to learn the finer arts. Those that do may choose any number of paths, but are commonly known as histrio - performers. These individuals have studied at the finest arts institutes, and have mastered any number of skills - composing countless fine works, playing numerous rare and exotic instruments, being able to make and alter clothing and disguises, singing, dancing, and commanding any number of stages from a tavern table to catering to aristocratic nobles.</p><p>Histrio are found wherever their fancy takes them. Seldom wanting for coin or aught else, they choose their engagements selectively, and sometimes infrequently as they spend their spare time honing their craft and compiling their next great masterpiece. Performers are highly focused on their works, and as such come across as disinterested and aloof toward other beings. That said, they are inherently curious about the nature of life, and observe others carefully - for everyday life contains all elements needed for another performance - great tragedy, hysterical comedy, mundane drudgery, and all manner of struggle. They may spend weeks at a time carefully considering each element of a story they wish to tell, becoming aggravated should they not find the perfect words to fit the tale they wish to weave. Only perfection will do for a histrio, and they never step onto a stage with anything less than what they view as a masterpiece.</p><p>Seldom wanting for anything and obtaining free room and board in inns and taverns in exchange for sharing their talents, histrio are prone to excess - they are often very fond of indulgences such as fine wines and extravagant clothing. Thus they come across as rather pretentious toward others, speaking in haughty tones, particularly when frustrated with their own engagements. However, they like nothing more than to share a glass of fine wine with others and hear tales that they can weave into poem.</p><p><strong>Master of the Spoken Word.</strong> Histrio are masters of the spoken and sung word, and are capable of making even the tallest tale sound plausible. Those who hear them speak or sing are transported to another existence, one of daring deeds and deep sorrow. Even when not performing, others are often enchanted by the tales woven by a histrio, and many find them immeasurably charming and engaging.</p><p><strong>Cunning Spies.</strong> Being able to make any tale plausible, combined with their keen eye for the behavior of others makes the histrio valuable sources of information. Thus they make cunning spies, and may gather vital intelligence on a variety of activities wherever they travel. They are more than capable quite capable of spreading misinformation; being regarded as trustworthy wherever they travel.</p>",

Corsairs, pirates, and raiders abound seeking to prey on merchant and passenger vessels alike and unpredictable tempests can catch vessels unaware.</p><p>To protect themselves, their cargo and passengers, some of the wealthiest nations will enlist the services of the cursario, or privateers. Highly skilled sailors who have adopted a mercenary’s life, few cursario would willingly choose this path. Many adopt this style of life out of necessity rather than a sense of duty, greed for gold, or lust for battle. Instead, they reluctantly enter into an unsigned privateer’s agreement with their financier, knowing through their actions slavers may be brought to justice, pirates brought to heel, and the seas made a little bit safer for travellers. The rather lucrative agreement taken on by the cursario makes them no mere pirate, but rather a well paid, loyal mercenary force that falls upon opponents like wolves of the sea. In return, their financier obtains the service of a loyal and capable retainer while maintaining the plausible deniability needed for them to direct perhaps less than legal means of harassing their adversaries.</p><p>Privateering has long been used as a means by which nations can wage war upon each other outside of the laws that bind nation states, where they can vie for control over lucrative shipping and supply lanes. Cursario ships often fly neutral colors when patrolling their territories, though when harassing pirates and other raiders they will raise a red flag. The red flag serves a double purpose, leaving no doubt in the minds of pirates and corsairs as to what fate they shall meet should the cursario in battle - a long plank and a short, wet fall into the briny depths.</p><p>Should they be captured by their opponents, a rare occurrence if ever for these skilled sailors and fighters, their financiers can plausibly deny having ever taken the cursario into their service. The privateer fly under no flag save that of the Red, and will maintain the integrity of their privateer’s agreement even in the face of torture. However, the cursario knows well upon their death they will receive no honors, but instead go to their grave with their integrity intact.</p><p>The cursario are often well read, courteous, and professional in their dealings with others. Due to their dangerous choice in profession, they are cold, cautious, and calculating in their approach to any interaction with others. They contemplate the implications of their actions well in advance, mapping out contingencies and alternatives to ensure a successful mission.</p><p><strong>Efficient and Professional.</strong> Unlike more roguish swashbuckling pirates and the like who are more often found boasting of their deeds in taverns and regaling admiring crowds with bawdy shanty songs, the cursario are professional and efficient, knowing their reputation is almost as important as their deeds. Their fighting style is equally professional, a series of precise and brutally efficient sword strokes capable of rapidly dispatching their opponents all which warily defend against the dirty tricks known to be the calling card of the less skilled but more ruthless pillagers and pirates. Whereas a pirate may take pleasure in tormenting an already defeated foe, a privateer will choose to end an engagement as quickly as possible, knowing that no reinforcements will come.</p>",

This may be achieved through the application of many years of training in the medical arts, where one learns how to properly clean and disinfect wounds, set bones, and treat various maladies through the application of complex alchemical potions and poultices. While a solid foundation is created without the use of magic, some practitioners may weave castings to almost instantly mend the most grievous of wounds, poisons, and other afflictions, though these skills are much less common.</p><p>These apothecaries are highly skilled medical practitioners who have spent long years studying the effects of herbs and simples to treat afflictions ranging from a mild headache to the rarest and most lethal of plagues. Their intimate knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants and, occasionally, the harvested organs and fluids of creatures allows them to treat their patients through any number of means.</p><p>Often the medice prefer a solitary life in the wild, in ramshackle cabins littered will all manner of odd drying plants and any number of alchemical tools and devices. Often they are found foraging in nearby woodlands or unique environments, diligently documenting plants, taking samples to conduct their experiments, and harvesting ingredients for their treatments. Locals will visit them for treatment, or at times the medice may themselves will make the short journey to local settlements to check on their patients or trade their remedies for whatever needs they may need to procure.</p><p>When not foraging or exploring for tincture and potion ingredients or tending to patients, medici are often purifying and distilling components from their gatherings, brewing strange potions, or experimenting with new procedures to treat those who may have need of their services. Some medici possess modest magical abilities which can aid their identification of poisons, disease, or toxins.</p><p>The medici have little patience for idle conversation, and come across gruff and disinterested. However, their demeanour soon changes when faced with a patient — their bedside manner changing to one of compassion and concern for the wellbeing of a patient. They are often older and wizened, their backs stooped from long hours spent digging and studying the natural world. The medici are generally clad in unusual but clean garb, their steady hands rough, calloused, but meticulously scrubbed and cared for in preparation for when they might be needed.</p><p><strong>Knowledgeable Survivalists.</strong> As they often choose to live away from the settlements they serve and closer to the source of their ingredients, medici tend to be highly knowledgeable about their environments, knowing precisely the most nutritious plants to consume and which may cause less than pleasant side effects if consumed. They tend to avoid conflict and hunting, preferring instead to live a simple existence of foraging for their meals.</p><p><strong>Patient Teachers.</strong> On rare occasions, a medice may take on a willing student, should they prove to have steady hands and a keen, curious mind. In such cases, a medice is patient but also a demanding teacher, knowing well that the knowledge they can impart upon their apprentices may take a lifetime to learn, but can save countless lives.</p>",

Only the elderly that can no longer perform their duties reside in the master house, training new initiates, to send out into the world.</p><p><strong>In Touch with Nature.</strong> Due to much of their time being spent in the wilderness, pinachuspugione are much closer to nature than other monastic orders.

Legends also tell of gods falling in love and bearing or siring children with mortals. The offspring of such unions were regarded as demigods and possessed powerful magical abilities, immunity to all but the most virulent of diseases, as well as an unnaturally long life. Yet they remained mortal, and not even these so-called vetunus, or ancient ones, were immune to the ravages of old age or the keen edge of a blade.</p><p>After many of the gods chose to no longer walk among mortals but rather in their own realms, the ancient ones interbred with other mortal races. Over millennia, this diluted the powers bestowed upon their offspring. Now, the bloodlines of the vetunus are all but extinct, save for a few beings who have still trodden the earth for a few millennia. There still may be some creatures bearing the blood of the gods, yet few may know of this. It may be that some magical traits are passed down through countless generations and manifest in sorcerous ways.</p><p>As one would expect, such a long-lived being would accumulate a wealth of knowledge and experience over their lifetime. Thus, the remaining vetunus that are known are sought after for their wisdom and counsel by any number of rulers. However, the ancient ones are nothing if not careful with their knowledge and are selective in whom they serve - they have seen countless good-intentioned rulers corrupted by the lure of power and their kingdoms descended into disarray. Likewise, they have seen the horror of countless wars and the ensuing famine and rebuilding that can last for generations. The counsel of an ancient one, while highly sought after, is therefore very carefully given.</p><p>Thanks to their bloodlines, ancient ones still retain impressive magical abilities. While they can manipulate their bodies to appear however they decide, in their wisdom, they often choose appearances that reflect their names. Vetunus often resemble elder councillors attending a king or queen in their court, and are often close at hand whenever negotiations are being held or treaties signed. Knowing as they do that a few well-chosen words can have a significant impact, they are reflective, thoughtful, and very careful with what counsel and advice they may offer. At times, they will act as emissaries between nations, conducting sensitive negotiations on behalf of their lords. As their wisdom is highly regarded, such negotiations between nations are long-lived and binding, and alliances forged with the aid and influence of a vetunus are strong and can withstand the test of time.</p><p><strong>Powers of Foresight.</strong> The vetunus have both the advantage of many years of experience, as well as the ability to peer into the distant future and evaluate the myriad of futures that may exist. They are careful with sharing such auguries, however, as they know the future is ever shifting and mutable. Sometimes, the wisest thing a being can do is to say nothing at all.</p>",

It is here that power wells and flows. Those trained in gathering such power and redirecting it are considered rare and powerful practitioners of magic.</p><p>The wizards of the edge, or Oramagicae, as they are known, are practitioners able to feel the edge of any situation and turn it into power. Such magic is highly volatile and takes a steady hand and a steadier mind. In the hands of a lesser mage, this would lead to unpredictable magical surges and strange effects. Oramagicae have learned how to direct those surges to their benefit and use them instead to empower their spells: making their destructive spells even more destructive, their divining spells more accurate and far reaching, their conjurations capable of bringing forth more powerful creatures, and the illusion spells have caused many a powerful warrior or rogue to stare blissfully into space as they were dispatched, never even feeling the killing blow so enraptured were they.</p><p>However, there is always a downside to this sort of magic. If the Oramagicae cannot find an edge, they cannot use it to empower their magic. Sometimes, there is simply no edge to be found and the wizard can quickly find their powerful magics curtailed by a weakened connection to the weave.</p><p>Edge magic is not for the faint of heart. It is a road to power and greatness for those that can walk the fine line and a death sentence for those that have neither the will nor the intellect to properly direct the flow of magic. Some have even been known to pull so much of this magical essence into themselves that they explode from the overload of energies, causing widespread damage and wild magic sparks in surrounding areas.</p><p>Such uncontrolled explosions have been known to cause permanent areas of magic, causing anyone entering them to fall sick if they linger in the area for long. Even those without magical gifts have become prone to magical sparks, which results in unpredictable and uncontrollable effects.</p><p><strong>Living on the Edge.</strong> Controlling unpredictable amounts of magical power is always dangerous. There is always a chance of overloading oneself and Oramagicae are no exception to that rule. However, because of their iron control, they tend to do damage to themselves rather than cause magical sparks. Should that damage kill them, however, the wild magic sparking out could cause considerable damage to those around them. </p><p><strong>Straddling the Border.</strong> Oramagicae are generally neutral, sitting as they do on the border between. They wield the magics of life and death in equal measure and in many cases where the magic they use would be considered light or dark, they can use their edge abilities to change it to another type entirely. Such magic needs a large surge of edge magic to work well and can cause backlash to the caster if they don’t possess enough power to control this fantastical force.</p>",

So it is with the Lava Warriors, also known as lavausors. What was once a failed experiment to harness the power of the elemental plane of fire by a wise and pussiant wizard of yore has turned into an order of elite warriors.</p><p>The wizard, whose name has been lost to time, was experimenting with ways to augment his powers, with the power of elemental lava, even up to transforming himself into an elemental, capable of hurling devastating flame. However, something went wrong and instead of augmenting his spells, he augmented his body. While this eventually would be put to good use, it was, at first, a disaster. The wizard could not touch anything without melting or burning it.</p><p>Eventually, he learned to control the magma that had replaced his blood and direct its flow to help him instead of hinder him. The story amongst the Lava Warriors is that a wise and powerful ruler of an ancient land came to the wizard, beseeching them for knowledge on how to empower his warriors.</p><p>At first the wizard refused, fearful what such a transformation could do and unwilling to teach any to harness the power as he had. Because of his refusal, many of his countrymen died ferocious combat. Twice more he refused, and twice more young warriors perished. Eventually, the enemy of his people stood outside the gates of the city ready to vanquish it. All inside knew they could withstand months of siege, but that the host before them would eventually destroy them all.</p><p>Finally, upon seeing the enemy and the imminent defeat apparent in the eyes of his countrymen, the wizard relented. Using the same ritual, he converted dozens of warriors into lavausor. It took many weeks to train them to control their powers, during which time the siege raged on. Eventually, though, it was done. Each warrior, now augmented with the power of elemental lava, was ready.</p><p>The next day, the gates of the city opened and two hundred lavausor strode forth. The enemy howled in derision, hurling insults at the warriors. Quite soon the enemy were howling in agony as the Lava Warriors began tearing through their ranks with abandon. It seemed no weapon could touch them, their skin hardening against sword and spear and no armor was protection against them, melting at the touch of their weapons.</p><p><strong>Lava Flows Through These Veins.</strong> The ritual replaces a warrior’s blood with elemental magma, which permeates every cell of their bodies. They can use it to create a hardened shell around their bodies, or allow it to flow into their weapons or their shields. They even have limited capacity to cast spells of the elemental plane of fire. There have been rumors of some members being able to transform into fire elementals, however that has never been confirmed.</p><p><strong>Protectors of the Innocent.</strong> Since their creation during that long ago battle, the lava warriors have had only one focus: protecting the weak and the innocent from evil men. Their order has been kept small. Partly due to the risk of death from the transformation, but also to stop them from ever becoming big enough that they become a threat themselves.</p>",
