This hearth helps warm you and your companions, and can be used to prepare hearty and nutritious meals on the road. If you or any friendly creatures you make camp with would regain hit points at the end of a short rest by spending one or more hit dice, each of those creatures may choose to re-roll one of their resting dice, taking the higher roll between the two.  Additionally, you gain proficiency with Cook’s utensils. </p><p> </p><h2>Channel Divinity: Magnificent Feast</h2><p>Starting at 2nd level, you may use your Channel Divinity to conjure a magical feast for the rough road ahead.

You grant yourself and a number of allies, up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), a boon from your deity. Allies must be able to see you and be within 30 feet to receive the boon. Once per round, a creature benefitting from this boon can roll a d6, adding the result to a skill check, saving throw, or attack roll. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 round). A creature can only benefit from this effect if it can see at least one of its allies. </p><p> </p><h2>Divine Strike</h2><p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon with the power to punish wrongdoing. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. Visions of the evil they have wrought upon others flash before their eyes. You choose whether any foe reduced to 0 hit points by this attack remains stable or dies. </p><p>When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p><p> </p><h2>Paragon of the People</h2><p>At 17th level, your Community Watch grants an additional d6 to each affected ally. It also grants immunity to fear for the duration of the effect. Additionally, your Magnificent Feast produces twice as many foodstuffs, each of which can, when consumed, remove a single curse or disease affecting the target (including attunement to a cursed item). </p><p> </p>",
