Animated skeletons are common among the practitioners of the necromantic arts. Even at the Avium, where necromancy is forbidden in practice, it is taught in theory. A common exception is the use of animated skeletons for menial tasks around the college. The reanimation of birdfolk who did not give their express consent in life is seen as a violation of their memory, so these skeletons usually consist of former college staff who desired to stay and help long past their own time. Not all scholars agree that even this relatively benign form of necromancy should be allowed, while others don’t see why permission from the dead should be necessary, believing that “dead is dead”.

Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Caustic Slime</h2>\n<p>These pale green oozes have an astringent chemical odor, which mixes with the smell of liquefied flesh from their latest meal. Owing to the slow speed at which they digest their victims, the bones of partially-digested meals can be seen through their transparent exterior. Dissolving remnants move within the slimes in a macabre semblance of motion.  This phenomena has earned them the nickname “green puppeteers”.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Defenses</strong>. Capable of producing a lethal acid that can eat away at stone and metal, caustic slimes are especially deadly. Even the slightest touch on exposed fur or feathers can be dangerous. Many would-be heroes have met a slow, grim demise after being engulfed by these strange creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific Interest.</strong> Though hazardous, the acid produced by these slimes is also valued for its potential uses as a powerful sorcery reagent and an ingredient in potent potions. Some claim it can be distilled into practical applications, like a solvent for metallurgists and builders.</p>",

Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colonies of Combustion</strong>. Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting. The real threat they pose lies in the remarkable coordination of their colonies.</p>\n<p>Alone, an emberbat is no more dangerous than a candle. But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them. However, recently colonies of emberbats are acting aggressively towards travelers, harassing any who approach their expanding territories. Some swear they have seen emberbat supercolonies whose heat could be felt from yards away. </p>\n<p><strong>Fine Familiar</strong>s.

          "description": "<p>Cobblefrights are undead monstrosities created through dark necromancy. Rumored to have been originally devised by the mad necromancer Lathrus of the Night’s Call, cobblefrights are made by linking several birdfolk skeletons together to form one frightening creature with enhanced physical properties. Among those who have studied Lathrus’ research, only the most reckless have tried to create a cobblefright of their own, often to disastrous effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror of Horrors</strong>. Cobblefrights are generally pieced together from the skeletons of five or six birdfolk. The combination of multiple bodies allows not only for a larger and more robust design, but also vastly increases the quantity of necromantic energies cobblefrights contain. This increased capacity for power provides cobblefrights with tremendous strength, as much as a dozen birdfolk combined. It also grants cobblefright bones greater durability. Their remarkable power and resilience is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as cobblefrights also require a large amount of necromantic energy to be sustained. The surviving records of cobblefright creators note that, quite unexpectedly, the creatures developed the ability to drain the life force of other living beings, replenishing their own energy in the process. This makes cobblefrights useful as independent sentries, so long as they have a steady supply of living beings to fuel them. </p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic Psyche</strong>. The discordant parts that comprise cobblefrights exert tremendous strain on the bodies of these creatures. The source of this strain is rooted in the same magic that allows birdfolk skeletons to recall skills they once knew in life: the bones remember. Remnants of the soul such as memories, desires, fears, skills, and certain forms of knowledge are imprinted on the bones of the departed. When activated by necromantic energy, these conflicting impressions swirl chaotically within cobblefrights. Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator. However, necromancers must be careful to maintain control over these dangerous creatures. Damaged cobblefrights will readily harvest their maker as an immediate source of life energy.</p>",

Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colonies of Combustion</strong>. Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting.

But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them.

Forest prowlers are apex predators. They can claim virtually any prey they desire, but usually target deer, elk, and other large herbivores. Prowlers use their powerful bodies and gripping claws to drag their kill up into their tree nests, where it can be consumed at their leisure.

Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for  scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Shifting Slime</h2>\n<p>A type of large and fluid ooze, shifting slimes have an iridescent hue to them which seems to shift as they move. According to slime-wranglers, they can use magical energy to create an eerie bioluminescence. Shifting slime residue is a highly sought after potent reagent, but it is hard to come by. Despite their size, these slimes are elusive and generally spend their time below ground where visibility is low. They can be quite difficult to locate when they conceal themselves in the subterranean darkness, though these strange creatures are known to leave trails of bioluminescent residue to lure in prey. </p>\n<p><strong>Adaptive Defenses</strong>. This type of slime can harness magical energy within its form. Shifting slimes absorb and store magic passively over time, but are also capable of absorbing magical jolts from spells. It is unclear exactly how much energy they can store, or for how long.</p>\n<p>Shifting slimes can develop a temporary immunity to various types of magic after exposure.

Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for  scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Sticky Slime</h2>\n<p>A semi-solid type of ooze, sticky slimes are far more robust than their cousins.

Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colonies of Combustion</strong>. Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting. The real threat they pose lies in the remarkable coordination of their colonies.</p>\n<p>Alone, an emberbat is no more dangerous than a candle. But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them. However, recently colonies of emberbats are acting aggressively towards travelers, harassing any who approach their expanding territories. Some swear they have seen emberbat supercolonies whose heat could be felt from yards away. </p>\n<p><strong>Fine Familiar</strong>s.

          "description": "<h2><br />The Tenders</h2>\n<p>Although the Tenders are most well known across the Wood for their involvement in healing and studying the Scorched Grove, their order is actually far more ancient. Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors.</p>\n<h2>Havel of the Autumn Moon</h2>\n<p>Havel is a frail but courageous huden gallus, with pheasant-like plumage. He is a dear friend of Tevor, and the two have fallen for each other during their time together in Alderheart.</p>\n<p>Havel is a Summerblossom, a rank given to experienced members of the Tenders. He has been working at the Tenders’ headquarters in the Trunk district, where he provides aid to the refugees.</p>\n<p>He is also skilled in the use of natural magic, and while normally too sickly to adventure, could still assist the party with his talents. </p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",

Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors. </p>\n<h2>Tevor of the Spring Path </h2>\n<p>Tevor is a timid sable luma, with ruddy gray feathers and a short beak. He is a good friend of Havel, and has begun to feel affection for the gallus since their time working together.</p>\n<p>Tevor is a Sapling, a low ranking member of the Tenders, who barely escaped from an ashsnake attack that killed his mentor. While he has agreed to give his report of events in the Scorched Grove, he is not prepared to do much beyond this. He possesses conviction in the beliefs of his order, but the traumatic event has left him feeling frightened and helpless.</p>\n<p>If only he could find the courage to match his ideals, he would be destined for greatness. Tevor is generally averse to combat now, but before joining the Tenders he trained as a perch guard recruit.</p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",

A small hand-cart stacked high with bags and boxes of various sizes stands nearby. One of the hooded figures goes to the cart and unceremoniously sifts through the packages, leaving fallen bundles strewn on the road.</p><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">As you approach the three strangers who were gesturing at the body, you can see the pointed faces of mapach under the hoods. Two male and one female mapach, each wearing worn leather armor and a short sword on their belt. The fourth, an intimidating vulpin female, is lightly armored and wears an ornate sword on her hip. She seems to be hanging back, letting her subordinates do all the work.</p><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">You hear a whimpered “Help me” from the creature laying on the road, but you can’t make out their features. The mapach female, still standing near the fallen body, puts her hands on her hips and says to the party, “All right folks, nothing to see. Move along if you know what’s good for ya.”</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The vulpin leading these three <span class=\"hpp bold-purple\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-npcs.Actor.h3bgFDVaSI9OrtKX]{mapach bandits}</span> is a powerful foe named <span class=\"hpp bold-green\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-npcs.Actor.cTbOjLcXtaVPKaRR]{Fray Merridan} (see Appendix B, pg. 208)</span>. She represents a serious threat to the party, but won’t take interest in them unless she has a reason to believe the characters are a worthy challenge.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Assuming the party doesn’t want to fight, the bandits will leave if bribed. They are reasonable robbers, and will gladly relinquish the cart if the party can offer a worthy sum. Negotiations start with Fray evaluating the cart’s contents. She and her crew will simply walk away for 10 gp each. Players can roll <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">opposed Charisma (Deception) or (Persuasion) checks</span> against a Wisdom check made by Fray to negotiate for a lower price, but the bandits won’t leave for anything less than 5 gp each.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Believing they have the upper hand, the bandits won’t hesitate to attack if they sense trepidation or suspect that the party might be up to something. Any threats or posturing from the characters will be met with an attack from the three mapach bandits. This fight shouldn’t be too difficult, as the party likely outnumbers the bandits and are probably better equipped.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Fray will stay back and let the party fight the bandits for a round or two. She will intervene after two rounds or when a bandit is brought down. Fray will target the character who looks to be the most capable in single combat. If the party is larger than four players, she will engage in combat from the start, ordering her underlings to deal with the others.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Vulpin-Captain-Fray.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp image-name-caption\">Fray</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">Joining the fight, the bandit captain says, “Intriguing. You look like you might actually give me a proper fight!” The vulpin smirks and draws her blade, tracing intricate patterns in the air as she rushes into battle.</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Fray is a deadly foe, but she wasn’t prepared to have her heist interrupted. She won’t risk her life needlessly if the odds turn against her. If at least two of the mapach bandits go down, she will make a tactical retreat into the dense forest, where she can easily disappear in the foliage. While escaping, she will swear revenge and leave any unfortunate underlings to the party’s mercy.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The terrain is difficult for the party, but not for Fray, who is familiar with the area. Any character trying to pursue Fray on foot will quickly lose her in the forest unless they can make a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check perception 15 format=long]]</span> each round. The dense forest also makes gliding difficult. Most birdfolk can’t glide through the trees, but Small birdfolk characters can attempt to glide after Fray, avoiding trunks and branches with a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check acrobatics 15 format=long]]</span>.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Failure on either the Wisdom or Dexterity check means the character has lost sight of Fray and ends the chase for that character. A character successfully chasing Fray through the woods means the party catches up with her, at which point she will surrender. If four rounds have passed since her retreat, the party has lost Fray.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Should the party choose to try and locate Fray by continuing down the road, they will arrive at a clearing where a river separates them from a dense forest on the other side. A heavy log sits with one end on riverbank and the other end in the water, preventing the party from crossing the river and chasing Fray.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the party continues through any forest terrain, they will need to make regular survival checks to avoid becoming lost in the trees. Use the <span class=\"bold-red\">@UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-encounter-rt.RollTable.t3ui5wGQihQDw9v1]{Forest Encounters (Level 1-2)} table (pg. 216)</span> for an especially persistent group. Make it clear that the vulpin has made her getaway, covering her tracks well enough that following her is fruitless.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the encounter should go horribly awry, the bandits won’t bother capturing the party or finishing them off. Rather, they will retreat, stealing as much from the hand-cart as they can carry. After all, the bandits aren’t sure there won’t be reinforcements coming to the rescue. If a player consents, their character can earn a scar from their battle with Fray in order to heighten anticipation for the rematch later.</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-yellow\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-header-3\">TREASURE</p><p class=\"hpp para-1\">The mapach bandits are wearing worn leather armor and each one carries a poorly-kept short sword.

After a minute of observation, characters can determine weak spots in the structure. Striking these with a series of three hits against AC 10 with ranged weapons or spells will trigger the collapse.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">Thunder damage</span>.

A creature of legend, it is believed by some that this was the “being of fire and destruction” said to have caused the Great Calamity that created the Scorched Grove many centuries ago. The aspect possesses frightening power, enough to cause serious harm to the Wood and all those who inhabit it. Long has it been forgotten that the creature was conjured in a lost ritual. Shortly afterwards, it was sealed away beneath the Scorched Grove where its presence has continued to affect the region. Centuries of dormancy have weakened the aspect, as its essence has seeped into the surrounding land. Since being released, it has begun to amass power for itself by consuming plants, trees, and other living beings in flame. Once it attains enough energy to completely break the mystical fetters that tie it to the Scorched Grove, it will be an unstoppable force that could very well bring fiery ruin to all of Humblewood. </p>\n<p><strong>Stirring in its Slumber</strong>. The strange occurrences of late have many prominent scholars baffled: unusually aggressive emberbats, the appearance of ashsnakes, the increased frequency of forest fires, and many other phenomena which have never been seen before in Humblewood. More than mere legend, the aspect is the reason for all of these. As a creature of primordial fire, it is inextricably bound to the plane of its element. Even as it slumbered beneath the Grove for generations, the aspect has stirred, its presence causing a weakening in the barrier which keeps the material plane separate from the plane of fire, allowing for weaker creatures to slip through.</p>\n<p>The aspect’s essence has also seeped into the Scorched Grove, causing the landscape to take on far stronger elemental properties than before. The fundamental shift in the Grove’s nature has effectively thwarted the efforts of the Tenders, who have for so long sought to heal this burned land. As the aspect continues to grow in power, more of this harmful elemental energy will be released, and even more powerful creatures will arise from the flames. If this otherworldly power spreads across the forest unchecked, all of Humblewood might suffer the fate of the Scorched Grove.</p>",

Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Caustic Slime</h2>\n<p>These pale green oozes have an astringent chemical odor, which mixes with the smell of liquefied flesh from their latest meal. Owing to the slow speed at which they digest their victims, the bones of partially-digested meals can be seen through their transparent exterior. Dissolving remnants move within the slimes in a macabre semblance of motion.  This phenomena has earned them the nickname “green puppeteers”.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Defenses</strong>. Capable of producing a lethal acid that can eat away at stone and metal, caustic slimes are especially deadly. Even the slightest touch on exposed fur or feathers can be dangerous. Many would-be heroes have met a slow, grim demise after being engulfed by these strange creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific Interest.</strong> Though hazardous, the acid produced by these slimes is also valued for its potential uses as a powerful sorcery reagent and an ingredient in potent potions. Some claim it can be distilled into practical applications, like a solvent for metallurgists and builders.</p>",

Rumored to have been originally devised by the mad necromancer Lathrus of the Night’s Call, cobblefrights are made by linking several birdfolk skeletons together to form one frightening creature with enhanced physical properties. Among those who have studied Lathrus’ research, only the most reckless have tried to create a cobblefright of their own, often to disastrous effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror of Horrors</strong>. Cobblefrights are generally pieced together from the skeletons of five or six birdfolk. The combination of multiple bodies allows not only for a larger and more robust design, but also vastly increases the quantity of necromantic energies cobblefrights contain. This increased capacity for power provides cobblefrights with tremendous strength, as much as a dozen birdfolk combined. It also grants cobblefright bones greater durability. Their remarkable power and resilience is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as cobblefrights also require a large amount of necromantic energy to be sustained. The surviving records of cobblefright creators note that, quite unexpectedly, the creatures developed the ability to drain the life force of other living beings, replenishing their own energy in the process. This makes cobblefrights useful as independent sentries, so long as they have a steady supply of living beings to fuel them. </p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic Psyche</strong>. The discordant parts that comprise cobblefrights exert tremendous strain on the bodies of these creatures. The source of this strain is rooted in the same magic that allows birdfolk skeletons to recall skills they once knew in life: the bones remember. Remnants of the soul such as memories, desires, fears, skills, and certain forms of knowledge are imprinted on the bones of the departed. When activated by necromantic energy, these conflicting impressions swirl chaotically within cobblefrights. Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator. However, necromancers must be careful to maintain control over these dangerous creatures. Damaged cobblefrights will readily harvest their maker as an immediate source of life energy.</p>",

Forest prowlers are apex predators. They can claim virtually any prey they desire, but usually target deer, elk, and other large herbivores. Prowlers use their powerful bodies and gripping claws to drag their kill up into their tree nests, where it can be consumed at their leisure. These felines are known to travel long and winding paths through the forest, residing in temporary shelters throughout the seasons. Although nomadic, the prowlers are quite territorial of whatever area they currently inhabit. Relatively passive in the winter, they are most active in the spring and summer during peak hunting and breeding seasons.</p>",

According to slime-wranglers, they can use magical energy to create an eerie bioluminescence. Shifting slime residue is a highly sought after potent reagent, but it is hard to come by. Despite their size, these slimes are elusive and generally spend their time below ground where visibility is low. They can be quite difficult to locate when they conceal themselves in the subterranean darkness, though these strange creatures are known to leave trails of bioluminescent residue to lure in prey. </p>\n<p><strong>Adaptive Defenses</strong>. This type of slime can harness magical energy within its form. Shifting slimes absorb and store magic passively over time, but are also capable of absorbing magical jolts from spells. It is unclear exactly how much energy they can store, or for how long.</p>\n<p>Shifting slimes can develop a temporary immunity to various types of magic after exposure. This immunity in turn makes it exceptionally difficult to destroy the slimes with a single type of magical energy. Luckily for slime-wranglers, shifting slimes are only capable of containing one energy type at a time. </p>\n<p><strong>Manifestation of Stored Power.</strong> After absorbing magical energy, these slimes will change color based on the type of power absorbed. Because of the rarity of shifting slimes, only a handful of people have witnessed these changes.

Despite their size, wakewyrms are elusive, able to hide within the vast expanse of the ocean. The rarity of this creature has bred many rumors about the exact nature of wakewyrms. All sailors know at least a few stories about bizarre creatures of the sea, including fantastical accounts of wakewyrms that lurk in the ocean’s gloomy depths, able to sink an entire fleet of ships. Such tales are more often fabrications than not, as few have actually encountered these creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Devourer from the Deeps</strong>. Wakewyrms are more than a 100 feet long and weigh over 1000 tons. Their lashing tails, snapping jaws, and huge bodies can deal significant damage to a ship’s hull, though they prefer to swallow sailors whole, swiftly pulling them into the fathoms below with hardly more than a splash. Filling their gullet with as many creatures as possible, wakewyrms let their strong stomachs take care of their meals. While a fine tactic for devouring fish or other large marine creatures, wakewyrms that swallow adventurers whole sometimes find the snack too much to handle. </p>\n<p>Though wakewyrms rarely encounter sailing vessels as they cross the ocean looking for food, the results are often violent.

The leader of the Bandit Coalition, she is an idealist who believes that Alderheart’s canopy, the symbol of birdfolk power in the region, should be burned and its resources looted to help those displaced by the flames.</p>\n<p>Benna lived a tranquil village life until her mother, a respected village elder and seer, foretold that the flames would come. Word was sent to Alderheart’s Council, asking for supplies and aid, both of which were denied because the Council didn’t believe in the power of the seer’s visions.</p>\n<p>When the flames had all but consumed the village, birdfolk support arrived, but it was too late. Benna lost her family. She also lost her left eye and left ear due to the burns she sustained while helping others escape from the blaze. She fell in with the bandits and quickly rose through their ranks, thanks to her passion and purpose. She is a seasoned veteran who has been building the bandit forces, and utilizing the organization to care for humblefolk left homeless by the spreading fires.</p>\n<p>Benna Seridan uses the @Compendium[hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-beastiary.fckMIMrlaPxcbjzD]{cervan bandit general} stat block, but the scimitar in her main hand is a blade of the wood *(+1 to attack and damage rolls, see @Compendium[hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-campaign-setting.o45baujDUWYHKxfm]{Appendix D: New Magic Items}), and a shortsword (1d6 + 3 piercing damage) in her off hand.</p>",

The promise of seeing lost loved ones again, or raising an army of powerful minions, can sometimes be difficult to resist. The birdfolk of Humblewood are not immune to that lure. To help curb this curiosity, professors at The Avium teach necromantic theory only. But some intrepid students have been known to pursue the practical applications in secret. Sure of their intellect, corvums in particular are often willing to challenge traditions for the sake of knowledge. As a result, more than one corvum has wandered down the path of the dark arts. </p>\n<h2>Odwald Ebonhart</h2>\n<p>Odwald is a haggard old kindled corvum, resembling a thick billed raven with coarse, hoary  feathers, ruffled from years of adventuring. Odwald has a sharp mind but a faint heart. A member of the illustrious Ebonhart family, a noble house that dates back to the founding of Alderheart, Odwald was an arcane prodigy who grew up in a world which expected him to be brilliant. </p>\n<p>While magic always came naturally to him, the pressure of his family’s expectations weighed heavily upon him, and filled him with a deep-seated fear of failure. Months ago, he was tricked by an unknown entity into weakening the seal that held the aspect of fire beneath the Scorched Grove. Ever since he has blamed himself for the worsening conditions in the Wood. He has no solution for stopping the aspect, and this terrifies him. </p>\n<p>Shortly after saving his friend Riffin, desperation drove him back to his alma mater, the Avium, where he has since worked with forbidden magics in secrecy.

Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors.</p>\n<h2>Havel of the Autumn Moon</h2>\n<p>Havel is a frail but courageous huden gallus, with pheasant-like plumage. He is a dear friend of Tevor, and the two have fallen for each other during their time together in Alderheart.</p>\n<p>Havel is a Summerblossom, a rank given to experienced members of the Tenders. He has been working at the Tenders’ headquarters in the Trunk district, where he provides aid to the refugees.</p>\n<p>He is also skilled in the use of natural magic, and while normally too sickly to adventure, could still assist the party with his talents. </p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",

          "description": "<h2><br />The Tenders</h2>\n<p>Although the Tenders are most well known across the Wood for their involvement in healing and studying the Scorched Grove, their order is actually far more ancient. Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors. </p>\n<h2>Tevor of the Spring Path </h2>\n<p>Tevor is a timid sable luma, with ruddy gray feathers and a short beak. He is a good friend of Havel, and has begun to feel affection for the gallus since their time working together.</p>\n<p>Tevor is a Sapling, a low ranking member of the Tenders, who barely escaped from an ashsnake attack that killed his mentor. While he has agreed to give his report of events in the Scorched Grove, he is not prepared to do much beyond this. He possesses conviction in the beliefs of his order, but the traumatic event has left him feeling frightened and helpless.</p>\n<p>If only he could find the courage to match his ideals, he would be destined for greatness. Tevor is generally averse to combat now, but before joining the Tenders he trained as a perch guard recruit.</p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",

Bita offers whatever information she can, but this creature is a new discovery and the Council has little to go on.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tevor is called up before the head table. He was the most recent Tender to encounter the massive beast in the Grove. He recalls seeing the ash of the plains seize up, as if something were burrowing through. The creature never broke the surface, so he was unable to get a good look at it. It must have grabbed his instructor, though, as Tevor saw him get sucked under the ash. Tevor ran, until he was safe on the edge of the Scorched Grove.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tevor is obviously shaken after the account, but Havel places a hand on his shoulder, which seems to comfort him.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tevor points out on a map where this most recent sighting took place. Bita will mention that the Grove is a dangerous place, and ask Havel to look for someone to guide the party. At first, Tevor simply raises his hand to speak. It’s clear that he is conflicted and his fear is getting the better of him. Despite this, he’ll firmly state that he will guide the party to where he last saw the creature. He will admit his fear, but every second they waste is a chance for it to strike again.</p>"

Tevor will be able to identify the creature immediately. He’ll also add that such entities are only found in the deepest parts of the Grove, and it’s unheard of to see one so far from the Grove itself. The Tenders are taught to leave them be, as they will dissipate once they have fulfilled their purpose, which usually consists of re-enacting a memory from the life of the victim. Tevor will warn the party that disturbing the specter risks invoking its wrath.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If characters interact with the specter peacefully, read this:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">As you approach, the creature appears unaware of your presence. It is on its knees, and continues to fruitlessly grasp at something in the underbrush, only to burn any plant life it touches. With each failed attempt the creature places its head in its talons and shudders in a way that suggests weeping.</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The memory this creature is enacting is one of picking flowers to place at a nearby gravesite. Players must figure this out on their own. If a character examines the area, with a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check investigation 14 format=long]]</span> they will be able to locate an overgrown wooden grave marker covered by reeds. The singed, desiccated bush the specter keeps reaching for matches bushes on either side of it, around which small patches of bluebells grow. Simply gathering any number of these flowers and placing them upon the grave will be enough to cause the specter to dissipate harmlessly.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Remind the players that their time is limited, as the mere presence of the specter is causing trees and shrubs around it to smoke. Characters can attempt to quench the flames before they become true blazes, but unless they have a way to do this at range, they’ll need to get within 5 feet of the fire specter. Any character that lingers too long near the specter takes [[/damage 1d10 fire average]] damage from its heat. Have characters continue to take fire damage the longer they stay in close proximity to the fire specter.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If a player disturbs the creature in any way or attempts to harm it, it will turn and attack.

If it senses the party grouping up, it will unleash its breath attack on them. If attacked from outside the range of its tremorsense, the ashnake takes an action to determine the direction from which the attack originated.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">During the fight, the ashsnake will try to stay under the ash to protect itself, but it will come up to attack when it senses an opening. Have it burrow or surface to make the fight interesting.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Here are a few points to remember:</p><ul class=\"hpp para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">The ashsnake will generally surface near characters to try and knock them over with its eruption ability. If anyone falls &amp;Reference[prone], they can expect to have a grab attack launched against them, or a bite attack if the creature is already grappling a character.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">The ashsnake can be attacked while under the ash, although it has a bonus to its armor class (as noted in the monster’s description).</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">The ashnake can also hide under the ash, but to do this it needs to spend an action making a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">Dexterity (Stealth) check</span> opposed by each character’s passive perception score. While hidden in this way the ashsnake is functionally &amp;Reference[invisible], although characters can make a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">Wisdom (Perception) check</span> against its initial roll once on their turn (this doesn’t cost an action), determining its location on a success. Anytime the ashsnake emerges it is no longer hidden.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">The ashsnake can grab characters before burrowing, and can move freely underground with a grappled character in tow. Each time a character starts their turn under the ash they need to hold their breath (which they can do for 1 + their Constitution modifier’s worth of minutes before they start to suffocate). This resets every time the creature surfaces, giving the character a chance to gasp for air.

As the ashsnakes encircle you, there is a deeper rumble, less violent but full of power. The creatures hesitate for a moment, until another more powerful tremor shakes even their massive bodies. The ashsnakes flee, heading south and burrowing into the ash. The tremors continue to gain in momentum and intensity. To the north, miles away, something gigantic rises from a bed of cinders. First a hill, then a small mountain, releasing a plume of ash that blocks the sun. As the dust clouds settle, you see a huge creature made of craggy black rock and pulsing orange magma.

Try to avoid calling it the “aspect of fire” in front of your players, as this creature is currently unknown to them. If a character wants to make an <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check arcana 16 format=long]]</span> to see if they know of it, a roll of 16 or higher would be enough for them to have heard of the aspect of fire through scant tales and myths. The stories say that this creature’s sole desire is to consume, heedless of the destruction it leaves in its wake. Characters would not know anything more than this.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The aspect will immediately sense the party of intruders in its Grove, and make for them at full speed. It’s obvious from the size and power of this creature that taking it on would be folly. Be sure to communicate this to the players. However, any party member who stays to make a noble sacrifice will surely buy time for their companions to escape.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The party can make whatever plans they want, but the shortest distance out of the aspect’s path is back into the forest toward Alderheart. Any other path out of the Grove would leave them exposed to the aspect’s march or ashsnakes that could be following. The forest canopy should also provide some cover from the creature, making the party difficult to target.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Tevor will flee immediately into the forest, making his escape before the party can react. This is the simplest way to resolve the matter, but if it makes sense within the story, you can have Tevor sacrifice himself to buy the party time to escape, or to save a party member in the following chase sequence.</p><img style=\"border:0\" title=\"Riffin Fleeing the Flames\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Riffin-Flames.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Have the players describe how they would make their way to safety. The easiest way to resolve this would be to have each character make a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check strength 14]]</span> or <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check athletics 14 format=long]]</span> to attempt to outrun the aspect. Allow players to make different ability checks if they can come up with a unique way for their characters to escape the threat. For example, distracting the creature might be somewhat of a challenge, requiring a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check charisma 14]]</span> or <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/check deception 14 format=long]]</span>, but attempting to restrain it would be more difficult.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Once they have succeeded on the first skill check, have each player make another skill check to determine how successful they are at fleeing as the creature continues to move toward them. Make this check easier or harder depending on how well players did on the first check. If players succeed at this check, their character flees at a sufficiently quick pace to avoid being in range of the creature’s attacks. Particularly dire failures on this check could result in characters falling <span class=\"hpp-enricher-noindent\">&amp;Reference[prone]</span>.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As the aspect marches, it indiscriminately hurls massive boulders of magma and rock into the forest. Characters who failed the second skill check have fallen behind and are in range of these attacks. They must make a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">[[/save dexterity 15 format=long]]</span> at the start of each round. On a failure, they take [[/damage 3d10 fire average]] damage. On a success, they take half that damage. They may then attempt another skill or ability check to flee out of the creature’s range. As above, be flexible here, and try to reward players for creativity while keeping the threat to their characters believable.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">After about two rounds of pursuit, the characters should notice that the aspect isn’t gaining as quickly, and after another round the characters will all have made it out of the creature’s range regardless. If any look back, all they will see is an ominous red glow through the trees, and a plume of thick smoke rising up over the horizon. From here the characters are free to make their way safely into the forest and back to Alderheart.</p>"

The aspect is not only a creature of heat and energy, but also of destruction and rage, and it appears to draw strength from the forests its flames consume.</p>\n<p><strong>Primal Incarnation</strong>. A creature of legend, it is believed by some that this was the “being of fire and destruction” said to have caused the Great Calamity that created the Scorched Grove many centuries ago. The aspect possesses frightening power, enough to cause serious harm to the Wood and all those who inhabit it. Long has it been forgotten that the creature was conjured in a lost ritual. Shortly afterwards, it was sealed away beneath the Scorched Grove where its presence has continued to affect the region. Centuries of dormancy have weakened the aspect, as its essence has seeped into the surrounding land. Since being released, it has begun to amass power for itself by consuming plants, trees, and other living beings in flame. Once it attains enough energy to completely break the mystical fetters that tie it to the Scorched Grove, it will be an unstoppable force that could very well bring fiery ruin to all of Humblewood. </p>\n<p><strong>Stirring in its Slumber</strong>. The strange occurrences of late have many prominent scholars baffled: unusually aggressive emberbats, the appearance of ashsnakes, the increased frequency of forest fires, and many other phenomena which have never been seen before in Humblewood. More than mere legend, the aspect is the reason for all of these. As a creature of primordial fire, it is inextricably bound to the plane of its element. Even as it slumbered beneath the Grove for generations, the aspect has stirred, its presence causing a weakening in the barrier which keeps the material plane separate from the plane of fire, allowing for weaker creatures to slip through.</p>\n<p>The aspect’s essence has also seeped into the Scorched Grove, causing the landscape to take on far stronger elemental properties than before. The fundamental shift in the Grove’s nature has effectively thwarted the efforts of the Tenders, who have for so long sought to heal this burned land. As the aspect continues to grow in power, more of this harmful elemental energy will be released, and even more powerful creatures will arise from the flames. If this otherworldly power spreads across the forest unchecked, all of Humblewood might suffer the fate of the Scorched Grove.</p>",

Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Caustic Slime</h2>\n<p>These pale green oozes have an astringent chemical odor, which mixes with the smell of liquefied flesh from their latest meal. Owing to the slow speed at which they digest their victims, the bones of partially-digested meals can be seen through their transparent exterior.

Capable of producing a lethal acid that can eat away at stone and metal, caustic slimes are especially deadly. Even the slightest touch on exposed fur or feathers can be dangerous. Many would-be heroes have met a slow, grim demise after being engulfed by these strange creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific Interest.</strong> Though hazardous, the acid produced by these slimes is also valued for its potential uses as a powerful sorcery reagent and an ingredient in potent potions.

Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale.

The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colonies of Combustion</strong>.

Rumored to have been originally devised by the mad necromancer Lathrus of the Night’s Call, cobblefrights are made by linking several birdfolk skeletons together to form one frightening creature with enhanced physical properties. Among those who have studied Lathrus’ research, only the most reckless have tried to create a cobblefright of their own, often to disastrous effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror of Horrors</strong>. Cobblefrights are generally pieced together from the skeletons of five or six birdfolk. The combination of multiple bodies allows not only for a larger and more robust design, but also vastly increases the quantity of necromantic energies cobblefrights contain. This increased capacity for power provides cobblefrights with tremendous strength, as much as a dozen birdfolk combined. It also grants cobblefright bones greater durability. Their remarkable power and resilience is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as cobblefrights also require a large amount of necromantic energy to be sustained. The surviving records of cobblefright creators note that, quite unexpectedly, the creatures developed the ability to drain the life force of other living beings, replenishing their own energy in the process. This makes cobblefrights useful as independent sentries, so long as they have a steady supply of living beings to fuel them. </p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic Psyche</strong>. The discordant parts that comprise cobblefrights exert tremendous strain on the bodies of these creatures. The source of this strain is rooted in the same magic that allows birdfolk skeletons to recall skills they once knew in life: the bones remember. Remnants of the soul such as memories, desires, fears, skills, and certain forms of knowledge are imprinted on the bones of the departed. When activated by necromantic energy, these conflicting impressions swirl chaotically within cobblefrights. Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator. However, necromancers must be careful to maintain control over these dangerous creatures. Damaged cobblefrights will readily harvest their maker as an immediate source of life energy.</p>",

Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colonies of Combustion</strong>. Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting. The real threat they pose lies in the remarkable coordination of their colonies.</p>\n<p>Alone, an emberbat is no more dangerous than a candle. But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them. However, recently colonies of emberbats are acting aggressively towards travelers, harassing any who approach their expanding territories. Some swear they have seen emberbat supercolonies whose heat could be felt from yards away. </p>\n<p><strong>Fine Familiar</strong>s.

One of the reasons forest prowlers have attained such mythic status is due to their elusive nature. They are adept at moving unseen through the canopy where they hunt, and their skills as ambush predators means that few who see them live to tell the tale. In some communities the killing of a forest prowler is considered a rite of passage among beast hunters. The large fangs seen adorning the necks of Humblewood’s greatest hunters and warriors, and cloaks made from prowler fur, are trophies that showcase one’s prowess and skill.</p>\n<p><strong>Fierce Hunter</strong>. Forest prowlers are apex predators. They can claim virtually any prey they desire, but usually target deer, elk, and other large herbivores. Prowlers use their powerful bodies and gripping claws to drag their kill up into their tree nests, where it can be consumed at their leisure. These felines are known to travel long and winding paths through the forest, residing in temporary shelters throughout the seasons. Although nomadic, the prowlers are quite territorial of whatever area they currently inhabit.

Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for  scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Shifting Slime</h2>\n<p>A type of large and fluid ooze, shifting slimes have an iridescent hue to them which seems to shift as they move. According to slime-wranglers, they can use magical energy to create an eerie bioluminescence. Shifting slime residue is a highly sought after potent reagent, but it is hard to come by. Despite their size, these slimes are elusive and generally spend their time below ground where visibility is low. They can be quite difficult to locate when they conceal themselves in the subterranean darkness, though these strange creatures are known to leave trails of bioluminescent residue to lure in prey. </p>\n<p><strong>Adaptive Defenses</strong>. This type of slime can harness magical energy within its form. Shifting slimes absorb and store magic passively over time, but are also capable of absorbing magical jolts from spells. It is unclear exactly how much energy they can store, or for how long.</p>\n<p>Shifting slimes can develop a temporary immunity to various types of magic after exposure. This immunity in turn makes it exceptionally difficult to destroy the slimes with a single type of magical energy. Luckily for slime-wranglers, shifting slimes are only capable of containing one energy type at a time. </p>\n<p><strong>Manifestation of Stored Power.</strong> After absorbing magical energy, these slimes will change color based on the type of power absorbed. Because of the rarity of shifting slimes, only a handful of people have witnessed these changes. But, over generations, skilled slime-wranglers have managed to record which color a shifting slime will turn in response to different types of magic.</p>",

Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for  scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Sticky Slime</h2>\n<p>A semi-solid type of ooze, sticky slimes are far more robust than their cousins. Experienced slime wranglers know never to attack them directly with weapons. The rubbery bodies of sticky slimes can suck a blade out of a wielder’s hands, leaving the attacker unarmed. </p>\n<p><strong>True to Form</strong>. Sticky slimes are wholly described by their name. They leave a trail of extremely thick adhesive residue in their wake. While the residue itself is harmless, it can trap adventurers where they stand, and sticky slimes tend to live in proximity of far more threatening monsters.</p>\n<p> </p>",

Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colonies of Combustion</strong>. Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting. The real threat they pose lies in the remarkable coordination of their colonies.</p>\n<p>Alone, an emberbat is no more dangerous than a candle. But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them. However, recently colonies of emberbats are acting aggressively towards travelers, harassing any who approach their expanding territories. Some swear they have seen emberbat supercolonies whose heat could be felt from yards away. </p>\n<p><strong>Fine Familiar</strong>s.

Wakewyrms are more than a 100 feet long and weigh over 1000 tons. Their lashing tails, snapping jaws, and huge bodies can deal significant damage to a ship’s hull, though they prefer to swallow sailors whole, swiftly pulling them into the fathoms below with hardly more than a splash.

Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors.</p>\n<h2>Havel of the Autumn Moon</h2>\n<p>Havel is a frail but courageous huden gallus, with pheasant-like plumage. He is a dear friend of Tevor, and the two have fallen for each other during their time together in Alderheart.</p>\n<p>Havel is a Summerblossom, a rank given to experienced members of the Tenders. He has been working at the Tenders’ headquarters in the Trunk district, where he provides aid to the refugees.</p>\n<p>He is also skilled in the use of natural magic, and while normally too sickly to adventure, could still assist the party with his talents. </p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",

Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors. </p>\n<h2>Tevor of the Spring Path </h2>\n<p>Tevor is a timid sable luma, with ruddy gray feathers and a short beak. He is a good friend of Havel, and has begun to feel affection for the gallus since their time working together.</p>\n<p>Tevor is a Sapling, a low ranking member of the Tenders, who barely escaped from an ashsnake attack that killed his mentor. While he has agreed to give his report of events in the Scorched Grove, he is not prepared to do much beyond this. He possesses conviction in the beliefs of his order, but the traumatic event has left him feeling frightened and helpless.</p>\n<p>If only he could find the courage to match his ideals, he would be destined for greatness. Tevor is generally averse to combat now, but before joining the Tenders he trained as a perch guard recruit.</p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",

Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors. </p>\n<h2>Tevor of the Spring Path </h2>\n<p>Tevor is a timid sable luma, with ruddy gray feathers and a short beak. He is a good friend of Havel, and has begun to feel affection for the gallus since their time working together.</p>\n<p>Tevor is a Sapling, a low ranking member of the Tenders, who barely escaped from an ashsnake attack that killed his mentor. While he has agreed to give his report of events in the Scorched Grove, he is not prepared to do much beyond this. He possesses conviction in the beliefs of his order, but the traumatic event has left him feeling frightened and helpless.</p>\n<p>If only he could find the courage to match his ideals, he would be destined for greatness. Tevor is generally averse to combat now, but before joining the Tenders he trained as a perch guard recruit.</p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",

He discovered records of its creation, penned by the wizard who crafted, stored it in the Avium’s lower library. Using these valuable notes, Odwald theorized a ritual that might utilize this artifact’s power to seal the aspect of fire. He had abandoned the ritual in favor of the cobblefright, because he couldn’t ascertain whether or not the records of the artifact were genuine.

The building rests on a disk-shaped wooden platform seated within the gnarled branches of a great tree that has been shaped around it. Different bridges connect with the wooden platform to allow travel from all around Brackenmill. The place looks cozy and inviting, and players who approach will notice a wooden sign above the door with a smiling silkworm munching on a leaf. Pleasant-smelling smoke wafts from the large chimneys that emerge from its quaint thatched roof. The inn is usually bustling, and today is no exception. When the party enters the building, read:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">The common room of this inn and tavern teems with activity. Many birdfolk and humblefolk of all descriptions are engaged in talk, drink, and games. Three large hearths frame the space, one to the right, another in a stone chimney which rises in the center of the common room, and one behind the bar counter at the back of the common room, over which pots of stew bubble away aromatically. The place is warm and inviting.</p></aside><img style=\"border:0\" title=\"Giant Silkworm\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Giant-Silkworm.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp image-name-caption\">Giant Silkworm</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">The party will find Riffin in the inn’s common room,</span> sitting at a small table next to the large central hearth, where he is engaged in a game of cards.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If the party came here with Odwald, they will likely be searching for Riffin so that Odwald can explain himself to his old friend.

After checking many of their old haunts, Riffin decided it’s best to wait at the Sunny Silkworm, rather than risk missing his friend in roving. After all, this was where they always ended up when they traveled together; he’s hoping to run into Odwald eventually if he stays long enough. If the characters interacted with Riffin at the Wooden Flagon in Alderheart, he’ll recognize the party once they enter and excuse himself from his table to greet them.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">If the party never spoke to Riffin</span>, he will recognize them from the battle at the Bandit Camp, as well as from stories he’s heard about their exploits since that battle. By now, they surely sound like honorable and upstanding folk to the strig knight, and he’ll introduce himself in a familiar tone (they fought alongside each other, after all).</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">“Hullo again, friends!

Odwald might have gotten himself into some tough scrapes before, but he would never act in such a reckless and hurtful manner. If the party decides to press the point, Riffin will excuse himself, maintaining that they don’t know what they’re talking about. He and Odwald have known each other for years, and this doesn’t sound like him.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">So long as the party doesn’t do anything to really offend Riffin, he will be able to provide some useful information. Though he hasn’t seen Odwald, he has noticed a few lodgers who don’t seem very friendly. He’ll point some of them out:</p><ul class=\"hpp para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">A surly <span class=\"hpp bold\">luma sorcerer</span> who wants to be left alone.

A character who sits down with Odwald must succeed on a <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</span> to notice a hiccup in his illusion.

This is the last stop for the exhausted corvum, and once the party has dealt with any ill effects caused by his magic, they should be able to track him here. They’ll find him panting, out of energy, and trapped by the difficult terrain. If the party manages to capture him sooner, Odwald will relent once it’s clear he cannot escape.</p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Birdfolk-Guard.webp\" /><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">“That’s quite enough, I yield,” the old corvum wheezes. “I can’t run from my fate any longer.

He intends to go peacefully and cooperate with the Avium, and the notes would make far less sense without his guidance. If questioned, Odwald will explain what he was trying to achieve with his experiments, and why it was so important to him that he be the one to stop the aspect, but that he regrets everything.

The party can easily explain the situation, and once they present proof that they are working with the Dean of the Avium (their amulets will do) the Perch Guard will relinquish Odwald to their custody.

Riffin will look more and more confused as Odwald explains himself.

Odwald can only look crestfallen, and deliver the above line.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Either way, Riffin is hurt. Odwald not only saved his life, but traveled with him for many years, and Riffin thought he could trust his friend. To find out that the corvum had been keeping so much from him, coupled with the reckless and dangerous nature of his activities, has Riffin considering whether or not to break ties with Odwald.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Riffin will retreat to his room at The Sunny Silkworm without a word. He’ll stay here for one more day, but he won’t accept any visitors until the next day at dawn.

The character talking with Riffin can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince him to take the course of action they suggest, but the difficulty check of the skill should be modified based on the approach party members take while talking with Riffin. For example, if they appeal to his sense of honor and duty to the Wood, the check should be easier. Some players may decide to have Riffin and Odwald meet to talk things over, which could also be successful. Characters who try to convince Riffin can make any number of arguments:</p><ul class=\"hpp para-bullets\"><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">They need Riffin’s help to defeat the aspect.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Riffin should work with them for the good of the Wood.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Odwald seems to regret his actions and care deeply about their friendship.</li><li class=\"hpp para-1-bullets\">Anything else the players might come up with that feels appropriate.</li></ul><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Decide how things play out based on the motives of the characters, improvising checks with any characters who might be serving to mediate, and select the outcome that best fits with the narrative.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">If Riffin and Odwald reconcile</span>, Riffin will steadfastly agree to help the party in whatever way he can on their quest. Riffin and Odwald’s relationship will be strained for the rest of the game, but they will work together to defeat the aspect. Riffin will accompany the party back to the Avium, but he won’t have much to say along the way—he’s more of a doer than a thinker. Despite recent events, should it be required, he’ll act as a character witness for Odwald. Riffin will never totally forgive the old corvum, but he can attest to his brilliance and reliability from their years of adventuring together. Riffin is willing to journey with the party to Alderheart. He’ll choose to bunk separately at the Wooden Flagon, the inn and tavern in the trunk district. If the players wish, Riffin can accompany them on the rest of their journey. If he joins the party, he will be treated as another character for the purposes of dividing up XP.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp bold-italic\">If Riffin and Odwald don’t reconcile</span>, Riffin will leave.

They thought they could control its icy power by containing it within a staff, but instead it froze them. Left to itself, the newly-made artifact kept freezing the land around it. The tales say that the old Tenders felt this imbalance in the Wood.

Havel will support Tevor, and say he believes this agrees with references to an ancient chamber in the Scorched Grove. The text appeared in the historical records around the same time as the stories of <span class=\"hpp italic\">the Borealus</span> being sealed away. Neither Tevor nor Havel can take the party to the location because they’re needed in Alderheart, but Tevor can mark it on the party’s map.

The Elder Tenders of old needed to store the staff where the fire-aspected energies of the Scorched Grove could serve to keep <span class=\"hpp italic\">the Borealus’</span> dangerous energies sequestered. In times long past, Tenders wishing to join the leadership of their organization would come here to be tested for their worthiness; this practice was ended when a breach of the sanctum caused the Tenders to swear the location of <span class=\"hpp italic\">the Borealus</span> to secrecy and destroy records of its location. Only scant myths and snippets of information escaped the culling. Eventually, the last of those who possessed actual knowledge of the artifact died, and the dungeon has sat unused for hundreds of years.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\"><span class=\"hpp italic\">The Borealus</span> lies at the lowest level of the dungeon, where the flame energies are strongest.

Without the proper key, the entrance to the dungeon will not reveal itself. Read the following if the party is carrying the sprig of skyleaf with them:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">As soon as you and your companions arrive at the frog-shaped rock formation, the ground begins to quake. Five pedestals emerge from the ashes, one at each cardinal point around a flat disk that rises in their center. The fifth stands in the middle of the disk. One of the four outer pedestals is broken.</p></aside><img style=\"border:0\" title=\"Skyleaf\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Skyleaf.webp\" /><p class=\"hpp image-name-caption\">Skyleaf</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The pedestals rise from the earth, to a height of four feet. The ones to the west, east, and south have distinctive carvings and motifs, along with a domed receptacle on their top which opens like a mouth. The receptacles are large enough to fit the sprig of skyleaf. The fourth pedestal to the north is broken in half and exhibits obvious wear, as though it had been smashed long ago. The pedestal in the center of the disk has no domed receptacle or motif carved, only an inscribed Druidic rhyme. Druidic is a language known only by druids, but any character using the <span class=\"hpp italic\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.4dSvfvTy2ZIJ3K4k]{comprehend languages}</span> spell or a similar effect will be able to read this:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-1 hpp-table-center\"><span class=\"hpp bold\">The cycle of nature is death and rebirth,<br /><br />forests to ashes and ashes to earth.<br /><br />Stand in the compass and your proof there deliver, <br /><br />to the cleanser of forests, the sapling’s life-giver.</span></p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The motifs carved into the three intact pedestals represent elemental forces of nature. The one to the west has motifs of waves and rain clouds, the one to the east has gusting winds and blowing leaves, and the one to the south has flames and smoke plumes. Upon closer examination, the broken pedestal has worn geometric motifs, depicting fallen trees on fractured ground, most likely representing earth. At least one party member must stand in the middle of these pedestals when placing the skyleaf sprig into a receptacle. Whether or not the party chooses the correct answer, nothing will happen if no one is standing in the center of the “compass” when placing the sprig inside a receptacle.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The correct answer is to set the sprig in the receptacle of the pedestal with the flame motifs. This will cause the sprig to ignite with magical flames and the pedestals to recede, revealing the door to the dungeon.</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">The ashen field shifts again as the pillars recede beneath it.

Characters inside the sphere who try to free a grappled ally roll their <span class=\"hpp checks-and-saves\">Strength (Athletics) check</span> with disadvantage.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Players may think of clever strategies to help their friends out.

The magma lies 60 feet below the island of rock, and any character that gets too near the edges of the island will feel its full heat.

It appears to have small gaps at 5-foot intervals. Any player who steps onto the bridge’s surface will trigger the bridge’s main trap, which will cause a 20-foot-high jet of flame to erupt from the nearest gap. This jet remains for a few seconds, receding for a moment before flaring up again.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The party can tell that these flame jets aren’t made of magma, but that they are still dangerous.

              "text": "<p class=\"hpp header-4\">Preparing for Battle</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">After Speaker Bita's speech, the party will be found by either Odwald or the Dean (if Odwald isn’t alive) and told that, by the looks of it, the aspect’s influence in this region has grown tenfold since the party’s first encounter. If they don’t take the opportunity to try and seal the aspect with the Borealus now, even if it is driven back, the aspect may become too strong to attempt sealing again.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The Defenders of Alderheart will soon find their presence requested by the Council: the aspect of fire must be stopped before it reaches the Great Tree City. Its movement has stirred up ashsnakes, emberbats, and other fire creatures that are causing havoc in the surrounding forest. Give the party a chance to explain to the Council what they can do to help (the Council is receptive to most ideas), but if the party doesn’t mention sealing away the aspect, then either Odwald or the Dean (if Odwald is dead) will make the suggestion.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">While the Council will listen to the Dean, Odwald will be looked upon more suspiciously, and the party may need to convince the members on his behalf. To keep the tension high maybe have the party roll Charisma checks for this. The Council will trust the Defenders of Alderheart, even if they don’t trust Odwald. However the Council is convinced, Speaker Bita will make it clear in no uncertain terms that the fate of the Wood is in the party’s hands.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Odwald will elaborate that in order to complete the ritual to seal the aspect, two mages must work together to weave a spell into the existing conjuration circle to strengthen and alter its magic. He’ll also remind the party of the importance of utilizing cold-type magics to subdue the aspect. Once it has been subdued, they will have only an hour before it regenerates, so it’s imperative that the character attuned to <span class=\"hpp italic\">the Borealus</span> brings it to the circle, so the mages can complete the sealing.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If a spellcasting party member volunteers to help the NPCs prepare the sealing ritual, they will be turned down. Preparing the ritual will be time-consuming and require such focus that the party member wouldn’t be able to fight the aspect at the same time. The mages who work the ritual need to rely on the Defenders of Alderheart to ensure their efforts aren’t interrupted. Odwald (or the Dean, if Odwald is dead) will explain that the second mage must have a good grasp of arcane theory and precise control over their magic. They will essentially serve as an additional power source and they therefore do not need to have the same familiarity with the ritual.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Odwald can think of only one other spellcaster he would trust with this ritual: Susan, and he will ask for her to accompany him (if she is alive). Otherwise, the Dean can help. The Dean has a strong desire to see this through to the end, and would gladly work with Odwald for the good of the Wood. If Odwald is dead, the Dean will need assistance for the ritual. Should Susan not be able to assist, a Council member will mention knowing of a talented spellcasting protégé within the Tenders who may be able to help. This is, of course, Havel.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If Odwald is conducting the ritual he will request to have the restraints inhibiting his magic removed, which will cause the Council consternation, but they will ultimately agree. If the party is still suspicious of Odwald’s intentions and unwilling to have his restraints removed, the Dean (who has been looking through Odwald’s notes) is familiar enough with the material to lead the ritual. Even so, he’ll insist they bring Odwald along, shackled or not, as the corvum’s knowledge could prove useful should something go awry.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The plan is to have the mages escorted to the conjuration circle, by either the Wildwood Brigade or the Perch Guard, to prepare the ritual. The rest of the Perch Guard and/or Wildwood Brigade will need to work together to keep the path to the aspect cleared for the party.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Whoever is leading the ritual indicates that someone will have to grab the aspect’s attention and lure it closer to the Grove. If the aspect is too far away when the ritual is completed, there’s no guarantee it will be sealed. Scouts report that the aspect is easy to provoke, but it'll be difficult to outpace, and luring it to the Grove will certainly place the volunteer in incredible danger. Riffin volunteers to help draw the aspect back to the circle if he’s here, otherwise a Defender of Alderheart has to volunteer for the task. Speed won’t matter as much as endurance, since they’ll need to be able to withstand whatever the aspect can throw at them in order to make it to the Grove.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">As the party leaves the Council chambers, they will witness something special:</p><aside class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-gray\"><p class=\"hpp gm-sidebar-para-2\">The mood in the city is electric. Birdfolk and humblefolk from all walks of life work hand-in-hand, with the Perch Guard distributing weapons and armor to any who volunteer. Those who cannot fight are readying supply lines and bucket brigades to help people on the front lines combat forest fires and support the Defenders of Alderheart. Everyone in Alderheart is doing their best to pitch in however they can.</p></aside><p class=\"hpp para-2\">If any characters are looking to prepare for the final fight, the party has a small window to resupply. Many of Alderheart’s shops have been closed or abandoned, but the armories of Alderheart are open to the party, allowing them to take whatever supplies they may need (Weapons, Armor, or Adventuring Gear). If they’re looking for a little extra, <span class=\"hpp bold-red\">Eliza’s Emporium table (pg. 106; @UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-encounter-rt.RollTable.OZNsT7iZxNoCVSOJ]{Good for Sale} | @UUID[Compendium.hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting.humblewood-cs-encounter-rt.RollTable.HhkESTnrzvP75Gm4]{Magic Items})</span> is always open, though even in such dire times the party won’t be able to get a magic item for free. Eliza is volunteering for the bucket brigade and plans on living through this. While she’s still willing to offer “friends-only” prices, and supply the party with any non-magical necessities they might need to complete their mission, she has no intention of giving up her livelihood out of fear.</p><img style=\"border:0\" title=\"Backpack\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Backpack.webp\" />"

This is necessary not only for the ritual, but because the abundance of available fuel in the forest makes the aspect functionally invincible there. Consider having a scout report that the aspect seems to flare up as it burns through the forest, as players may be unaware that the aspect can heal itself using the trees it consumes. While not a vital clue at this stage, this information about the aspect is essential to the fight.

To the south of the field is 40-feet-deep tree cover. The aspect will be led through a gap in the tree cover that is 20 feet wide.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Only the 40 feet of tree cover to the south is substantial enough for the aspect to heal using its “Fuel for the Fire” ability.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">The conjuration circle is 20 feet in diameter, and it's located 40 feet from the tree cover and 80 feet from the eastern edge of the map.

An NPC will act at the top of the round by rushing over and casting a cure wounds spell at 3rd level on the injured character (assume a Wisdom modifier of +3 for the spell) before retreating. The NPC can either be Tevor (if he’s alive), Havel (if not performing the ritual), or another NPC Tender.</p><p class=\"hpp para-2\">Riffin will retreat, as the chase has exhausted him.

There is no time to argue, and if another character volunteers and refuses to back down, Odwald will appear to acquiesce, only to sacrifice himself at the last minute and save them.

      "description": "<p>Now that the aspect of fire has awoken from its long slumber, it’s only a matter of time before it fully replenishes. Once it does, the aspect will surely have enough power to reduce all of Humblewood to ashes.</p><p>The seal which kept the aspect of fire sleeping beneath the Grove was broken by a corvum mage named Odwald Ebonhart. Odwald deeply regrets his actions and blames himself for the spreading wildfires. In his desperation, he has returned to the Avium, where he was once a student, and disguised himself as a librarian in order to access its resources. Out of fear for what might befall the Wood if the aspect is not stopped, Odwald has begun to secretly research the darkest of necromancies. He created a monstrous undead creature known as a cobblefright, which he hopes will provide him with the key to stopping the elemental menace once and for all. In so doing, Odwald has placed the Avium in grave danger, for his control of the monster is imperfect. Strange occurrences on campus have aroused the suspicions of a few students and professors that something isn’t quite right at the Avium. While the Dean, Gabe Windsworth, doesn’t yet have any concrete information, he’s hoping the party will be able to investigate and help him uncover the mystery. This will lead the way to Odwald and his dangerous scheme.</p>",

Little is known about the origins of the ashsnake. They recently emerged from beneath the ashen plains of the Scorched Grove and appear to have an insatiable hunger. Ashnakes use the mounds of ash and dust in the Grove to conceal their presence, allowing them to close in on unwary prey and ambush them.

Ashsnakes have no ability to detect sights and sounds in a traditional sense. They are, however, adept at sensing even the smallest vibration, and the slightest footfall is enough to draw their attention.

The aspect is not only a creature of heat and energy, but also of destruction and rage, and it appears to draw strength from the forests its flames consume.</p>\n<p><strong>Primal Incarnation</strong>. A creature of legend, it is believed by some that this was the “being of fire and destruction” said to have caused the Great Calamity that created the Scorched Grove many centuries ago. The aspect possesses frightening power, enough to cause serious harm to the Wood and all those who inhabit it. Long has it been forgotten that the creature was conjured in a lost ritual. Shortly afterwards, it was sealed away beneath the Scorched Grove where its presence has continued to affect the region. Centuries of dormancy have weakened the aspect, as its essence has seeped into the surrounding land. Since being released, it has begun to amass power for itself by consuming plants, trees, and other living beings in flame. Once it attains enough energy to completely break the mystical fetters that tie it to the Scorched Grove, it will be an unstoppable force that could very well bring fiery ruin to all of Humblewood. </p>\n<p><strong>Stirring in its Slumber</strong>. The strange occurrences of late have many prominent scholars baffled: unusually aggressive emberbats, the appearance of ashsnakes, the increased frequency of forest fires, and many other phenomena which have never been seen before in Humblewood. More than mere legend, the aspect is the reason for all of these. As a creature of primordial fire, it is inextricably bound to the plane of its element. Even as it slumbered beneath the Grove for generations, the aspect has stirred, its presence causing a weakening in the barrier which keeps the material plane separate from the plane of fire, allowing for weaker creatures to slip through.</p>\n<p>The aspect’s essence has also seeped into the Scorched Grove, causing the landscape to take on far stronger elemental properties than before. The fundamental shift in the Grove’s nature has effectively thwarted the efforts of the Tenders, who have for so long sought to heal this burned land. As the aspect continues to grow in power, more of this harmful elemental energy will be released, and even more powerful creatures will arise from the flames. If this otherworldly power spreads across the forest unchecked, all of Humblewood might suffer the fate of the Scorched Grove.</p>",

Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Caustic Slime</h2>\n<p>These pale green oozes have an astringent chemical odor, which mixes with the smell of liquefied flesh from their latest meal.

Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colonies of Combustion</strong>. Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting.

          "description": "<p>Cobblefrights are undead monstrosities created through dark necromancy. Rumored to have been originally devised by the mad necromancer Lathrus of the Night’s Call, cobblefrights are made by linking several birdfolk skeletons together to form one frightening creature with enhanced physical properties. Among those who have studied Lathrus’ research, only the most reckless have tried to create a cobblefright of their own, often to disastrous effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Horror of Horrors</strong>. Cobblefrights are generally pieced together from the skeletons of five or six birdfolk. The combination of multiple bodies allows not only for a larger and more robust design, but also vastly increases the quantity of necromantic energies cobblefrights contain. This increased capacity for power provides cobblefrights with tremendous strength, as much as a dozen birdfolk combined. It also grants cobblefright bones greater durability. Their remarkable power and resilience is somewhat of a double-edged sword, as cobblefrights also require a large amount of necromantic energy to be sustained. The surviving records of cobblefright creators note that, quite unexpectedly, the creatures developed the ability to drain the life force of other living beings, replenishing their own energy in the process. This makes cobblefrights useful as independent sentries, so long as they have a steady supply of living beings to fuel them. </p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic Psyche</strong>. The discordant parts that comprise cobblefrights exert tremendous strain on the bodies of these creatures. The source of this strain is rooted in the same magic that allows birdfolk skeletons to recall skills they once knew in life: the bones remember. Remnants of the soul such as memories, desires, fears, skills, and certain forms of knowledge are imprinted on the bones of the departed. When activated by necromantic energy, these conflicting impressions swirl chaotically within cobblefrights. Since cobblefrights are composed of multiple bodies, often originating from differing times, places, and walks of life, the impressions contained within the creatures are particularly volatile and chaotic. This constant internal conflict requires large and regular supplies of energy to keep cobblefrights stable, but it also grants them a surprising degree of resistance against those who would seek to wrest control of the creatures away from their creator. However, necromancers must be careful to maintain control over these dangerous creatures. Damaged cobblefrights will readily harvest their maker as an immediate source of life energy.</p>",

Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colonies of Combustion</strong>. Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting.

But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them.

Forest prowlers are apex predators. They can claim virtually any prey they desire, but usually target deer, elk, and other large herbivores. Prowlers use their powerful bodies and gripping claws to drag their kill up into their tree nests, where it can be consumed at their leisure.

Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for  scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Shifting Slime</h2>\n<p>A type of large and fluid ooze, shifting slimes have an iridescent hue to them which seems to shift as they move. According to slime-wranglers, they can use magical energy to create an eerie bioluminescence. Shifting slime residue is a highly sought after potent reagent, but it is hard to come by. Despite their size, these slimes are elusive and generally spend their time below ground where visibility is low. They can be quite difficult to locate when they conceal themselves in the subterranean darkness, though these strange creatures are known to leave trails of bioluminescent residue to lure in prey. </p>\n<p><strong>Adaptive Defenses</strong>. This type of slime can harness magical energy within its form. Shifting slimes absorb and store magic passively over time, but are also capable of absorbing magical jolts from spells.

Within this ominous mire lurk some of the most unusual natural predators in Humblewood. Collectively known as “slimes”, these oozes move slowly through the muck, well-camouflaged by the dark and pungent waters, waiting to devour any hapless being that wanders within reach. Slimes are easily provoked, and while it isn’t difficult to outrun one, some who have strayed into a slime’s territory only find out too late that they have been detected. Fortunately for many swampland travelers, slimes have a slow metabolism, and can go without feeding for long periods. </p>\n<p>In addition to being an important part of the ecosystem, many slimes are either naturally magical, or yield organic materials which are in high demand among mages, scholars, and researchers. While slime hunting is a dangerous undertaking, the perch of Winnowing Reach was built on the labor of so-called “slime-wranglers”, whose skill collecting valuable residue from live slimes is directly responsible for transforming the once minor outpost into a thriving site for  scholarly innovation.</p>\n<h2>Sticky Slime</h2>\n<p>A semi-solid type of ooze, sticky slimes are far more robust than their cousins.

Emberbats only started appearing in Humblewood after the calamity that befell the Scorched Grove, and scholars nearly all agree that the emergence of the creatures had something to do with the elemental magics present in the Grove. The flames that give the bats their name are lit through an internal combustion process that issues fuel from their nostrils as they exhale. Emberbats appear able to start and stop this process at will. The bats obviously do not need the flames to see, but it is hypothesized that the small candle serves to attract moths or other insects into their waiting mouths, greatly facilitating hunting.</p>\n<p><strong>Colonies of Combustion</strong>. Emberbats are most often seen flying in clouds consisting of many different families acting in unison. The bats perform virtually every task as a cohesive unit, from flying to hunting to nesting. The real threat they pose lies in the remarkable coordination of their colonies.</p>\n<p>Alone, an emberbat is no more dangerous than a candle. But together they have the potential to burn like a pit of hot embers, and can easily set dry tinder ablaze. When a colony of emberbats attacks a target, it is usually for defensive purposes. The air temperature within the cloud rises dangerously fast, and it has to potential to cook the victim alive. When encountering a colony in the wild, it is best not to engage them. However, recently colonies of emberbats are acting aggressively towards travelers, harassing any who approach their expanding territories. Some swear they have seen emberbat supercolonies whose heat could be felt from yards away. </p>\n<p><strong>Fine Familiar</strong>s.

He has no solution for stopping the aspect, and this terrifies him. </p>\n<p>Shortly after saving his friend Riffin, desperation drove him back to his alma mater, the Avium, where he has since worked with forbidden magics in secrecy. Using a secret door he discovered during his time as a student, Odwald converted several inaccessible and defunct classrooms into a makeshift laboratory where he toils tirelessly, experimenting with dark and dangerous magics in the hopes of discovering a way to stop the aspect. Odwald uses the corvum necromancer stat block. His alignment is chaotic neutral.</p>",

Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors.</p>\n<h2>Havel of the Autumn Moon</h2>\n<p>Havel is a frail but courageous huden gallus, with pheasant-like plumage. He is a dear friend of Tevor, and the two have fallen for each other during their time together in Alderheart.</p>\n<p>Havel is a Summerblossom, a rank given to experienced members of the Tenders. He has been working at the Tenders’ headquarters in the Trunk district, where he provides aid to the refugees.</p>\n<p>He is also skilled in the use of natural magic, and while normally too sickly to adventure, could still assist the party with his talents. </p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",

Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magics to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters. Today, many of their members find employ as tree-shapers, and are well-respected in birdfolk settlements. Nowhere is this more true than in Alderheart, where the Tenders are looked upon favorably for the work they’ve done to create and strengthen living spaces within Alderheart’s trunk. Other factions of Tenders work to respond to forest fires across the Wood, using their magic to encourage new growth in burned areas, as well as to help any survivors. </p>\n<p>Since the Great Calamity, a large part of their order has dedicated their efforts to tending the Grove, monitoring its spread, and studying the mysterious creatures that live there. Unfortunately, much of the healing in the Grove can end up ruined by a sudden blaze. Progress has been made, however. Before the fires started to rage with renewed force, the Tenders managed to shrink the Grove little by little, doing much to bolster the forest that grows around its edges.</p>\n<p>The Tenders are a unique organization in birdfolk society. Gaining admission to their ranks is akin to joining a monastery or convent. After initiation, a novice is generally expected to make their way to the Scorched Grove to learn from the masters who live there. Recruits live and study communally in special shelters within the Grove, protected by Tender magic. When they are sent out in the world again, new acolytes are taught to leave the high cities and walk among the undergrowth, to gain a better perspective on forest life. On occasion, Tenders living in the Wood will go on pilgrimages to tend to the Grove before returning to their normal duties. Masters of the order often choose to completely dedicate themselves to healing the Grove, setting up permanent homes there. This is considered to be a noble self-sacrifice among Tenders, and those who do this are given the order’s highest honors. </p>\n<h2>Tevor of the Spring Path </h2>\n<p>Tevor is a timid sable luma, with ruddy gray feathers and a short beak. He is a good friend of Havel, and has begun to feel affection for the gallus since their time working together.</p>\n<p>Tevor is a Sapling, a low ranking member of the Tenders, who barely escaped from an ashsnake attack that killed his mentor. While he has agreed to give his report of events in the Scorched Grove, he is not prepared to do much beyond this. He possesses conviction in the beliefs of his order, but the traumatic event has left him feeling frightened and helpless.</p>\n<p>If only he could find the courage to match his ideals, he would be destined for greatness. Tevor is generally averse to combat now, but before joining the Tenders he trained as a perch guard recruit.</p>\n<h2>Joining the Tenders</h2>\n<p>Gaining admission to the ranks of the Tenders is not difficult, and recruits are especially welcome now to help expand their thinning numbers. Any player who shows proper devotion to the tenets of natural balance and a willingness to swear an oath to become a keeper of the Wood can speak with Havel of the Autumn Moon about joining the Tenders. New recruits will begin at the Seedling rank. </p>\n<p><em>The Tenders</em></p>\n<p><em>Rank 1</em> - Seedling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 2</em> - Sproutling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 3</em> - Sapling</p>\n<p><em>Rank 4</em> - Summerblossom</p>\n<p><em>Rank 5</em> - Autumnal </p>\n<p><em>Leader</em> - Treekeeper</p>\n<p>Joining the Tenders involves taking an oath to keep the balance of nature, to help it recover from disasters both natural and unnatural, and to help all people who have been harmed by natural imbalance. The Tenders know they can’t control nature, and they teach that trying to do so is a folly which will only lead to further unbalancing of natural cycles. They do believe that when disaster strikes, it is their duty to restore the balance that was lost for the sake of all beings. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:0\" src=\"modules/hpp-humblewood-campaign-setting/assets/art/Art-Tenders-Symbol.webp\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" /></p>",
