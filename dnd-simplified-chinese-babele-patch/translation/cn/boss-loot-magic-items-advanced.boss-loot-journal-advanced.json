It has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 18 and a Charisma of 16. It can speak and manifest physically under certain circumstances or when spoken to. You can address the symbiote as \"Worm\" or \"Wyrm\".</p><p>The Wyrm does not want to leave its host and once you don this armor, you can't doff it unless you make a Charisma check contested by the Wyrm's Wisdom. You need to have a good argument to convince it. You can try this only when you level up your character. If you try to doff it in any other way you die.</p><hr /><p>The symbiote feeds off the host's energy, vitality, and magical power, which in return gives various advantages in battle.</p><p>Each time you use one of the active abilities, you must say the activation word \"Worm\" and the name of the ability. The symbiote will feed on 10% of your current and maximum hit points. Missing maximum hit points are only recovered when the character levels up. The symbiote can feed on up to 50% of your initial maximum hit points to complete the symbiosis. Once this is achieved, you will receive a new ability randomly from a pool of other abilities and any ability you use will no longer deduct your hit points.</p><ul><li><p>This armor offers no protection.</p></li><li><p>You can ask the symbiote about a creature's advantages and disadvantages before combat.</p></li><li><p>Spells of 4th level or lower require no ingredients or arcane focus.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dual Spell (Active Ability)</strong>. This ability lasts for 2 turns. During combat, you can cast spells of level 4 or lower as a bonus action, but it requires sacrificing 10% of your current and maximum hit points to feed the symbiote. Missing maximum hit points are only recovered when the character levels up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Find Weakness (Active Ability)</strong>. This ability requires a weapon in hand and lasts 2 turns. During combat you ignore all buffs but you are immune to all conditions, you cannot cast spells, you have no bonus action, as an attack action you make a single attack with a +5 bonus and the attack always has advantage and critical damage. It requires feeding the symbiote 10% of your current and maximum hit points. Missing maximum hit points, are only recovered, when the character levels up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Last Breath (Temporary Effect)</strong>. When you take lethal damage in combat, the symbiote can make you invulnerable for 2 turns. This requires a lot of energy so you need to have at least 5 current hit points to trigger the \"<strong>Last Breath</strong>\" effect. Once activated, your current hit points will be reduced to 1.</p></li></ul>"

This deity, <strong>Yar'tel Poralis</strong>, met his demise in a cataclysmic battle between gods, and on the brink of death, he infused a fragment of his essence into his weapon. Through an otherworldly enchantment, he set the weapon on a transcendent journey across realms, waiting for a hero deserving of its divine might.</p><p>When a Cleric or Paladin attunes with Yarte Pora, their sacred mission becomes clear: to rekindle the God's Divine Power through their righteous deeds. The hero must spread the name of the fallen God far and wide, gathering followers and disciples who will aid in the construction of a grand temple in his honor.</p><p>As the God's power grows, it inevitably draws the attention of the malevolent forces that once defeated him.

Aiden was once a member of an elite group of assassins, but after a failed mission that resulted in the death of his closest friends, he left the guild in disgust. He believed that the guild had become too focused on profit and power, and had lost sight of its original goal to protect the innocent and eliminate evil.</p><p>After the massacre of his comrades, Aiden was haunted by their memory. Determined to continue his quest for justice, he turned to crafting and devoted himself to creating the perfect armor for stealthy and deadly combat, one that would allow him to continue his mission for revenge. He spent years researching rare materials and enchantments, experimenting with different designs and techniques, until he finally succeeded in creating the Shadows Refuge.</p><p>The armor is made of lightweight leather, enchanted with powerful magic that allows it to absorb and manipulate shadows. This allows the wearer to blend seamlessly into the shadows and become almost invisible, even in broad daylight.</p><p>However, the creation of the armor came at a cost. Aiden had to sacrifice his own life force to infuse the armor with magic. With his dying breath, he hid the armor, believing that it would be too dangerous in the wrong hands.</p>"

Suddenly, he heard a voice whisper in his ear, \"No matter how fast you run, you can't outrun the shadows.\" The man froze in horror.
