It is said to be the instrument of choice of back alley doctors and black market suppliers. Amputation operations can be conducted almost instantaneously; plenty of time before the town guard started sticking their nose in.</p><p>You have advantage on <span id=\"was-tagged\">Medicine</span> checks made to perform surgical procedures using this sword.</p><p><em><strong>Amputation.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can speak its command word, causing it to momentarily become incredibly sharp and able to cut through limbs with even a glancing blow. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra [[/r 2d12]] slashing damage and loses a randomly determined limb (use the table below). On a success, it takes half as much damage and doesn't lose a limb. Creatures with legendary resistances automatically succeed on this saving throw. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p>How the creature is affected depends on the creatures' anatomy and is up to the GM's discretion. If the GM decides the creature can't be amputated, this property deals an extra [[/r 6d12]] slashing damage instead of [[/r 2d12]]. Below are examples for a humanoid.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>[[/r d20]]</td><td>Limb</td><td>Effect</td></tr><tr><td>1-9</td><td>Leg</td><td>The target's walking speed is halved and it has <strong>disadvantage</strong> on <strong>Dexterity saving throws</strong>.</td></tr><tr><td>10-19</td><td>Arm</td><td>The target drops whatever it is holding in this hand (if any) and has <strong>disadvantage</strong> on attack rolls using its arms. If the target has a feature or trait that allows it to make multiple attacks using its arms, it makes one fewer.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Head</td><td>You cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>GM Tip: Avoiding Amputation.</strong></em> If you don’t want to include amputation in your game, replace the slashing damage with psychic damage and have the Amputation property instead temporarily disable the target’s limb until it finishes a short or long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Finesse.</strong></em> When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><em><strong>Light.</strong></em> A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p>",
