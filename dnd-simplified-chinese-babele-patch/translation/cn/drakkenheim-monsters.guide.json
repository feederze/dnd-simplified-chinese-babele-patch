The only terrible green thing I put in my body is salad. Classic apothecaries and their weird experiments and torsos chained to walls, there's no way those working conditions are viable. They are just trying to scare some would-be adventurer. I, the great Pluto Jackson, do not fear torsos. I have the greatest torso of all! My torso is carved from the relentless pursuit of perfection and red meat.”\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>—Pluto Jackson</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  <span class=\"dropcap\" aria-hidden=\"true\">T</span>\n  <span aria-hidden=\"true\">hrough</span>\n  <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Through</span>\n  occult science and eldritch magic, apothecaries manipulate life and death itself. Most use their skills to cure ailments, mend injuries, and save lives. Superstition and rumors abound regarding their practice and abilities, these healers and doctors are often well-regarded within their communities. Experience and curiosity inspire apothecaries to experiment, seeking out new knowledge and advanced techniques.\n</p>\n\n<p>Well-intentioned exploration turns to dark practice when an apothecary discovers that the same magic that repairs the body can also reanimate dead flesh, transmogrify muscle and bone, animate inorganic matter, manipulate the mind, and even create new life. It begins in small ways: the apothecary offers an experimental concoction made from dangerous materials to a desperate patient, or transplants body parts harvested from the dead to save a grievously wounded friend. Perhaps next they attempt to reanimate a beloved pet, create a laboratory assistant from mud and chemicals, or use a new technique to gently dissuade local authorities from investigating their laboratories. Most stop there, content to close the book on their occult discoveries and return to more humble and reliable methods. However, unforeseen circumstances or boundless ambition drive a rare few to take these studies even further; to push the boundaries of science and magic with no regard for ethics, morals, or safety.</p>\n\n<p>Tragically, though the vast majority of apothecaries harness science to aid others, heal the sick, and change the world for the better, a rare few among them become villains who unleash nightmares from their laboratores. These monsters perpetuate a vicious cycle when their masters send them out into the world to collect body parts and unwitting victims for use in further experimentation. Even after their creators are brought to justice, the horrors they created remain hiding in the dark corners of villages, in underground lairs beneath cities, or in secret and forgotten laboratories.</p>\n\n<p>The twisted and unusual abominations crafted by the minds of apothecaries who have thrown away morals in exchange for scientific advancement are becoming an unfortunate byproduct of their avenues of study. These monster maker's vile experiments have unleashed a new generation of wicked creations upon the world. Tales spread around campfires and amongst children that tell of the things that go bump in the night: stitched-together corpses, their limbs replaced with medical instruments; grave-robbing body-snatchers stealing away in the dead of night; strange monstrosities lurking in the shadows seeking fresh victims; and patients who got more than they bargained for in a desperate plea for help.</p>\n\n<aside>\n  <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n    <h1>What is an Apothecary?</h1>\n    <p>The apothecary is a new class for Fifth Edition introduced in Sebastian Crowe's Guide to Drakkenheim. These Intelligence-based spellcasters and medical experts use their knowledge to both heal and harm, augmenting their conventional skills with alchemy and occult magic. They mimic magical effects using the right combination of natural ingredients, chemical reagents, and occult practices. Many monsters in this chapter are inspired by the six subclasses available to apothecaries: Alienist, Chemist, Exorcist, Mutagenist, Pathogenist, and Reanimator.</p>\n    <p>Some apothecaries might first attempt treatment with traditional means like medicinal herbs and surgical techniques. When these methods are not enough, they use arcane magic and eldritch forces to restore their patients. Apothecary magic revolves around the body: healing it with tinctures, modifying it via transmogrification or psychoactive compounds, or harming it with poisons and diseases.</p>\n    <p>Though much rarer than sorcerers and wizards, apothecary techniques are spreading through the continent from master to apprentice, as well as in a few institutions for higher learning. While their magic isn't forbidden, the Amethyst Academy does not take kindly to magical instruction outside their schools. Thus, knowledge about apothecary magic has spread largely in secret. These desperate circumstances have often inspired less ethical apothecaries to carry out unsavory magic and methods to continue their research, gain power, and protect themselves and their techniques.</p>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n\n<h2>Occult Creation</h2>\n\n<p>During their training, many apothecaries develop skills used to create strange creatures, be that through modifying the dead, stitching together flesh into something new, or harnessing the essence of a creature and transforming it into something else. Apothecaries have, at times, strayed from their paths of scientific study for the betterment of mortals, and gotten carried away with the possibilities of if they could accomplish a new feat, disregarding if they should. Often these practices have been used in creating brainless lab assistants, minions to help and perform menial surgical tasks or bodyguards who need no rest to protect and safeguard the important works of the scientists. All manner of bizarre creations bending science and the arcane have been noted as apothecary inventions. The most ambitious and insane apothecaries may even use themselves as a canvas for their experiments.</p>\n\n<h3>Alienist</h3>\n\n<p>The mind is a malleable thing to an Alienist. To the untrained and ignorant, the methods of an alienist may appear little more than cunning charm and subtle words. However, they know potent occult techniques for mental manipulation including hypnosis, suggestion, telepathy, and telekinesis. When their practice moves on to test subjects, they use mental projection, indoctrination, and even brain surgery to brainwash their victims, altering mental capability, memory, and thought patterns.</p>\n\n<p>An Alienist will use their vast and expanding intellect to create monsters from the severed and broken minds of their patients. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.514disembodiedps]{Disembodied Psyches}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.512cerebrograft0]{Cerebrografts}, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.518bloodleeches0#mind-leech]{Mind Leeches} are notable Alienist creations. They have also been known to implant victims with aberrations to take control of the host's body, removing the brains of patients and using them in further experimentation—and other more unfathomable things.</p>\n\n<h3>Chemist</h3>\n\n<p>Chemists often start with mixing mundane acids and compounds in a laboratory. They practice harnessing heat, cold, and electricity in new and unique ways. As they move on to larger projects, Chemists begin experimenting with more destructive forces, attempting to perfect what combination of the least ingredients results in the biggest elemental reactions. They also create sentient alchemical mixtures, creating life from the very core and raw alchemical elements. Eventually a Chemist learns the skills to raze buildings to the ground with little more than a flask of chemicals used in the right way.</p>\n\n<p>\n  Chemists often create various forms of oozes or elementals as lab assistants or defenses. @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.NwQpeeaMxAC3fRft]{Black Puddings}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.3fzQVYQhXxCXRa2o]{Gelatinous Cubes},\n  <strong>Mephits</strong>, and all manner of elementals are common creations. The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.527tanker0000000]{Tanker} acts as a common lab assistant to the Chemist, but no creation is as deadly as the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.513chemystral000]{Chemystral}, the ultimate creation of chemical sentience, adaptable and durable; they are the pride of any Chemist.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Exorcist</h3>\n\n<p>Exorcists have long been an outlier in the branches of scientific study. However, in a world full of portals to other planes, creatures from the Hells and the Shadowlands, and even the fairy Otherworlds constantly slipping through, the scientific study into these planes is a discipline many will undertake. They do not share the devotion of a paladin or cleric, but instead research the origins of divine power, and how to harness it to manipulate extraplanar beings. Many Exorcists begin their path banishing simple spirits or communicating with ghosts. Eventually they master the ability to vanquish possession and banish much more powerful foes. Exorcists who are driven to more sinister paths can reverse engineer this knowledge to summon entities from other planes, and even allow these beings into themselves, using their bodies as a vessel.</p>\n\n<p>Exorcists could be accompanied by @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.qoFEjfrANBdrCP6m]{Ghosts} or demons of any sort, but their true vile powers come to light in the form of possessions. An Exorcist on a path for power may let a demonic being into their body to try and harness and control the power of that creature, these @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.525soulboundhost]{Soulbound Hosts} often struggle, and often fail to maintain control over such power.</p>\n\n<h3>Mutagenist</h3>\n\n<p>A Mutagenist is practiced controlling mutations and altering of the flesh of creatures. They are less crude in their implementations than a Reanimator, and often their experiments will lack the stitched-together nature of other apothecaries, instead containing growths, misplaced appendages and orifices and other grotesque mutations. Mutagenists often begin their practice on small rodents and other creatures, testing their transmogrification to see if they can bend these creatures to be stronger and faster, or mutate them to grow new beneficial properties. It's when a Mutagenist turns to human experimentation that things tend to take a dark turn. For every successful experiment, there are a handful of failures.</p>\n\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.524skinwing00000]{Skinwing}is the byproduct of a Mutagenist tampering with smaller creatures, while creations such as @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.512cerebrograft0]{Cerebrograft} are a much more advanced creation. Sometimes their failures do remain beneficial to the doctor in the form of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.528uncontainedgr]{Uncontained Growths}. Ultimately the end goal of any Mutagenist is to create the Apex Formula and use it on themselves, transforming into what they deem to be the perfect version of humanity. However, there are always side effects.</p>\n\n<h3>Pathogenist</h3>\n\n<p>The Pathogenist studies viruses, diseases, poisons, and pathogens. They usually begin their careers with innocent intentions, such as attempting to perfect combating deadly pathogens and viruses by creating cures or medicines. However, some turn more toward harnessing the powers of poison and disease for harmful purposes. When they begin experimenting on test subjects, using them as breeding grounds for their new mutant strains begins their path toward creating horrible abominations.</p>\n\n<p>Pathogenists who use human subjects as testing grounds for their diseases often create @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.520plaguecarrier]{Plague Carriers} as a means of delivering these diseases, while @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.515injector00000]{Injectors} act as loyal lab assistants, ready to deliver the Pathogenist's deadly toxins to their often unwilling patients.</p>\n\n<h3>Reanimator</h3>\n\n<p>Reanimators are often first practiced in the art of reattaching severed limbs, or moving body parts from one creature to another. As their desire for perfection in their creations grows, their path to deadly experimentation begins. Their minds blossom with wild ideas to attempt physical manipulations that no being should endure.</p>\n\n<p>Reanimators will often be accompanied by @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.521reautomata000]{Reautomata} as their first foray into human testing, but they create all manner of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.526stitcher00000]{Stitchers}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.523ripper0000000]{Rippers}, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.515injector00000]{Injectors} as lab assistants to help them with the production of new creations.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.111imgipulatingl inline]\n\n<h2>Apothecaries and Delerium</h2>\n\n<p>When delerium first arrived in Drakkenheim on that fateful day, it left behind devastation and death in its wake, but it also left opportunity for those willing to seek it, and determined enough to harness its power.</p>\n\n<p>While the vast resources and institutional organization of the Amethyst Academy were fully leveraged to research and obtain delerium, the mages were not the only ones interested in learning about and exploiting the strange crystals. Apothecaries of all stripes sought samples of their own as whispers of the magical potency and corrupting influence of delerium spread. Most purchase delerium from traders, prospectors, and smugglers, but others go as far as hiring adventures or mounting their own expeditions to the ruins to collect the stones.</p>\n\n<p>There can be no doubt that the boundless magical power and contaminating influence of delerium has sharply increased the scope and horror of apothecary experimentations. Practitioners of all sorts have begun to use delerium to further extend their scientific research, as it offered magical potency to places that were without it before. Apothecaries have long wished to harness the abilities of mages, and in many ways were able to mimic those examples through blending the right chemicals, or the use of carefully practiced procedures. However, when delerium was added into the mix, it amplified the capabilities of apothecaries to new heights, allowing them to push the nature of scientific study into realms hitherto unimagined.</p>\n\n<p>Commonfolk can often no longer tell the difference between a mageborn spellcaster and an apothecary twisting science to their will. Both the Academy and Silver Order have frowned upon the back-alley practices of many apothecaries. These traditionalists fear that as science grows ever closer to the realm of magic, the provisions of the Edicts of Lumen begin to blur. Delerium is showing up in places it should not, and its presence is always cause for concern. Experimenting with delerium brings inevitable danger, and the pathway to things beyond mortal comprehension. Still, apothecaries aim to harness this power to modify and enhance their capabilities—with understanding comes power. The more an apothecary understands delerium, the less there is to fear from it, and the more power they believe they can have over it.</p>"

They are deadly and precise creatures who are skilled as both medical lab assistants and defenders. With their surgical tools or unbound strength, they pose a deadly threat to any who dare meddle in the affairs of the mad apothecaries who created them.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Mindless Minions</h2>\n\n<p>Most abominations are specifically designed to feel no pain, and lack a mind of their own. They will often fight until they die, relentlessly attacking until they cannot anymore. Oftentimes, these minions operate on the commands of their apothecary masters, performing the orders they have been given to the best of their abilities.</p>\n\n<h2>Eyes and Ears</h2>\n\n<p>Apothecaries can often use their experiments as a means of gathering intel. Whether through psychic links, telepathic connections, or other more inventive means, it is common that when an apothecary's minion spots a threat, the apothecary will be alerted to that threat immediately. The minions frequently act as a security system for an apothecary's lair.</p>\n\n<h2>Sample Encounters</h2>\n\n<p>Apothecaries often collect an eclectic mix of creations and experiments, so it is common for several different monsters in this chapter to be found together.

These missing people are often accompanied by reports of strange creatures on the outskirts of town.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Infiltrating the Guild</h2>\n\n<p>The Amethyst Academy is concerned with the scientific research happening in secret at the Mobius Facility, located in the Drakeclaw mountains. The Academy needs a team of adventurers to find the hidden entrance to this facility, infiltrate it, and find out if any illegal magic is practiced there.

These places hold the mysteries of science and occult lore. Finding an apothecary's lair is often a difficult task, as they go to great lengths to conceal their work; the monsters that inhabit the dank workshops and occult labs are the stuff of nightmares.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Repurposed Facilities</h2>\n\n<p>Whether working alone or in small groups, apothecaries typically repurpose an existing structure to serve as their lair. They may choose a disused old manor house, abandoned fortress, or a remote sanitarium. Often their lairs are unknown to most, in long forgotten facilities, in remote locations, or in secret chambers below a town.</p>\n\n<h2>Institutional Facade</h2>\n\n<p>Apothecaries who make their lairs in towns and cities may provide legitimate medical services and healing to the community while concealing their experiments from public view. Their lair may outwardly operate as a school, hospice, or clinic open to those seeking the apothecary's talents, while housing their real work in hidden chambers below ground. Less scrupulous apothecaries may use this as a scheme to transform unwitting patients into test subjects.</p>\n\n<h2>Science-Fiction Furnishings</h2>\n\n<p>An apothecary lab is often filled with bizarre alchemical ingredients, various types of lab equipment, and strange chambers filled with occult secrets. Strange contraptions: tesla coils, cadavers, half-finished experiments, and all manner of science-fiction staples can be found in their labs. No matter the type of apothecary inhabiting the lair, it is a bizarre place that fringes on the borders of what is science and magic.</p>\n\n<h2>Nothing as it Seems</h2>\n\n<p>There is no way of knowing when you are walking into a horrible trap when exploring an apothecary's lair. Cadavers may get up and walk around, the vat of bubbling liquid may be a sentient ooze, and the multitudes of experiments and equipment may cause elemental traps and hazards. With the numerous forms of science that apothecaries experiment with, there is no telling what mind-bending contraptions they may have at their disposal.</p>\n\n<h2>Minions and Monsters</h2>\n\n<p>Many of the monsters in this chapter operate as minions to powerful apothecaries. Depending on the type of apothecary you are using, there are monsters it may use more often than others. Regardless, an apothecary uses its experiments and mastery of arcane science to protect themselves and their valuable research.</p>\n\n<h2>Puzzles and Protections</h2>\n\n<p>Apothecaries do not easily allow access their labs and research. They often have powerful locks, puzzles, and various ways to outsmart and confuse those trying to infiltrate to their secret lairs.</p>\n\n<h2>Laboratory Features</h2>\n\n<p>This lair is based on the secret apothecary laboratory found beneath Altbruke University, but could be adapted to the lair of any apothecary. The descriptions of the rooms are left ambiguous in nature, as different apothecaries may decorate their rooms in different ways.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>An @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.506apothecaries0#alienist]{Alienist} may have more texts on psychology, simple puzzles and games, abstract ink blots with sinister interpretations, a Newton's cradle on the desk, or a classic brain in a jar.</li>\n  <li>A @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.506apothecaries0#chemist]{Chemist} will likely have vials and vats of chemicals, alchemical equipment, tongs, furnaces, barrels of water, safety equipment, and lots of test samples.

Macabre décor decorates the laboratory, such as skulls and bones, along with religious items relating to the Sacred Flame or Old Gods. They may even have a ghost or spirit contained in a warded vessel.</li>\n  <li>A @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.506apothecaries0#mutagenist]{Mutagenist} will often have books of biology, diagrams of the human form, test samples of their formulae, alchemical equipment, and perhaps even a failed test subject kept as a minion or pet.</li>\n  <li>A @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApo05.JournalEntryPage.506apothecaries0#pathogenist]{Pathogenist} may have more vials and toxins lining their shelves, books about viral infections, pathogens, healing, and occult lore.

Nondescript meat hanging from hooks or severed limbs in piles are not unheard of.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>1. Doctor's Office</h3>\n\n<p>This private office is where the apothecary retreats for some light reading of their own.</p>\n\n<p>A small wooden desk covered in writing supplies, specimens, and scientific knick-knacks sits in the far corner. A comfortable looking chair, and a few bookshelves filled with occult lore and scientific texts forms a comfortable reading nook. A rather plain rug sits upon the floor and artwork on the walls depicting various scientific or medical procedures relating to the apothecary's field of work</p>\n\n<h3>2. Laboratory</h3>\n\n<p>This large chamber can be set up for a variety of alchemical and scientific experiments, involving both organic and inorganic materials. It may even be appropriate for creating magic items.</p>\n\n<p>Shelves of samples and equipment line the walls with long tables in the middle of the room, each equipped with alchemical gear, or strange instruments for performing scientific experiments and research.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Library</h3>\n\n<p>This library contains rare and exotic works on medicine, occult magic, science, nature, and may contain forbidden lore or secrets mortals were not meant to know.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Operating Theatre</h3>\n\n<p>This grim chamber is a horrifying laboratory dedicated to mad science. At the center of the room is a pedestal in the middle of a large magic circle. Four sconces bearing delerium crystals surround the raised pedestal. A massive dissection slab flanked by two great machines crackling with arcane energy resonate with the slab, which sits atop the pedestal. There are sets of dissection tables all about the room, with various corpses and bodies in different states of dismemberment placed upon them. Along one of the walls are several jars containing preserved brains and body parts.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Materials Storage</h3>\n\n<p>This organized chamber contains chemicals and reagents used for the apothecary's work.</p>\n\n<h3>6. Subject Containment</h3>\n\n<p>A prison by any other terms, these rooms are used to hold test subjects for the apothecary's work—or their failed experiments.</p>\n\n<h3>7. Morgue</h3>\n\n<p>A room for storing the dead, often for use in grim experiments.</p>\n\n<h3>8. Patient Ward</h3>\n\n<p>This room is filled with beds for the apothecary's more willing patients to convalesce and rest.</p>\n\n<h3>9. Waiting Room</h3>\n\n<p>Some apothecaries run functional businesses where patients will come to seek their aid. The waiting room is a place for those waiting to see the doctor to pass time.</p>\n\n<h2>Notable Apothecary Lairs in the World of Drakkenheim</h2>\n\n<h3>Altbruke University</h3>\n\n<p>One of the continent's finest institutions for higher learning, Altbruke University offers programs in the humanities, natural philosophy, mathematics, physics, and medicine. However, the curriculum at Altbruke University concerns mundane topics only. Under the Edicts of Lumen, none save the Amethyst Academy may operate a school for instruction in the arcane.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the school is home to the Guild of Conscientious Practice and Scientific Discovery, an organization of philosophers, scientists, and doctors, who share knowledge, collaborate on research, and clandestinely operate an occult study of apothecary magic. The guild took advantage of the political turmoil in the years following the Westemär Civil War to work largely unnoticed by school authorities, amongst the nobility, and, most importantly, the Amethyst Academy. Working in hiding for almost a decade, the guild instructed promising students in occult magic and repurposed the subterranean chambers below the Lena Leuven Laboratory of Medicine and Natural Philosophy into an extensive secret school and lab.</p>\n\n<p>The intense secrecy surrounding their hidden labs enabled several guild members to conduct truly dark and horrifying experiments, contrary to the group's mission statement. The psychic manipulator Dr. Sina Rienks, aided in concealing the mutagenic experiments of Dr. Johanna Veers, while Anton Jonge conspired to create deathly pathogens. It may have continued had not the reanimated experiments of one Dr. Everett Freed begun wreaking havoc on the student body.</p>\n\n<h3>Mobius Facility</h3>\n\n<p>Rumors throughout Westemär speak of a facility deep in the twisting peaks of the Drakeclaw Mountains. Known as the Mobius Facility, its location is kept secret by the apothecaries who wish to hide their research from the rest of the world. It is said that the Mobius Facility's internal structure is built around optical illusions, making it a mind-bending place to navigate. Inside the deep lab's seemingly endless rooms are scientific atrocities that push the boundaries of fathomable knowledge.</p>\n\n<h3>Lento College</h3>\n\n<p>Lento College in Caspia is known mostly for its arts programs. The school produces many of the continent's well-known bards, but it also provides standard studies, including a few small labs and science facilities. Although not as well known as Altbruke, a small group of Caspian apothecaries formed their own research facilities after graduating from Lento College.</p>\n\n<h3>Liberio</h3>\n\n<p>The arts and sciences flourish in the Free City of Liberio, sponsored by wealthy aristocracy and merchants who flock to the city. Many apothecaries see themselves as artists, and they thrive in Liberio. The cosmopolitan city has no shortage of ailments, and skilled doctors readily establish themselves by treating sick sailors, healing injured commonfolk, or doting on a vain noble. Liberio is a mercantile crossroads; apothecaries here have no trouble procuring rare ingredients and materials, especially those of a less-than-legal nature thanks to the smuggling and piracy flowing from the city across the Middle Sea.</p>\n\n<p>Liberio's political independence also means apothecaries can work more openly here than anywhere else in the continent, despite the direct presence of the Amethyst Academy and their Enigma Ziggurat. Interestingly, occultists in the city find working under the Academy's nose beneficial. First, the mages' presence means that willing adventurers and rare curiosities pass through the city regularly, especially delerium. Second, Academy mages seem to tolerate apothecaries in Liberio, unwilling to disturb the peace where their great stronghold sits. Indeed, it's not unknown for apothecaries and Academy guildmages to gather, trade, and occasionally collaborate here.</p>\n\n<p>Although many apothecaries operate their own clinics, the city is home to one of the few purpose-built hospitals in the Continent: the Sanatoria Obscura, led by two prolific apothecaries, Isidora Venefica and Lucius Noctis. The hospital none-the-less is the subject of many rumors about what happens in the extensive morgue and research labs housed beneath the public-facing medical wings.</p>\n\n<h3>Southern Reach</h3>\n\n<p>The coastal side of the Southern Reach is far enough away from the rules and regulations of Elyria, that although those in Lumen consider the Southern Reach part of their nation of Elyria, they hold little control or sway over what goes on beyond the Witherbleach Desert. Those in the Southern Reach have, for a long time, considered themselves their own separate nation. One that is free from the rule of many of the other nations, and very seldom looked at even for maintaining the Edicts of Lumen. The Black Lambda Facility, one of the largest facilities of science and research resides in the base of the Pale Teeth Mountains. Dozens of apothecaries practice and study here, performing occult rituals, dangerous science, and brutal experiments.</p>"

Although they are not gods, their vast powers and incredible knowledge often allows them to masquerade as such to naive or unwitting mortals. Indeed, these entities can seal eldritch pacts with those who seek their favor and patronage; some of their warlocks even revere and worship these patrons. Other spellcasters may seek forbidden lore from them via magic like the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.dSTu1MaPhBqPITwM]{Contact Other Plane} spell. Perhaps some of these entities may have come to mortals in ancient days and made some of the first warlock pacts which brought magic to the Mortal World.\n</p>\n\n<p>Promising and ambitious mortals, such as courageous adventurers, often attract the interest and ire of these ancient beings. Their plans and machinations stretch on for countless mortal lifetimes, and so these ancient entities often appear to adventurers as patient patrons, offering information, aid, magical powers, and insights. However, they extract their own costs, for these entities seldom share human values, instead following their own amoral principles and alien perspectives. Often, they demand a service performed at a perpendicular purpose to the heroes' own objectives — their reasons or purposes may not become apparent until years, decades, or centuries have passed.</p>\n\n<h2>Inscrutable Origins</h2>\n\n<p>These ancient entities are intrinsically connected to their planes of origin. The metaphysical tethers mean that such beings normally cannot travel physically into the Mortal World without extraordinary amounts of magical energy. However, their planar connection also makes them nearly impossible to permanently destroy. Since they are part of the essence of their planes of origin, they will re-form if their physical forms are slain, although it could take centuries before they regain their full forms. Nevertheless, even in this disembodied state, it is still possible to interact with their consciousness via magic or their intermediaries. Instead, mortals who wish to end these otherworldly threats investigate ways to bind or imprison them indefinitely, as their complete destruction is impossible.</p>\n\n<p>If these beings possess any true knowledge regarding the fundamental nature of the cosmos or the existence of the gods, it is not clear. They only speak to mortals of such topics in a cryptic manner, and often in metaphorical or figurative language which deliberately obfuscates their meaning.</p>\n\n<h2>Using the Ancient Entities in Your Campaign</h2>\n\n<p>\n  Although presented here with their game statistics as Epic Bosses, these Ancient Entities should<strong> not</strong>\n  be cast in the role of the ultimate villain in a Drakkenheim campaign! These beings care little for mortal affairs, and who triumphs in the contest between the embattled factions of the Continent matters very little to them. They do, however, have a profound interest in delerium, but only because its chaotic influence creates fertile ground for their own schemes.\n</p>\n\n<p>While player characters may speculate as such — and you should certainly feed into this suspicion — none of these ancient entities are responsible for sending the meteor that annihilated Drakkenheim. They did not create delerium; the crystals are a much more fundamental property of the way magic works in the Drakkenheim cosmos. However, some are entertained by what that notion prompts in mortals. Others, such as the Thing with the Writhing Tail and the Whispered Promise, seek to use delerium to advance their agendas and power. Other beings ultimately desire the destruction or domination of the Mortal World—such as He Who Laughs Last and the Rat God—but those plans are centuries from fruition and will come at a time when no heroes live to oppose them. Even if the player characters manage to slay one of these beings, such an event is ultimately an insignificant setback to their longstanding plans.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, these beings are best involved in the campaign as patrons, manipulators, and puppetmasters, orchestrating schemes far beyond the comprehension of the player characters. Not only do they make excellent patrons for warlocks of all stripes and great targets for the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.dSTu1MaPhBqPITwM]{Contact Other Plane} spell, roleplaying interactions with the Ancient Entities are also delightful opportunities to test the principles and desires of the player characters. These Ancient Entities can offer the player characters shortcuts to knowledge and power if the characters are willing to make bargains or pacts with terrifying eldritch creatures. These entities could offer characters the chance to “correct” a past mistake, or a direct path to achieve a key objective related to their personal quests — but the possible cost and consequences should give the heroes pause.</p>\n\n<p>All you need to do is place a statue, shrine, mysterious portal, or magic circle along the adventurers' path to facilitate a telepathic interaction between the entity and the player characters. Play to the characters' desires, fears, ambitions, and regrets. Cryptically offer them everything they want and more, but without answers or explanations. Take delight in playing the entities with a sense of alien distance, nonchalant superiority, and arrogant assurance. After all, the heroes are but insignificant pawns in a grand game for them — and all the characters' struggles and victories aren't even a key play in the overall strategy for these enigmatic beings.</p>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote parchment\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>I have killed a lot of weird monsters in my day, but these things eat my toughest foes for breakfast.

Led by the valiant Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal, the knights have been dispatched to eradicate Drakkenheim's corruption at its source.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <span class=\"dropcap\" aria-hidden=\"true\">T</span>\n  <span aria-hidden=\"true\">he</span>\n  <span class=\"visually-hidden\">The</span>\n  Silver Order are a well-known military organization hailing from the nation of Elyria in the southwest of the continent. Loyal to the Church of the Sacred Flame, they operate as a church-sanctioned military whose stated purpose is to protect the world from evil magical intrusions, to keep otherworldly threats at bay, and to protect the people against dark magic and abuses of power from mageborn. Many believe the Silver Order are a strict organization who upholds the letter of the law within the Edicts of Lumen, a legal document that dictates the balance of power between the church, the mages, and the royalty.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>What the Silver Order lacks in subtlety they make up for with sheer force. They are a military organization, and their soldiers are well trained and work together as a team. When they tackle problems, they do so in a uniform fashion, knowing when to rely on one another, complete tasks and make pushes in unison. The Silver Order has simple call signs, hand signals, commands, and strategies that they can rely on in the field.</p>\n\n<p>Silver Order knights and paladins should work as a cohesive unit who know their strengths and how to protect their weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p>Any Silver Order regiment is accompanied by at least one paladin or Flamekeeper, and usually at least one of each. Larger organized military missions will see griffon riders as well as entire units of paladins and several Flamekeepers or Pyre Priests. This means that no Silver Order unit is without moderate healing, protective buffs, and often forms of divination and holy battle magic. When push comes to shove, the order's divine spellcasters tend to have a few @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{Fireballs} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flamestrikes} amongst their options.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.234imgightsofthe inline]\n\n<h2 class=\"banner\">Silver Order Squire</h2>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.235imgightsofthe inline]\n<h4>Statblock: @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.monsters.Actor.TmSzCBo3qK5GuCxG]{Silver Order Squire}</h4>\n\n<p>Dressed in leathers, and carrying a short sword, shield, and shortbow, the young squire hefts a small backpack of gear for maintaining and patching armor and weapons, griffon care, ammunition, and other essentials that may be needed on the field.

They wish to drive out the monsters and outlaws who infest their nation's capital, find an heir to the throne, and restore the realm of Westemär.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns are divided into three regiments which occupy the city and the areas surrounding it. New recruits joining the Lanterns are often first put into the Support Regiment. They make up the chefs, apothecaries, scribes, and maintenance workers at every Hooded Lantern fortification. Many of those positions are held by folk who will never move beyond the Support Regiment, and their job is valuable to the foundations of the Hooded Lanterns.</p>\n\n<p>The Watch Regiment defend the walls and gates of any Lantern-controlled location. Oftentimes, if the Vanguards manage to gain a new foothold in the city, a group of Hooded Lanterns Watch are sent to hold the new position and ensure it remains in the Hooded Lanterns' hands. They also often operate as scouts in the field. Not specifically aiming for tactical engagement or large-scale battles, but they are the eyes and ears of the Lanterns throughout the city and occasionally clean up wandering monsters from the streets near their bases.</p>\n\n<p>The Vanguard Regiment are the front line of the Hooded Lanterns. They are skilled combatants, who know their way around the ruins of the city and can find vantage points, plan ambushes, secure positions, and dispose of monster dens and other enemies. Vanguards are often soldiers who have proven themselves as reliable and talented Watch or Support Regiment and aim to prove themselves further in the city.</p>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns rarely go into a fight without a plan. They set up ambushes, tailoring an encounter to put them at an advantage. They know their territory and can navigate the ruins of the city with relative ease compared to most adventurers who journey into Drakkenheim. They travel in well-equipped groups, and often carry tools to alert other nearby scouting parties if they need help.</p>\n\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns are skilled archers. They often occupy rooftops and ruined towers. If they expect combat to occur, they position soldiers with bows in any nearby vantage points with a clear view of their allies down on the streets. They place scouts in ruined buildings to keep eyes on the streets and run for aid if a combat breaks out. The Lanterns lay traps and ambushes before their enemies have entered the area. Hooded Lanterns are often incredibly prepared and use the ruins as camouflage for their attack.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.242imgodedlanter inline]\n\n<h2 class=\"banner\">Hooded Lantern Scout</h2>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.243imgodedlanter inline]\n\n<h4>Statblock: @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.monsters.Actor.HNqjLxavQzH8PrV9]{Hooded Lantern Scout}</h4>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">This lightly-armored urban scout is armed with a grapple gun, flare gun, shortsword, and longbow.

        "Crafting Overview": {
          "name": "Crafting Overview",
          "text": "<h1 class=\"banner no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Crafting Overview\">Crafting Overview</h1>\n\n<p>In brief, here's how characters craft items using these rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Learn the Recipe.</strong> The player characters must first find the <strong>Recipe</strong> for the magic item they want to create, which identifies its properties and the <strong>Components</strong> needed. The Recipe also details the types of monsters from which the Components must be harvested. Permanent items, such as weapons and armor, require between four and ten Components, while consumables, like potions and scrolls, only need two or three.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Harvest the Components.</strong> After the player characters defeat a monster, they can spend ten minutes to <strong>Harvest</strong> and preserve <strong>Components</strong> from the corpse. This process must be completed quickly after a monster dies, otherwise the Component's innate magic fades. The Game Master describes what Components are available, and then each player character may choose to harvest one Component (regardless of how many foes were defeated). This abstractly represents how Components can be damaged in battle, ruined by harvesting, or of insufficient quality for crafting.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Locate a Workshop.</strong> Once the required Components are collected, the characters must bring them to a suitable <strong>Workshop</strong> to build the item. Workshops have a rarity that corresponds to the magic items which may be produced there. Uncommon or Rare Workshops may be found in great cities, whereas Very Rare and Legendary Workshops are only found in fantastic locations with powerful magical phenomena present, such as magma forges deep in the heart of the earth and arcane laboratories constructed along extraplanar rifts.</li>\n\n  <li><strong>Construct the Item.</strong> The characters spend one day working at the Workshop to combine the Components, and their new magic item is complete!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Component and Workshop Rarity</h2>\n\n<p>Components and Workshops have a rarity, which correspond to the rarity of the magic item made with them. For example, an Uncommon magic item typically calls for Uncommon Components and must be created at an Uncommon workshop. This rarity also provides a rough gauge for what level characters should be able to craft the item.</p>\n\n<p>The rarity of harvested Components are based on the monster's Challenge Rating. Unless otherwise specified, a component's rarity is defined by the Component Rarity table.</p>\n\n<h4>Component Rarity</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        <p>Component Rarity</p>\n      </th>\n      <th>\n        <p>Monster Challenge Rating</p>\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Common</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>1/4 to ½</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Uncommon</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>1 to 4</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Rare</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>5 to 10</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Very Rare</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>11 to 16</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Legendary</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>17+</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The rarity of the Components and workshop used in crafting always determine the highest rarity item they can produce. You can use higher rarity Components and Workshops to produce lower rarity items. For example, if a recipe calls for an Uncommon part, such as monster blood, a character may substitute Rare monster blood to fill the requirements of the Recipe.</p>\n\n<h3>How Often Do Characters Craft an Item?</h3>\n\n<p>Assuming that the player characters face about 4 to 8 combat encounters per character level against non-humanoid foes over the course of an entire campaign, each player character can craft the following quantities of permanent magic items:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"two-column\">\n  <li>3–4 Uncommon</li>\n  <li>2–3 Rare</li>\n  <li>1–2 Very Rare</li>\n  <li>1 Legendary</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These numbers are approximate but are provided to offer a baseline set of expectations which you can adjust accordingly based on how many magic items you wish your player characters to possess. Characters may craft many more Common magic items, as well as many consumable magic items (potions and scrolls) of all rarities.</p>\n\n<p>We recommend adjusting the amount of treasure found in your campaign when you use these rules. Characters should find about half as many magic items as they normally would, since they'll be crafting their own instead.</p>\n\n<aside>\n  <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n    <h1>This is Not an Economic System!</h1>\n    <p>Our objective for these rules was to offer player characters a way to create magic items for their use during adventures. Crafting flows from the adventure's narrative, with every magic item having an evocative tale with its creation. While this system can handle characters occasionally selling items, its not suited for those looking to run a business “farming” monsters for Components, building items, and selling them for profit. Similarly, these rules should <em>not</em> be extrapolated into a setting's functional economy. This system is about functional gameplay that tells a rewarding story, not creating a realistic simulation.</p>\n    <p>We recommend discussing these rules during Session Zero before using them at your table. We felt that the fun of this system would be spoiled with restrictions to prevent economic abuse. We didn't want an overly analytical approach to get in the way of fun. Frankly, no rules-based safeguards are as effective as setting the expectations at the start of a campaign for how these rules may be used.</p>\n    <p>\n      For those looking for narrative justification, the Edicts of Lumen limit magic item creation and sale to the Amethyst Academy, and the mages strictly control this trade. Nevertheless, NPCs may discuss using Components, the need for appropriate facilities, and share recipes with the player characters. Indeed, the Amethyst Academy\n      <em>does</em> pay adventurers to collect Components for them. However, proficient adventurers, capable craftspeople, and suitable monsters, especially higher-level ones, are relatively scarce. The player characters are amongst the few who are in a position to craft magic items using the rules presented here.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</aside>"

        "Step 1 - Learning Recipes": {
          "name": "Step 1 - Learning Recipes",
          "text": "<h1 class=\"banner long no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Step 1: Learning Recipes\">Step 1: Learning Recipes</h1>\n\n<p>Every magic item has a <strong>Recipe</strong> which lists the monster parts required to craft the item and the type\n  of workshop used to construct it.</p>\n\n<p>Most items require between three and ten parts to create. For example, a <em>+1 Weapon</em> must be created at an\n  <strong>Uncommon Workshop</strong> and requires the following <strong>Uncommon Components</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>[Animus] Any Animus.</li>\n  <li>[Bones] Any Bones.</li>\n  <li>[Natural Weapon] Any Natural Weapon.</li>\n  <li>[Hide] Any Hide.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recipes vary from item to item, but most call for monster parts from at least two or three different creatures or\n  sources.</p>\n\n<p>Characters can learn Recipes in three main ways: Finding Schematics, Purchasing Schematics, or through Research.</p>\n\n<h2>Finding Schematics</h2>\n\n<p>Most often, characters learn how to craft a particular magic item by finding a <strong>Schematic</strong>. These\n  documents reveal the rarity, type, and full properties for a crafted magic item, as well as all Components needed to\n  create it. A Schematic may be found as treasure placed by the Game Master or given as a reward for completing a quest.\n</p>\n\n<p>A Schematic takes the form of written or illustrated plans, such as a diagram on parchment, an instruction manual, or\n  inscriptions upon ancient ruins. A master craftsperson might be able to teach the player characters how to make an\n  Uncommon or Rare magic item, whereas Schematics for Very Rare and Legendary items may be knowledge gleaned from the\n  whispers of an otherworldly entity, ancient archmage, or powerful dragon.</p>\n\n<p>Learning Components from a Schematic is an ideal method to kick off a “scavenger hunt” side-quest for the player\n  characters. Plans in hand, they know what they need to get, but it's up to them to locate the monsters and Components\n  needed. Schematics encourage the characters to keep a careful eye out for rare or interesting creatures, and perhaps\n  search a little more thoroughly through the deep dungeons and dark streets of Drakkenheim for a rare prize.</p>\n\n<h2>Purchasing Schematics</h2>\n\n<p>Occasionally, player characters may have the opportunity to purchase a Schematic. The Schematic Pricing table below\n  details suggested prices based on the rarity of the finished item:</p>\n\n<h4>Schematic Pricing</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        <p>Item Rarity</p>\n      </th>\n      <th>\n        <p>Typical Price</p>\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Common</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>5 GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Uncommon</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>50 GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Rare</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>500 GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Very Rare</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>5,000 GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Legendary</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>50,000 GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote parchment\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>I like the recipes with pictures and arrows so I can get right down to business.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Research</h2>\n\n<p>During their adventures, player characters may gather all manner of curious Components, but they may not know exactly\n  what magic items can be created from these collected materials. In such cases, the player characters may study the\n  found parts to discover possible Recipes on their own. This method allows the player characters to discover a magic\n  item Recipe piecemeal, and creates the feeling the characters are inventing or discovering something new.</p>\n\n<p>During a Long Rest, a character can examine a number of Components equal to their Intelligence modifier (minimum one\n  Component). Once they finish a Long Rest, the character learns the Recipe for one magic item the studied Component can\n  be used to create. Since some monster Components can be used to create a variety of different items, an individual\n  Component can be studied multiple times.</p>\n\n<h2>Instant Discovery</h2>\n\n<p>If the player characters have collected all the monster parts needed to craft an item, but haven't yet learned the\n  Recipe, they discover the full Recipe once they research any one of the required parts. Seeing all the parts together\n  is enough for a flash of inspiration!</p>\n\n<h2>Tool Proficiency</h2>\n\n<p>Player characters gain knowledge of a few basic Recipes based on their tool proficiencies, as indicated in the table\n  below.</p>\n\n<h4>Basic Recipies</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        <p>Tool Proficiency</p>\n      </th>\n      <th>\n        <p>Known Recipes</p>\n

          "name": "Step 2 - Harvesting Components",
          "text": "<h1 class=\"banner long no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Step 2: Harvesting Components\">Step 2: Harvesting Components</h1>\n\n<p>\n  Characters may harvest and preserve Components from the corpse of a slain creature using\n  <strong>monster harvesting tools</strong>.\n</p>\n\n<p>Harvesting monster components or extracting its animus must begin within ten minutes of its death. After this time, the magical energy within fades and the animus passes to the ether, and any remaining Components are no longer usable for creating magic items.</p>\n\n<p>No ability checks are required to successfully harvest monsters or extract an animus. As long as a character has the time and tools, they always successfully collect one monster Component from a creature's corpse. The toolkit provides everything a character needs to extract and preserve parts from any creature.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong> Monster Harvesting Tools (50 GP).</strong> The toolkit provides everything characters need to extract animus and preserve any creature parts. This kit contains skinning knives, a cleaver, syringes, a hammer, scissors, scalpels, a bone saw, hooks, as well as a vials, watertight containers, binding reagents, and wrappings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Monster Components</h2>\n\n<p>When the characters decide to harvest a monster's corpse, the Game Master determines which Components can be harvested from a monster, if any. In this book, each monster entry lists the Components available from that creature.</p>\n\n<h3>Component Rarity</h3>\n\n<p>The rarity of all parts are determined by the CR of the monster as presented by the table earlier in this chapter.</p>\n\n<p>Most item recipes call for Components with the same rarity as the item itself. However, some recipes may call for a component from a specific named monster, such as a Frost Giant, an Ancient Red Dragon, or a Banshee. In such cases, if no part of the presented rarity is available for a monster of that type, the DM should allow a component of a lower rarity to be used. For example, the ghost site bow is a Very Rare item that requires the bones of a Dryad and the hair of a Banshee. In this case, these components require you to find any Dryad or Banshee and do not require the parts to be Very Rare.</p>\n\n<h3>Component Categories</h3>\n\n<p>Each Component belongs to one of the following categories:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Animus.</strong> This special Component is described below.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bones. </strong>This includes the skull, spine, or the stem of a plant monster.</li>\n  <li><strong>Dust.</strong> Detritus left behind by magical creatures or undead.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fluid. </strong>Usually monster blood, and also ectoplasm, sap, or mucus.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hair. </strong>Any fur or feathers.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hide. </strong>Includes the monster's skin, scales, carapace, bark, or plates.</li>\n  <li><strong>Natural Weapons.</strong> Almost any natural weapon from the monster's game statistics, such as teeth, claws, horns, tentacles, etc.</li>\n  <li><strong>Organs. </strong>A broad category including both internal body parts and sensory organs, such as the heart, brain, glands, eyes, or guts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Magical Animus</h3>\n\n<p>In the world of Drakkenheim, magic items are created by imbuing a physical object with a metaphysical animus. This vital energy must be properly extracted from a magical creature. A creature's animus is formed from the latent magical energy held within its body, but it is distinct from a creature's soul. Aberrations, Celestials, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, Giants, Monstrosities, Plants, Oozes, and Undead all possess a magical animus. Beasts and Humanoids typically do <em>not</em> possess an animus.</p>\n\n<p>When a creature is slain, its animus lingers momentarily before fading into the ether. However, a creature's animus can be collected and contained within a vessel of some kind, which is then used to make a magical item. It is impossible to extract the animus of a creature without killing it.</p>\n\n<p>Creating magic items requires the animus of one or more suitably powerful creatures. However, some magic items may call for a specific type of animus, such as the animus of a fey creature or dragon. In rare cases, a magic item may require the animus of a much more specific monster.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Animus Vessels.</strong></em> An animus must be collected and stored in a specially prepared magical <strong>vessel</strong>. Traditionally, these vessels were minor magic items in their own right: often rune-etched gemstones infused with magic and created in a laborious process. However, the world of Drakkenheim was transformed by the arrival of delerium: the eldritch crystals function as suitable vessels in their raw state. A delerium crystal filled with magical animus glows with a brilliant octarine light, similar to how the crystals resonate with energy when exposed to magic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Creating Animus Vessels. </strong></em>An animus vessel can be created in 1 hour by combining any three other components of the same rarity. The resulting vessel can then be used as a vessel for an animus of the corresponding rarity. For example, an animus made from three Rare components can hold a Rare animus.\n</p>\n\n<h4>Animus Vessel Crystal Sizes</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        <p>Animus Rarity</p>\n      </th>\n      <th>\n        <p>Required Delerium Crystal Size</p>\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Common</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Chip</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Uncommon</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Fragment</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Rare</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Shard</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Very Rare</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Crystal</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Legendary</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Geode</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Harvest and Extraction Time</h3>\n\n<p>Once started, collecting Components or animus takes ten minutes of work. During this time, the character must remain within 5 feet of the corpse. If the process is interrupted, harvesting must resume within ten minutes, or the Components are lost. A player character may only harvest Components from one creature at a time, regardless of its size. Several characters can work together to harvest multiple parts from the same corpse. No matter how many characters harvest a single corpse, they must all spend ten minutes harvesting.</p>\n\n<h3>Collector's Choice</h3>\n\n<p>Each character may harvest one component from a creature's corpse per encounter.</p>\n\n<p>Characters can work together to harvest several different parts from one monster, or they may split up and harvest parts from several creatures at once. A monster's body usually provides only one of each available part, so two characters harvest</p>\n\n<p>ing parts from the same corpse must choose to collect different parts, unless the Game Master determines that the creature's unique physiology allows the collection of multiples of the same part. For example, a Game Master might allow both horns from a Minotaur to be harvested, but it would take the work of two characters to collect both. Other parts may be more abstract in quantity: it's enough to know that the characters collected a bag of dragon fangs or a vial of troll blood without worrying about a specific measurement.</p>\n\n<p>When the player characters decide to butcher a carcass for Components, the Game Master lists all the possible Components available from the body. Each character may then choose one Component to collect. All other Components are lost and unusable, either because they were damaged in battle, ruined in the harvesting process, or deemed of unsuitable quality for magic item crafting.</p>\n\n<h2>Example Harvesting</h2>\n\n<p>For example, suppose the player characters defeat a Gorgon. They decide to harvest parts from its corpse. The Game Master describes that the Gorgon has the following Rare Components: eyes (organ), a skull (bones), monster blood (fluid), plates (hide), horns (natural weapon), glands (organs), and its animus. There are three player characters, and all work together to harvest parts from the Gorgon. Sebastian decides to collect the Gorgon's Animus, Pluto decides to take the Gorgon's plates, and Veo decides to take the Gorgon's monster blood. All the other parts are lost.</p>\n\n<p>In another case, suppose four player characters defeat a small horde of ten Ratling Warriors. The party would only be able to collect parts from four of them. The parts from the other monsters are lost.</p>\n\n<h3>Keeping Records</h3>\n\n<p>When recording what monster parts the player characters have collected, it's important to identify the Component's name category, as well as the name, creature type, and rarity of the creature. For example, a character might record the following Components:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Minotaur, horns (natural weapon). Uncommon Monstrosity.</li>\n  <li>Vampire, undead dust (dust). Rare Undead.</li>\n  <li>Troll, skin (hide). Uncommon Giant.</li>\n  <li>Adult Red Dragon, monster blood (fluid). Legendary Dragon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recording how many bones characters collect from a slain red dragon, or how many vials of blood characters drain from the corpse of a dead troll, isn't necessary. Regardless of a creature's actual size or dimensions, a character harvests enough material from its corpse to fulfill the ingredients required for a single magic item. Simply recording “Red Dragon monster blood” or “Troll hide” is sufficient. If characters collect the blood or hide from multiple dragons or trolls, simply record “3x Red Dragon blood” or “3x Troll's hide.”</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Component Weight.</strong></em> In general, most Components weigh no more than 1 pound each. When tracking the weight of individual Components, consider the final weight of the constructed item it will be used to create. Most weapons, wondrous items, and consumables weigh between 1 and 5 pounds, so most Components should fall within this range. The Game Master may determine that certain Components intended for use in medium or heavy armor (or other bulky items) weigh substantially more. For example, dragon scales or gorgon plates collected for use in scale or plate armor could weigh as much as 50 pounds.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Buying and Selling Components</h2>\n\n<p>Talented arcanists, artificers, and forgesmiths alike frequently eschew the adventuring life, preferring to commission adventurers to procure rare Components for magic item crafting on their behalf.</p>\n\n<p>Buying and selling Components is an optional downtime activity characters can engage in between their adventures.</p>\n\n<p>Most often, those purchasing Components are looking for a specific Component or two, and seek the services of dedicated monster hunters to retrieve their materials. Even the industrious Amethyst Academy rarely makes an unsolicited purchase, and the mages are seldom willing to purchase anything presented to them.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, finding a seller or buyer for a monster Component takes a number of days equal to the Challenge Rating of the monster.</p>\n\n<h4>Component Base Price</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        <p>Monster Challenge Rating</p>\n      </th>\n      <th>\n        <p>Component Value</p>\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>0 to 1/2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>[[/r 1d4 * 10]] GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1 to 4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>[[/r 1d6 * 20]] GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>5 to 10</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>[[/r 3d6 * 200]] GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>11 to 16</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>[[/r 1d6 * 2000]] GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>17 to 20</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>[[/r 2d6 * 5000]] GP</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>21+</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Priceless</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Additionally, some creature types are more difficult to find than others, resulting in an increase in component prices as follows:</p>\n\n<h4>Creature Type Price Modifier</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>\n        <p>Creature Type</p>\n      </th>\n      <th>\n        <p>Price Multiplier</p>\n      </th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Giants, Monstrosities, Plants</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>No Change</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, Undead</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>×1.5</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Aberrations, Dragons</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>×2</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Celestials, Fey, Fiends</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>×3</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<aside>\n  <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n    <h1>Why Only One Item?</h1>\n    <p>These rules intentionally abstract monster harvesting. Instead of rolling to determine whether or not they harvest parts, or how many parts are harvested, it is simply one part per character per harvest. This prevents the player characters from finding more monster parts than expected (and thus being able to craft more magic items than intended). Similarly, this restriction minimizes the amount of required bookkeeping. Even taking one monster part per character will result in the characters holding on to a lot of crafting materials, and we wanted to avoid clogging up their inventories with hundreds of items they won't ever use.</p>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote parchment\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Gently slide your knife along the spine,or as close to what could be considered a spine, the primary spine.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>"

        "Step 3 - Find a Workshop": {
          "name": "Step 3 - Find a Workshop",
          "text": "<h1 class=\"banner long no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Step 3: Find a Workshop\">Step 3: Find a Workshop</h1>\n\n<p>Crafting magical items also requires a suitably equipped Workshop to create the item, such as a blacksmith's forge, arcane laboratory, or artisan's studio. While a typical blacksmith's forge is fine for making steel, it is ill-suited to working with dragonbone, demonic animus, troll's blood, and elemental earth!</p>\n\n<p>In addition to providing all the tools and equipment necessary, a Workshop also supplies all mundane materials needed for crafting magic items. A forge has an ample supply of coal, iron, and steel, for example, whereas an arcane laboratory or artisan studio has paper, inks, chemicals, and other materials characters would logically need to supplement the monster Components.</p>\n\n<h2>Workshop Rarity</h2>\n\n<p>Like monster parts, each Workshop has a rarity from Common to Legendary. The Workshop's rarity corresponds to the maximum rarity of the magic items which may be created working there. Creating a Rare magic item requires a Rare Workshop, but a Legendary Workshop could be used to fashion an Uncommon magic item, for example.</p>\n\n<h2>Common Workshops</h2>\n\n<p>These Workshops are made for fashioning everyday mundane equipment, and usually lack the specialized and magical tools needed for making magic items. However, they're usually sufficient for making Common magic items, or consumables such as potions and scrolls.</p>\n\n<h2>Uncommon Workshops</h2>\n\n<p>Characters can find Uncommon Workshops in towns and larger settlements. Examples include the finest blacksmith's forge in the region, or a typical wizard's tower.</p>\n\n<h3>Crowe and Sons Smithy</h3>\n\n<p>In Emberwood Village, just outside the city of Drakkenheim sits the Crowe and Sons Smithy. Tobias Crowe is a humble family man who has worked the forge his whole life. His forge is well stocked with all the mundane gear someone would need to craft basic items, and Tobias himself has worked magical gear in the forge as long as he has the right supplies. He is always willing to let adventurers who show they know what they are doing handle the forge, and often aids them in the crafting of unique magic items.</p>\n\n<p>The forge sits under a wooden overhang connected to an old shop. The wall is lined with tools and fitted with a table and shelves containing iron, wood, sacks of coal, brass, copper, leather straps and much more. The old stone forge has a large bellow that you can operate by foot and a rustic and worn anvil next to a metal bucket of cool water.</p>\n\n<h2>Rare Workshops</h2>\n\n<p>Rare Workshops are usually only found in large cities. These impressive facilities are equipped with state-of-the art tools and machinery, and able to import the finest raw materials from around the world.</p>\n\n<h3>Smithy on the Scar</h3>\n\n<p>The Smithy on the Scar was an old blacksmith shop taken over by a group of Ironhelm dwarves. They have refitted the forge to work delerium, meteoric iron, and gunpowder. They have all the tools needed for crafting fine magic items, gunpowder weapons, and some of the best dwarven inventions in the area. With a constant supply of delerium arriving, a group looking to use the forge need only do a seemingly simple task: help the Ironhelm dwarves and guard their forge through the night while they mine the delerium in the scar. Do this, and they will happily allow you to access their gear and make any weapons you need.</p>\n\n<h3>Apothecary Laboratory</h3>\n\n<p>Beneath Altbruke University is a labyrinthian series of corridors, tunnels, and workshops. Amongst them is a great Laboratory complete with a forge, alchemical gear, and a well-stocked storage of every rare element the school could get their hands on. It is better equipped for the crafting of unique potions, poisons, and tonics, but can also be used to craft unique magical items of exquisite design. The abundance of iron, leather, and steel the school has at its disposal means that if one can gain access to this forge, they will be well equipped to do any crafting needed. However, getting the apothecaries of Altbruke University to grant permission is another story.</p>\n\n<h2>Very Rare Workshops</h2>\n\n<p>Very Rare Workshops are built with access to a notable power source used to channel the great heat or mighty arcane forces needed to work with rare and valuable materials. Examples could include an adamantine forge located along a magma flow, or an arcane university channeling the energy of a Thin Place.</p>\n\n<h3>Inscrutable Tower Laboratories</h3>\n\n<p>In the lower chambers of the Inscrutable Tower lies the great Arcane Forge. The Tower is a conduit of sorts that draws in raw arcane energies and focuses them within the tower's nexus. Although the nexus powers many arcane devices throughout the tower, and used as a prime focus for magical practices throughout, the Arcane Forge also draws from this well of power when being used to craft exceptionally rare and powerful magical artifacts. Many of the Academy's most renowned artificers worked in the Arcane Forge. Even in the destruction of Drakkenheim, the forge remains well stocked with the gear needed to draw immense arcane power for forging items. The only issue is that the nexus is not fully operational and the tower needs to be brought back online to use the forge again.</p>\n\n<h3>Dwarven Volcano Forge</h3>\n\n<p>High in the Drakeclaw Mountains is the great Dragon's Maw, a sleeping volcano that was once home to the Firebrand dwarves, who built their great city in the heart of the caldera of the volcano, and harnessed the magma flows into a powerful dwarven forge. Fire elementals once worked the forge and crafted some of the finest dwarven weapons in history. The forge still sits amongst the ruins of this great dwarven empire and is completely operational. However, the ancient red dragon Volmongoth claimed the caldera centuries ago as their lair, and access to the forge has been near impossible since then. One would either need to treat with Volmongoth for access or defeat them in battle. Neither seems likely.</p>\n\n<h2>Legendary Workshops</h2>\n\n<p>A Legendary Workshop is a one-of-a-kind place built in special locations due to the magical phenomena present. Indeed, these storied places are seldom found in the Mortal World at all and may require travel to other dimensions or worlds.</p>\n\n<h3>Space Between Worlds Star Forge</h3>\n\n<p>Deep within the Space Between Worlds, on a floating pile of rubble within the Void Sea, sits the Star Forge. There is no record of who built the Star Forge, or what its intention was. Perhaps just a strange random happenstance amongst the chaotic possibilities, or maybe a chunk of rock drawn in from some distant dimension, the Star Forge can harness the very fabric of arcane magic from the roiling cosmos of the Space Between Worlds and channel that into the gear made within it. For those seeking to harness unimaginable power into their creations, journeying into the Space Between Worlds and seeking out this forge is one of the few known paths to creating such potent items. Getting there is nearly impossible, and is only half the problem, for firing up the forge draws the attention of all number of eldritch beings, who feed on the raw arcana that flow into the forge. One must survive the onslaught long enough to finish their gear, and then escape with it.</p>\n\n<h2>Workshop Quests</h2>\n\n<p>Locating a suitable Workshop can be a quest all on its own. However, a Game Master may wish to add an additional complication or problem:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The Workshop's power source has been damaged or stolen, and the characters must retrieve a replacement and conduct necessary repairs.</li>\n  <li>The Workshop has run out of raw materials or fuel. For example, a dwarven forge relied on a nearby iron mine which has been overrun by monsters, or bandits raided the supply caravans supplying alchemical materials for an apothecaries' lab. The characters must recover the Components or deal with the issue before the Workshop can be used.</li>\n  <li>The Workshop is owned or run by a powerful individual or faction who will not allow the characters to use it until they complete a mission to prove their worthiness or demonstrate their capabilities.</li>\n</ul>"

Set the pace appropriate for the campaign and the part of the narrative: it's fine for the characters to spend an hour making the item, or a day. An extended period of downtime isn't necessary: this system makes the characters take an active role collecting the Components, Schematics, and crafting Workshop rather than downtime and gold.</p>\n\n<h2>Interlopers!</h2>\n\n<p>At your option, characters crafting a Legendary magic item may have to do battle against invaders seeking to stop them in the process! This can make for a fun and climatic end to an adventure arc.</p>\n\n<p>Doing so is a simple skill challenge: completing the magic item requires the characters spend a number of actions to finish the item.</p>\n\n<p>Each round, magical invaders, such as elementals, outsiders, demons, or spirits, appear to try to stop the characters completing the item. They won't relent until the item is finished.</p>"

A few highborn houses have been ruled by vampires for centuries, their family leaders gifted with undead immortality yet cursed with sanguine cravings. Secretly preying upon their mortal subjects whilst concealing their undead nature from their noble peers, these vampire lords have in turn transformed their heirs, lieutenants, courtesans, and staff into obedient spawn to secure their lineage and loyalty.\n</p>\n\n<p>Yet their dark ambitions do not end there, for the vampire aristocrats desire complete control and total domination over the people of the continent. Together, thirteen vampire-ruled noble houses established a sinister cabal and shadow government collectively known as the Court of the Night, a shadowy alliance that aims to influence and manipulate political affairs and eventually seize power. The Court of the Night works in the shadows, pulling noble puppet strings across the continent. Originally founded in the kingdom of Westemär, the Court of the Night's influence has spread, infiltrating the noble ranks of neighboring lands such as Caspia and Elyria.</p>\n\n<p>The elusive vampires have managed to keep their plot undiscovered for hundreds of years. During this time, however, a few amongst the court and even entire vampire households have been exposed — sometimes by intrepid monster hunters, other times by the devout paladins of the Silver Order, or occasionally by the mages of the Amethyst Academy, or astute mortal nobles. While many exposed vampires have been eradicated, others have managed to escape and reestablish themselves elsewhere under new identities.</p>\n\n<p>The few mortals who have come dangerously close to unraveling the full extent of the vampire conspiracy have faced grim fates. Some have disappeared without a trace, swallowed by the shadows that cloak the Court of the Night's operations. These unfortunate souls stumbled too deep into the vampires' secrets, provoking a lethal response to ensure their silence. Others, however, suffer a fate arguably worse than death: they are captured and transformed into thralls by the vampires. Stripped of their will and enslaved, these thralls serve their vampire masters, their former lives obliterated by vampiric compulsion and dark magic. This sinister practice ensures not only the continuation of the vampire's secrecy but also a sadistic reinforcement of their dominance over humans.</p>\n\n<p>However, within the secretive bounds of the Court of the Night, an atmosphere of constant suspicion and ambition breeds endless betrayal and intrigue. The vampire households, each led by ancient and cunning undead lords, vie fiercely for influence and control. Alliances are as fleeting as they are strategic, formed to stabilize power or to execute swift betrayals when advantageous. The stakes of this internal power struggle are exceedingly high, as supremacy within the Court can grant unparalleled control over both the vampire and human realms. These internal conflicts often manifest in covert sabotages, assassinations, and intricate plots that further complicate the dynamics within the Court, making the hierarchy within this shadow government both volatile and deadly.</p>\n\n<h2>Vampiric Origins</h2>\n\n<p>Legends claim the vampiric curse first fell upon mortals who, hungry to extend their own lives, fed upon other's life essence through sanguine rites. Though they attained their coveted power and immortality, these first vampires were forever banished to the shadows for their dark predations. Ancient stories amongst those who keep the Old Faith attribute the curse to the fickle goddesses Morrigan, who laid the punishment upon heretical druids blasphemously seeking immortality in her name. Amongst the Faith of the Sacred Flame, vampirism represents a twisted and fallen soul utterly consumed by darkness and bloody impulses, one so completely shunned by the light they are destroyed by its very presence.</p>\n\n<p>Though vampirism is unquestionably a curse, it is one that brings great power through unnatural abilities. As such, ambitious mortals have themselves often sought out the curse willingly. Unscrupulous warlocks have made dark pacts with demonic entities and become vampires in the process. Indeed, the tyrannical Sorcerer-Kings were masters of blood magic, wielding dark power to imbue their bloodlines with draconic and fiendish lineages. Many amongst them sought to establish an eternal empire through some form of immortality. Academy scholars speculate that several Sorcerer-Kings attained undeath through vampirism or lichdom, though their dreams of everlasting rule ended in betrayal by their own rivals.</p>\n\n<p>As the Faith of the Sacred Flame rose in Elyria, these vampires and surviving blood mages fled its spreading light for other lands where they could more safely hide in the shadows. Meanwhile, in the deep forests of the lands which would one day become Westemär, descendants of the druids cursed by Morrigan still practiced their sanguine rites in secret, until a bloodthirsty ruler emerged who sought their cursed power for himself.</p>\n\n<p>The legendary Vladimir von Drakken was a peerless swordman and ruthless warlord born in the late sixth century, who forged the nation of Westemär through bloody conquest over three decades of brutal invasion. Vladimir von Drakken carved a gore-streaked path through his neighbors and built a kingdom born out of genocidal massacres and brutal subjugation. He established himself as the Lord of Castle Drakken, naming Drakkenheim for his household. History tells that Vladimir von Drakken ruled as a despot and had imperial ambitions upon his neighbors in Elyria and Caspia. However, he was cut down by his rebellious daughter, Carmen, who succeeded her father's throne. While sensational stories about Vladimir von Drakken's bloodthirsty nature are scrawled into the margins of history, no records remain that tell the full story: Vladimir von Drakken was in fact a powerful ascendant vampire.</p>\n\n<p>Two decades into his conquests, Vladimir von Drakken became paranoid that he would be betrayed and usurped by one of his lieutenants, or worse, by one of his own family members. Fearing his own death most of all, he sought out forbidden magic to grant him power and immortality. He found it in the form of vampirism. Deep within the Brachenwald, he was transformed in an unholy ritual known as the Sanguine Rite.</p>\n\n<p>When he returned to Castle Drakken, Vladimir von Drakken turned his vassals into vampire spawn so that none could ever stand against him, holding them as thralls in his Court of the Night Over the next ten years, he continued his cruel and merciless campaign to dominate the lands of Westemär and beyond. Although he was struck down by his daughter, many members of his Court of the Night survived to carry on his legacy.</p>\n\n<h2>Calling of the Court</h2>\n\n<p>Originally comprised by the surviving vampiric vassals and lieutenants of Vladimir von Drakken, the court has grown over the centuries, both in power and influence, silently manipulating events and entities from behind the scenes as its members dispersed themselves across the continent.</p>\n\n<p>Once every thirteen years, a malevolent meeting of the Court of the Night is held. During the founding decades of the Court, the families gathered in the Brachenwald of Westemär, at the ancient grove where the Druids of Morrigan transformed Vladimir von Drakken into a vampire. However, a more organized and central location space was needed as the vampiric court grew and the families spread throughout the continent and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the secret meeting is held in the heart of the Free City of Liberio at Rossovino Manor. The cosmopolitan port and independent city-state is located on the Middle Sea, and represents a melting pot between the major nations of the continent. Given its inherent bustle of travel and trade, Liberio is no stranger to fantastic sights and sounds. Visitors from faraway places, mages, and all sorts of strange folk and adventurous types gather in the democratic city. Vampires can easily conceal their presence here and find no shortage of activities or appetizers during the warm nights in Liberio.</p>\n\n<p>Each vampire family dispatches a delegation to attend once every thirteen years to discuss the next steps for the court. Though they often send grand contingents of vampires, spawn, and thralls, each family chooses two representatives to speak on their behalf. The vampires meet for nights, punctuated with dark revelry, macabre masquerades, and grisly feats which stretch into the long hours of the night. During these events, the vampires openly discuss their plots, their triumphs, their struggles, and how their goals may further the Court of the Night's longevity and prosperity. They review their plots and deception for their continued infiltration of the Mortal World.</p>\n\n<p>Amongst the vampires, the Calling of the Court is a neutral ground, where all families must put aside infighting, backstabbing, past betrayals, and schemes against each other under penalty of true death. Yet, the vampires are conniving and clever — the Calling of the Court is the time to strengthen their shared goals and gain the support they need. If a rival or two can be eliminated before or after the gathering itself… so much the better.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.147imghtbornunde inline]\n\n<h2>Vampiric Ideologies</h2>\n\n<p>Although to mortal eyes the Court of the Night appears to be a united faction, in truth, the vampiric nobility is deeply divided internally. Amongst their number have emerged three competing ideologies.</p>\n\n<h3>Resurrectionists</h3>\n\n<p>Steadfast in their oaths of eternal fealty to Vladimir von Drakken, the Resurrectionists plot nothing more than the return of the legendary vampire. Keepers of lore and ancient artifacts, the Resurrectionists are the most reclusive. They dream of the return of the mighty vampire lord, when he will bathe the world in blood and establish a true empire of the night, where mortals are lorded over like livestock to feed the ambition and power of the vampiric nobility.</p>\n\n<h3>Inheritors</h3>\n\n<p>The Inheritors arose in response to the slow and ponderous pace of the Resurrectionists plans. Impatient to await a long-dead lord of the night to return and command them, the Inheritors seek to claim the legacy of Vladimir von Drakken for themselves. Instead of returning the dread lord to power, each Inheritor instead dreams of usurping the might of the Vampire King for themselves. The Inheritors are a fractious and scheming organization. Each member ultimately wishes to rise in power over their peers, and so their grand plans are often fraught with subterfuge and sabotage.</p>\n\n<h3>Libertines</h3>\n\n<p>Growing in power and influence amongst the Court of the Night are a contingent of vampire lords who reject both the old ways of the Resurrectionists, and the scheming politics of the Inheritors. Instead, the Libertines seek to live out their undeath with lavish decadence and unholy debauchery, unfettered by the morals and responsibilities of mortal life. They crave wealth and power only because it fuels and supports their existence of excess. Avarice, lust, and pride prompts the Libertines to defend themselves and their holdings, often using the mortals they live so easily among to do their bidding.</p>\n\n<h2>Vampire Strains</h2>\n\n<p>There exist three main strains of vampiric affliction and two sub-strains. Each cause different physical manifestations and behavioral impulses, while granting diverse vampiric abilities. All three strains are present in the Court of the Night; typically, all the members of a household possess the same strain, though the strains occasionally mingle amongst one another and many courts and houses contain vampires from different strains.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of their strain, all vampires possess the same classic vampire weakness: vulnerability to sunlight.</p>\n\n<h3>Vampyre</h3>\n\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The regal vampire standing before you scoffs and smiles devilishly as its fangs protrude. Its eyes take on a crimson hue as it gracefully lifts into the air, hovering slowly towards you, its cape billowing behind it. The well-dressed noble who stood before you is gone, now revealing its true form: that of a hungry vampire.</p>\n\n<p>The Vampyre consider themselves the purest descendants of Vladimir von Drakken, believing they were crafted in his perfect image. They appear almost humanoid until they choose to reveal themselves and are the most well equipped for infiltrating human settlements. With their charm and wit, they blend in by standing out, becoming important members of the communities they intend to take over. Like a parasite, they infiltrate, spread, and devour until they have claimed the entire settlement, leaving behind a husk now filled with an undead army bent to the will of the vampiric family.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the Vampyrs are positioned as powerful nobles in some of the greatest cities on the continent, and through them the Court of the Night has eyes and ears in every major decision, plot, or scheme made throughout the continent. Unbeknownst to the vast majority, the Vampyre are everywhere, leading the Court of the Night in their efforts for complete domination.</p>\n\n<p>This is the most common and well-known strain of vampirism, the Vampyre are often represented by the game statistics for @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.DDO9lDCDtNHkfShP]{Vampires} found in the Core Rules. These vampires appear as regular humans with sullen and pallid flesh, sharpened features, crimson-hued eyes, and sharp fangs that they use to feed on blood. They possess greatly enhanced physical endurance, strength, speed, and intellect thanks to their vampiric curse. Their subtle and easily concealed features allow most Vampyres to blend in with mortal society. Many Vampyres consider themselves the most pure and refined of their kind, and many claim to be blood-borne descendants from Vladimir von Drakken, meaning they were transformed by the legendary vampire personally or turned by another vampire who can trace their own vampiric lineage back to Vladimir von Drakken.</p>\n\n<p>The Vampyre are at the forefront of the Court of the Night's infiltration of civilization. They lurk in the shadows of established communities, pulling the strings in major cities throughout the continent. Using their cunning illusion and wit, the Vampyre have masterfully built a network of noble vampires leading the court in their goals of bringing about a revolution of blood.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.148imghtbornunde inline]\n\n<h3>Nosferatu</h3>\n\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The creature before you is humanoid in shape, appearing almost elven; they are slender and tall, with pointed ears. However, their complexion is sickly pale, and their sunken back crimson eyes give their gaunt face an almost skeletal appearance. Their fingers are gnarled elongated and end in dirty clawed nails. As the creature opens its mouths, its teeth are all fine points, razor sharp.</p>\n\n<p>Amongst the Druids of the Old God Morrigan, several heretical sects emerged in ancient days, their origins shrouded in blood magic and sanguine rituals. These blood-drinking druids used magic to prolong their life indefinitely. They developed the vampiric curse that they shared amongst their small circles in the deep wilderness of the Brachenwald.</p>\n\n<p>The Nosferatu are the descendants of these first druidic vampire cults. Over the centuries of blood drinking and sunlight aversion, they have developed extremely gaunt features, sunken eyes, and often skeletal appearances, pointed ears, and their teeth are all sharpened fangs.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike their vampiric cousins, they cannot be killed by piercing the heart. They cannot enter a home without permission, cross a stream of running water, and are cursed to never see daylight again. More than most vampires, however, daylight destroys them almost instantly, so the Nosferatu tend to stick to shadows and dark places more than most.</p>\n\n<h4>Nosferatu Traits</h4>\n\n<p>Any vampire from the Nosferatu strain has the following traits.</p>\n\nAdd missing features\n\n<h3>Vrykolakas</h3>\n\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">The beast before you is half man and half bat. Its bald head has two bat-like ears and beady red eyes above a snout and a fanged mouth. It walks in a hunched gaunt, sometimes pulling itself forward on its burly forearms with long taloned claws, while its legs are shorter with wide-set clawed feet.</p>\n\n<p>These monstrous vampires have taken on the bat-like qualities of vampirism to a place where they are no longer recognizable as humanoid. They still speak, walk, and carry themselves as well as other vampires, but their demeanor tends to be more ravenous and enraged. Rather than drinking blood, the Vrykolakas vampires gain their energy by consuming living flesh. They are more prone to outwardly attack their prey, and feast upon them while they scream.</p>\n\n<p>The Vrykolakas vampires hunt in packs, and rather than hide themselves with illusions, they live in secluded castles and remote isolated caves. They sweep into small farming communities and villages in the dead of long winter nights and devour every living creature they find. There are some reports of entire communities going missing overnight, with nothing left but blood splatters in the snow.</p>\n\n<p>The Vrykolakas vampires will change their appearance to appear as more humanoid when engaging in affairs with non vampires, but prefer their more animalistic appearance when they are on the hunt.</p>\n\n<p>These vampires developed from a twisted form of undeath. The vampiric curse creates an eternal hunger for mortal blood, and a vampire who does not feed regularly develops more monstrous qualities over time. The Vrykolakas developed over years of starvation amongst sects of vampires, and as they became more twisted forms, the vampire spawn they would produce carried that hunger, and developed a taste for raw flesh, and could not come back from their monstrous nature.</p>\n\n<h4>Vrykolakas Traits</h4>\n\n<p>Any vampire from the Vrykolakas strain has the following traits.</p>\n\nAdd missing features\n\n<h3>Spawn</h3>\n\n<p>These lesser vampires use the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.zpaZb7I8alY32vWV]{Vampire Spawn} game statistics from the Core Rules. Vampire spawn are intermediate, they are under the control of the vampire who created them, but not yet granted full independence from their master. However, many develop unique abilities to fulfill their roles. The Crimson Knight, Dark Confessor, Grim Custodian, Night Blade, and Sanguine Witch all represent vampire spawn with specialized capabilities used to achieve their master's goals.</p>\n\n<p>A vampire spawn becomes a full-strain vampire when they can partake in the blood of a full-blooded vampire. Often this is a gift granted by their own creator, and these stray spawn are often led to believe that only the blood of their creator can grant them their full vampiric powers. However, this is not the case: consuming the blood of any vampire will accomplish complete the transformation. A vampire spawn whose master is destroyed regains their autonomy but does not become a full-strain vampire.</p>\n\n<h3>Ascendant Vampire</h3>\n\n<p>Legend claims that a fourth strain of vampirism exists: the Ascendant Vampire. This mighty form is supposedly granted vast power encompassing all three lesser strains. Furthermore, it is claimed that such a vampire could walk unharmed in the light of the sun, and that their every word is a command to any other vampire. Members of the Court of the Night know this is no mere legend; Vladimir von Drakken was the first, and thus far, only vampire to gain this power. None since have been able to attain this form, though many have sought it over the centuries.</p>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote parchment\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>These monsters have a face only my blade could love.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.149imghtbornunde inline]\n\n<h2>Vampire Families</h2>\n\n<p>The Court of the Night was founded by thirteen vampiric noble houses. Although some of these families have been uncovered, and in some cases eradicated, the dead houses' legacy lives on through vassals and thralls. The remaining families all hold positions of importance within the current political landscape of the continent, and unbeknownst to the wider world, are subtly manipulating the ebb and flow of power within the continent. In addition, several lesser families have sprung up over the centuries as a vassals in service or cadet branches of a higher household.</p>\n\n<h3>House Kleinkessel</h3>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Head Vampire:</strong> Constance Kleinkessel</p>\n  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Kesselholm, Westemär</p>\n  <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Inheritor</p>\n  <p><strong>Strain: </strong>Vampyre</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>House Kleinkessel is a cadet branch of House von Kessel, who were in turn themselves distant descendants of House von Drakken. The household formed shortly after Helena I von Kessel took the throne to separate the royal household from their extended family in matters of succession. Nevertheless, the Kleinkessels have perhaps one of the stronger claims to the throne of Westemär since they can trace their ancestry back to Helena I. In fact, when the main House von Kessel line ended during the Civil War, they took up the royal family's ancestral castle in Kesselholm.</p>\n\n<p>Constance Kleinkessel is in fact the sister of Helena I. Originally known as Camilla von Kessel, she has passed through a series of identities to hide her vampiric nature. Every few decades, she marries a hapless nobleman, slowly draining his life force so that he appears to expire from old age. Shortly thereafter, her so-called daughter inherits the estate and the cycle continues. During the Civil War, Constance Kleinkessel used her vampiric abilities to manipulate and scheme alongside Cecilia von Kessel and Lord Commander Elias Drexel to plot the murder of Mannfred von Kessel. She had planned to follow through and murder her co-conspirators, but the subsequent death of Cecilia von Kessel was an unexpected development. Constance had been planning to target Cecilia's future children with her replacement scheme to seize the throne of Westemär.</p>\n\n<p>Constance also witnessed the impact of delerium firsthand when a fleeing family of vampires came to her for help after the meteor fell. Impressed by its potency and effects on vampiric blood, but disheartened by the negative impact it had, she began studying the strange rocks, buying delerium in large quantities and experimenting on her lesser thralls, attempting to make a new breed of vampire. Her creation, she hopes, would be strong enough to rise above all the others.</p>\n\n<p>Since undead creatures are not immune to the effects of delerium contamination, Constance Kleinkessel befriended and made close alliances with her Apothecary, the malfeasant wizard and mad chemist Deidrick Mors. Since then, they have been creating an army of delerium-infused vampires in secret in the chambers under Kesselholm Keep.</p>\n\n<h3>House Crossbruke</h3>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Head Vampire:</strong> Viktor Crossbruke</p>\n  <p><strong>Location: </strong>Drakkenheim, Westemär</p>\n  <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Resurrectionist</p>\n  <p><strong>Strain:</strong> Nosferatu</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Baron Viktor Crossbruke was a steadfast captain who served Vladimir von Drakken in life, and was among the first of Vladimir von Drakken's vampire spawn, and among the first the Ascendant Vampire granted the boon of full-strain vampirism. Victor Crossbruke survived Carmen von Drakken's rebellion against her father, and was instrumental in securing Vlad's remains in the aftermath. He has been dedicated to the cause of restoring his old master ever since.</p>\n\n<p>Viktor founded the village of Crossbruke four miles southwest of Drakkenheim. After Vladamir was struck down, he quietly secluded himself into a life managing the sleepy village. When the city of Drakkenheim was destroyed, much of the surrounding area was left a corrupted landscape. The farmland all withered and died, the weather turned into a constant overcast gray, and daily rainfall on dead crops meant there was little left for those within several miles of the cursed city.</p>\n\n<p>The village of Crossbruke was assumed to be abandoned. The ghost town, however, was not. Viktor seized the opportunity to transform Crossbruke's villagers into vampires and other undead in the aftermath of the fall of Drakkenheim. He maintained the illusion by traveling to Drakkenheim and meeting with Elias Drexel of the Hooded Lanterns. Viktor desired to remain in the town of his namesake, and offered it to the Hooded Lanterns as a meeting point and supply chain. Crossbruke served as a military camp where Hooded Lanterns could stop for the night before bringing wagons of food, water, armaments, and other supplies to Drakkenheim. Viktor was also a prominent benefactor in the multiple Hooded Lantern expeditions into the city, and remains their primary noble contributor.</p>\n\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns have a saying amongst their ranks: Crossbruke Quitters. The first task of a new recruit is always to be stationed in Crossbruke to see that the trade route remains open, and to do counts of goods passing through. It's common that amongst every batch of new recruits, a handful of them do not last the first week. They disappear without a word in the middle of the night, assumed to have abandoned their post in the dreary town, unable to cut it for what it means to be a Lantern. What the Lanterns do not know is that the recruits never leave. They are taken in the night by the vampires hiding in the shadows and turned into thralls or undead servants for Viktor's secret undead army.</p>\n\n<h3>House Jovovich</h3>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Head Vampire:</strong> Carina Jovovich</p>\n  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Duelcross, Caspia</p>\n  <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Inheritor</p>\n  <p><strong>Strain:</strong> Vampyre</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>As vassals of House Joplin, the Jovovich name has been held in high regard in Caspia for some time. Never as notable as the six great houses, the Jovovichs were a small noble house who bided their time to rise to power. The former marquis, Revati Jordan, held the position in Duelcross for seventy years. In that time, Revati had six children, which were assumed to carry on her legacy. In her fading years, Carina Jovovich befriended Revati and the two became very close. In the time they spent together, Revati began to fall ill. The children grew suspicious of Carina, who encouraged them to keep their distance, and she would tend to their mother's needs as she passed. In the final days, the children report Revati spoke as if possessed. They said she stopped sounding and acting like herself. When she passed, she left everything to Carina. Her wealth, her house, and her servants all went to Carina — the children were left with nothing.</p>\n\n<p>The Jovovich children promptly began an investigation into Carina, believing she somehow fooled their mother into leaving her the family's wealth. Strangely, all six children passed away from illness within the next year and the Jovovich family became one of the most powerful lesser houses in all of Caspia. In truth, the children are alive as thralls, chained up in Carina's dungeons below her castle, where they are used as a supply of blood for her and her other thralls. She controlled and manipulated Revati and fed on her until she died, combining the two families' wealth ensured the Jovoviches a position of power in Caspia. Along with her ties to the Joplin household, Carina Jovovich may very well be one of the most influential people in the nation.</p>\n\n<h3>House Devero</h3>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Head Vampire: </strong>Gorman Devero</p>\n  <p><strong>Location: </strong>Geldstadt, Westemär</p>\n  <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Libertine</p>\n  <p><strong>Strain:</strong> Vrykolakas</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The Devero family acquired great wealth during the Glimmer Mountain gold rush and established themselves in Geldstadt as a prominent noble house. Their riverside manor is known as the wealthiest and most opulent house in an already wealthy city. Known for collecting rare artifacts, and old tomes, the house is somewhat a museum of ancient literature and historical antiques. The walls are lined with world renowned paintings. Four times a year, Gorman opens his house to the public, allowing paid tours where he boasts about the history of the items in his collection.</p>\n\n<p>The Devero family also were early investors in Altbruke University, and one of the main study halls is named after them. Many Devero, and their cadet branch the Veers, have studied at Altbruke, becoming some of the most renowned apothecaries in the continent. Few would guess the deep connections the court has in the study of alchemy, and the few renowned vampiric apothecaries that operate in secret.</p>\n\n<p>Through the centuries of his family's longevity, Gorman has managed to acquire nearly half the land in Geldstadt, and now the main strip of shops, studios, taverns, and inns all pay high rent to the Devero family for the privilege of being on the main road in the wealthiest city in Westemär. Because the Devero's own so much of the land, they do not need to be invited in to prey on their tenants. Rumors amass among the shop owners and late night talks at the Inns of bats in the city, and people seeing figures standing over their beds in the middle of the night.</p>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote parchment\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Usually I love a free meal, but these are family dinners I'd rather not be part of.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<h3>House Wolfenbach</h3>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Head Vampire:</strong> Winchester Wolfenbach</p>\n  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Drannsmund, Westemär</p>\n  <p><strong>Ideology: </strong>Inheritor</p>\n  <p><strong>Strain:</strong> Nosferatu</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Vassals of House von Baden, House Wolfenbach have held their position in the city of Drannsmund for some time. Known as elite sea captains, their vessel the Crimson Fang sails the Crystal Coast, fending off raiders from Skye.</p>\n\n<p>Unknown to the people of Drannsmund, the ship raises a different flag, one of blood-soaked teeth instead of Drannsmund's crest. House Wolfenbach defeated a fleet of raiders from Skye some years ago and reanimated them, using them as their proxy crews. These undead warriors now crew a fleet of ships who stay out at sea, away from the eyes of the city. They are known to send their ships down as far as the Elyrian coast to plunder seaside villages, and none realize the connection the house has to Drannsmund.</p>\n\n<p>They also have established a cadet branch in Skye and have raided many small villages within the island, claiming the forgotten villages as towns of undead. Winchester Wolfenbach hopes to raise an undead fleet that could sail the oceans and conquer the world. Winchester believes himself the true inheritor of the power of Vladimir von Drakken—where Vladimir failed, Winchester will not.</p>\n\n<h3>House Graveworth</h3>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Head Vampire: </strong>Corbin Graveworth</p>\n  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Dregden's Ferry, The Eastern Vale</p>\n  <p><strong>Ideology: </strong>Libertine</p>\n  <p><strong>Strain:</strong> Vrykolakas</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>House Graveworth is an ancient bloodline that does not partake in the typical schemes of the Court of the Night. They are more monstrous in appearance due to the Vrykolakas strain, and do very little to hide their traits. Rather than infiltrating a community and sneaking in the shadows, the Graveworth family have an old castle deep in the woods north of Dregden's Ferry. There they rule over the wilds, hunting loggers, miners, hunters, and travelers heading along the Dawnbreaker trail. They only use illusions to disguise themselves as regular humanoids when they need to enter a town to meet with other vampires, such as attending the Court of the Night, and only ever when in public. They drop their guises whenever they can, feeling like hiding themselves is a mark of shame amongst the vampires, and that their form is perfect as it is.</p>\n\n<p>The monsters of the Iron Woods are now a folktale passed around the Eastern Vale, and many steer clear of the woods after sunset. But there are always those who venture too deep or get lost in the thick pines and muddy grounds. Those who dwell too late are often never heard from again.</p>\n\n<h3>House Rossovino</h3>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Head Vampire: </strong>Dmitri and Darya Rossovino</p>\n  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Liberio</p>\n  <p><strong>Ideology: </strong>Resurrectionist</p>\n  <p><strong>Strain:</strong> Vampyre</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The only known halfling family of vampires, House Rossovino descends from Milos Rossovino, the steward who loyally served Vladimir von Drakken. After Vladimir's fall, the Rossovino family made its way to Liberio, establishing themselves as wealthy moneylenders, bankers, and benefactors of arts and culture. They quickly became well known nobles in Liberio, accumulating incredible wealth and building a manor house rivaling most kings on the continent. Yet these efforts are not for vanity or personal power, as the Rossovinos command considerable power amongst the Court of the Night and have led the efforts to resurrect Vladimir von Drakken. To further collaboration between the vampire houses, the Rossovinos constructed a massive secret auditorium below their manor where the Court of the Night gathers once every thirteen years.</p>\n\n<p>Those who borrow money from them and fail to pay it back in time mysteriously go missing in the night, often ending up as thralls working in the secret depths of the Rossovino manor. They use their manor home as a lush museum for ancient art and old artifacts, and no one questions a rich halfling family of bankers collecting old tomes and art, but really, they are searching for relics that can aid in their plots and bring about vampiric domination.</p>\n\n<h3>House Crane</h3>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Head Vampire: </strong>Isobel Crane</p>\n  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Lumen, Elyria</p>\n  <p><strong>Ideology:</strong> Libertine</p>\n  <p><strong>Strain:</strong> Nosferatu</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>House Crane is the only surviving vampiric family in Elyria, and notably stand apart from their rivals in the Court of the Night: the family is deeply committed to tenets of the Sacred Flame in spite of their cursed nature. Forming their own shadowy cult, the family's strange faith preaches that darkness and light exist together in careful balance, and that through blood, both shadow and flame coalesce into transcendence. They revere undead creatures as holy guardians whose role is to safeguard life from otherworldly and demonic forces which aim to utterly destroy it. Their cult attracts mortal followers who partake in so-called sacred rituals in secret chapels where they willingly offer a blood-tithe to a vampire-priest, teaching that this is a sacred offering which shows respect for the great curse and responsibility borne by undead who protect the living. Their agents operate throughout Elyria as the secret Society of the Bat, aiming to convince other undead creatures to take up their purportedly noble cause. Although House Crane's goals are noble-minded, their peers on the Courts of the Night tolerate their strange religion since it still situates undead as the masters over mortals.</p>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote parchment\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Too many family names to remember, I have a hard enough time remembering the 6 Caspian Houses.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>"

It is not unheard for lower vampires to dwell in abandoned homes or secluded caves. But more often vampires attempt to spend their years acquiring great wealth and working their way to the higher positions of societies. Noble houses, manors, and castles are all common places for a vampire to make their home. Many of the locations of the Court of the Night are a complete mystery. It stands to reason that nearly any lonely castle, secluded town, misty fishing village, or abandoned home could be a space for nighttime rituals, dark offerings, and secret meetings amongst vampiric nobility.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Service of the Dead</h2>\n\n<p>A vampire's first order of business is to clean house once they have acquired a suitable castle or manor house. This usually involves draining the blood of the staff, guards, and any other people who frequent the castle. Instead turning them into thralls, knights, or assassins. A vampire castle is usually occupied by multiple forms of undead. Sometimes skeletons or zombies can perform menial tasks. More intelligent and human-looking thralls provide the vampires eyes and ears in the surrounding towns, and allow them to keep the guise of normalcy throughout the castle.</p>\n\n<h2>Illusions Hide Decay</h2>\n\n<p>Often vampires will use powerful illusion magic to hide the blood, refuse, and general disarray of their homes. They may even disguise themselves or their staff with illusion magic to ensure they appear as normal as possible. Vampires are all about trickery, charm, and deceit, and will use any magic at their disposal to ensure their secret remains hidden from the public. Those who happen to see through the disguises are often moments from joining the ranks of the vampire's thralls themselves.</p>\n\n<h2>Treasures and Trinkets</h2>\n\n<p>A vampire's castle is often filled with opulent and ornate decorative treasure. Fine rugs, unique paintings, rare books and tomes, vases, statues, and jewelry. With their long lifespans they tend to acquire wealth and are avid collectors of items that few mortals would be able to obtain in a single lifetime.</p>\n\n<h2>Known Lairs</h2>\n\n<p>Vampires of all sorts can be found throughout Westemär, with several families stretching into Caspia and Elyria. The most prominent name associated with the Court of the Night is House von Drakken. Although it is rumored that it has seeped into other noble names as well.</p>\n\n<h3>Rossovino Manor</h3>\n\n<p>When the Court of the Night is called to meet, they gather at Rossovino Manor in the Free City of Liberio. Located in the hilltops outside the city proper, when Rossovino Manor was constructed nearly 250 years ago, it was among the largest estates in the region. Now, the manor sits inconspicuously among many grand villas in the countryside near Liberio, able to keep its secrets without drawing any unwanted attention. The sight of several black carriages drawing up to it once every thirteen years is thought no stranger than any of the galas, balls, or parties thrown by their wealthy neighbors. Indeed, the Rossovinos are a well-regarded house who play host to many gatherings. The meeting of the Court of the Night is a wonderful opportunity to invite some of their mortal peers to join the exclusive society.</p>\n\n<p>Deep below the sprawling estate lies a secret dungeon accessed via the great library. Playing the right notes on a baroque piano (a specific chord known well to children of the night: G F# B E) causes the back wall of a massive fireplace to open into a stone staircase that spirals down. There, a vaulted chamber houses a great auditorium which can fit a hundred guests. Round tables with lavish chairs fill the chamber, decorative skull-adorned chandeliers hang from the high ceiling, and ancient flags bearing the thirteen family crests line the gray stone walls. A hundred candles and torches alight with everlasting magical flames flicker and illuminate the room, and a large stage and podium sit at the far end with crimson curtains set behind it. The feasts are supplied by a wine-cellar stocked with blood wine and a pantry filled with preserved hearts, with the many bottles labeled like vintages of the year it was bottled and the surname of the mortal who provided it. Appropriately, the high rafters house several bats that flitter about and add to the macabre atmosphere. It is here in this dark chamber that the Court of the Night holds its midnight seances.</p>\n\n<h3>Brachenwald Grove</h3>\n\n<p>This ancient grove is the place where the dark druids of Morrigan performed the Sanguine Rite on Vladimir von Drakken. In the depths of the forest is a place where the thick trees create a canopy over an old grove. No sunlight penetrates through the old branches. There, nestled between moss-caked cliffs, is a circle of standing stones. They rise up out of the earth covered in ancient symbols and dried blood. Thorny, blood-red vines wrap around them and twist like veins through the grove. In the central clearing is an old stone tablet set out like a stage, covered in splashes of blood. A series of caves along the cliff faces are makeshift hovels for druids to sleep and rest.</p>\n\n<h3>Kesselholm</h3>\n\n<p>The city of Kesselholm has recently fallen victim to a curse. The castle staff don't seem to be present during the day. No one sees the nobility anymore, many townsfolk are complaining of strange nightmares, and odd shapes in the dark. The Kleinkessels rule over Kesselholm as a cadet branch of House von Kessel, which itself has ties to the von Drakkens. So naturally there are rumors abound on the possible cause of all these mysteries.</p>\n\n<h3>Crossbruke Castle</h3>\n\n<p>The lonely castle sits atop a hill in the ghost town of Crossbruke. A dark husk of its former glory, the dark and dreary keep lays decaying in the decrepit, rain-soaked village. The town itself is mostly deserted, save for a Hooded Lanterns encampment on the edge where a series of reinforced houses and an old barn form a makeshift military outpost. A line of wagons carrying goods and cargo to Drakkenheim are hitched while scouts survey and count the contents to ensure delivery to their comrades in Drakkenheim.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the small bonfire the Lanterns keep, the only other light in the town comes from the uppermost windows of the old castle, where the dim candlelight signifies Lord Crossbruke's presence. The town is prone to eerie noises, bats, and strange movements in the dark streets and hidden corners. Everyone who stays in Crossbruke describes a general feel of unease, and the itching sensation of being watched.</p>"

As the name implies, they are better suited to battles at night, or in the dark. They will seldom be foolish enough to fight outside during the day. Vampires are smart and have lived for centuries by not taking unneeded risks in battle. If they are discovered, and being hunted, they will draw the hunters to their castle, where their armies, minions, and dark corridors aid them. The vampire's thralls and soldiers create a slaughterhouse for those who believe they can face a vampire. If vampires fight in open military combat, they do so under moonlight.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Court of the Night seldom operates alone. The entire operation of the court is to infiltrate a community and turn as many key members of that community to their will as possible. This includes transforming priests, mages, nobles, and any others they can into vampires. These vampire lords create Crimson Knights from castle guards, Sanguine Witches of court mages, Night Blades from assassins, Grim Custodians of loyal house servants, and a Dark Confessor from local clergy. Vampiric nobles use these allies to incite a cult following to their cause, selecting any who wish to “ascend” into the ranks of being a vampire thrall. So, to face down a single Vampire Lord or Vampire Master, one must expect that they are facing an entire entourage of vampiric figures, complete with their own networks of thralls, cultists, and minions.</p>\n\n<aside>\n  <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n    <h1>Vampire Weaknesses</h1>\n    <p>All vampires in this chapter have the below traits unless otherwise indicated, such as through their specific vampiric strain.</p>\n    <br />\n    @Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.features.Item.CEBSMkqk5uzhCYeZ inline]\n  </div>\n</aside>"

Vampires do not age or die like other mortals; vampires construct plots that capture power for centuries. Once a vampire has selected a place to rule, they begin feeding on the townsfolk. Most begin only feeding as needed, leaving victims alive with nothing more than bad nightmares and strange bite marks. The vampire may turn some into thralls and soldiers for their army, allowing them to keep more eyes and ears around the area. Eventually the vampire's insidious plot comes together and they become leaders in the area, often from castles bearing noble names.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Court of the Night does not stop at nobility. In many cases, as vampires seek to gain dominance over a settlement, their first task is to dismantle and control all pillars of a community. This means they create vampiric loyal servants of the castle stewards, the guard captains, even the Flamekeepers of the church, and court mages. If they can turn each known pillar of the community into a vampire, then there is nowhere for the townsfolk to turn that is not part of the expanding network of the Court of the Night.</p>\n\n<h2>Charming Hosts</h2>\n\n<p>Members of the Court of the Night conceal their undead nature from their mortal peers through several means. Many establish themselves in remote fiefs, claiming backwater domains and distant castles where their isolation allows them to simply go unnoticed. They seldom treat with others, but carefully comply with their feudal obligations to their liege lords. Over time, they slowly manipulate and turn their household staff, family members, and vassals into their own thralls, leaving none in any position of power to expose or stand against them. Others instead prefer to use misdirection and trickery to integrate with mortal society in a more conventional manner as befits their noble station.</p>\n\n<p>Many vampires of the court hold lavish parties, open their castles to the public, and attempt to maintain a helpful and kind position in the community they inhabit. The more the people of their community look up to them, the easier time they have infiltrating it. They are charming and seductive, charismatic and powerful. Vampires carry themselves with a grandiose persona and have centuries of anecdotes, wit, and tales to weave into conversation.</p>\n\n<h2>Masters of Deception and Illusion</h2>\n\n<p>The Court of the Night maintains their position through powerful illusions, often kept in check by the court's Grim Custodians. They disguise their vampiric traits and hide the parts of their castles and manors that would give away their vampiric tendencies. The vampires weave such intricate lies and illusions that even a full on investigation of their homes, or a face-to-face study of one of the undead lords themselves, may reveal nothing out of the ordinary to those not sure where to look, or what to look for.</p>\n\n<p>Due to their undead immortality, vampires do not appear to age, cannot sire heirs, nor will their reign end upon expected natural deaths. This prompts many to rely on a clever scheme whereby they play the role of both ruler and heir apparent: pretending at some times to be one or the other. Then, at an appointed time, the heir appears to announce the “death” of their “parent” and take up the title as ruler. Thus, many</p>\n\n<p>Anyone that does that much business at night should be a suspect. When do they even get their beauty sleep?</p>\n\n<p>vampires have lived under several different names over the centuries, taking up a new identity every few decades as their own children or grandchildren to maintain the ruse of noble succession. Alternatively, some vampires opt to rule from the shadows, often appointing a favored thrall as a decoy or puppet for any meetings with mortal nobles.</p>\n\n<h2>Purveyors of Fine and Rare Items</h2>\n\n<p>With centuries of wealth and warfare under their belts, the Court of the Night often find themselves in noble positions. They enjoy these lifestyles of privilege and wealth, and take every opportunity to show off their collections of fine arts, tapestries, rugs, vases, weapons and armor, and anything else they have managed to procure in their long lifetimes.</p>\n\n<p>Some artifacts and symbols of wealth in a vampire's manor may include:</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.JUVMXHcEG1clUTk0 rollable]\n\n<h2>Vampiric Cravings</h2>\n\n<p>When a vampire grows hungry, they begin to manifest traits that may give them away to prying eyes. Vampires often try to be well fed when going out or engaging with mortals as to not reveal themselves. A hungry vampire who catches the scent of fresh mortal blood may begin to manifest certain attributes, including:</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.lt0n48ziFHpr2nF3 rollable]\n\n<h2>Common Vampire Roleplaying Traits</h2>\n\n<p>Giving your vampires roleplaying traits can help define what kind of vampire they are, and how they treat their allies and enemies.

This adventure hook lays the groundwork for an entire high-level campaign, and makes for a great potential follow up to a <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> campaign.</p>\n\n<p>None know for certain who taught the heretical druids of Morrigan the Sanguine Rite. Perhaps it was the Old God Morrigan herself, as her faithful often hold power over life and death, and trade knowledge and magic for blood and souls. Yet, the Druids of the Sanguine Rite are remembered as outcasts and blasphemers amongst many of Morrigan's worshippers even today, and so it's possible the knowledge they possessed came from another, darker source, an evil power that finds joy and mirth in death and the macabre: the demonic entity known as He Who Laughs Last.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the source, the Court of the Night has thus far failed to obtain knowledge of the Sanguine Rite. It's possible that the ritual may be taught again to a powerful individual who wins the favor of Morrigan or He Who Laughs Last, or instead the secrets of the ritual were indeed recorded. However, if written details of the Sanguine Rite do exist, they would be far flung and closely guarded — agents of the Court of the Night have sought them for centuries. A fragment may be held in the library of the Inscrutable Tower in Drakkenheim; another may have been sealed away by the Faith of the Sacred Flame; one key piece of text has been sequestered away to the Far Continent; and the final scraps of knowledge have been banished to another world entirely, drifting lost in the Shadowlands or the Space Between Worlds.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the cunning Court of the Night could seek out a competent band of adventurers to help them find these pieces, posing as double agents of a trusted faction, and falsely claiming the rite is used to prevent Vladimir von Drakken's return? It would be deliciously ironic indeed if among those adventurers were suitable sacrifices, or an unwitting descendant of Vladimir von Drakken…</p>\n\n<p>Along the way, a faction of Inheritor vampires seek to infiltrate the mission, usurping the knowledge to use for themselves. If the player characters fall for the ruse, they may just end up being the ones responsible for unleashing Vladimir von Drakken again!</p>\n\n<h2>Night Terrors</h2>\n\n<p>A local community living under the shadow of an old castle is complaining of several townsfolk having horrible nightmares, reporting demons standing over them in their sleep. The local guard and the priest seem to wave these stories away.</p>\n\n<h2>Army of Darkness</h2>\n\n<p>A neighboring town from where the party is based has been discovered to be entirely composed of vampires and their cultist minions. Knowing they have been found out, the locals are concerned that the army of vampires will march upon their home at the next full moon.</p>\n\n<h2>The Longest Night</h2>\n\n<p>A thrall has arrived in town and is being held at the local sheriff's office. He has come with a warning. That on the longest night of the year, in 3 days, his masters will be arriving to feast on the town.</p>\n\n<h2>Vampires in Drakkenheim</h2>\n\n<p>Rumors exist that a small family of vampires are operating out of the city of Drakkenheim, or possibly from a small nearby town. They are very keen to find a means of placing themselves on the throne and bring the corrupted city into a new age of blood and terror. Luckily the dangers of the city offer its own problems for anyone after the throne to overcome, even vampires seem unable to claim the city without help.</p>"

Countless inhabitants of Drakkenheim have suffered this horrible fate, transformed after the meteor fell. Others are fallen soldiers, lost adventurers, or faction agents who never escaped the ruins. Survivors and explorers often refer to these creatures as “wretches,” “unfortunates,” “the lost ones,” but they are most commonly known as Delerium Dregs.\n</p>\n\n<p>These monsters are hideously transfigured in both body and mind. They are trapped in a terrifying landscape filled with delusions and torment, left with only fragmented memories, unable to comprehend what has happened to them. Delerium Dregs have been driven mad by their transformations.</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally, a Delerium Dreg may still be recognizable to their friends and loved ones, but are so stricken with madness that little remains of their former personalities. Others have changed so much they bear no resemblance to their former selves, though most retain some humanoid features and body proportions. No matter how they ended up in this horrific form, they are doomed to wander the ruins, disorientation occasionally wavering into anguish, distress, or violent outbursts.Multitudinous Mutations</p>\n\n<p>No two Delerium Dregs are exactly alike, as all are transformed in chaotic and unpredictable ways. Their bodies sprout all manner of twisted limbs, spines, and bones. Their organs, muscles, and flesh are resculpted, their faces twisted painfully into terrifying visages. Nevertheless, there are several recognizable and relatively common variations which all express a differing degree of danger to those exploring Drakkenheim.</p>\n\n<p>Those who have studied eldritch contamination and mutations have theorized that certain factors may influence</p>\n\n<p>the types of mutations a contaminated individual may manifest. Perhaps the subject's physical or biological traits are the determining factor, especially in those who may already possess magical talents or who have been touched by arcane forces in some way. It may also be that the environment and conditions under which an individual gains Contamination affect the forms they develop, as Bloated Dregs appear more commonly near flooded regions, and Lambent Dregs are more common near the crater. It is also entirely possible it is all simply chaotic magic, and any patterns are mere coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, a Delerium Dreg continues to mutate with continued exposure to eldritch contamination. Over time, the typical Delerium Dreg described here may change into one of the other forms. However, these continued mutations may eventually cause their form to destabilize, transforming them into a Protean Abomination or Pyknic Maunder.</p>\n\n<h2>Warped Minds</h2>\n\n<p>While their new form may hold some uncanny resemblance to their original appearance, most often, a Delerium Dreg's mutations are so drastic and their behavior so radically altered that little trace is left of their former identity. Most Dregs wander Drakkenheim unfettered from reality and are easily provoked to violence.</p>\n\n<p>Experienced soldiers amongst the Hooded Lanterns have observed how Dregs passively follow one another. As they aimlessly roam the ruined streets, more stragglers and lone dregs join a group, which eventually gathers into a large crowd. While occasionally infighting or hostility breaks out within the throng, left unchecked in the city, Delerium Dregs slowly start to form massive mobs that clog the city streets.</p>\n\n<p>Hooded Lantern scouts have adamantly patrolled the western parts of the city near their barracks, slaying any small group of Dregs on sight. If they can keep their numbers down, it is less likely that uncontrollable swarms of them will gather. Dreg cleanup is one of the most harrowing duties for the Lanterns. More often than not, the Dregs in western Drakkenheim are fallen Lanterns, friends, or even family.</p>\n\n<p>Adventurers incorrectly believe Delerium Dregs are cannibalistic, driven to feed on flesh. All evidence suggests Delerium Dregs are physically sustained by the magic of the Haze. They do not need to eat or drink, and do not sleep. They do, however, need to breathe. Consequently, they do not consume the bodies of their victims; rather, they attack out of madness-induced aggression. As such, a Delerium Dreg won't be lured into a trap by meat and usually can't be bargained with using food.</p>\n\n<h2>Haze Hulks</h2>\n\n<p>Occasionaly, these transformations include tremendous growth. Although studies of this are scarce, it seems that a common change is an instant increase in both muscle mass and ferocity. These violent monstrosities are known as Haze Hulks, huge cousins to the twisted Delerium Dregs.</p>\n\n<p>The delerium affects the flesh of the creature, immediately toughening a creature and increasing its inherent strength, while diminishing parts of the brain that process emotions such as anger or frustration, and completely neutralizing the concepts of fear and greatly diminishing pain. The effects of this are a massive hulking beast that shrugs off attacks, is violently territorial, and shows no fear in the face of danger.</p>\n\n<h2>Advanced Mutations</h2>\n\n<p>Some creatures grow beyond the confines of standard mutations, where a rare few no longer fit into the obvious categories of Delerium Dregs or Haze Hulks. These creatures possess traits that separate them from the mutated hordes of the ruins, often because of their ability to maintain control of their sentience and sense of self in a way most others cannot.</p>\n\n<p>The danger occurs when these creatures believe they are still human despite terrible transformations. These advanced mutants are often twisted by misguided goals, such as gaining control over their mutations. Others are just unfortunates who cling to the shreds of self remaining in their slowly fragmenting minds. These may be the most dangerous of all. They still possess a cunning intellect while slipping into a madness they cannot fathom.</p>\n\n<p>Although rare, encountering these forms of advanced mutations is always dangerous—they have been known to control Dregs, or unite the mutated monsters to fight on their behalf. Two of these advanced mutants are described in this chapter: the malfeasant wizard known as the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimDel02.JournalEntryPage.226paleman000000]{Pale Man}, and the former Queen of Drakkenheim, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimDel02.JournalEntryPage.225lenorevonkess]{Lenore von Kessel}.</p>"

While the comparison is apt in some respects, Delerium Dregs are not brainless creatures or reanimated thralls. Rather, these mutated humans retain a broken consciousness drifting in and out of a lucid state. These horrible shreds of sentience can be difficult to witness, as the once human creatures mumble phrases of their last moments. Some cry for help, others beg for safety, while others call to loved ones and old companions. There are a few reports of Delerium Dregs have apparently coherent conversations for a few minutes before returning to their incoherent mumbles and ravenous cries.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, many have attempted to communicate with Delerium Dregs in search of their former humanity. Occasionally, Delerium Dregs respond to such appeals, but the effect is short-lived. The madness gripping their minds is all-consuming and isn't readily treated with words or even powerful magic. More than once have well-intentioned individuals sought out a transformed friend or loved one and tried to coax them back into a cogent state, grasping at whatever shreds of humanity remain. Unfortunately, these attempts ultimately fail; at best gleaning a fleeting moment of recognition before the terrifying realization of their wretched state becomes apparent. Often, such efforts only succeed in triggering frenzied outbursts, but there is no doubt that a handful of Dregs are kept captive in the hopes that one day their condition may somehow be healed or reversed.</p>\n\n<h2>Lasting Memories</h2>\n\n<p>Dregs may not be coherent, or even human anymore, but a small sliver of their former selves remains. Many have strange quirks that reveal their former selves, often displayed while tearing their victims apart.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.EmfNp2E9er1of1Kq rollable]"

They do not have a specific preference to the types of environments they inhabit. Once a creature succumbs to Contamination and is lost, they stay within the Haze and tend to gravitate to areas of contaminated magic, such as delerium clusters and Thin Places. However, they can be found almost anywhere throughout the city. These Dregs wander in groups throughout Drakkenheim, attacking anything not touched by Contamination.</p>\n\n<h2>Dark Corners and Old Ruins</h2>\n\n<p>Many Dregs tend to stick to shadowy areas, such as old ruins or abandoned buildings. They wander through the dimly lit streets often enough, but any venture into an old building is likely to find a conglomerate of various Dregs.</p>\n\n<h2>Gathering at the Source</h2>\n\n<p>Dregs will gather around clusters of delerium. It is unclear why they are instinctually pulled to delerium. Perhaps because Dregs were initially created by the Contamination produced by delerium, they constantly seek more as a means of fulfilling some sort of advanced transformation.

There, he houses all manner of Dregs. They serve and follow him, believing him to be their savior, and caring little for the constant experiments he performs on them. The Dregs the Pale Man houses do not attack visitors on site, however. The Pale Man welcomes those brave enough to seek him out, and will even offer aid to those who are sick. But he is always looking for the moment to turn a situation into an opportunity to acquire new test subjects for his brutal transformations and horrible experiments with eldritch contamination.</p>\n  </div>\n</aside>"

Through centuries of research, a few have gleaned scraps of knowledge, as scholars attempt to catalog the planes and discover the means to reach them. It is known that beyond the Mortal World are countless planes, side realms, and parallel dimensions: the verdant Faerie Otherworlds, the grim Shadowlands, the fuming Elemental Planes, and more. Though few mortals ever visit these other worlds, their influence permeates the material plane through magic and creatures that slip though the metaphysical veil that separates one reality from the next. However, sewn within the seams of the planar fabric is a realm unto itself, one more incomprehensible and bizarre than any other: the roiling non-place known as the Space Between Worlds.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Space Between Worlds is a tumultuous expanse of raw magical potential, a surreal landscape where crystalline obelisks rise at bewildering angles beneath a sun shaped like a square circle setting into an endless horizon. This horizon never touches the psychedelic, octarine sky. Logic and reason fade from meaning and the paradoxical reigns — here chaos and order are one and the same.</p>\n\n<p>Often thought of as the borderland between planes, or a void that collects the detritus of failed realities, broken timelines, annihilated universes, and collapsing dimensions, the Space Between Worlds is believed to be the source of all arcane magic, and metaphysically connected to every other plane. In this endless tundra of incomprehensible chaos, creatures beyond mortal understanding glide through the void or linger within pockets of semi-coherent reality. Void pirates navigate the cosmic seas, while elder beings traverse shattered dimensions. Sentient planets engage in celestial wars across a nebulous cosmic landscape, and inscrutable entities study and abduct mortals for obscure purposes. Within this tumultuous realm, various self-proclaimed gods manipulate mortal lives, viewing them as trivial playthings. To these beings, mortals represent mere ephemeral and erratic blips in the vast, ever-shifting expanse of the universe.</p>\n\n<p>These few scraps of information are the totality known to mortal scholars in the World of Drakkenheim about the Space Between Worlds. The remaining information on the Space Between Worlds is for the heroes to discover themselves during play.</p>\n\n<p>Conventional understandings of space, time, and causality do not necessarily apply in the Space Between Worlds. Indeed, the foundational laws of logic itself do not hold here. The entire Space Between Worlds is a contradiction unbound; the excluded middle made manifest; a place where whatever is, is not, and is also something else, and that which is not, is. The realm is spatially multi-dimensional, extending into the fourth, fifth, sixth, and potentially infinite spatial dimensions. Similarly, time flows freely forwards, backwards, stands still, accelerates, and slows down. Finite mortal creatures confined to three spatial dimensions and a linear timeline cannot experience the full spatial and temporal breadth of the Space Between Worlds in its utterly infinite potential. Within the Space Between Worlds, everything extends endlessly everywhere all at once, while being simultaneously compressed into a singularity.</p>\n\n<p>The Amethyst Academy mages Adama Borgess and Killgar Copperpot as well as apothecary Mathias van Buskirk were leading minds in the study and understanding of the Space Between Worlds. The deeper these brilliant minds delved into the knowledge of the Space Between Worlds, the more they began to lapse from reality. Copperpot died after his breakthrough into understanding the entities of the realm. Borgess published multiple books on the topic, each more esoteric and confused than the last. In his final years, he became reclusive and isolated, speaking at length about dimensions and reality in an increasingly confounded manner. Van Buskirk is a modern practitioner and is still alive today. His study is focused on Thin Places, and the entities that emerge through them, dealing with the protection of our realm from such creatures.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond these brilliant minds, other entities exist that have a firm grasp of the Space Between Worlds, but these entities are just as rare to encounter as the realm itself. What secrets these</p>\n\n<p>incredible beings of vast intellect may know they care little to share with mortals. Three such entities have a deep understanding of the nature of the Space Between Worlds. The first is The Thing With The Writhing Tail. Second is He Who Laughs Last, the demon lord from the Hells speculated to have existed since the origin of time, and destined to be the last creature to exist at the end of all things. Last is Amaranthyst, The Ultraviolet, archmage of the Amethyst Academy Directorate, a being who transcends time and space. There might be other incomprehensible entities that traverse the Space Between Worlds and know it as no others could, but those entities are beyond a mortal's perception and understanding.</p>\n\n<h2>Order Out of Chaos</h2>\n\n<p>In the rare instances of communication between beings of the Space Between Worlds and mortals, very little has been gained. The gnome wizard Killgar Copperpot used a planar contact spell to communicate with a being from the Space Between Worlds. Upon making contact, his fellow mages witnessed a one-sided discussion that went as follows.</p>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote chapter-intro\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>“I, Killgar Copperpot, reach out to you now to seek understanding.”<br />“I do not understand.”<br />“I do not understand.”<br />“Oh…”<br />“I understand.”</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<p>Which promptly ended with the mage standing up and walking to the edge of the sea ten miles away. For twelve days he spoke not a word and silently wept. None of his fellow mages could get him to communicate. After sunset on the twelfth day, during a full moon, the mage stood from his place in the sand. Witnesses transcribed what he said:</p>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote chapter-intro\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>“The gibbering and entombed wretches, by the twinkled pointed stings of dusks settling, hark, cast ye into the sea so I shall be swept into foam upon the waves and be Killgar Copperpot no more.”</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<p>The mage's eyes then melted into mush, and a strange octarine glow came from within the empty sockets. He then walked into the sea and was never seen again. Some who observed the act say that as the waves crashed over him, he slowly dissolved as if he was made of sand.</p>\n\n<p>Many philosophers, mages, and priests have thus speculated that the void found within this chaotic realm is little more than incomprehensible nothingness, one that mortal minds were not meant to bear witness to, but simply is a space between the pockets of functioning realities that we are intended to exist within.</p>\n\n<p>However, the mad mage Adama Borgess suggested that rather than existing between worlds as befits its name, the Space Between Worlds actually contains all of reality and existence itself. Under their utterly baffling model, the entire multiverse — all planes of existence, timelines, and worlds — are merely thought of as “islands of order within a sea of chaos.” Borgess theorized that the fate of such islands is inevitably to be broken down and consumed, returning to primal chaos. To Borgess, order is merely a temporary state cast against the natural chaotic state of the multiverse, a chance snapping together of cogent components forming randomly within the ether.</p>\n\n<h2>Fundamentally Contaminated</h2>\n\n<p>The raw magic within the Space Between Worlds is intense and manifests as unrestrained eldritch contamination, transforming matter and energy into everything beyond imagination. The chaotic magical landscape produces constantly fluctuating arcane energy that forms a swirling nebula of contaminated energy.</p>\n\n<p>Not dissimilar to the Haze found over Drakkenheim, the Space Between Worlds is a contaminated place; delerium crystals can be found in the Space Between Worlds in massive quantities. A form of concentrated raw arcane power turned into a solid form, delerium is an inevitable constant in a realm of churning arcane power. Growths of it dot every landscape and structure found in the realm, and in other regions it dominates the terrain, shaped like colossal mountains, crystalline forests, octarine obelisks, and strange edifices. Entire planetoids of delerium drift through the void. Delerium may have very well originated from the Space Between Worlds, shifting into the various realms and realities through Thin Places, or arcane gates.</p>\n\n<p>The creatures that inhabit the realm are born from this contamination, and their alien physiologies and incomprehensible arrangements echo the horrible mutations occurring in Drakkenheim. Adama Borgess's theory suggests that delerium is the inevitable return to chaos that all realities will eventually suffer. The process of returning order to its natural state of chaos is caused by the swirling arcane void and delerium is simply a catalyst for this destruction caused by the inherent nature of magic itself. The realms floating within the Space Between Worlds are at all times deathly contaminated, and it is perhaps the epicenter of the chaotic whims of contamination.</p>\n\n<h2>Cats of the Moons</h2>\n\n<p>One of the strangest noted occurrences within the Space Between Worlds is the relative frequency in which cats occur. Multiple accounts from those who have traversed the Space Between Worlds and lived to tell about it mention cats, or similarly feline creatures, guiding them back to their mortal realms.

Many possess forms and consciousness so bizarre that mortals do not recognize them as creatures at all. They view mortals similarly, nothing more than inert matter and whose souls are little more than passing thoughts. Still, these otherworldly creatures interact with mortals in more cogent and physical ways. The plane's inscrutable inhabitants include sphinxes, gemstone dragons, and countless aberrations. Those humanoids who have been lost to this realm are forever changed by the arcane anomalies of the Space Between Worlds.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Paradoxical Physiology</h2>\n\n<p>The native creatures of the Space Between Worlds often have physical features that defy the laws of physics:</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.5QUviFpQYqWfXHhI rollable]\n\n<h2>Inscrutable Minds</h2>\n\n<p>Dwellers of the Space Between Worlds behave and think in ways incomprehensible to mortals.

          "text": "<h1 class=\"banner no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Locations and Lairs\">Locations and Lairs</h1>\n\n<p>Mortal spellcasters are seldom able to physically travel between differing planes of existence; for in the entire world only a handful of tuning forks for the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]{Plane Shift} spell are known to exist, and only a few living people are able to cast unfathomable spells such as gate. Instead, most interplanar travel occurs via happenstance. Rifts in reality appear seemingly at random throughout the Mortal World and on occasion creatures have been known to slip through.</p>\n\n<h2>Travel to the Space Between Worlds</h2>\n\n<p>Physical travel to the Space Between Worlds is a deadly prospect for all but the most seasoned and powerful mortals. Rather, it is more common that the influence of the Space Between Worlds appears in the Mortal World in the form of Thin Places.</p>\n\n<h3>Thin Places</h3>\n\n<p>These are spots where the borders between worlds are especially weak. Emerging under extraordinarily rare magical circumstances, Thin Places form a connection between the Mortal World and another plane of existence. Thin Places often mark sites where creatures from the worlds beyond step into the Mortal World. Powerful planar magic can be harnessed here; Thin Places are characterized by a subtle influence of their corresponding plane.</p>\n\n<p>Thin Places can wax and wane over time. An object such as a doorway, arch, stone circle, bridge, wardrobe, or looking glass can act as a fulcrum for a Thin Place, and even spontaneously form a planar portal. Animal burrows, lakes, and trees can act in the same manner, becoming places where mortals and extraplanar creatures slip between worlds. When Thin Places wane, they can leave planar travelers trapped in another dimension, unable to return home. Academy scholars claim this is how gnomes, goblins, and many anthropomorphic peoples came to the Mortal World, as well as monsters such as lycanthropes, trolls, and worse.</p>\n\n<p>Most commonly, Thin Places connect to the Faerie Otherworlds or the Shadowlands, but the presence of delerium can trigger much more wild rifts that open to never-before-seen realms. Since the emergence of delerium, the Thin Places connected to the Space Between Worlds have appeared, mostly in and around Drakkenheim. These places are especially dangerous, as the monsters and wild magic that leak into the Mortal World from the Space Between Worlds are far more deadly and hostile than those of other realms. Worse, the eldritch contamination from the Space Between Worlds tends to slowly cause these conditions to worsen over time.</p>\n\n<h3>Plane Shift</h3>\n\n<p>\n  There are only three known tuning forks that allow one to venture into the Space Between Worlds via\n  <em>Plane Shift</em>. One is a tesseract, another a mobius strip, and the last is a melting pocket watch. The locations of these mythical items are known only to a select few. The Directorate of the Amethyst Academy knows of one. Another is said to be held by the great dragon Opularis the Wise, though none have ever been able to confirm this with the dragon. The third is a mystery. Some believe it was lost in Drakkenheim; others say the Divine Matriarch holds it in a secret vault; still others believe some great demonic entity houses it within the hells.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Temporal Disjunction</h2>\n\n<p>There is no meaningful concept of time in the Space Between Worlds beyond the perception of mortal creatures. Traveling through this place is a journey of eons which can unfold in mere minutes within the Mortal World. Many who find themselves lost in the Space Between Worlds have returned to the Mortal World having found the world completely changed. Although they believed themselves gone for months, they came home to a century of time passing. Other rare stories speak of an apothecary claiming they were lost in the Space Between Worlds for at least forty years, returning unaged only 42 minutes after they entered. With the absence of time within the realm, it has been observed that those who enter go through physical and mental changes that are disproportionate to the time spent in the realm. Where one creature might age, another may not. These inconsistencies continue to prove difficult to map or speculate upon due to their inherent lack of reason or consistency.</p>\n\n<h2>Visions of Madness</h2>\n\n<p>The sights of the Space Between Worlds are so bizarre and incomprehensible that few mortal minds can withstand beholding them. The landscapes leave those who witness them with severe headaches, dizziness, and in some cases have caused lasting bouts of madness, lethargy, and death. The Space Between Worlds is so utterly devoid of reason or logic that no mortal mind that dares imagine such a place could ever conceivably fathom the true reality of it. Those who have spied its landscapes and been coherent enough to document their findings have struggled to do so by any words or phrases of any language. The few recorded documentations are also wildly inconsistent amongst one another, further proving that there is no perceivable way to draw conclusions about the Space Between Worlds besides its utter chaotic incomprehensibility.</p>\n\n<h2>Impossible Vistas</h2>\n\n<p>The terrain of the Space Between Worlds varies greatly. Within it are some common groupings of matter that have been observed and mapped amongst the otherwise impossible to comprehend landscapes:</p>\n\n<h3>Desert of the Unreal</h3>\n\n<p>Trackless dunes of hourglass sands engulf the ruins of forgotten civilizations. Ancient bone-white monuments and half decayed structures jut out of the dunes along with strange jewel toned rocks that reach towards a purple sky. The rocks reshape at incoherent angles depending on how they are observed, and the howl of unnatural winds billow through the sands under an eternal blazing sun.</p>\n\n<h3>Hyperdimensional Caverns</h3>\n\n<p>A network of caves and dungeons extend past the third dimension, comprising chambers with four, five, six, or more spatial dimensions, all overlapping one another. With no consistent path to take or to map, the caverns seemingly reform and reimagine themselves at any given moment. Journeying down a straight corridor may very well lead you in a circle, and descending into a pit may lead you to the top of a mountain.</p>\n\n<h3>Void Sea</h3>\n\n<p>A great roiling mass of eldritch storms, the Void Sea is not quite outer space, not quite ocean, and not quite landless sky. Floating rocks drift through the sea in various shapes and forms, some as small as a pebble, others large enough to house entire structures or cities. Void Pirates roam the sea surviving off the drifting debris seeping in from the Thin Places of other realms. The Void Sea is a terrifying space where gravity is broken in illogical ways. Stepping off the edge of a cliff might cause you to fall in any direction, or float through the air gently, or even have gravity shift so you are still walking on solid ground in a new direction. Navigating this eternal sea is an art few can comprehend besides those born in the Space Between Worlds, or those forever altered by it.</p>\n\n<h3>Monolith Plains</h3>\n\n<p>The Monolith Plains are made up of vast fields of orange grass upon rolling hills that shift and move like waves upon an ocean caught in slow motion. Stretches of land are spotted with great monoliths of black obsidian stone formed in perfect geometric shapes. Scattered perfect cubes of rock orbit the largest of the great stones, giving off a slight ringing hum. The sky is a deep crimson, filled with churning green clouds that flash with purple lightning in an ever present storm. Occasional torrential downpours of contaminated rain cause flooding and form rivers and lakes along the landscape.</p>\n\n<h3>Temples of Ulthar</h3>\n\n<p>A series of vast islands within the Void Sea house ancient temples of white stone with bizarre architecture unlike that of any mortal creature's making. Great statues of cat-like creatures stand upon ancient pedestals or within carved vistas throughout the geometrically baffling hallways. The temples are both ancient and pristine, standing out of time, and oddly fathomable amongst the otherwise chaotic landscapes.</p>\n\n<h3>The Screaming Heads</h3>\n\n<p>Dead gnarled trees, some resembling bony human hands or petrified tentacles burst forth from a blackened marshland of wet ground. Trickling waterfalls flow upwards into a darkened sky. Amongst the dribbling black waterways, thousands of circular stone tablets jut out of the ground. Many are perfect circles and each one contains two smaller circles punched through the stone and one large circle towards the bottom, giving the strange stone monuments the appearance of screaming faces. The stone surfaces are perfectly smooth, as if it was polished and finely crafted.</p>\n\n<h3>Towers of Gears</h3>\n\n<p>Amongst the Void Sea are a collection of epic towers that stretch for eternity in length. These towers are composed entirely of metal mechanical workings: gears, belts, levers, buttons, wires, segmented tubes, bolts, and dials constantly turning like clockwork, grinding and clicking. The towers are alive with metal creatures of geometric shapes and shifting metal workings who continually rearrange and restructure the machine workings of the towers. The towers are pulled apart and its nodes and conduits powered up by great floating mechanical beings with wires and tubes flowing off of them like a squid. The purpose of these towers is completely unknown, and seemingly inconsequential. Nevertheless, the creatures are determined to continue their work.</p>"

Mageborn and priest alike lose their spellcasting powers, and the pacts between warlocks and patrons are forever snuffed out. Any whispers from old gods, eldritch powers, celestial beings, and demons are silenced. Every thin place is destroyed, and magical creatures, such as trolls, giants, fey, and dragons slowly go extinct as the magic intrinsic to their nature fades from reality. The world of Drakkenheim would be safe from Delerium, but it would become a mundane place, utterly devoid of all magic.</p>"

Trembling as they spoke, these survivors recounted how they narrowly avoided the fire and ash that consumed the city, only to watch in horror as their loved ones, neighbors, and fellow citizens were twisted into grotesque parodies of themselves by the chaotic energies that followed the falling stars. All agreed that the only lucky ones that day were those who were swiftly incinerated in the initial meteoric impact. Ever since, those who perish within Drakkenheim or succumb to the contaminated Haze transform into hideous monsters.\n</p>\n\n<p>Those who dismissed these claims as the distressed inventions of a few traumatized refugees were decisively proven wrong in the years following the disaster. Seeking to restore order as quickly as possible, the nobility of Westemär desperately mustered an expeditionary force to search Drakkenheim for royal survivors, recover the lost crown, and retake Castle Drakken. Lord Commander Elias Drexel was placed in command of the mission, hand-picking a contingent of fifty elite House von Kessel soldiers to be the first team dispatched into the ruins. Captain Pieter Lang was appointed to lead the squadron.</p>\n\n<p>Although they were well-equipped veterans, this conventional military force was wholly unprepared for the conditions in the ruins. Arriving on the outskirts of the city, the troops found Drakkenheim cloaked in a thick opalescent fog, which came to be known as the Haze. When the mists did not abate, the soldiers cautiously proceeded into the ruins from the south, making their way along Champion's Way. The details are unclear about what exactly occurred next, since only a few scrawled notes from Captain Lang's logbook were ever found from that first mission.</p>\n\n<p>Lang records that a few among their number began to fall ill shortly after entering the ruins and encountering a “gigantic and misshapen rodent” of some kind. Nevertheless, the unit pushed onward and ran afoul of “a throng of reanimated dead shuffling the streets.” Lang notes that many were wounded in the battle against the undead after the creatures “violently exploded with some kind of strangely-colored magic” when slain. At that, the regiment decided to stop and rest to help their comrades recover. While making camp, a few of the soldiers presented Lang with “brightly glowing gemstones, which glimmered like nothing from this world” that they'd found amongst the rubble. Lang explains how he confiscated the stones, keeping them on his person “for safety, lest the troops get ideas about looting.”</p>\n\n<p>However, the soldiers were unable to sleep, haunted by whispers and nightmares of something in the swirling darkness. More began to fall sick, and that's when the changes began. One of the wounded soldiers started convulsing violently as their arms transformed into flailing tentacles, and their stomach opened into a gaping, toothy maw. Unsure what to do, a panicked Lang had “no other choice but to slay the poor wretch.” At that point, Lang's writing becomes less clear, as he explains the affliction spreading amongst his soldiers taking hold in himself. That was the final entry in his log. The scribbled notebook was found by adventurers some years later amidst the remains of a terrible shapeless mass of monstrous flesh and limbs. None from Lang's unit ever returned from the ruins.</p>\n\n<p>Since that time, many expeditions and adventuring parties have met a similar fate to Lang's unit, and rarely are records or remains ever found. However, a few were far more fortunate and returned from their missions. Through these few successes, the world was able to learn about the horrors of Drakkenheim, and the vast power—and danger—of delerium.</p>\n\n<h2>Eldritch Contamination</h2>\n\n<p>It is now well-known that the delerium crystals scattered throughout the ruins emit arcane radiation known as eldritch contamination (the game rules for which are described in @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApp0C]{Appendix C: Contamination}). These energies also manifest the misty Haze that covers the city. Sustained exposure to this raw magic causes all matter to warp erratically. While living animal tissue is readily susceptible to contamination, over time even plant and vegetable matter, dead flesh, solid rock, metal, and even the elements themselves are affected by delerium. Overexposure to eldritch contamination induces a chain reaction of rapid mutation which changes humans, animals, and even inanimate objects into terrifying monsters in a painful and gory process. As the body betrays itself, the mind slowly unravels. A monstrous transformation drives even the most strong-willed individuals irrevocably mad, though a few retain a distorted facade of their intelligence and personality. Each creature described in this chapter has suffered this terrible fate.</p>\n\n<p>The mutations caused by eldritch contamination are endless in possibility, and do not conform to any need for biological function or natural law. There is no telling what strange appendages, odd shapes, and unnatural abilities a contaminated creature could possess. While some mutations make for a fearsome abomination, many mutated creatures become a pathetic lump of flesh barely able to support their own misshapen bodies. However, within the churning chaos of change, occasionally patterns emerge. Even two creatures which share the same mutations and game statistics may have wildly different appearances and behavior.</p>\n\n<h2>Hideous Beasts</h2>\n\n<p>Humans are not the only creatures that have been transformed into monsters. The beasts that once inhabited Drakkenheim have also become abominations: the livestock and pets living alongside the citizenry, the vermin crawling in the streets and sewers, the skittering insects inhabiting every home, and the wild animals eking out a life amidst the pockets of nature found within the urban sprawl. Worse, even plant life has gained otherworldly sentience, animated by the eldritch forces taking root in the soil. Although monsters have always been known to exist, these horrific nightmares are unlike anything seen in any other place on this world.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes Drakkenheim's mutations are so bizarre and mind warping that they create an entirely new species. Although many mutated creatures appear related to the various animals and people who once inhabited the city, some have mutations so bizarre and mind warping that they create an entirely alien species. At times these changes manifest as masses of indistinguishable flesh, bloated tentacled limbs, or in rare cases they develop into a creature more uniform and recognizable in its makeup, but never before seen in the world.</p>\n\n<h2>Walls that Talk</h2>\n\n<p>It is a common misconception that eldritch contamination only affects living, organic creatures. The Haze infuses the atmosphere: conjuring bizarre and violent weather, polluting the earth and waterways, and even warping and changing the objects and structures within the city. Scouts claim the mists and fog have reshuffled the streets and thoroughfares of Drakkenheim into a shifting maze, but the reality is far more unsettling. Reports and rumors tell of walls of flesh, plants and trees turned to delicate glass, doorways opening portals to other realms, grasping tendrils emerging from seemingly inanimate objects, eyes and faces appearing amongst the stonework, and teeth, tongues, and hungry maws opening between the floorboards. Even time seems to flow erratically within the ruins, and on occasion adventurers thought lost in the ruins for months emerge suddenly, thinking they were only in the city for a day.</p>\n\n<p>Given these strange effects, the monsters roaming the ruins, the hazards of rubble and wreckage, and the corrupt environmental conditions in Drakkenheim, nowhere in the city is safe. Anything, even the very walls of the buildings, are potential threats waiting for an opportune moment to strike.</p>\n\n<h2>Haze Dependent</h2>\n\n<p>Most contaminated monsters are dependent on the magic of the Haze to sustain themselves, as their unstable physiologies often defy the laws of nature. Brought outside the Haze, these monsters begin to rapidly wither and deteriorate, and seldom live much longer than a week. Once this was discovered, it was widely believed that the threats posed by the horrors of Drakkenheim were largely contained to the ruins. Nevertheless, the devastating effects on the countryside from spreading contamination and the danger of wandering monsters nearby was enough to see most towns and villages near Drakkenheim abandoned within a few years of the disaster.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the only settlement within two weeks' travel of Drakkenheim is Emberwood Village. Fortunately, the large concentration of adventurous sorts and faction agents gathering in the town is more than enough to fend off most curious creatures who come to Emberwood, though no one questions what may have happened when a person disappears anymore.</p>\n\n<p>However, contact or exposure to delerium can be enough to nourish these creatures for longer forays from the ruins. Worse, a significant concentration of delerium in any one place can cause a local manifestation of the Haze, which can maintain a great number of monsters. Bold and particularly lucid monsters seeking new hunting grounds may bring delerium with them on their own excursions outside the ruins, driven by an innate compulsion to spread their contaminated state.</p>\n\n<h2>Corrupted Urban Ecology</h2>\n\n<p>Drakkenheim has transformed over the last fifteen years into a nightmarish wasteland where urban decay meets the wild. The city's ruins are now more akin to a vast, untamed wilderness, teeming with violent and predatory creatures that have adapted to this new, harsh environment. These monsters have carved out their own ecological niches within the crumbled streets, decrepit sewers, and broken spires, turning the city into a landscape that is both alien and hostile.</p>\n\n<p>These creatures have become the true inhabitants of Drakkenheim, mastering every aspect of their environment to their advantage. They use the dense Haze for cover, the labyrinthine ruins for navigation, and the scattered debris for shelter. The tunnels, alleys, and hollowed-out buildings serve as their nests, homes, and battlegrounds. To these monsters, Drakkenheim is familiar territory, their hunting ground where they thrive.</p>\n\n<p>For any outsider venturing into the city, Drakkenheim offers no safe passage. Iconic landmarks such as towering spires, grand gates, city squares, and once-vibrant gardens have become twisted and unfamiliar. The city's layout is constantly shifting with fallen buildings blocking paths, broken and cratered streets, and contamination altering the environment unpredictably. This makes the city a labyrinth, constantly changing and challenging even to those who once knew it well.</p>\n\n<aside>\n  <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n    <h1>First Contact</h1>\n    <p class=\"detail\">A report from Vanguard Captain Rose Walker, first expedition into Drakkenheim.</p>\n    <p>We were crossing the river on the eastern outskirts, making our way up King's Road. As we approached the Drann, Faraday spotted strange eggs along the shore, colored unlike anything we had seen before. Similar, I think, to the fog hanging over the ruined city. Collins said they reminded him of tadpole eggs he saw as a child. We heard a low gurgling noise from the river and drew our bows. Collins was hit with one of the strange eggs. We saw a figure lurking in the water and unleashed our arrows at it, but it vanished beneath the surface. The egg that hit Collins had stuck to his neck. He was on the ground, writhing in discomfort. Faraday examined the egg, which had seemingly fused to Collin's flesh, appearing like a strange pulsing growth.</p>\n    <p>We were hesitant to attempt to remove it, and that hesitancy may be what cost Collins his life. I can't say for sure what happened next. We continued to travel towards King's Gate, keeping an eye on Collins, who claimed he felt alright; we would drop him off at a nearby Lantern waypoint to seek medical attention. Faraday observed a small creature within the egg, possibly a tadpole, disappear into Collins's neck as the egg merged even further. Collins lost consciousness only a minute or two later, and moments after that, began convulsing. His skin turned strange hues of yellow and green, his eyes grew pale, and he began to bleed from sores that appeared across his body. As we attempted to staunch the bleeding and tend to his ailments, Collins was lost to the disease that had quickly overtaken him. As we came to terms with losing one of our own to such bizarre circumstances, horrible events began to occur.</p>\n    <p>It's difficult to describe what happened to Collins's body. His skin began to writhe, and crack. His ribcage ripped open as a large frog emerged, its face split down the middle with a strange maw. It let out a horrible croak and leapt past us. We unleashed multiple arrows at the creature until it fell. Approaching the creature's body, we saw that it had already begun producing its own eggs, likely to use on the rest of us. However, the most unsettling thing was that its eyes were strangely familiar. They reminded me of Collins's.</p>\n  </div>\n</aside>"

As such, the roleplaying traits below are common amongst them.</p>\n\n<h2>Beyond Reason</h2>\n\n<p>The monsters inhabiting Drakkenheim are irrevocably gripped by otherworldly madness. Most become predatory and instinctively violent as a result, but a few are lucid and capable of speech. However, even these creatures possess an unstable consciousness: they may be perfectly capable of carrying on a conversation for a short while, only to break out into rage, despair, or other extreme emotions without warning. Appeals to logic and reason often confuse and frustrate them, and they possess a twisted sense of empathy and alien logic. Few of Drakkenheim's horrors understand the origin of their malevolent predilections, and instead construct elaborate fantasies or incoherent narratives to explain their predicaments and behaviors.</p>\n\n<h2>Struggle for Survival</h2>\n\n<p>These monsters are often just as hostile to one another as they are to explorers who venture into the ruins. Although some have formed groups, many live a solitary existence wandering the city streets. Some are aimless, while others desperately search for something, be it food, their own memories, or some other delusion. A particularly empty or desolate area of the city may indicate that a powerful beast lurks nearby, as weaker abominations know to give the dangerous predator a wide berth.</p>\n\n<h2>Motivated by Madness</h2>\n\n<p>The monsters inhabiting the ruins have strange and incoherent motives.</p>\n\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.b2CEvkZNXbakUEPf rollable]</p>\n\n<h2>Aberrant Physiology</h2>\n\n<p>The monsters presented in this chapter are typical of their kind, but even creatures with the same game statistics may have extreme variation in physical appearance.

Rarely do the monsters of Drakkenheim speak or utter coherent words. Those that do are most likely humans who have mutated in the ruins.

Here are a few ideas to keep in mind when designing encounter locations and lairs for the monsters in this chapter.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Ruined City</h2>\n\n<p>Amongst the city streets and back alleys are hundreds of buildings brought low by the rain of falling stars. Some buildings are more intact than others, but the devastation of the city is everywhere and the scars of the aftermath of that horrible day remain. Thick dust, octarine Haze, rubble-blocking paths, fallen towers and caved-in roads all have turned the great city into an endless labyrinth of twisting and turning passages.</p>\n\n<h2>Monsters in the Dark</h2>\n\n<p>There is always something hiding in the city's dark corners. An explorer may think they are in the clear and away from danger only to be ambushed unexpectedly by a hungry abomination. Nothing can be trusted, and if the city is quiet, that's even more reason to be on your guard — the worst terrors are the ones you never hear or see.</p>\n\n<h2>Hazards Abound</h2>\n\n<p>The city is always a dangerous place, even in the rare instance a mutated horror is not lurking just out of sight. Ruined buildings collapse, streets cave in, and the Haze can make navigation difficult. At any moment a terrible hazard can cause problems for adventurers trying to make their way through the city. Few buildings in the city stand unscathed. Most are in a partial state of collapse and heavily damaged. Shattered windows, splintered boards, and jagged rocks make up a large portion of the structures found throughout the city. Any encounter could be more lethal due to these constant hazards.</p>\n\n<h2>Threats Above and Below</h2>\n\n<p>The dangers of Drakkenheim's streets make many adventurers consider if safe routes may be found underground through the sewers, or by taking the high road along the rooftops of the city buildings. However, there are monsters and dangers on both routes. The choice to take the streets, sewers, or rooftops is more about the threats explorers are best equipped to handle, rather than a means to avoid monsters entirely.</p>\n\n<p>Drakkenheim had a sophisticated sewer system running beneath the city. There are two types of tunnels in the system: drainage and sewage tunnels, which carry refuse and wastewater away from the city, as well as aqueducts and underground canals, which supply fresh water to the wells, cisterns, and fountains located throughout Drakkenheim. Of course, the damage and disarray to both systems means it's sometimes difficult to tell the difference. In these confined tunnels are all manner of horrible creatures. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.142lobfrog000000]{Lob Frogs}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimPre04.JournalEntryPage.403deepdregs0000]{Deep Dregs}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.113bloatedhive00]{Bloated Hives}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.121drakkensewgtr]{Drakkenheim Sewer Gators}, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.146sewerthing000]{Sewer Things} all lurk in the fetid waters under the city.</p>\n\n<p>Those agile and athletic enough to leap and run across the rooftops may evade threats in the streets below, but expose themselves to the wide range of airborne creatures who rule the skies above Drakkenheim, such as @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.149skretch000000]{Skretches}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.147shardmaulmant]{Shardmaul Manticores}, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.128eldritchcata0]{Eldritch Cataclysms}.</p>"

It once stood as a glimmering beacon over Drakkenheim, and a testament to the majesty and royalty of the city. Now, the castle looms over the ruins, a dark and foreboding presence whose shadow casts an ever-present feeling of gloom and despair.</p>\n<p>The castle is made up of two front gates along a winding path up the cliffside that leads to the upper and lower bailey. The lower bailey houses the castle stables and barracks. The upper bailey holds the castle chapel, gardens, and courtyard. The castle proper is composed of a long central building, with five great towers attached to it.</p>\n<p>The castle is now overrun with demons, devils, vengeful spirits, and all manner of mutated monstrosities. Some of the most horrible monsters in Drakkenheim such as the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.130gravekeeper00]{Gravekeeper}, and the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.106amalgamationn]{Amalgamation} reside in the castle, but the halls are filled with @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.151warpwitch0000]{Warp Witches}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.131hazehusk00000]{Haze Husks}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimDel02]{Dregs}, and a menagerie of other horrors, making it one of the most dangerous locations in the city.</p>\n<h2>Drann River</h2>\n<p>The wide Drann River flows southwest, and divides Drakkenheim into the North Ward and the South Ward. Averaging about four hundred feet wide as it travels through the city, the water is deep, slow-moving, and thoroughly contaminated.</p>\n<p>The Drann River travels hundreds of miles before it empties into Ash Bay at the port city of Drannsmund. The Drann can accommodate lumber barges and small row boats, but seaworthy sailing vessels cannot travel this far upriver. While there are small quays and docks along the Drann, it does not support large ports.</p>\n<p>The polluted waters of the Drann carry a steady amount of delerium downstream, and the river is now home to a wide variety of contaminated monsters, including @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.142lobfrog000000]{Lob Frogs}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.121drakkensewgtr]{Drakkenheim Sewer Gators}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.123elementalcont]{Animated Delerium Sludges}, and the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimPre04.JournalEntryPage.403deepdregs0000]{Deep Dregs}.</p>\n<p>Four large bridges cross the Drann River from the north to south ward of Drakkenheim. All of which can be found in the Inner City, while the Outer City houses two ferries, one to the south, and one to the northeast.</p>\n<h3>Champion's Bridge</h3>\n<p>This decorated stone causeway is the largest in Drakkenheim at nearly five hundred feet long and fifty feet wide. It extends from Champion's Way in the south over towards the great Market Square in the Middle Ward. Five arched spans supported by stone piers hold the bridge thirty feet above the Drann. The bridge has an elegant stone guardrail, and overhanging balconies spaced along its outer edges each hold statues depicting mighty heroes from Drakkenheim's past. Today, the haunted bridge is home to countless monsters who occupy both the waters below, and the bridge itself. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.142lobfrog000000]{Lob Frogs}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.113bloatedhive00]{Bloated Hives}, and even the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.121drakkensewgtr]{Drakkenheim Sewer Gator} have been spotted in the areas under the bridge and some of these creatures wander up to its surface when hungry, looking for anything to eat.</p>\n<h3>Temple Bridge</h3>\n<p>This narrow bridge is made up of white cobblestone with seven stone arches supporting it twenty to twenty-five feet above the Drann River. The bridge is only twelve feet wide and has a slight arched curve to it as it extends across the river. A wrought iron fence flanks either side of the bridge, and every ten feet a tall, ornate pillar holds a torch. These torches have long been snuffed out, and the once pristine and bright bridge is now caked in dirt and blood. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimPre04.JournalEntryPage.402garmyr0000000]{Garmyr} occupy the bridge now and hold a small encampment on the north side of it.</p>\n<h3>Saint Selina's Bridge</h3>\n<p>This bridge was under construction when the meteor struck, and sections made of thick wooden scaffolds are still set between the partially complete stone arches. The ruined bridge is extremely hazardous, with many of its support beams missing or damaged. A section of the bridge has crumbled and one of the arches is jutting out of the water below. Anyone daring the bridge must keep their wits about them, as any section of it could collapse at a moment's notice. Several @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.149skretch000000]{Skretches} who perch upon the city walls occasionally fly over and circle the bridge, waiting for an accident to grant them an easy meal, while @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.109beetleknightt]{Beetle Knights} skitter below the bridge, and a great @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.107anomolluskkkk]{Anomollusk} occupies the stony debris below.</p>\n<h3>Albrecht's Crossing</h3>\n<p>The northernmost bridge is the oldest in Drakkenheim and was constructed originally as the main entrance to the city from the south, when the city was only the Old Town surrounding Castle Drakken. The bridge was constructed during the reign of the last House von Drakken monarch, Albrecht, and is made of finely crafted brass and iron into one of the most beautiful functional art pieces in the city. The bridge is lined with metal sculptures of dancing dragons that flow and coil around the railings, the long walkway etched with depictions of heroic deeds of long dead warriors. Now caked in debris and moss, the metal has lost its shine, but the bridge still stands sturdy against time. A @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07]{Troll} encampment sits on the north side of the bridge while the south is close to the Crater, and well known for being a hot spot of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.NizgRXLNUqtdlC1s.JournalEntryPage.D2BdqS1GeD5rcZ6q]{Undead} and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimDel02]{Dregs}.</p>\n<h3>Stick's Ferry</h3>\n<p>Old Sticks was a simple ferryman who ran a small rowboat crossing from The Sprawl to The Spokes in the southern stretch of the Outer City. He used to be a talkative sort, always wanting to hear the stories of the people he took across the Drann while sharing his own tales. Old Sticks was known amongst the locals as a jovial and kindhearted man, who simply loved being out on the water and enjoyed the steady, meditative nature of rowing. An elderly man in his late sixties, he would always claim that rowing kept his heart young, and joked that when he did eventually go, wherever he ended up he would likely just keep rowing if he could. Old Sticks didn't survive the initial blast of the meteor. He is now a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.131hazehusk00000]{Haze Husk} that seems to lack any of the normal hostile traits of the undead in the city. True to his word, he is content to just keep rowing people back and forth for an eternity.</p>\n<h3>Abandoned Ferry</h3>\n<p>The northeast stretch of the Drann in the Outer City has become a difficult place to cross. The ferry that once operated here is left abandoned. This old raft has been pulled up on shore with an old frayed rope that lazily stretches across the river. Now a self-service ferry of sorts, explorers can use the rope to cross the Drann. The river here is home to multiple @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.142lobfrog000000]{Lob Frogs} that hide under the two docks of the old ferry path and lay their eggs in large clusters there. A crude sign has been placed on the south banks by some unknown adventurer that simply reads “Don't.”</p>\n<h2>Outer City</h2>\n<p>Stretching outward from the city walls in all directions, the Outer City itself comprises three main districts: Kingside, The Sprawl, and The Spokes.</p>\n<h3>Kingside</h3>\n<p>The area north of the Drann River to the east of the city walls is known as Kingside. Appropriately, the district is built along King's Way on the way to King's Gate. This once lush and beautiful landscape had the largest manors and houses outside the walls. It was also home to some well-known vineyards, inns, and the most luxurious stables, orchards, and cider houses in the city. Since the fall of Drakkenheim, strange magics have rested in the area. Twisted creatures haunt the old vineyards and inns, an eerie and constant chorus of wails and moans echo through the wide streets, and packs of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07]{Trolls} hunt the area looking for fresh meat.</p>\n<h3>The Sprawl</h3>\n<p>The large region west of the city walls is known as The Sprawl. Three main roads, Shepherd's Way, Temple Road, and College Street, all cross The Sprawl towards their respective gates. This stretch of small, packed together houses, street markets, taverns, and shops was always bustling with people prior to the collapse of the city. It was the most densely populated area in Drakkenheim. This unfortunately means that now it is also one of the most densely populated areas for the horrible, mutated monsters that roam the old streets and ruined buildings, filled with @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimDel02]{Dregs}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRat03]{Ratlings} and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.114bojack0000000]{Bojacks}.</p>\n<h3>The Spokes</h3>\n<p>The Spokes are the entire area outside the walls south of the Drann River. Champion's Way, leading to Champion's Gate, is the main road through The Spokes, and the only one that is paved. This large assortment of industrial buildings, warehouses, shops, mills, and taverns was where most of Drakkenheim's industry happened. Brewers, smiths, forges, lumber mills, tanners, granaries, and textile mills make up a large portion of the area closest to the walls, while many of the most established farms spanning out further south from The Spokes, connecting down to Emberwood Village five miles away. Now most of the buildings lie in ruin, shattered and broken by the initial blast of the falling star that landed right on the edge of where The Spokes meet the South Ward. The Spokes is the most ruined area in Drakkenheim—rubble blocks streets, buildings barely stand, and the place holds the Haze, dust, and debris thick in the air. The Spokes is a common place to find some of the more horribly mutated monsters such as @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.120digipede00000]{Digipedes}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.138kronen0000000]{Kronen}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.118darkgrowth000]{Dark Growths}, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.122effulgent0000]{Effulgent Cnidarians}.</p>\n<h2>Inner City</h2>\n<p>Protected within the walls, the densely packed Inner City features winding cobblestone streets and towering spires of stone. Decorated plazas and broad squares mark major landmarks, monuments, and important buildings. Major landmarks in the Inner City include the ornate Saint Virturvio's Cathedral, the Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy, the lush and verdant Queen's Park Garden, the once-bustling Market Square, the Cosmological Clocktower, and Slaughterstone Square.</p>\n<h3>South Ward</h3>\n<p>Once the most densely populated area of the Inner city, South Ward had rows of small shops, temples, and taverns along its main roads, with packed houses grouped together in small bustling communities. Now, it is nothing but smoldering, indistinguishable ruins. A wood beam, or a stone arch jutting from the ground amidst ash and rubble, is mostly what you will find as you draw closer to the great Crater Basin. From decrepit wooden skeletons of homes, to piles of shattered stone, heaped bodies, and half buried foundations, the landscape becomes increasingly sparse closer to the Crater. Finding a standing structure in the South Ward is rare, and often filled with monsters such as @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.138kronen0000000]{Kronen}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimDel02]{Dregs}, or @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.139lastmemory000]{Last Memories}. This ward is also a common place for @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.141loathsomegagf]{Gag Flies} and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.133hazewingmoth0#hazewing-moths]{Hazewing Moths}.</p>\n<h3>Old Town</h3>\n<p>Old Town stretches through the northeast of the Inner City and was the first area of Drakkenheim to be built. It is made up of well-spaced properties, each with a large manor house. Main roads are lined with stables, high end shops, and well-regarded establishments. Much of this area of the city remains intact, especially the old Kleinberg Estate resting against the cliffs that lead up to Castle Drakken. Although known as the wealthiest part of the city, in its ruin this area is now a prime haunt for malfeasant wizards to operate. Old Town is home to @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.110belfray123456]{Belfrays}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.120digipede00000]{Digipedes}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.122effulgent0000]{Effulgent Cnidarians}, and has been known to be a hunting ground for @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.140livingcity000]{Living Cities}.</p>\n<h3>Middle Ward</h3>\n<p>The Middle Ward was a common place for inns, taverns, shops, and a few of the more prominent blacksmiths and woodcarvers. Sprawling through the west end of the city, it is the largest district in the Inner City. The Great Market Square rests on the inner border of the Middle Ward and was the most popular place for shopping in the city. The Middle Ward also housed many of the prestigious playhouses and brothels of the city. Now ruled over by the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimPre04.JournalEntryPage.405hazewindharpi]{Harpies}, and an abundance of undead like @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.131hazehusk00000]{Haze Husks}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.132hazewight0000]{Haze Wights}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.108arcanewraithh]{Arcane Wraiths}, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.151warpwitch0000]{Warp Witches}.</p>\n<h3>Temple Ward</h3>\n<p>The Temple Ward makes up the southwest portion of the Inner City around Temple Gate and Temple Road. The main attraction of the Temple Ward is Saint Virturvio's Cathedral, which towers high above the residential surroundings. Now packed with roving bands of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimPre04.JournalEntryPage.402garmyr0000000]{Garmyr}, this once bright and vibrant part of the city is littered with carnage and death. Besides the roving packs of war dogs, one can expect to find @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.138kronen0000000]{Kronen}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.109beetleknightt]{Beetle Knights}, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.120digipede00000]{Digipedes} roaming through the buildings or hiding in the darkened corners of abandoned homes.</p>\n<h3>Queen's Park Garden</h3>\n<p>This elegant park was built to commemorate the ruling monarchs of Westemär and their royal consorts. The garden was a social hub during the spring and summer, featuring bountiful fountains, secluded grottos, grand monuments, and lush gardens.Today, the entire area is covered by the Deep Haze (see appendix C). Queen's Park Garden has been transformed into a terrifying maze. Before the meteor struck, from its trellised paths, you could nearly see from one side of the park to the other, and most landmarks could be seen from the central fountain. Today, adventurers exploring the park speak of getting lost in the thickets; the once carefully curated orchards are now dangerously tangled forests.</p>\n<h4>Queen's Park Locations</h4>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Lenore's Grotto. </strong>An elegant, tiered garden with two rectangular pools marks the entrance to a wondrous grotto built for the Queen Consort to Ulrich IV.</li>\n  <li><strong>Lunar Meadows of Arwen.</strong> This once lush green clearing was a prime spot for stargazing, or picnics dotted with small floral patches and a babbling creek.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fountain of Beauty. </strong>The heart of Queen's Park Garden is a majestic, multi-tiered marble fountain which honors all the royal women of Westemär.</li>\n  <li><strong>Botanical Gardens of Mother Danu.</strong> These vast gardens housed the largest assortment of flowers in all of Westemär, including unique species brought in from the Far Continent.</li>\n  <li><strong>Queen Eleanor's Lavender Fields.</strong> A winding cobblestone path navigated through these beautiful purple flowers with small benches and statues dotting the walkway.</li>\n  <li><strong>Old Willow Falls. </strong>Near the north end of the gardens is a natural three-tiered waterfall that flows into the winding river that snakes through the gardens, next to it is the oldest tree in Drakkenheim, a massive weeping willow.</li>\n  <li><strong>Weeping Angels of Gunhilda.</strong> Not far from the willow is a clearing holding multiple statues of weeping angels gifted from Caspia to Queen Gunhilda years ago. Mists from the waterfall hang low around the moss-caked statues giving the clearing a fantastical ancient atmosphere.</li>\n  <li><strong>Dream-pools of Phantasia. </strong>Several small bridges and walkways weave between ornate pools and fountains, the sound of flowing water filling the space. In the center, a statue of Phantasia watches over the pools, smiling.</li>\n  <li><strong>Statue of Nuada Vitrix.</strong> This glorious statue depicts the Old God Nuada as a winged valkyrie striking down the enemies of Drakkenheim.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hildegarde's Arch.</strong> This impressive victory arch on four columns commemorates Queen Hildegarde von Drakken I's signing of the Edicts of Lumen.</li>\n  <li><strong>Helena's Column.</strong> Dedicated to House von Kessel's first monarch, Helena I, who used the Crown of Westemär's power to cure a plague ravaging the nation. Her deeds are etched upon the column, and a bust of her likeness rests on top.</li>\n  <li><strong>Carmen's Dragons. </strong>This topiary garden depicts the famous draconic mounts of Carmen von Drakken, the first Queen of Westemär. Oddly, despite the garden's overgrown state, these masterpieces remain well-trimmed and pristine.</li>\n  <li><strong>Theresa's Grove.</strong> A small clearing featuring several standing rocks and simple benches, all overtaken by creeping vines.</li>\n  <li><strong>Lily Ponds of Queen Beatrice. </strong>The lily ponds once housed many different frogs and fish, as well as an old tower that one could climb to see most of Drakkenheim and overlook the gardens.</li>\n  <li><strong>Groundskeeper's House.</strong> The gnomish head groundskeeper, Wilber Greenroot Pebblepond, and his many gnome gardeners kept their tools here, conducted garden business, and also rested here on night shifts.</li>\n  <li><strong>Corridor of Queens. </strong>The main cobblestone road leading from the south entrance of the gardens up to the central fountain is flanked by large ten-foot-tall statues of every queen that ruled Drakkenheim.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Crater Basin</h3>\n<p>The meteor that annihilated Drakkenheim landed in the South Ward, shattering part of the wall dividing the Inner and Outer City. Little remains of the original buildings save wreckage and the gaping crater. Swirling mists fill the Crater while an eldritch storm rages overhead. It is perhaps the most dangerous and contaminated region in Drakkenheim. No expedition into its depths has ever returned to tell the tale — except for Lucretia Mathias, leader of the Followers of the Falling Fire. Today, the Chapel of Saint Gresha by the Crater's Edge is a destination for the faction's pilgrims seeking to partake in their most sacred rituals.</p>\n<p>Exceptionally dangerous creatures dwell here, including @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.107anomolluskkkk]{Anomollusks}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.117craterwurm000]{Crater Wurms}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.123elementalcont]{Contaminated Elementals}, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.128eldritchcata0]{Eldritch Cataclysms}, and @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimHor01.JournalEntryPage.108arcanewraithh]{Arcane Wraiths}.</p>\n<p>Pulsing at the Crater's center is the throbbing Delerium Heart, a massive formation of the magical crystals which was the core of the meteor itself.

Its large, elongated maw opens to reveal one hundred thin translucent tentacles that lash and dart out like one hundred tongues. Its wet skin is a mottled grayish purple, shimmering in unknown colors impossible to comprehend.</p>\n  <p>The Haze disperses in an instant as it rises from the Crater. Its four muscular arms end in hands with eight long spindly fingers, each tipped with a delerium clawed nail. Its large digitigrade legs end in veiny black hooves, and its rigid spine extends into three long, tentacle-like tails. The smell of ozone and sulfur fill the air, and a deep and booming voice utters words incomprehensible in a cadence unrecognizable to the human ear, merely coming through as a muffled tone of booming bass and high-pitched wails that causes your brain to seer in pain.</p>\n</div>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef01.JournalEntryPage.45biotheworldend inline]\n\n<aside>\n  <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n    <h1>Mysterious origin</h1>\n    <p>Characters who confront The World Ender are the first to ever do so: none in the World of Drakkenheim have encountered this creature before nor know of its existence.

This isn't because you will suddenly forget how to read but more likely you will lose your eyes, an arm, the ability to comprehend language, or just die, and it's because some of you won't take this seriously. My name is Pluto Jackson and I am the greatest threat to the monsters of Westemar and beyond. This is my book entirely written by me! Well, it was written by some lowly scholar but completely guided and dictated by me. In it, you will find a compendium of truths and treasures about the greatest foes found throughout the known worlds. I have walked, run, flown, jumped, and fallen through portals and pathways to discover the intricate understanding of how these foes are put together and more importantly how to pull them apart.</p>\n    <p>Some of the stories you've heard about me are completely under-exaggerated. I have found myself in deep dungeons facing the brightest minds who staple body parts together. I have ventured into forests to hunt my troll rivals. I have crossed barriers into places where time moves in all directions. I have found myself fighting off dark creatures with a strange fascination with my neck. I have even spent entirely too much time breathing in the toxic air of Drakkenheim—all so I could bring this great knowledge to you.</p>\n    <p>Do not leave this book on your coffee table. It is not meant to be ornamental; it is factual and brilliant. Filled to the brim with drawings of the most hostile creatures, along with their tactics and fears. I have assembled this once-in-a-lifetime encyclopedia to help the weak and helpless achieve something big, something greater than themselves. A chance to walk a mile in the greaves of Pluto Jackson.</p>\n    <p>You're welcome!</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p class=\"signature\">Pluto Jackson</p>\n</div>"

When reading this book, text in bold usually references a creature or non-player character stat block, while text in italics often indicates spells or magic items.</p>\n<p><strong>The material in this book is meant for Game Masters!</strong> Many dark secrets and ancient conspiracies are explained in the lore entries for the monsters in this book! Here's what you'll find within these pages:</p>\n<h2>New Monsters</h2>\n<p>Chapters 1 to 8 feature new eldritch monstrosities, mutated beasts, and undead horrors spanning multiple tiers of play from CR 1 to CR 30. Each chapter features in-depth lore entries about the monsters, unique roleplaying traits, deadly combat tactics, and adventure locations with tactical maps.</p>\n<h3>Epic Bosses</h3>\n<p>Among the creatures detailed in this tome are mighty adversaries called Epic Bosses. These formidable creatures present a potent variation on legendary monsters intended as a solo threat to an entire adventuring party. General rules for Epic Bosses are described later in this introduction. In addition, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApp0A]{Appendix A: Ancient Entities} features Epic Boss game statistics for eldritch beings inhabiting the otherworlds of Drakkenheim!</p>\n<h3>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</h3>\n<p>This book also updates game statistics for many monsters introduced in <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em>. If you're running that adventure, we've created these new monsters to fit within the ecology and challenge within that adventure. Furthermore, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApp0B]{Appendix B: Faction Agents} describes humanoid NPC game statistics representing members of the five factions originally introduced in <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote parchment\">\n  <blockquote class=\"quote\">\n    <p>They call it Dungeons of Drakkenheim, but I don't remember any dungeons!

This means that the affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themselves early on a success.</p>\n<h2>Monster Harvesting and Magic Item Crafting</h2>\n<p>This tome introduces a new way for player characters to craft magic items and equipment using components harvested from slain monsters.</p>\n<p>The full rules are presented in @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApp0D]{Appendix D: Crafting &amp; Harvesting}. Our crafting system emphasizes adventuring to collect rare components, rather than spending gold, taking extended downtime, and making random skill checks. Instead, all characters need to do is find the parts required for an item, then bring those parts to an appropriate workshop.</p>\n<h3>Harvesting Components</h3>\n<p>Each monster entry in this book includes a Harvesting Components section, listing the components player characters can collect from it. Each monster's part has a <strong>Rarity</strong> from uncommon to legendary, defined by its challenge rating. These are detailed in @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApp0D]{Appendix D: Crafting &amp; Harvesting}</p>\n<h3>New Magic Items</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApp0E]{Appendix E: Magic Items} features dozens of new magic items, and recipes for each!</p>"

These are meant to be difficult encounters where the player characters must expend every remaining resource if they are to survive. This is counterbalanced by the expectation that an Epic Boss usually represents the final encounter of an adventure or story arc, so the player characters will be able to take a long rest and recuperate immediately afterwards.</p>\n<p>As such, Epic Bosses have also been designed with the assumption that they need to bear the full brunt of the player characters “big guns,” such as <em>Divine Smites</em>, Action Surges, and spellcaster's highest level spells.</p>\n<p>When creating encounters with an Epic Boss, consider carefully before adding any minions to support them in battle. If you want to make the encounter more challenging, consider adding traps, hazards, or other environmental factors before adding additional creatures to the mix.</p>\n<h3>Epic Bosses and Challenge Rating</h3>\n<p>The table below shows the recommended Challenge Rating for an Epic Boss given the player characters' level. Note that since Epic Bosses scale to the number of player characters, it is not necessary to use a higher Challenge Rating Epic Boss for larger or smaller parties.</p>\n<table>\n  <caption>\n    Epic Boss Challenge\n  </caption>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Character Level</th>\n      <th>Recommended Epic Boss Challenge Rating</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5th to 6th</td>\n      <td>CR 7–10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7th to 9th</td>\n      <td>CR 11–14</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10th to 13th</td>\n      <td>CR 15–18</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>14th or higher</td>\n      <td>CR 19+</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Characters of 4th level and lower do not have the Hit Points and resources to survive encounters with Epic Bosses, unless they are substantially more powerful than expected due to high ability scores, magic items, or player skill.</p>"

The once-proud capital of Westemär is a desolate urban wasteland, ravaged by an eldritch storm of falling stars fifteen years ago. The disaster that day was merely a prelude to the horrors that followed. Once the octarine flames that engulfed the city died down, a thick eerie mist remained behind. By night, a billowing aurora of prismatic light appeared, dancing over the city's corpse. Now, the forlorn streets are haunted by mutated monsters, twisted abominations, and undead wretches created by the otherworldly forces which have taken root in the ruins.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"dropcap\" aria-hidden=\"true\">T</span>\n  <span aria-hidden=\"true\">his</span>\n  <span class=\"visually-hidden\">This</span>\n  book expands upon the setting introduced in our adventure <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim,</em> which details the ruined city and five factions warring over it. The wider world beyond Drakkenheim is detailed in the setting book <em>Sebastian Crowe's Guide to Drakkenheim.</em> Throughout this book, you may find references to locations in Drakkenheim itself, as well as places in the neighboring nations of Westemär, Elyria, and Caspia. While we recommend consulting these books for the full information, here are a few details about the setting.\n</p>\n<h2>Quick Facts About the Setting</h2>\n<p>The setting of Drakkenheim diverges from the default assumptions of Fifth Edition in four key ways:</p>\n<p class=\"hanging-indent\"><strong>The gods are silent and distant. </strong>They don't manifest physically nor speak with worshippers, and do not interfere in earthly matters. Planar cosmology is mysterious and unknowable, but sages have still developed many conflicting (and wildly incorrect) theories.</p>\n<p class=\"hanging-indent\"><strong>Gods don't grant divine spellcasting powers. </strong>Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins tap into sacred energies through devotion, meditation, and resolve. Violating one's religious tenets won't result in a loss of these abilities, but a crisis of faith might.</p>\n<p class=\"hanging-indent\"><strong>Individuals can't become wizards through study alone.</strong> The arcane magic of both sorcerers and wizards alike is borne in the blood, which may be harnessed via practice and study. An important treaty between nations known as the <em>Edicts of Lumen</em> bars arcane spellcasters from holding noble titles.</p>\n<p class=\"hanging-indent\"><strong>High-level NPCs and spellcasters are exceptionally rare in the wider world. </strong>Despite their few numbers, such people still have a profound impact on society. However, Drakkenheim has attracted an uncommonly high concentration of such individuals.</p>\n<h2>Delerium</h2>\n<p>Delerium crystals are found throughout the ruined streets of Drakkenheim, jutting forth from piles of rubble, spreading along crumbling walls like crystalline moss, and glowing within the gaping crater. These iridescent stones radiate with vast magical energies which induce madness and mutate any matter they touch. While most deposits were left behind by the falling stars which devastated the city, the magical crystals slowly sprout and grow as their contaminated energies spread.</p>\n<p>Although the crystals are dangerous, their tremendous magical potential makes them especially valuable to arcane spellcasters of all kinds. Delerium is readily used as the material component for nearly any spell, and the crystals can store and contain powerful magical essences which may in turn be used to power magical weapons, equipment, and other arcane contraptions. As such, the stones command a high price amongst mages and occultists alike, and an influential gray market has developed around prospecting, extracting, transporting, and selling the crystals. Nevertheless, the true origins and full properties of delerium have yet to be discovered.</p>\n<h3>The Haze</h3>\n<p>Swirling mists filled with indescribable colors of greenish yellow-purple settled over Drakkenheim. This magical mist is the visible byproduct of the intense magical radiation emitted by the vast concentration of delerium in the ruins. Normal creatures slowly gain contamination the longer they linger within the Haze and cannot benefit from a long rest while they remain inside it.</p>\n\n<aside>\n  <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n    <h1>Dungeons of Drakkenheim &amp; Sebastian Crowe's Guide to Drakkenheim</h1>\n    <p>This book further expands the world originally presented in our adventure <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> and builds on the background lore for the wider world featured in <em>Sebastian Crowe's Guide to Drakkenheim</em>. If you own a copy of either book and are planning to run the campaign, you'll find a wealth of information herein to expand the campaign.</p>\n    <p><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> is confined to the city of Drakkenheim itself, and covers the factions, conflicts, and locations within that city in detail. This book makes references to characters, locations, and the original five factions from that campaign, including the Amethyst Academy, the Followers of the Falling Fire, the Knights of the Silver Order, the Queen's Men, and the Hooded Lanterns.</p>\n    <p>If you don't have a copy of <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em>, don't worry! While the lore and adventure hooks for the monsters are created with the campaign in mind, you should feel free to use the new monsters in your own campaign, reflavoring or adapting their lore and appearance to suit your setting.</p>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<aside>\n  <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n    <h1>Content Warning</h1>\n    <p>Drakkenheim portrays a dark fantasy world. We recommend players and Game Masters have an open conversation at the start of the campaign to discuss their lines and veils. In support of this conversation, please note references to the following are common in this setting:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Violence, murder, blood, gore, cannibalism, and body horror.</li>\n      <li>Degenerative mutations which cause physical disfigurement and madness/insanity.</li>\n      <li>Rats, spiders, insects, demons, undead, ghosts, and other monsters.</li>\n      <li>Natural disasters, large-scale loss of life, civil war, displaced persons, refugees.</li>\n      <li>Moral ambiguity, social/political manipulation, religious zealotry, military nationalism</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Explicit sexuality, sexual assault, racial prejudice, systemic racism, homophobia, and transphobia are not topics we want to explore in this world. Any inferences of such are wholly unintentional.</p>\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<h2>Factions of Drakkenheim</h2>\n<p>Five factions clash over the ruins of Drakkenheim, each vying for control over the ruins and the delerium found there. Their agents are regularly encountered in the world at large seeking to recruit new heroes to join their cause and additional resources to aid their embattled forces in the fallen capital.</p>\n<h3>Hooded Lanterns</h3>\n<p>Formally known as the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, the Hooded Lanterns are an irregular military drawn up from veterans of the Civil War and remnants of the old Drakkenheim City Watch. Led by the dour Lord Commander Elias Drexel, they wage a guerrilla war against the monsters, bandits, and scavengers that have taken root in their nation's capital. Each has pledged their swords and lives to rebuild Drakkenheim and restore the Realm of Westemär. Several noble houses have set aside their feuds to support the Hooded Lantern's efforts. These families believe once the city is restored, evidence will emerge revealing the true heir to the throne of Drakkenheim... or enable a cunning house to seize the crown.</p>\n<h3>Queen's Men</h3>\n<p>The Queen's Men are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands, outlaws, and scoundrels, all owing fealty to the enigmatic Queen of Thieves. These reprobates prey upon the pilgrims, prospectors, and explorers drawn to the city, extort and rob adventurers, smuggle delerium to disreputable clients in distant lands, and plunder the fantastic treasures and incredible wealth left behind in the city. The Queen of Thieves dreams of building an influential and powerful criminal empire forged in the anarchy and lawlessness of the ruins, conspiring against the other factions at every turn.</p>\n<h3>Knights of the Silver Order</h3>\n<p>The Knights of Silver Order are an organization of oath-bound paladins and devout warriors sworn to combat supernatural evil, dark magic, and otherworldly incursions. The questing knights normally travel the realms in small bands and companies, and adhere to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the dominant religion across the continent. They believe delerium is a contaminating blight borne of the darkest chaos, and have resolved to annihilate the corrupted crystals, slay every monster it has created, and hunt down diabolical mages who would wield its power to work evil magic. Now an entire regiment has been dispatched to Drakkenheim to carry out this righteous task, led by Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal.</p>\n<h3>Followers of the Falling Fire</h3>\n<p>The annihilation of Drakkenheim incited a serious religious schism within the Faith of the Sacred Flame. A new sect has emerged known as the Followers of the Falling Fire, who adhere to the prophecies of former Flamekeeper Lucretia Mathias. She attests that delerium is a divine gift, not a blight, and that these sacred stones will offer salvation against a greater darkness yet to come. The mainstream clergy have excommunicated Lucretia Mathias and branded her followers as an insane cult with heretical beliefs and blasphemous practices. Even still, masses of devout commonfolk now embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to Drakkenheim to take their place in a divine plan.</p>\n<h3>Amethyst Academy</h3>\n<p>The Amethyst Academy is a magical school for sorcerers and wizards where students learn magic in remote castles and secluded universities. Directed by a shadowy cabal of powerful archmages, the Academy also operates an enterprising mage guild that controls the manufacture of magical wares and orchestrates an influential arcane syndicate that provides occult counsel to the nobility of the continent. However, the Academy was dealt a terrible blow following Drakkenheim's destruction, as the city was home to their greatest stronghold: the Inscrutable Tower. Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver leads the Academy's efforts to access the tower and safeguard the secret lore within. Meanwhile, their survey teams conduct ongoing re- search regarding delerium's supernatural qualities and unknown dangers. The mages plan to harness the crystal's vast energies to craft magical items and power new arcane spells.</p>\n\n<aside>\n  <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n    <h1>The Original Drakkenheim Campaign</h1>\n    <p>The material in this book is based on the<em> Dungeons of Drakkenheim </em>live stream campaign broadcast by the Dungeon Dudes, which ran from October 2018 to December 2019, and the follow up campaigns<em> Shadows of Drakkenheim</em> (which ran from January 2020 to December 2021), <em>Untold Tales of Drakkenheim</em> (played in 2020 and 2021), and <em>Fate of Drakkenheim </em>(which began in 2022).</p>\n    <p>It featured Kelly McLaughlin as Sebastian Crowe and Wilhelm Wolfsbane, Jill Danitis as Veo Sjena and Rudi Whittaker, Joe O'Gorman as Pluto Jackson and Wrath, with Monty Martin as Game Master.</p>\n    <p>You can watch it on the Dungeon Dudes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/dungeondudes\">YouTube Channel</a> and find it on most major podcast platforms. Check it out if you're looking for inspiration for how we ran the adventures in this book, but be warned: spoilers abound! We've also created a wealth of instruction videos for players and game masters covering everything about tabletop roleplaying games, from character building to designing campaigns.</p>\n    <p>The World of Drakkenheim is a vast and ever-expanding place, and this book focuses the many monsters our heroes have battled over the course of the campaign. We've done our best to include as many monsters and nonplayer characters from the show in this book as possible, and we've included many more completely new ones for you to explore in your own game.</p>\n    <p>We think of our original livestream campaign as the “first draft” of our world, and as the World of Drakkenheim has grown, we've occasionally made the odd change, and several retcons too. If you've watched the original series and notice an inconsistency between this book and the show (there are many), the version in this book takes precedence. On the flipside, you should feel empowered to alter, change, and expand the material here, especially if doing so builds stronger connections or better stories for you and your players.</p>\n    <p>The events of our original campaigns are non-canonical with regards to this book, so several elements of Drakkenheim strongly connected to the original characters have been altered or removed. If you wish, the original “Drakkenforce” and “Duskwardens” characters may appear in your campaign as rival adventurers, but their stories have been set aside herein so your players may take center stage.</p>\n  </div>\n</aside>"

These special circumstances have produced several unique groups of monsters which operate in a much more unified and coherent fashion—at least, compared to the ravening horrors and Delerium Dregs wandering the Haze. Initially banding together with others in order to survive, the most successful packs have carved out their own domains and territories within the ruined streets of Drakkenheim. Each has proven their mettle in battle against each other, the Hooded Lanterns, and expeditionary groups alike, each securing their own niche within the predatory hierarchy of the ruins.\n</p>\n\n<p>While the ratlings are among the first of such groups most adventurers encounter in the Outer City of Drakkenheim, this chapter introduces several other notable monster families dwelling in Drakkenheim: the furious @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimPre04.JournalEntryPage.405hazewindharpi]{Hazewind Harpies} who rule the high spires, the ferocious @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimPre04.JournalEntryPage.402garmyr0000000]{Garmyr} wardogs who make their hunting grounds within the embattled Cathedral District, and the fishlike @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimPre04.JournalEntryPage.403deepdregs0000]{Deep Dregs} lurking within contaminated waterways beneath the city.

Covered in thick fur, Garmyr coloration and features vary from houndlike to wolflike, but all bare sharp teeth and claws. They form hyper-aggressive and predatory warpacks equipped with weapons taken from the many failed attempts to reclaim the city.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Garmyr revel in their countless battles with adventurers, the Hooded Lanterns, and the Knights of the Silver Order for control over the Inner City of Drakkenheim. Although the roving warpacks make this district their primary hunting ground, Garmyr raiders have sallied forth from the ruins to plunder the countryside with increasing frequency. They live for the thrill of the hunt, taunting their prey as they pursue them into merciless ambushes. Though the warpacks are prone to infighting, a massive beast known as the Lord of the Feast rules the Garmyr as their overlord. When this terrifying monster calls the packs to battle, all the Garmyr set aside their enmity for one another to join the blood hunt.</p>\n\n<p>Where exactly the Garmyr came from isn't clear. The popular belief amongst the Hooded Lanterns is that the Garmyr originated from mutated stray canines left behind in the city during its destruction, since the appearance and behavior of the Garmyr is not dissimilar to packs of wild dogs. However, amongst the Garmyr have been sighted hunters and thaumaturges bearing the symbols similar to Kromac, the old god of beasts and slaughter, suggesting the Garmyr have some sort of connection to the bloodthirsty deity.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Traits</h2>\n\n<p>Although they are cunning hunters, Garmyr care little for conversation, and even less for parley—and they seldom show mercy. Garmyr speak bits of Common, but typically communicate with one another through barks and growls. Adventurers and faction agents who have attempted to communicate peacefully with Garmyr are ignored at best, and more often eaten.</p>\n\n<p>However, a few bold explorers have managed to observe Garmyr where they make their encampments, recording their behavior when not on the prowl.</p>\n\n<h3>Trophies</h3>\n\n<p>It seems that amongst the warpacks, strength and skill in the hunt is shown utmost respect. Garmyr display their trophies proudly to demonstrate their kills not only to their prey, but to each other. A twisted sort of hierarchy has formed, with the most accomplished and ferocious Garmyr leading the pack</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.C6sGOXNX872FHKUq rollable]\n\n<h3>Scars of Battle</h3>\n\n<p>The fear of all Garmyr is to become wounded or decrepit with age, so that they can no longer partake in the hunt. However, elder Garmyr wear scars that identify their experience. The more battle-worn a Garmyr is, the more respect they garner from their peers.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.NQFCRirPA4GTlEAW rollable]\n\n<h3>Warpacks</h3>\n\n<p>The Hooded Lanterns have encountered several distinct warpacks within the ruins, identified by these names.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The Gray Hounds</strong> are a pack of gray-furred hunters who have taken up positions along the city, holding Temple Gate. They wear rusted armor scraps taken from the city armories, and even adorn themselves in tattered green cloaks to mock the Hooded Lanterns.</li>\n  <li><strong> The Blood Fangs </strong>are a vicious group of Garmyr wandering the Outer City, known predators of ratlings who adorn themselves in ratling pelts and skulls.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Tower Dogs </strong>are an Inner City pack in a constant state of battle against the hazewind harpies near the Central Market Place. They wear feathered capes and harpy talons around their necks.</li>\n  <li><strong>The Lord's Butchers</strong> are the personal warpack of the Lord of the Feast. They wear human skull pauldrons and cloaks stitched of the flesh of adventurers, covering themselves in the blood of their enemies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>The Garmyr are skilled hunters, and know how to use the ruins to their advantage. They have hunted the streets of Drakkenheim for years and know when and where to strike. They do not hide in the shadows, but rather howl and yip their way through the streets, surrounding prey and flanking with staggering precision. They revel in the fear they cause, and the thrill of the chase, the hunt, and the kill. Groups of adventurers, larger beasts, and some of the more iconic monsters of the city require a bit more tact. When it comes to this, the Garmyr lay clever ambush paths, sometimes sending some of their pack to lure a group of adventurers or a beast into a strategic location where they can surround it and ambush it.</p>\n\n<h2>Locations and Lairs</h2>\n\n<h3>Temple Gate</h3>\n\n<p>A shanty town of crude hovels and wood platforms surround the once proud gate. This is now the forward command post of the Garmyr, and they use it to ward off adventurers and any creatures aiming to enter or leave the city proper. The streets leading to the gate on either side are rigged with death traps, pits, spiked logs, and all manner of crudely made effigies of bone and blood.</p>\n\n<h3>Temple Ward and The Sprawl</h3>\n\n<p>These are the prime hunting grounds for the Garmyr and throughout them are many forward camps and burrows dug into old, abandoned buildings or piles of rubble and ruins. A Garmyr camp is easily identified by the smell of cooking flesh and hanging bones and meat on hooks. The Garmyr decorate their favorite campsites with such symbols as to inform other Garmyr that this is a good place to set up camp for a hunt in the area.</p>\n\n<h3>St. Vitruvio's Cathedral</h3>\n\n<p>This is the home of the Lord of the Feast and his most loyal dog soldiers. The cathedral is covered in blood and gore, with the many victims of the lord's hunt hanging on meat hooks throughout the cathedral. The once divine building now lies in ruin, more akin to a slaughterhouse than a place of worship. The brazier that once held the sacred flame is now a monument of skulls and blood, identifying the grim blasphemy of its new occupants.</p>\n\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n\n<h3>Hunter / Hunted</h3>\n\n<p>A rather aggressive warpack has been hunting in the sprawl and making travel dangerous for all adventurers, prospectors, and many of the factions. Someone must track down this warpack and put an end to their hunt.</p>\n\n<h3>Dog Soldiers</h3>\n\n<p>A group of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApp0B.JournalEntryPage.2005hoodedlanter#hooded-lantern-scout]{Hooded Lantern Scouts} find themselves cut off. They send up a flare for aid, locking themselves inside an old cabin. They must survive the night with a group of ravenous @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimPre04.JournalEntryPage.402garmyr0000000#garmyr$1]{Garmyr} making every attempt to break in and eat them.</p>\n\n<h3>Garmyr Warriors</h3>\n\n<p>A pack of grizzled, bipedal canines charges toward you, howling with fury. They brandish scavenged weaponry and wear patchwork armor stitched together from the rotting hides of their previous kills. Some wear macabre jewelry made from fingers, ears, bones, and teeth. Their frothing mouths are filled with jagged teeth as they bark and growl.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"banner\">Garmyr</h1>\n\n<p>Drakkenheim was once home to packs of wild dogs on the city's outskirts, as well as the trusted pets of locals in nearby farms and villages. When the meteor fell, every creature was changed. It's still unclear if the Garmyr are mutated dogs, humans transformed by the Haze into snarling beasts, or a combination of both. Regardless, the deadly Garmyr, led by the monstrous Lord of the Feast, roam the streets in packs hunting adventurers, travelers, and anything they can find.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"banner\">Garmyr Bloodhound</h2>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.88imgrmyr0000000 inline]\n\n<h4>Statblock: @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.monsters.Actor.k111iWES8qzLdto8]{Garmyr Bloodhound}</h4>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">Lurking behind the pack is a Garmyr wearing a tattered cloak and hood, leaving only its snarling snout exposed and its red eyes glowing from the dark shroud.

Although they have similar origins to Delerium Dregs, many of these so-called Deep Dregs have become thralls to an eldritch entity dwelling deeper in the sewers of Drakkenheim known as the Duchess. This nightmarish horror lurks deep below Drakkenheim's forsaken waterways, slowly amassing contaminated minions while fostering dark dreams to usurp control of the surface.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Deep Dregs patrol the sewers and waterways of Drakkenheim while making forays onto the surface to gather supplies or take captives. Despite the ambitions of the Duchess, Deep Dregs are peculiarly social, and frequently do not attack explorers and faction agents when they encounter them. Rather, Deep Dregs can be indifferent or even helpful in some cases. However, beneath the surface lurks a monstrous plot, as the Duchess commands her Deep Dregs to seek out fresh subjects.</p>\n\n<p>The Duchess's body secretes contaminating mucus. When this slime is combined with delerium and used to contaminate a humanoid creature, that individual transforms into a Deep Dreg should they succumb to a monstrous transformation. Mortals with significant martial or magical talents may instead become deep knights or deep sirens.

While a few of their number might begin to parley, others lurk in the water, waiting for an opportune moment to strike. Especially when facing uncontaminated humanoids, Deep Dregs prefer to attack from the water since they know their foes are hesitant to risk contamination.</p>\n\n<p>Often, Deep Dregs attempt to subdue their foes instead of killing them so they can bring live captives back to the Duchess, where she will transform the captives into fresh thralls.

They wear little more than ragged clothing and scraps of leather armor, and carry a brace of javelins, a spear, and a fishing net.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef01.JournalEntryPage.86bioepdregs0000 inline]\n\n<div class=\"blockquote parchment\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>If you have to fight it don't do it in water because it likes that and you won't.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"banner\">Deep Knight</h2>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.97imgepdregs0000 inline]\n\n<h4>Statblock: @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.monsters.Actor.lIcf5wEO0JJbUcwl]{Deep Knight}</h4>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">Towering over the other Deep Dregs is a muscle-bound warrior with a head shaped like a hammerhead shark.

Most impressive are the grotesque gargoyles of stone, marble, and cast bronze which resemble winged fiends or ferocious dragons. However, these are no mere ornamentations. Centuries ago, the reigning monarch of Drakkenheim, Hildegarde von Drakken I, secretly used the power of the Crown of Westemär to bring these statues to life to serve as protectors for the city. These magical constructs were bound to the will of the monarch, but also answered to the commands of any who bore one of the six Seals of Westemär. Although rumors swelled about the living statues of Drakkenheim, the common folk never truly knew the full extent of the stone guardians watching over them.\n</p>\n\n<p>During Ulrich von Kessel IV's last moments as the meteor overwhelmed the city, a final command was given to the constructs: “Protect Drakkenheim and its people!” However, the magical energies of the Haze have contaminated even these guardians, and the ambiguity of the king's last order has been corrupted in their construct minds. They enact a twisted interpretation which sets them upon any who dare trespass into the city, and view the mutated inhabitants of Drakkenheim as the very citizens they are charged to protect.</p>\n\n<p>This has made adventuring into the city even more dangerous, and getting into the Inner City has proven difficult as scaling the walls or attempting to fly over them immediately draws the attention of the defenders. Approaching the castle has proven nearly impossible, and as for Slaughterstone Square, the small handful of survivors who have seen it simply encourage any traveling into the city to avoid it at all costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Traits</h2>\n\n<p>In the former glory of Drakkenheim the constructs of the city were bound to the crown and the holders of the seals of Drakkenheim. There are those who believe that obtaining all six seals would allow some control over the situation. Others think the contamination and Haze has caused an irreversible problem that can no longer be contained or controlled.</p>\n\n<h3>Distinguishing Decorations</h3>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.msqZqUXdaEjsjT2M rollable]\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Guardian constructs feel no pain, and know no fear. They are simply designed to protect the walls of the city, or the castle proper. They are relentless in their pursuit within the domains they occupy, but rarely chase a creature beyond their designated locations. The gargoyles and tower dragons stick to the city walls. Still, those who find themselves within the territories of these constructs are pursued by unflinching horror determined to protect its territory at all costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Locations and Lairs</h2>\n\n<h3>City Walls, Gates, and Towers</h3>\n\n<p>During the construction of Drakkenheim, the outer walls of the city were built with large gargoyles facing both inside and outside the city. The towers along the walls were each constructed with a beautiful ornate dragon perched atop it. Across Drakkenheim's walls, there are approximately 500 beautifully constructed statues. They now guard the towers and walls from anyone who attempts to climb or fly over them, and hunts any intruders with vicious determination.</p>\n\n<h3>Castle Drakken</h3>\n\n<p>When Castle Drakken was constructed, it followed suite with the design of the city walls and housed gargoyles perched along every tower and roof, as well as several alcoves and niches throughout the building. Each tower was placed with a bronze dragon coiled along its roof. The central tower houses a massive statue of a dragon much more ornate and well decorated than the rest. The statue, named Minazorond, was built by the eccentric Liberio artist Nicoletti, and animated by a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell. It now acts as the sworn protector of the castle.</p>\n\n<h3>Slaughterstone Square</h3>\n\n<p>A great construct built by the Glitterpeak dwarves, recovered from the ruins and brought to Drakkenheim, was deemed “The Executioner” and designed to carry out the death sentence in Drakkenheim. The massive construct was a spectacle that many who traveled to the city would stop to witness. Now it haunts the square, consumed by a need to execute any living creature that enters its domain. Its original programming is confused—it deems anyone who sets foot in Slaughterstone Square a criminal worthy of the harshest sentence.</p>\n\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n\n<h3>Scale the Walls</h3>\n\n<p>Climbing the walls of Drakkenheim might still be one of the better ways into the city, and if a patch of the walls can be cleared of its constructs, perhaps there is a way to make a permanent entry point for those hoping to enter the city.</p>\n\n<h3>Reset</h3>\n\n<p>Perhaps there is a way to reset the programming of the constructs of Drakkenheim. If all the seals can be uncovered and brought to the throne room, control over the constructs could be a turning point in saving the city.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"banner\">Guardian Constructs</h1>\n\n<p class=\"drop-cap\">Once animated by royal decree, these corrupt guardians now regard everyone and everything as a hostile trespassers and invaders assaulting the rule of Drakkenheim.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"banner\">Wall Gargoyle</h2>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRef03.JournalEntryPage.100imgrdianconst inline]\n\n<h4>Statblock: @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.monsters.Actor.0ZP2Si5z0cTG7pha]{Wall Gargoyle}</h4>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">These winged creatures resemble fiendish bats, often with grotesque exaggerated grinning or snarling faces.

The harpies are some mutated combination of humanoid and avian, though it is believed many of them were once birds who occupied the towers in the city, now twisted by the Haze and corruption.\n</p>\n\n<p>You can find these creatures nesting in the tallest structures throughout the city and prowling the skies, making aerial travel within the city exceptionally dangerous. The harpies have managed to make uneasy alliances with other flying monsters throughout the city and are known to befriend manticores, who they often use as brute protectors of their territories, as well as keeping the awful skretches nearby as additional problems for any who would threaten them.</p>\n\n<p>Their songs echo through the streets of the city and have a haunting effect on those who draw close. From a distance, travelers may feel a building tension or a sense of unease when the chorus of disarming melodies hits them. Those closer to the harpies may be drawn in by the tunes, or even find themselves entranced by them. Some who have heard the songs have felt a strange sense of dream-like wonder, only to snap out of it by being plucked off the ground by the harpies. Most who hear the melodies do not live to share their stories.</p>\n\n<p>The clock tower has become the roost of their leader, the Crimson Countess. While the harpies hunt the streets of the city and attack anything that attempts to fly in or out, they all answer the call of the Crimson Countess, who loves plucking adventurers from the streets, and protects her tower with ferocity and cunning. She enjoys the tower for its open concept—perfect for flinging foolish adventurers who dare challenge her domain.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Traits</h2>\n\n<p>The hazewind harpies are loyal to their chain of command, and all serve the matriarchs and crones of their communities. They are proud warriors who are well trained combatants and skilled hunters.</p>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Hazewind harpies stick to the skies and high towers, relying on ranged attacks to down their foes. Stronger harpies swoop in and pluck their enemies off the street, lifting them into the air before dropping them to their death. When possible, harpies find perches, rafters, balconies, or other higher vantage points to take cover, attacking from these optimal positions.</p>\n\n<p>Harpies attack as a unit and almost always travel in a flock. If a harpy is alone, it usually means it is lost or it has allies nearby.</p>\n\n<h2>Locations and Lairs</h2>\n\n<h3>The Cosmological Clock Tower</h3>\n\n<p>The Crimson Countess makes her lair in the great clock tower in Market Square. Her and her greatest champions occupy the tower, claiming the central streets of Drakkenheim as their territory. Any who have opposed the Crimson Countess must climb the tower's dangerous stairs while fending off harpies. The Crimson Countess herself has knocked many would-be heroes to their death from the highest balconies of the clock tower. It is an incredibly defendable position for flying creatures, and one not easily taken.</p>\n\n<h3>Old Town Towers</h3>\n\n<p>Many ancient towers now lie in ruin within Old Town. These were once command posts for the original city guard and older temples in the city. Most of these locations have been occupied by harpy nests, and the streets are now a hunting ground for the avian huntresses</p>\n\n<h2>Adventure Hooks</h2>\n\n<h3>Disturbing the Nest:</h3>\n\n<p>A group of harpies led by a deadly crone has occupied a small watchtower in the sprawl and the surrounding area has become a death trap for navigating or traversing. Someone needs to put those harpies down and make travel through the sprawl at least mildly safer.</p>\n\n<h3>Break a Few Eggs</h3>\n\n<p>An apothecary in Drakkenheim is paying good money for anyone willing to obtain a harpy egg for them for an experiment. It needs to be undamaged and unhatched in order to work. So whoever gets it needs to also make it out of the city without taking more than half their Hit Points in damage, otherwise the egg will be ruined.</p>\n\n<h3>Out to Lunch</h3>\n\n<p>The harpies have plucked a group of Queen's Men or Hooded Lanterns from the city streets and taken them back to their roost. We need someone to go get them out, but the roost is likely swarming with harpies, so stealth will be key.</p>\n\n<h1 class=\"banner\">Hazewind Harpies</h1>\n\n<p>\n  <span class=\"dropcap\" aria-hidden=\"true\">T</span>\n  <span aria-hidden=\"true\">he</span>\n  <span class=\"visually-hidden\">The</span>\n  witch-covens of the Hazewind Harpies rule the skies over the Inner City of Drakkenheim.

The back alleys and basements of the Sprawl teemed with rats, and countless more prowled the sewers. As a result, many households kept cats, and the city even commissioned a Rat Trapper's Guild to help control the rat population to little avail. When the city fell to ruin, the problem grew much, much worse. Delerium mutated the rats into ratlings, hideous monsters imbued with a malevolent cunning, and driven by a mad compulsion to consume and multiply.\n</p>\n\n<p>Ratlings grow to the size of a gnome or halfling, with big eyes and ears, and large, pointed noses. They are slender creatures, covered with matted, coarse fur, and with thick hairless tails longer than their bodies. Today, thousands of ratlings dwell in Drakkenheim, lurking in underground burrows and subterranean tunnels. An individual ratling is far from the most fearsome threat in Drakkenheim, but these verminous multitudes present a creeping, gnawing danger that could one day grow beyond any other.</p>\n\n<h2>Mutated Vermin</h2>\n\n<p>Ratlings begin their lives as ordinary rats. Born in the contaminated sewers and subterranean tunnels of Drakkenheim, their pups feed on carrion tainted with eldritch contamination. The continual ingestion of delerium accelerates their development and mutation, allowing a ratling pup to reach maturity in just a few weeks. A ratling can live for five to seven years, although many die from infighting or accidents within their first year or two.</p>\n\n<p>Granted a warped intellect by delerium, ratlings suffer from a constant internal struggle between their cowardly survival instincts and violent and impulsive urges. Ratlings dream of eating everything, and will eat anything, but especially love eating people. They have acquired an appetite for humans that are easy to capture, kill, and devour such as children and the elderly, and especially babies. While they can subsist on carrion, ratlings prefer fresh meat, and will take captives back to their lairs.</p>\n\n<p>Despite their innate madness and violent predilections, ratlings are industrious and will fashion makeshift gear from scavenged equipment, favoring long knives, rusty spears, slings, and crossbows. They rarely wear armor, although they have been known to strap scrap metal pauldrons or an occasional breastplate onto their matted fur. Ratlings sometimes carry makeshift shields that once were shutters, tabletops, or parts of a door to defend themselves. Crafty and resourceful, a rare few ratlings have even learned to master the contaminated magic that created them, becoming powerful spellcasters.</p>\n\n<h2>Cunning Cowards</h2>\n\n<p>Ratlings display inherent naivety towards basic human concepts, especially kindness, empathy, and bravery. Many adventurers have made a grave mistake thinking ratlings are simple-minded fools. While ratlings care little for the lives of others, they value their own hide above all and will do just about anything to survive. Most are cowards who will flee at the first sign of a losing battle, willing to throw their best friend in the way of a hungry gator, a swarm of harpies, or a battle-ready group of adventurers if it ensures their own escape. When cornered or trapped, ratlings often break down in tears to beg for their lives, and offer delerium, information, or help infiltrating or sneaking through the city in exchange for their life. Those who have survived the longest usually become cunning warriors and clan leaders, and tend to develop skills in manipulation, lying, and bargaining.</p>\n\n<p>Occasionally, adventurers exploring Drakkenheim make deals with ratlings they capture to act as guides into more treacherous parts of the city. Almost every time, the ratling eventually attempts a horrible betrayal. Ratlings are always waiting for the moment they can turn the situation in their favor, and lead their enemies into an ambush, or deliver them to the lair of a much more horrible monster.</p>\n\n<h2>Teeming Mass</h2>\n\n<p>Ratlings form colonies consisting of several closely related families. They work together to dig maze-like burrows that incorporate multiple entrances and tight looping passages. The biggest ratling usually leads the pack, though in some cases the smartest and most cunning can find themselves as leaders as well. Individual ratlings easily recognize others from their colony by scent, a trait which often foils adventurers trying to use disguises or trickery to infiltrate ratling burrows.</p>\n\n<p>However, ratling colonies are quite hostile to each other, fighting over food and territory. Indeed, ratlings spend more time fighting each other than any other creatures or factions in the ruins, which is probably why they haven't taken over Drakkenheim yet. Successful colonies grow in number rapidly, as ratlings mature in a matter of weeks when ample food and delerium are available. The largest and most powerful ratling colonies bully others into submission and rule over them. Fortunately, intense competition with other ratling colonies over a limited food supply, predation from other monsters, and constant clashes with explorers and the Hooded Lanterns keeps their population in check. Lacking these constraints, their numbers would quickly swell beyond all hope of containment.</p>\n\n<h2>The Shiny</h2>\n\n<p>Ratlings call delerium “the shiny” and value the crystals highly. It acts as both a food source and a means to induce quick and aggressive mutations. Ratlings scratch out their burrows around delerium deposits and bring a steady flow of delerium into their burrows. It's the ratlings' obsession with delerium that generally causes them to forgo their inherent cowardice in exchange for wild aggression. Researchers or even a group of adventurers harvesting or carrying delerium are a prime pick for an ambush. Ratlings will kill just about anything to get their hands on more delerium and continue expanding their colonies.</p>\n\n<h2>The Rat God</h2>\n\n<p>Many ratlings worship a fiendish entity they call the Rat God. Ratlings construct crude effigies to the Rat God, who whispers to the most cunning and intelligent ratlings, granting them magic through eldritch pacts. This nightmarish and malevolent demon encourages the ratlings to multiply, collect delerium, and consume everything. Ratlings believe that the Rat God grows in power and size as they themselves feed and breed, and that one day the ravenous entity will emerge in the Mortal World to eat everything in an apocalyptic feast known as the Great Gnaw. The ratlincgs seem indifferent or oblivious to the implication they too will be devoured by their hungry god.</p>\n\n<p>The Rat God is one of many powerful fiends inhabiting the cosmos that claims to be divine. Scholars of religion and the arcane postulate this being is likely not a true god and is more likely a rising demon lord. This technicality is utterly irrelevant to the Rat God's ratling worshippers. Although the Rat God cannot grant divine spells to its followers, they can create eldritch pacts, imbue ratlings with sorcerous powers, and inspire faith in a rare few truly devoted priests.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond these details, Ratlings understand surprisingly little about the Rat God, and make up stories and fables about the ravenous god's exploits (see the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimRat03.JournalEntryPage.302roleplayingtr#beliefs-about-the-rat-god]{\"Beliefs About the Rat God\"} table). Even warlocks and oracles devoted to the strange being speak more lies than truths about its depiction, deeds, and desires. The full game statistics for the Rat God are described in @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimApp0A]{Appendix A: Ancient Entities}.</p>"

Thousands upon thousands of vermin will pour from the sewers, ruins, burrows, and tunnels and into the streets and houses and, with the aid of the great Rat God, they will devour the world.</p>\n\n<h2>Murderous Monsters</h2>\n\n<p>As creatures born of otherworldly contamination, the ratlings are, above all else, gleeful and remorseless killers. They care little for their own wellbeing and the feelings and needs of others. The only thing a ratling cares about is their own goals, and how they can most easily obtain them. Although they will listen to reason, they only agree to cooperate with non-ratlings if they see an opportunity for themselves. Otherwise, they would rather simply murder every humanoid they see.</p>\n\n<h2>Manipulative and Cunning</h2>\n\n<p>Ratlings may not be the smartest creatures, but they know that other creatures are also driven by their goals and needs. When cornered and with little options left, they plead to the needs of their captors and promise anything, if it means their own survival. Oftentimes they are lying, but they will see their promises through until they can devise a better plan to backstab and murder their foes. Some ratlings have gone as far as being hired as guides and scouts to help adventurers enter Drakkenheim. They lead those parties safely through the maze of ruined streets, only to spring a ratling ambush, or bring them to the den of a more horrible monster and turn on them the moment the numbers are favorable.</p>\n\n<h2>Murderous Tendencies</h2>\n\n<p>Most ratlings are driven towards violence, though their motivation for doing so can vary from one to the next.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.S4QxUUrqmHFfgfHc rollable]\n\n<h2>Beliefs About the Rat God</h2>\n\n<p>Ratlings make up fantastic stories about the Rat God's wrath and cunning. In truth, they know little about the Rat God except it likes the shiny, and they perform cannibalistic rituals in its name. Ratlings love eating, so they love these rituals.</p>\n\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.C7sV57J59L4AXC6B rollable]</p>\n\n<h2>Irrational Fears</h2>\n\n<p>Many ratlings are driven by irrational fears, causing them to act in unusual ways.</p>\n\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.XSvSueCfvwTLKJN8 rollable]</p>\n\n<h2>Ratling Trinkets (What's in Their Pockets)</h2>\n\n<p>It's rare to find a ratling without something unusual kept among their personal effects.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.CMOorSQvRMKp2jtz rollable]\n\n<h2>Ratling Names</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to names, Ratlings tend to be very simple and disorganized in their naming conventions. Ratlings will sometimes name other ratlings at a young age, other times they completely forget to name the young and a ratling will name themselves once they can speak. Ratlings have been known to change their names from time to time based on the deeds they have accomplished, or their most notable achievement.</p>\n\n<p>Ratling names are usually inspired by the sounds they make, the things they do, or a notable deformity or oddity they have. For example, the Rat Prince simply gained that name by declaring himself as such after leading a horde of ratlings into the Rat's Nest Tavern and eating the Dregs swarming the streets in that part of the city. In the process, he found some jagged metal that resembled a crown, conquered the Rat's Nest Tavern, and declared himself the Rat Prince. Often, a ratling will be given a nickname after it does something, and the name just sticks.</p>\n\n<p>Ace, Acorn, Alfred, Almond, Belch, Biscuit, Big Nose, Biter, Boil, Booger, Bonecrack, Bones, Bone, Buttcrack, Burp, Cavity, Chew, Chewy, Chicken, Chip, Chungus, Chuckles, Claws, Clawed, Clips, Clot, Cookie, Cough, Crisp Rat, Critter, Drowner, Dig, Dug, Dave the Rat, Dumbhead, Eater, Eel, Egg, Famish, Feral, Fester, Footless, Forky, Four Eye, Gag, Gasher, Gerald, Glorp, Gobble, Goggles, Grabby, Grips, Gnasher, Hurl, Harry, Horns, Huck, Impish, Ick, Jabber, Jester, Jiggles, Jokes, Jasper, Jumbo, Klaus, Knife-Knife, Knives, Krimp, Lazy, Limps, Little Bitey, Loudmouth, Lye, Mak, Marbles, Maim, Mess, Muddy, Muck, Muffin, Nag, Nash, Nasty, Nibbles, Nifty, Nick, Nife, Off, One Eye, Orbs, Pancakes, Petunia, Picky, Pip, Pile, Plump, Pod, Potato, Pretzel, Prince, Puddles, Pukeface, Pumpkin, Quitter, Ratford, Ratthew, Ratsby, Rataline, Rattrick, Ratticus, Retch, Remi, Rizzo, Rankle, Rump, Ripper, Samuel Whiskers, Scabs, Scabbers, Scratches, Schlep, Scribbles, Scritches, Slinks, Slimeball, Sparky, Spew, Spoons, Splatter, Splinter, Sporky, Squeeks, Squirts, Squish, Squash, Stabs, Stewart, Stinkfoot, Stinkbutt, Talk-Talk, Tark, Templeton, Temper, Tik-Tak, Three Eye, Toothy, Two Eye, Ugly, Uppers, Vermin, Vile, Waffles, Wack, Wart, Whiskers, Wip, Wolly, Zip.</p>"

Beginning from empty cellars, maintenance tunnels, and sewer canals, ratlings then dig their own passages and chambers. A ratling burrow is a looping maze filled with overlapping routes, dead-ends, traps, and dozens, if not hundreds, of hungry defenders.</p>\n\n<p>Unbeknownst to surface-dwellers, ratlings occasionally dig tunnels extending out from the city limits, allowing them to slip away from the ruins to plunder the few remaining farmsteads nearby, and even threaten Emberwood Village. Perhaps one day, other cities in Westemär, or throughout the world, will hear a gnawing beneath their feet.</p>\n\n<h2>Burrows and Dens</h2>\n\n<p>A ratling lair is often composed of networks of winding tunnels, small hollowed out rooms, and multiple passages between them. Oftentimes these dens and burrows can be labyrinthian and cramped to outsiders, but to the ratlings they offer multiple positions to attack from, or to flee.</p>\n\n<h2>Strength in Numbers</h2>\n\n<p>Ratlings know that their strength is in numbers, and often design their burrows for quick access for fighting or fleeing. When they can, they will group together to fight as a large force. Attempting to use the winding and multiple passages to surround and overwhelm enemies.</p>\n\n<h2>Traps and Tunnels</h2>\n\n<p>Ratlings are notorious trap builders. Traversing their lairs is often more of a threat than actually facing the ratlings. Ratlings protect their lairs by building spiked pit traps, rolling barrels, and dug out holes in the walls and ceilings to fire from if they are infiltrated, as well as devising multiple other ways to thwart their enemies. They use poisons and fire to try and trap enemies inside areas of their burrows and burn or gas them to death. They lead intruders into trapped rooms or narrow corridors before dropping wooden gates down and lighting the hallway ablaze. Ratlings generally don't care about the damage their own traps do to their lairs, since they are happy to dig themselves out once the battle is over.</p>\n\n<h3>Sample Traps.</h3>\n\n<p>Some common ratling traps are listed below.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Spiked Pit.</strong></em> A creature who enters the space of a spiked pit must succeed on a [[/save dex 10 format=long]] or fall in the pit, taking [[/damage 2d6 type=piercing &amp; 2d6 type=bludgeoning average]] damage. Climbing out of the pit requires an action and a successful [[/check ath dc=12 format=long]] check.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Collapsing Tunnel. </strong></em>All creatures in the area of the collapsing tunnel must succeed on a [[/save dex dc=12 format=long]] or take [[/damage 3d6 type=bludgeoning average]] damage and become &amp;Reference[prone]. In addition, creatures that fail their saving throw by 5 or more become partially buried, gaining the &amp;Reference[restrained] condition until they escape. A creature can use their action to make a [[/check ath dc=10 format=long]] check to escape the rubble. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw may choose which side of the collapse it wishes to be on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Spike-bomb.</strong></em> All creatures in a 15-foot-radius Sphere from the trap that are not behind &amp;Reference[totalcover] must make a successful [[/save dex dc=15 format=long]] or take [[/damage 4d4 type=piercing average]].\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Poison Spray. </strong></em> All creatures within a 15-foot Cone from the trap must succeed on a [[/save con dc=15 format=long]] or become &amp;Reference[poisoned] (save ends).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Cage Trap.</strong></em> All creatures within 5 feet of the cage trap must succeed on a [[/save dex dc=12 format=long]] or become &amp;Reference[Immobilized]. A creature can break out of the cage by spending an action and making a successful [[/check ath dc=18 format=long]].\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong>Roller-crusher.</strong></em> Any creature in the path of the roller-crusher must succeed on a [[/save dex dc=14 format=long]] or take [[/damage 3d8 type=bludgeoning average]] and be knocked &amp;Reference[prone].\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Pot of Acid.</strong></em> Any creature within 10 feet of the pot of acid must succeed on a [[/save con dc=14 format=long]] or take [[/damage 3d4 type=acid average]] and become &amp;Reference[burning] ([[/damage 3d4 type=acid]]).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Flame Bottles. </strong></em>The ratling using the flame bottle must make a ranged attack against a target within 30 feet. On a hit, the target takes [[/damage 2d8 type=fire average]] and is &amp;reference[burning] ([[/damage 2d8 fire]]). Hit or miss, the bottle shatters. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a [[/save dex dc=15 format=long]] or take [[/damage 2d6 type=fire average]].\n</p>\n\n<h2>Ratling Burrow</h2>\n\n<p>Groups of related ratlings live together in burrows. They often dig out the burrows to form networks of interweaving tunnels, trap filled hallways, and several small rooms that they use for storage, sleeping, or gathering. Below are several common rooms you would find in a ratling burrow.</p>\n\n<h3>Altar to the Rat God</h3>\n\n<p>A Rat God's altar often includes a crude effigy of varying depictions. Where one depicts a massive, bloated rat, another shows a demon-like figure with wings and horns, and others might present an almost angelic form. Regardless, these effigies are crudely made, involving horrifyingly graphic depictions of the Rat God devouring humans, or other murderous acts.</p>\n\n<p>Ratlings leave offerings in the form of well-gnawed bones, bits of old food, delerium chunks, unusual looking rocks, and other trash few would find valuable. On rare occasions there may be [[/r 1d4]] copper, or a common gemstone worth 1 silver.</p>\n\n<h3>Ratling Hovels</h3>\n\n<p>These small chambers are where the ratlings sleep. Hovels are burrowed out as a network of small adjoining rooms, each lined with garbage, rags, hay, grass, and mud. Anything a ratling can find to make the hovel more comfortable for them to sleep in.</p>\n\n<h3>Food Storage</h3>\n\n<p>Ratlings enjoy fresh meat, so they occasionally take prisoners back to their burrows to consume later. To the ratlings, this storage space holds an assortment of fresh and old meat that needs to be regularly rotated out. To non-ratlings, it is a prison cage where they wait among the dead and half-dead to be eaten. They can clearly see their fate before them. Hung up on hooks are dead creatures, loose limbs, and half-eaten people struggling to survive.</p>\n\n<h3>Delerium Storage</h3>\n\n<p>Ratlings will keep shards and crystals of delerium, or even build their burrows around underground delerium veins; these become valuable parts of any ratling home and a place for the ratlings to gather in worship, or for planning. Sometimes delerium crystals will lightly illuminate the ratling burrows like tiny octarine lanterns.</p>\n\n<h2>Known Lairs</h2>\n\n<h3>The City of Drakkenheim</h3>\n\n<p>Ratlings first mutated in the contaminated ruins of Drakkenheim — here the impact of their unchecked growth has had the most impact. They clog the sewers and streets of the city and every venture into the ruins is bound to put adventurers up against a swarm of ratlings. As their numbers swell, the prospect of the growing ratling horde grows more and more daunting.</p>\n\n<h3>The Sewers of Drannsmund</h3>\n\n<p>The city of Drannsmund has had several reports of large rats seen lurking near sewer entrances, and stories of monsters snatching children. People who stay out too late sometimes go missing when taking the back roads or quiet streets. Faction agents fear that the ratlings of Drakkenheim have made their way along the roads and into the sewer systems of other major cities as well.</p>"

If the environment can be used against their foes, or if they can lure their foes into a trap, they will. They will light things on fire, throw debris, cover the ground in oil, toss poison vials, and roll flaming barrels down ramps. Ratlings will surely take any opportunity to turn the tide in their favor.</p>\n\n<h2>Cowardly</h2>\n\n<p>Ratlings will not fight if they are outnumbered, or if a few of them go down in combat. Instead, as soon as the battle seems to turn against them, they fall back and regroup with more ratlings, trying to overwhelm and outnumber their foes with replenished numbers. If they do not stand to win the battle, the ratlings either plead for their lives and surrender, waiting for the right moment to backstab their foe, or flee. If the battle is lost, they will scurry off into the darkness and return to their burrow at a later time to rebuild.</p>"

The Fracturing of the Inscrutable Tower triggered haywire arcane anomalies through the city, while the impact of the meteor sent a shockwave of magical devastation that shattered glass, blew through stone and wood, and reduced most living creatures to ash. Others caught in the blast were instantly transformed into monsters, and buildings and streets were shifted into sentient growths and misshapen horrors.</p>\n<p>Castle Drakken was an epicenter of magical wards, protective spells, divination, and all manner of inherently magical trinkets and artifacts. The throne room where King Ulrich sat housed several of the most powerful magical relics in Westemär. The Crown of Westemär being the most prominent, although King Ulrich himself held a magical scepter, wore four magical rings, and a possessed a protective amulet. Furthermore, the large circular stained glass window behind the throne was imbued with magic that allowed it to change colors and depict different images throughout the seasons.</p>\n<p>Naturally, when the rippling wave of arcane destruction blasted through the throne room, it fractured the abundant magical energies within the room, immediately opening a rift to the Space Between Worlds (see chapter 9) and amalgamating all the king's men into a massive mound of rippling fatty flesh. King Ulrich tried to escape but the magical mayhem fused him to his throne. As the King melted, he was absorbed by the expanding flesh, his face coming to rest as a disfigured grimace placed in the center of the horrible Amalgamation.</p>\n<p>The creature continued to grow as the years passed, and those who went searching for the lost king would soon become one with the Amalgamation as well. Tendrils of strange flesh now spread like a web of sinew and skin across the throne room while pulsing contamination ripples out of the grotesque mass. A massive maw spans the length of the creature with various human bones posing as jagged and sharp teeth. Its tongue is a writhing mass of intestines and gore. No longer can any semblance of those lost to the Amalgamation be found. The king's face still prominently sits above the creature's massive maw, a mocking display of the fragility of the empires of a world not ready to face horrors beyond their comprehension.</p>\n<p>The Amalgamation has a multidimensional form that straddles the Material Plane and the Space Between Worlds. Its mere presence acts as an anchor for the dimensional rift that pulls more and more contamination into Drakkenheim.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n<p>Characters who have one or more mutations, or who are afflicted with any form of madness gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study the Amalgamation, learning the following based on the result:</p>\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(20+) Multidimensional.</strong> You recognize its Immunities, and its Rejuvenation, Malignancy, and Immutable Form traits.</p>\n  <p><strong>(25+) Insatiable Hunger.</strong> You know of the creature's Bite attack, as well as its Mind-Breaking Whispers ability.</p>\n  <p><strong>(30+) Beyond Comprehension.</strong> You are aware of its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n<p>The Amalgamation is a formidable foe capable of grappling multiple targets and eating them or throwing them around the battlefield.

        "Cacophonous Chimera": {
          "name": "Cacophonous Chimera",
          "text": "<p>\n  <span class=\"dropcap\" aria-hidden=\"true\">T</span>\n  <span aria-hidden=\"true\">he</span>\n  <span class=\"visually-hidden\">The</span>\n  Cacophonous Chimera emerged from a catastrophic convergence of several creatures — a Garmyr, Deep Dreg, Manticore, Ratling, and a Harpy — amidst a fierce battle. Caught in a terrible arcane anomaly, these creatures were unwillingly combined into this single, horrific form. Each head retains the memories and instincts of its original form, driving the chimera in a constant battle for dominance and survival. This relentless conflict within itself fuels its madness and aggression towards anything it encounters in the ruins.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Cacophonous Chimera lives in a constant state of internal discord as its three heads, each with its own predatory instincts, vie for control over its body. The constant bickering and screaming among the heads produce a sound that reverberates painfully within the skulls of all who hear it, inducing terror, confusion, and madness. Depending on which head momentarily gains dominance, the tone and effect of their combined shrieking varies, leaving their prey disoriented and defenseless.</p>\n\n<p>This terror hunts throughout the Outer City, making lairs within the crumbling ruins of the Spokes Merchants Exchange. The main tower was one of the tallest buildings outside Drakkenheims walls and functioned as a hub for traders and local craftspeople to conduct business without needing to travel to the bustling market square of the Inner City. The structure has become a ramshackle ruin, the crooked spire compromised by the constant shrieking of the chimera. Still, this strategic perch not only provides an ideal vantage point for the monstrosity. The structural damage also dissuades other monsters and adventurers from intruding on the chimeras personal domain.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Traits</h2>\n\n<p>The following traits can be used to inspire roleplaying the Cacophonous Chimera:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Trait:</strong> “Just ONCE can we chat with someone a little before we eat them? RARGH! STOP TALKING! RIP AND TEAR! NO! NO! NO! Our stomach is FOUR TIMES bigger than it used to be! Im STARVING!”</li>\n  <li><strong>Bond:</strong><em> </em>“Were fused together. Although each of us wants to be separated, in truth were afraid of what would happen if we were ever torn apart.”</li>\n  <li><strong>Ideal:</strong> “I make such wonderful music! Each howl, shriek, and chitter resonates to form a deadly orchestra. I cant stand silence!”</li>\n  <li><strong>Flaw:</strong> “Were constantly arguing. Our internal strife often distracts us from opportunities or leads us into traps, as we cant agree even on the simplest decisions.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Cacophonous Chimera, learning the following based on their result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(15+) Freakish Fusion</strong>. Youre aware of the chimeras Epic Resistance Epic Action.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Fighting for Control.</strong> You recognize the chimeras Cacophony Epic Action, noting that if the creature could be silenced, it would be far less formidable.</p>\n  <p><strong>(25+) Powerful but Distracted.</strong> You understand its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Desperate to eat and consume, the Cacophonous Chimera viciously attacks prey on sight despite the desires of its harpy head to engage in a little conversation first. The Cacophonous Chimera is not a very subtle hunter. Its prey can hear it coming by the sound of its droning cacophony from at least a city block away, which may give them opportunity to prepare, hide, or flee.</p>\n\n<p>The range of its Cacophony can affect creatures before they can see the chimera itself. By the time the chimera arrives, its prey may be shaken and immobilized by the sound.

The sights of the war caused him to see the frailty of the human form — the cries of pain and agony of the wounded collected in the fields disgusted him with their feeble, broken bodies. Deep within himself welled the desire to create a perfect soldier, a warrior who would not bend or break in battle.</p>\n\n<p>During the war, one of Dr. Freed's duties included triaging casualties to determine who could be saved or recover. Unbeknownst to his commanders, Dr. Freed used his position to manipulate the diagnosis, choosing ideal specimens for his experiments, individuals who would then be listed amongst the slain and missing.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Reanimator Minions. </strong></em>It's possible Dr. Freed was the first to create many creatures.

Such is the composition of a Reautomata that they fight on despite grievous injury, unflinching even as they are dismembered. Stopping a Reautomata necessitates mangling its body past the point of physical operation. Reautomata are ultimately brutal and decisive combatants that fight without regard for their personal well-being.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Created in Torment.</strong></em> Reautomata must be skillfully made by a master Reanimator using the finest components. It is essential the work begin on both a living and fully conscious individual. Typically, most apothecaries perform the work without anesthetic, instead opting to sever the vocal cords of their victims so as to not have their screams disturb the grim work involved. Limbs are removed and replaced, and metal is grafted into flesh and welded into the bone of the fully aware subject. Nervous tissue is pulled from the brain and distributed from the body, giving the construct nearly perfect proprioceptive awareness while excising unnecessary or superfluous brain tissues associated with cognitive functions. The process renders the Reautomata fully obedient, but not mindless.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Arcana or Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Reautomata. Each successful check reveals one of the following pieces of information:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(16+) Dispassionate Metal and Flesh. </strong>You are aware of the Reautomata's Relentless Endurance trait, as well as its damage and condition Immunities.</p>\n  <p><strong>(19+) Limb Weapons. </strong>You know of the Reautomata's Arm Blades and Entrapping Rend attacks.</p>\n  <p><strong>(21+) Focused Killer. </strong>You learn the Reautomata's Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Reautomata fight with outward ferocity and aggressive attacks which belie the cold, unfeeling calculation at the core of each solider. In battle, Reautomata launch themselves towards their foes in great leaps, impaling their targets upon their rending arm blades. The rending blades flense into flesh and</p>\n\n<p>latch on like hooks, allowing the Reautomata to restrain their targets. They then use their great strength to rend apart their restrained victims.</p>\n\n<p>Reautomata unquestionably obey the orders of their creator and will fight until destroyed without regard for their own bodies. However, even with only general instructions, Reautomata fight intelligently and know how to utilize the environment to their advantage, making use of their climb speeds and jumping ability to prioritize dangerous targets.</p>\n\n<h2>Harvestable Components (Rare)</h2>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Animus: </strong>Construct.</p>\n  <p><strong>Fluid: </strong>Contaminated Ichor.</p>\n  <p><strong>Organs: </strong>Brain.</p>\n  <p><strong>Bones:</strong> Skull, Spine.</p>\n  <p><strong>Natural Weapons:</strong> Blades.</p>\n  <p><strong>Hair: </strong>Stitches.</p>\n  <p><strong>Hide: </strong>Skin, Plates.</p>\n</div>"

          "text": "<p>\n  <span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>\n  Soulbound Host is the physical body of an apothecary who has willingly allowed an extraplanar creature to possess them, trapping the powerful outsider in a mortal form. Powerful yet vulnerable, Soulbound Hosts loathe their creators. They wander the world for the means to reverse the curse of mortality placed upon them and return to their otherworldly domains.\n</p>\n\n<p>Exorcist and Alienist apothecaries do not primarily study the body, and rarely practice the type of magic and science which leads to mutant horrors and flesh-stitched abominations. They are instead concerned with the supernatural forces of the mind and soul. Many research and contact powerful extraplanar entities, eager to possess mortals as a means of entering the material world. These apothecaries learn how to create Soulbound Hosts as a powerful means to contain and fight back against these dangerous otherworldly foes.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Desperate Gambit.</strong></em> A Soulbound Host is usually created under truly desperate circumstances, such as when a heroic apothecary faces a dangerous otherworldly being such as a demon, fey, spirit, or inscrutable entity from the Space Between Worlds. Not only are these planar invaders pernicious foes, many are effectively immortal—often these creatures simply reform when killed outside their native planes. Thus, an apothecary who lacks the ability to defeat the demon on their own, or who wishes to defeat a powerful outsider in a more permanent fashion, may instead decide upon a heroic act of self-sacrifice by turning themselves into a Soulbound Host.\n</p>\n\n<p><strong> Preparing the Trap.</strong> Using an array of implanted metals, ingested tinctures, mental preparations, and occult incantations, a skilled apothecary may willingly prepare their body for possession. During the process, the apothecary can weave a unique spiritual trap. It then falls to the apothecary to convince the otherworldly creature to possess them, an act that many outsiders are eager to do. Thus, the canny apothecary preys on the ego of the monster itself.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Mortal Curse. </strong></em>When the outsider inhabits the body, the apothecary's soul departs, leaving the extraplanar creature to take their place spiritually. If this mortal form is killed or destroyed, the bound creature does not simply return to their plane of origin. Instead, the spirit departs to the afterworlds like any other mortal soul, losing their accumulated otherworldly power forever. Thus, the Soulbound Host becomes both a prison and a death sentence for the other wielding being tricked into the apothecary's body.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Rogue Hosts. </strong></em>Unfortunately, this act of self-sacrifice is not without its imperfections. The apothecary's body is filled with otherworldly essence, and while the creature's power is greatly diminished, they often remain extremely dangerous—allies of the departed apothecary may still find it challenging to slay the Soulbound Host. Many escape, wandering the world with stolen lives and even assuming the identity of their host while they search for the means to escape their now mortal form. All bound outsiders are painfully aware of their new mortality, frustrated that returning to their planes of origin is\n</p>\n\n<p>not a simple matter of destroying their flesh-cage or switching their essence into a different host, one which lacks the binding wards placed by the apothecary.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Price of Freedom. </strong></em>Trapped outsiders can win their freedom by calling back the soul of the apothecary who trapped them, and resurrecting them into their body. This is a thing many outsiders are loathe to do out of fiendish ego, since it puts the original soul in a bargaining position. In this way, the apothecary can force the spirit to accept a bargain which requires them to remain in their own worlds for at least the duration of the apothecary's lifetime.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Religion, Medicine, or Survival gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Soulbound Host, learning the following based on the result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(10+) Possessed Body.</strong> You know the Soulbound Host's type and damage Resistances.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Extraplanar Magic.</strong> Depending on the type of spirit, you learn either the Hellfire Chain, Illusory Assault, or Psychic Barrage actions, as well as the Spellcasting trait of the host.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Cursed Fate.</strong> You recognize its desperation caused by its spirit-bound mortality and its Reactions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>A Soulbound Host is a careful combatant.

In Drakkenheims urban wasteland, suitable plots of fertile soil are scarce outside Queens Park Garden, necessitating a creative adaptation to proliferate. These Dark Growths take root in the bodies of creatures through their infectious, delerium-infused spores.\n</p>\n\n<p>Emitted from their blooming flowers, these spores drift silently throughout the air until they enter another creatures body through the ears, mouth, or nose. Once inside, these spores can lay dormant for some time, slowly contaminating their host with internal mutation which slowly decay their flesh and bone from within, transforming it into an ideal place for the Dark Growth to germinate. When the creature succumbs to contamination, or dies with the spores within it, the plant awakens. Consuming the internal organs of the dying infected, it suddenly and violently sprouts. Often, this transformation occurs so suddenly that the creature remains walking around, the Dark Growth using the corpse as a mobile shell so it may plant in an ideal location to spread future spores.</p>\n\n<p>One apothecary reports a case where a knight returning from a mission into the Inner City had survived the journey relatively unscathed save for an excursion into the gardens where a puff of what they thought was pollen from strange iridescent flowers got in their eyes. The knight thought little of it, suffering no immediate effects. After returning to Emberwood, the knight complained of stomach cramps, nausea, and headaches, eventually passing out from the pain. The apothecary performed an emergency surgery, cutting the patient open only to have their intestines burst out like a barrage of meaty, thorn-covered brambles that attempted to strangle the apothecary.

Alienists have been known to go as far as remove portions of their victims' brains or remove their brains entirely while keeping the subject alive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Chemist. </strong></em>Those looking for tinctures and tonics to ease all manner of ailments have turned to Chemists, often unaware of the danger of their compounds. These patients are often subject to new experimental procedures that leave them burned, or scarred, disfigured by chemical research. In some cases, the chemical procedures can leave the victims hairless, blind, or cause their skin to muddle and scar over completely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Exorcist. </strong></em>An Exorcists patients seek help with possessions that may or may not be real. These haunted people can find themselves at the hands of mad scientist and spiritualist who will use the willing patient to summon or trap demonic forces. Sometimes these patients are simply what remains after a demonic or spiritual possession, where after the removal, the victim is left numb and catatonic, having lost most of themselves to the entity that inhabited them. More sinister exorcists will perform this procedure on purpose, placing powerful entities into a patient, only to remove it and render the patient hollow and willing to become a subject to the apothecary.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Mutagenist. </strong></em>The failed experiments of a Mutagenist can leave all manner of strange disfigurations and abnormalities upon their patients. Everything from unusual growths, cankers, and tumors, to fully growing extra limbs, eyes, mouths, and other such strange occurrences. These patients become hideous mockeries of their former selves and over time, become reliant on the doctor to keep their growths and mutations in check.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Pathogenist. </strong></em>When sick with disease, or dealing with unknown poisons, subjects will go to a Pathogenist. Those\n</p>\n\n<p>who take their practices too far often use subjects as vessels for experimentation. Subjects are often riddled with diseases, sores, boils, at times losing their teeth and fingernails to unnatural decay, their skin turning shades of yellow, green, or purple. They appear sickly, carrying a many pathogens, toxins, and diseases.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <em><strong> Reanimator.</strong></em> Reanimators are sought out when a patient has lost a limb, or had severe injury that would leave them scarred or disfigured. The Reanimators who take their practice too far will use the subject as a means of experimentation. Attaching new limbs to them, testing the lengths they can go by adding multiple limbs, or a second head, additional fingers or toes, subjects over time can become a patchwork of various parts that have been removed, reattached, or swapped.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Wretched Patient, learning the following based on the result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(10+) Broken by Experimentation.</strong> You know the creature's Conditioned Obedience trait.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Fervent Loyalty.</strong> You know these creatures protect their creator via their Protective Impulse Reaction.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Wretched Patients are simple minions.

Viewing themselves as the apex predators, all creatures are beneath them. The Zealots of Morrigan pledge themselves to fighting against Morrigan's enemies, not least of which the druids and servants of Arwyn and Kromac. These warriors serve as the vanguard for much of the court's offensive operations, and are often sent in when they want an enemy utterly eviscerated.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Zealots of Morrigan, as their order is called, give in to the primal nature their vampirism. They see the trappings of civilization and the kingdoms and empires that mankind has built as a blight upon the land, a perversion of nature. They do what they can to bring what settlements they can into complete and utter ruin. Reports of far flung, small villages disappearing overnight are often an indicator of their presence.</p>\n\n<p>As they are vampires, Zealots of Morrigan like to attack and feed at night. There are rumored to be many Zealots of Morrigan dwelling in Netherwind, where the winter nights last several days, and the scarce population is a prime herd for the zealots to feast upon. The Reavers of Netherwind must stay especially vigilant during these times, and fighting them is a true test of their mettle. On occasion, the Zealots of Morrigan get a particular taste for giant's blood, and will coordinate an attack on a giant. This is usually done on Morrigan's holy day, and the blood feeds them for months.</p>\n\n<p>Morrigan has infused these zealots with immense power and vitality. They rarely bother fighting with weapons, viewing their vampiric gifts as more than sufficient. The blood of their foes wraps around them, bandaging their wounds and forming a protective shield to keep them in the fight. The scent of spilt blood drives them into a frenzy, pushing them on into further savagery. There is often very little left of a zealot's quarry, as they get carried away in their bloodlust.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Arcana or Religion gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks when taking the Study action to examine it, learning the following based on the result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(10+) Angry Undead.</strong> You recognize the creature's Morrigan's Fury bonus action.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Rejuvenating Violence.</strong> You learn of the creature's Blood Shield trait.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Swift and Strong.</strong> You know the creature's highest and lowest ability scores as well as its Vampire Weaknesses.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>As soon as a Zealot of Morrigan gets the scent of combat, they use their bonus action to enter Morrigan's Fury, amplifying their damage and bolstering them against assault.

Hidden there after he was defeated by his daughter Carmen, his undead body awaits the blasphemous magic needed to reanimate and restore him. Eternal life in undeath was bestowed upon him by the Sanguine Rite which transformed him into an Ascendant Vampire. Vladimir took the druids' words to mean that none could slay him: after the ritual was complete, Vladimir von Drakken could regenerate from any wound or magic.\n</p>\n\n<p>In truth, he can be struck down by one of his own blood relatives, descendants, or any other who has his “blood” within them. Even in such cases, his undead form is also rejuvenated by their blood. He can be resurrected by performing the Sanguine Rite again upon his remains, a grisly ritual that demands the sacrifice of a powerful sorcerer, a true dragon, and blood descendant of Vladimir von Drakken himself.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for the Court of the Night, the means and materials to perform this ritual again have eluded them for hundreds of years. Not only did Vladimir von Drakken slay the original druids who performed the rite, but the subsequent fall of House von Drakken in the centuries since has made finding a suitable sacrifice challenging. Nevertheless, should that ever come to pass, a threat unlike any other would return to the world.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Traits</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Trait</strong>.

He remains in this form until he consumes the blood of a living descendant of House von Drakken, which enables him to turn into his Reborn form.</p>\n\n<p>If reduced to 0 Hit Points in his Reborn form, Vladimir von Drakken unleashes his Ascendant form.</p>\n\n<p>In his Crypt-Starved form, Vladimir von Drakken is a craven and desperate combatant. He primarily aims to drink as much blood as possible using his Bite to transform into his Reborn form. He makes use of Shadow Step and Terrifying Glare to reposition himself and hold foes at bay.</p>\n\n<p>Once he regains his Reborn form, Vladimir von Drakken is nearly unstoppable. He wades into melee with Bloodmourne, demonstrating his martial superiority by using his maneuvers. He uses his Claws and Bite as finishing moves and uses Dominate to bend his foes to his will. When surrounded, he uses Wing Blast to reposition.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming his Ascendant form, Vladimir von Drakken becomes an engine of bloodlust and destruction, fueled by primal rage and undead power. In this form, he rips foes apart with melee attacks and flays their spirits whenever his Soul Rend becomes available.</p>\n\n<h2>Slaying Vladimir von Drakken</h2>\n\n<p>Vladimir cannot be fully destroyed unless he is wholly unmade at the place he was first transformed. Wholly destroying Vladimir von Drakken is difficult. Once he is defeated in combat, with the final blow struck by one who shares his blood, his heart must be cut out, and placed upon the altar within the Standing Stones in in the Brachenwald where he was transformed into a vampire.Under a full moon at midnight, a wooden stake made from a branch from Elenthas the Evertree must be driven through the heart by one of his blood descendants. Then, the heart must be left there until sunrise where it is destroyed by first light. Vladimir von Drakken's minions do not stand idly whilst this happens, and launch a massive assault upon the grove with the desperate aim of retrieving his heart before it is destroyed by the sun.</p>"

Their gardens are family, and they protect them with their lives. If you go tromping through mushroom patches in a swamp, you best be ready to face the wrath of these mothers of mushrooms.</p>\n\n<h2>Covens and Community</h2>\n\n<p>Some Troll Hags are happy to live out their days undisturbed in the deepest reaches of dark forests and smelly swamps.

How such creatures came to be is unknown, and few know of their existence. Some propose that they emerged spontaneously, hatching from crystalline eggs with octarine shells.\n</p>\n\n<p>A Delerium Dragon is not simply contaminated, but a unique type of gemstone dragon with an otherworldly physiology. These dragons are literally made of the crystals: their claws, bones, and scales are refracting delerium shards. Their flesh and organs are incomprehensible organic matter, and their blood is delerium sludge. When unleashings its breath weapon, it exhales a storm of glittering shards that explode, causing madness, mutation, and wild magic to erupt in the area.</p>\n\n<p>Delerium Dragons are amongst the most powerful beings born within the Space Between Worlds. Capable of perceiving dimensions imperceptible to mortals, these dragons often seem flighty or distracted, but this is because they experience layers of reality which humans cannot. They are thus strange intermediaries, able to interact with creatures on a transdimensional level. Indeed, Delerium Dragons are unstuck in time, unrestrained by the linear progression of past, present, and future. Some experience their entire lives simultaneously, whereas others live their lives non-sequentially. Most understand that even their own existences is beyond comprehension, and many contemplate the fundamental nature of existence, chaos, and the cosmos. Many are nihilistic solipsists who believe that nothing actually exists except themselves, and even then many doubt their own existence, believing they are merely half-remembered dreams caught betwixt a fleeting thought. Others instead revel in their chaotic existence, seeking new forms of art and untamed creation. Powerful mages and talented bards have sought their wisdom and knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Most Delerium Dragons find the Mortal World, and mortals, rather limited and boring. Throughout history, only one emerged in the Mortal World, the mighty Amaranthyst, archmage of the Amethyst Academy—the dragon's true nature known only to the other members of the Academy Directorate.</p>\n\n<p>Delerium Dragons exert their force of will over the Space Between Worlds and make their lairs realms unto themselves. These lairs may open into a Thin Place, the yawning cavern of a normal dragon's lair instead leading to the madness of the Delerium Dragon's home. These dragons fill their lairs with treasures and secrets of mysterious significance and anachronistic origin, hoarding items which may have been valuable in the distant past, or of critical importance to the distant future. Like themselves, some of their greatest possessions may exist in a state mortals can't perceive or which are fundamentally hazardous, such as multidimensional art objects, miniature primordial black holes, degenerate matter taken from a neutron star, or magical vessels containing another universe or pocket dimension.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Delerium Dragon, learning the following based on the result.</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(15+) Empowered by Eldritch Magic.</strong> You understand the dragon's Resistances and senses.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Octarine Breath.</strong> You recognize the effects of the Delerium Dragon's breath weapon, as well as noting its Spellcasting capabilities.</p>\n  <p><strong>(25+) Few Weaknesses. </strong>You learn its highest and lowest saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>A Delerium Dragon views combat less as a violent encounter and more as a chance to change foes into a new form.

However, some survive the prolonged exposure to contamination, and find themselves in an altered state, becoming one with the Space Between Worlds and mutating into a being that resembles their former self, only changed.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Stronger Together</h2>\n\n<p>These altered survivors can no longer return to the Mortal World and need the chaotic contaminated environment to survive, but they are also regarded as foreign entities within the Space Between Worlds. Thus, many of the alien creatures inhabiting the twisted landscapes will attack, abduct, or obliterate them on sight.</p>\n\n<p>These survivors have banded together into roving groups of scavengers, pirates, or gangs. They traverse the Void Sea upon scraped-together starships powered by elemental magics. These Void Pirates search and plunder the ancient ruins, caverns, and debris fields looking for anything that will help them survive. They wage war against alien entities and feed on the flesh of their kills, further inducing the never-ending descent into madness and contamination.</p>\n\n<p>When they encounter mortals from another plane, Void Pirates are unpredictable. Sometimes they help lost sailors navigate the sea, hoping the dangerous voyage fails, and a new recruit can join their company. Other times, the pirates are less outwardly kind, kidnapping newcomers and holding them in cells upon their vessels. They use them as a distraction when they come across some horrible entity looking to eat, or as a bargaining chip amongst the other pirates, or even as payment to Far Dwellers for safe passage. A mortal life seems to be of value to many of the strange creatures, so having a few in reserve is often a key to survival.</p>\n\n<h2>Ships of the Void Sea</h2>\n\n<p>The vessels used by Void Pirates vary from group to group. They range from a small skiff with a sail and winged oars, housing a few pirates, to massive floating castles with elementally fueled propulsion systems housing hundreds.</p>\n\n<p>Some void pirate ships resemble traditional pirate ships, while others appear as floating rafts with makeshift homes, or a series of roped together platforms drifting along. All these ships are bound together in a crude construction made up of junk and debris that has formed randomly in the Space Between Worlds or drifted into the void through Thin Places.</p>\n\n<p>Pirates hunt for better parts, or stronger materials to upgrade their vessels to defend against threats, or to exploit the other gangs of the sea.</p>\n\n<p>Void Pirate ships are often equipped with extra nets, and sometimes ballistae or canons. Some even have more bizarre weaponry befitting the Space Between Worlds</p>\n\n<h2>Myriad Forms of Chaos</h2>\n\n<p>Void Pirates take on all manner of unusual quirks and physical attributes that represent their prolonged exposure to the shifting chaos of the Space Between Worlds.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.iKS86yTYlPQTwZ2c rollable]\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Void Pirate, learning the following based on the result.</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(5+) Mortal Survivors.</strong> You learn the creature's type.</p>\n  <p><strong>(10+) Battle Readiness. </strong>You recognize the creature's Bonus Action.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Varied Abilities. </strong>They learn the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Void Pirates often attempt to abduct creatures rather than kill them. They fight without honor, aiming to quickly outnumber and out maneuver opponents. Many target threatening enemies with ship-mounted weapons, or they move in close to use nets and shackles to capture other humanoids. They nearly always take prisoners unless forced to kill a target. If a creature persistently attacks or breaks free, they may decide to slit their throat and use them as bait. They flee if risking defeat. Their lives are more valuable to them than prisoners or treasure.</p>\n\n<h2>Harvestable Components</h2>\n\n<p>Due to their humanoid origins, these creatures cannot be harvested.</p>"

They care little for the multiple realities and their squabbles, nor the relevance of a mortal life. They are eternal beings who exist out of space and time. To them, relativity and dimensions are broken concepts which they can bend to their whims. They exist in multiple dimensions and times at once. They move and age in counterintuitive ways that no mortal can fully comprehend. To a mortal eye, they may appear to phase in and out of existence, or teleport from place to place, at times appearing more ancient, or more youthful. The Star Wardens may not be teleporting at all, but simply experiencing the interaction with a mortal at multiple points in time and space simultaneously. Their existence is wholly outside the standard flow of time or the movement of spatial reasoning. A Star Warden may exist within the past present and future of a mortal being all at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Their physiology and bizarre existence is utterly baffling to a mortal observer. The few who have witnessed a Star Warden have gone mad by the sheer incomprehensibility of their existence. One such academy mage, Randolf Carter, who practiced entering the Space Between Worlds via Dreamland, said that at several points throughout his life, he has spoken to a Star Warden. From the Star Warden's perspective, their conversation was a singular event, yet for Randolf, it happened in tiny dream-like snippets over the course of 50 years.</p>\n\n<p>The Star Wardens shepherd the cosmos, observing and aiding in the flow of space and time. They view reality as a wavelength of interdimensional strands, and they see to the various timelines and branches of infinite realities. It is impossible to know the full scope of their purpose, but they seem to be protectors of timelines, and ensure no cataclysmic events cause the universe to collapse on itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Star Warden, learning the following based on the result.</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(10+) Mentally Tough. </strong>You know the creature's Immunities.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Transposition.</strong> You recognize the creature's Outside Time and Space Reaction.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Otherworldly Intellect.</strong> You learn the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Star wardens exist in multiple times and dimensions at once. A creature that tries to fight a star warden is at a loss for where and how the star warden exists before it. Both the Star Warden and the creatures facing it are constantly shifted around the battlefield, unable to grasp their sense of reality. The Star Warden uses its Outside Time and Space Reaction to let two creatures attack one another instead of landing a blow upon itself. It can force the truth of all reality into a creature's mind or have it experience the cold vastness of space. Star Wardens are clever and always flee a losing fight.</p>\n\n<h2>Harvestable Components (Rare)</h2>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Animus:</strong> Aberration.</p>\n  <p><strong>Fluid:</strong> Contaminated Ichor, Goopy Ooze, Mucus.</p>\n  <p><strong>Organs:</strong> Guts, Glands, Flesh.</p>\n  <p><strong>Natural Weapons:</strong> Tentacles.</p>\n  <p><strong>Hide:</strong> Skin.</p>\n  <p><strong>Dust:</strong> Aberrant Dust.</p>\n</div>"

Profoundly nihilistic yet strangely mirthful, this archfiend revels in the drama and theatrics of mortal existence, seeing life itself as a cosmic joke. To him, each moment is merely a meaningless scene in the grand tragicomedy of the universe. His spiteful laugh echoes through the corridors of time and space. Legend tells it will be the final sound at the end of all things — when the curtain falls on existence itself. He Who Laughs Last believes this to be his perverse destiny, and this purported knowledge fuels his interactions with mortals, who he regards as powerless pawns in the great play of life and death.\n</p>\n\n<p>Many undead creatures are believed to be his designs, mocking curses the demon lord has lain upon humanity for his own sick entertainment. Given his mastery over such dark magic, He Who Laughs Last is often sought by necromancers, warlocks, and other arcane practitioners alike as an instructor or patron. Furthermore, He Who Laughs Last often makes eldritch pacts offering power, knowledge, and the promise of escape from mortality. In particular, the demon lord is believed to know the blasphemous rituals required to transform a mortal spellcaster into an abhorrent lich.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than bargain for the souls of his petitioners, however, He Who Laughs Last demands they collect the souls of others instead. He cares not for the method, only that the quota is fulfilled. The demon lord hungers for mortal souls not for the power they contain — although that is certainly a factor — but because he enjoys keeping soul-puppets to entertain himself by replaying the tragedies of their lives.</p>\n\n<p>The Theatre of the Danse Macabre is the domain of He Who Laughs Last. Located in the dark pits of the abyss, this fiendish citadel resembles a great theatre-in-the-round made from bone and blood. There, the collected souls of He Who Laughs Last are bound eternally among the shadowy players and audience members, where they must continually perform tragic stories and watch the dark circus play out.</p>\n\n<p>Although the demon lord's followers are a common target for Knights of the Silver Order, the fiend himself has a particular enmity amongst worshippers of the Old God Morrigan, the goddess of death and magic. He Who Laughs Last often appears to desperate penitents and heretical priests of the Old God, occasionally even impersonating the deity to trick and deceive her devoted followers into creating undead creatures and participating in his schemes.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Traits</h2>\n\n<p>Adventurers who interact with He Who Laughs Last must endure his mocking laughter and jeering comments, as he remarks on the futility of their actions, the dramatic irony of their mistakes, and the meaninglessness of their quests. In doing so, He Who Laughs Last carefully offers an escape or solution—if the adventurers will offer him service in exchange, one that is almost certain to have unforeseen consequences.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Traits. </strong>In conversation, I cannot contain my dark mirth, which manifests from a low chuckle to a belly-bursting guffaw. Most of all, I love the moment when mortals realize the cost of their terrible mistakes and poor decisions.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ideal. </strong>Mortals fear death. I play upon that fear, and with it I can catch the conscience of any soul.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bond.</strong> I harvest of souls at life's curtain call, binding them to my cast of players in my Theatre of the Danse Macabre.</li>\n  <li><strong>Flaw.</strong> I oft direct the play too long, delighting in extending the final act. My patience is as deep as the grave, allowing me to savor each move in the mortal game, though sometimes to the detriment of a timely demise.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He Who Laughs Last loves nothing more than when mortal heroes attempt to outmaneuver him. As befitting his name, there is almost always some unfortunate upset or surprise twist the demon has in store. Even when he is seemingly defeated, he is always sure to remind his foes who will have the last laugh.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Arcana or History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when they take the Study action to examine He Who Laughs Last, learning the following based on the result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(20+) Powerful Demonlord.</strong> You are aware of his Truesight and telepathy, his Resistances and Immunities, and his Epic Resistance.

Nevertheless, he casually ends lives using Sleep No More, Dusty Death, and Out Brief Candle, trapping another foe in a Cage of Sorrows so they must bear witness to the death around them before they expire to his Mortal Coil.</p>\n\n<p>He Who Laughs Last does not fear his own destruction, confident that he will reappear if his corporeal form is destroyed. He is certain of his fate to watch the end of the universe, and even when slain his echoing laughter remains as a grim reminder of his power.</p>\n\n<h2>Harvestable Components (Legendary)</h2>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Animus:</strong> Fiend.</p>\n  <p><strong>Fluid: </strong>Monster Blood.</p>\n  <p><strong>Organs:</strong> Heart, Eyes.</p>\n  <p><strong>Bones:</strong> Skull, Spine, Ribs.</p>\n  <p><strong>Natural Weapons</strong>: Teeth, Claws.</p>\n  <p><strong>Hide: </strong>Skin, Wing Membranes.</p>\n</div>"

It was the scholar Killgar Copperpot who realized its multitudinous identities were one and the same and named it the Thing with the Writhing Tail.\n</p>\n\n<p>Almost every warlock of the Thing with the Writhing Tail was approached by the creature as a child, appearing before them in the form of a common housecat, though one marked by some strange coloration, demeanor, or smell. It seems to favor those in unfortunate, neglectful, or powerless situations, such as street-wandering orphans or the mistreated offspring of narcissistic aristocrats. It casts itself in the role of their imaginary friend and confidant, sharing reassuring stories, protecting them from danger, and spurring them to precociously seek knowledge and adventure.</p>\n\n<p>Its eldritch pact occurs with a seemingly harmless promise to keep their bond an important secret. In turn, the Thing with the Writhing Tail grants its warlocks a special familiar in the form of a cat, which acts as a direct proxy for the entity itself. The familiar accepts any name the child-warlock chooses, often becoming known by names typical of a household pet, such as Bruce, Dinah, Felix, and others. Since the Thing with the Writhing Tail acts through these familiars, its warlocks are able to converse with the entity on a regular basis through their telepathic bond. As such, the warlocks often exhibit the strange behaviors of having one-sided conversations with their cats.</p>\n\n<p>Although it has appeared throughout history to countless mortals, the motivations of this creature are uncertain, even to its warlocks. It oscillates between agent of chaos and custodian of secret lore known only to cats and may be metaphysically connected to all felines. The Thing with the Writhing Tail is utterly indifferent to the human constructs of morality or duty and observes the Mortal World with a detached curiosity and occasional boredom. While most of the time its desires are guided by hungry impulses, it may suddenly fixate its attention on seemingly innocuous or strange patterns or magical phenomena incomprehensible to its human warlocks.</p>\n\n<p>The Thing with the Writhing Tail rests in places defying logic. It basks within cosmic rays shed by dying suns, languishes atop a shifting nebula, and curls up in the dark corners of reality, where time and space convolute into impossible geometries. Its slumber is deep and filled with dreams of ancient chaos.</p>\n\n<p>It is said that a strange place known as Ulthar, where no one may kill a cat, is especially sacred to the Thing with the Writhing Tail. The Thing with the Writhing Tail is not without its rivals, however. It seems utterly obsessed with one day consuming the Rat God.</p>\n\n<p>Since it goes by so many names, two warlocks who are both pactbound may not realize it at first, believing them to serve different beings. The Thing with the Writhing Tail seems to enjoy this state of affairs, even though it means its warlocks often act against one another. This may in fact be a strange way of weeding out the weak or seeking the most promising and talented warlock amongst its servants.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Traits</h2>\n\n<p>This cosmic entity's interactions are marked by caprice and whimsy.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Personality Trait. </strong>One moment, I might bestow affectionate purrs and nuzzles; the next, I display utter aloofness or sudden ire, swiping with claws of dark matter that rend the veil between sanity and madness.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ideal. </strong>My actions are neither cruel nor kind.

It teleports and swaps places with its duplicates as its rends its foes apart. The many duplicates vastly expand the range of its Purring Aura, sowing terror and madness in any who try to oppose them.</p>\n\n<p>The Thing with the Writhing Tail may grow suddenly bored in the middle of combat, deciding to inexplicably flee or change tactics to a new fixation.

It is a mind-reader and shapeshifter, who appears before mortals as their own reflections, but in a grand and idealized form. In this way, The Whispered Promise preys upon their insecurities and dreams simultaneously, showing mortals both their grand potential and many shortcomings through contrast. To those rare few who do not feel ambition or self-doubt, The Whispered Promise appears to be a writhing bundle of hairs.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Whispered Promise preys upon hopes, dreams, and ambitions, seeking to manipulate and seduce mortals into their web of schemes, and ultimately, make countless powerful mortals utterly indebted to the demon lord. Perhaps The Whispered Promise stands behind the great heroes and villains of history, having spurred their ambitions and supercharged their desires. In particular, the Sorcerer-Kings of the Arcane Empire sought out The Whispered Promise and made countless bargains with the demon to advance their wealth and power. Summoning circles and magic items found within their ancient ruins still allow mortals to contact The Whispered Promise. There are even some tieflings who claim that The Whispered Promise is a distant ancestor through fiendish pacts made in those days. It is unknown whether The Whispered Promise had any influence in ultimately engineering the fall of the Sorcerer-Kings.</p>\n\n<p>There is little The Whispered Promise cannot offer. Knowledge and information are their most common currency: teaching mortals forgotten magic and sharing deeply kept secrets.</p>\n\n<p>They have dealt in magical artifacts, granting mortals powerful magical items, or simply vast amounts of material wealth. The Whispered Promise also enjoys helping mortals undo a past mistake, solve a guilty conscience, get revenge on a hated enemy, or seize the reins of power for themselves. In exchange, The Whispered Promise seeks to extract a promise of future service from the mortal — a promise for a promise. While they try to keep the terms of this service as open-ended as possible, they reassure mortals they will never ask them to do any direct harm to their friends or loved ones, nor perform any task beyond their own capability to fulfill. In this way, they build a web of interactions and debts, trading services for services. The Whispered Promise plots to use their collected debts to fulfill their future bargains.</p>\n\n<p>While an expert in the desires of others, determining The Whispered Promise's motives prove vexing. The Whispered Promise does not lie, and they seldom reveal their full intentions. They seemingly wish to construct a tapestry of promises, never making one of their own, but brokering the promises of others. A broken promise is a broken thread, pushing the entity to always keep their promises. Yet within this web of desire, The Whispered Promise is always at the center.</p>\n\n<h2>Roleplaying Traits</h2>\n\n<p>Capable of sustaining multiple separate telepathic conversations at once, The Whispered Promise addresses each character individually.

In actuality, the Rat God has gnawed on the bones of reality for eons, growing fat and powerful on the remains of slain demon lords, fallen elder entities, and destroyed worlds.\n</p>\n\n<p>The Rat God has followed the course of delerium throughout the universe, eager for opportunities to feast amidst the chaos the crystals bring in their devastating wake.

Drakkenheim and the world it rests upon has become the latest stop for this wandering interdimensional scavenger.</p>\n\n<p>Acting through its warlocks and oracles, the Rat God has enthralled the ratlings of Drakkenheim, sweeping them into its apocalyptic plan to enter the Mortal World and devour it. Ratlings believe that the Rat God guides them through shadows and whispers, pushing them to grow in size and number so they can one day overtake the world. Indeed, the Rat God does send visions and messages to favored ratlings, encouraging them to breed and consume—a chittering throng is needed to conduct the Great Gnaw, the summoning spell to bring the Rat God out of the abyss and into the Material Plane. The Rat God makes pacts with ratlings who demonstrate a curiosity and aptitude for magic, especially those who foster a feverous worship towards the arcane arts, knowing that there must be talented ratling spellcasters to carry out the Great Gnaw.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the Rat God is not without its foes.

Speculation suggests it is obsessed with perfection and expectation; it deems the universe and all its planes a broken and imperfect thing in need of repair and reform.</p>\n\n<p>The Algorithm is the master of calculations and realities. It can predict and evaluate every possible outcome to a course of action within an instant, and has the ability to shift and manipulate time and space to allow its most favorable outcome. If any goal can be surmised from such an unknown being, it is that it sees mortals, and most life-forms and planets as broken objects needing to bend to its whims of expectations and perfections. Anything The Algorithm deems undesirable it will adjust accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>The Algorithm has no known origin — perhaps it was never made, but rather came into existence through the chaotic nature of the Space Between Worlds. It is impossible to say how a construct which was never constructed has gained the level of impossible sentience found in The Algorithm, but it is in its very nature a being of pure order, which itself causes mass chaos. It constantly restructures elements of the Space Between Worlds to suit its perfect vision. Entire planets drifting within the void of the Space Between Worlds have been repurposed into mechanical hubs, quantum spheres, time paradoxes, and machine factories. Whatever The Algorithm's intentions or goals are, they are something that could never be understood by a mortal mind. Its constant shifting of realities and obsession with perfection seems to a mortal to be total nonsense, and utter absurdity.

Due to their nature, a Living City does not create the appearance of a damaged or ruined structure, so adventurers may be naturally wary of oddly intact buildings they encounter while roaming the ruins.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Living City, learning the following based on their result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(15+) Animated Building.</strong> You are aware of the Living Citys Structural Form and No Exit traits, as well as its Immunities.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Escape Routes.</strong> You recognize that destroying the creatures walls and doors creates exits, but these are short-lived because of its Shifting Form Epic Action.</p>\n  <p><strong>(25+) Slow, Smart, and Tough.</strong> You learn of the Living Citys strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>A Living City takes the form of an oddly intact residence, workshop, or warehouse using its Structural Form trait, and waits for hapless creatures to wander inside. A Living City may deceive characters into entering it using its telepathy and Haunting Whispers. It suppresses its Digestive Aura and so it can take full advantage of its False Appearance trait.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, a Living City shapes its body to create outer rooms that have walls bordering the edge of the Living Citys space, and inner rooms deep within which do not have walls, ceilings, or floors immediately adjacent to spaces outside the Living City. The Living City will create doors, windows, or even stairs within it so that its prey can easily move from outside, to the outer rooms, and then further inside to the inner rooms. Often, the Living City might place any treasure or valuables it has collected in these inner rooms as bait.</p>\n\n<p>Once a few characters have entered one of its innermost rooms, the Living City attacks and activates its Digestive Aura. When it rolls Initiative, it uses its No Exit trait to close all the doors and windows in its body, trapping characters inside. Then, it attacks them with its Grasping Tendrils, Bite, and Haunting Whispers, while using its Shifting Form Epic Action to slowly change its interior, separating the characters and cutting off their escape routes.</p>\n\n<p>Should the player characters break a hole in one of its walls, the Living City uses its Shifting Form trait to plug the hole. Note that some area-of-effect attacks and spells (such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.5SuJewoa1CRWaj1F]{Burning Hands}) can damage or destroy multiple sections of the Living City. However, a Living City can only take damage from one section being destroyed per turn. If characters manage to slip outside the Living City through a breached hole or exit, the Living City may use its Grasping Tendrils to pull them back in. It then tries to quickly seal them inside again with Shifting Form.</p>\n\n<h2>Harvestable Components (Very Rare)</h2>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Animus:</strong> Montrosity.</p>\n  <p><strong>Fluid:</strong> Contaminated Ichor, Goopy Ooze, Acidic Bile.</p>\n  <p><strong>Organs:</strong> Glands.</p>\n</div>"

On some of the especially quiet and warm nights, you could hear the chorus of croaking frogs from within the woods close to the river. These frogs were commonly found there, and large numbers of them would migrate down the Drann River into the northern parts of the city, especially around Kings Gate. Today, the frogs migration continues, but now the contaminated waters of the Drann have caused the amphibians to bloat to horrific size, and also wildly changed their reproductive cycle.\n</p>\n\n<p>These mutated monsters are now commonplace along the river and make crossing at any point dangerous. Their eggs do not hatch on their own but require a host body to feed on to complete the metamorphosis. For this reason, the frogs weaponize their contaminated eggs, tossing them at passing by adventurers, scouts, and even other contaminated creatures, hence their moniker: “Lob” Frogs.</p>\n\n<p>The Lob Frog produces hundreds of eggs and hedges its bets by throwing them at any creature it finds, hoping that a few of them have the opportunity to gestate into a newborn Lob Frog.

Their deep roots draw up the delerium in the soil and they are altered in ways that defy understanding.

In particular, this may occur when multiple delerium-tipped arrowheads or bolts become imbedded deep into the body. In at least one documented case, a foolish adventurer who tried ingesting a delerium shard quickly mutated into a maunder.

The creatures attack everything they encounter, including other maunders, absorbing more flesh and matter from their kills.

They are unable to perceive the Reality Cyst and instead find themselves in a confused landscape with the very fabric of reality shifting and altering forms. Colors beyond perception bleed from walls, objects appear and disappear at random, nonsensical angles and shapes form and alter before their eyes.

Their eye sockets will droop, their mouth will be too open, their arms and legs will have loose and sagging skin. They appear almost as the person who was consumed, but with their skin hanging off in odd and disproportionate ways.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to Study a Skin Crawler, learning the following based on their result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(5+) Unrestrained Undead.</strong> You recognize the Skin Crawlers creature type, Resistances, and Immunities.</p>\n  <p><strong>(10+) Squeezing Death.</strong> You are aware of its Crush and Consume Bonus Action.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Deathly Aware.</strong> You learn of the Skin Crawlers mental ability scores and saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>The Skin Crawler is a mindless creature.

These cowardly opportunists feed on corpses and weakened prey while steering clear of more adept aerial predators inhabiting the ruins. Attracted to the sound of conflict, Skretches patiently circle at great heights until the fight ends, then attack any wounded, dying, or survivors caught off guard.\n</p>\n\n<p>A Skretchs digestive system is a disgusting mess. It is filled with the partially dissolved remains of its last meal, churning into a contaminated slop inside its bloated belly. Skretches shower their meals—whether corpses or still-living targets—with acidic vomit and expelled waste. This noxious mixture dissolves flesh and bones, turning prey into digestible goop that the Skretch then easily consumes.</p>\n\n<p>These beasts maintain a significant distance from the Harpies residing in the highest spires of Drakkenheim since the more proficient hunters are not averse to killing and consuming Skretches. Skretches typically establish their roosts near the city walls or along the cliffsides of Castle Drakken. The magically animated guardians present near the citys fortifications, such as Wall Gargoyles and Tower Dragons, typically overlook the presence of Skretches. These constructs do not consume their vanquished foes, leaving ample spoils for the Skretches to gorge upon. Some of the bolder Skretches perch atop inanimate constructs, waiting patiently for them to animate and dispatch their next victim—thereby securing a fresh meal with and taking full advantage of the cold efficiency of these guardians.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Skretch, learning the following based on their result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(5+) Flying Scavenger. </strong>You recognize it may be possible to distract it with meat, offal, or strong-smelling food.</p>\n  <p><strong>(10+) Acidic Vomit. </strong>You learn of the Skretchs Expel Waste and Spittle actions.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Dextrous and Sturdy. </strong>You recognize the creatures strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Skretches keep to high perches and observe potential prey before attacking.

However, elements of their bizarre physiology appear somewhat human.

Instead, the Undulating Polyps seem to transcend physical space in a manner that makes them quite difficult to pin down. They displace themselves constantly within an area, appearing in multiple places nearly at the same time, or teleporting from one location to another constantly. It is as if they exist in an almost constant state of flux. Their acidic mucus-filled growths allow them to spray acid bile onto anything it deems a threat as it not only teleports itself, but anyone who harms it to a more advantageous position.</p>\n\n<p>These creatures wants and needs are completely unknown. Like much that emerges from Thin Places, or many of the mutated horrors of the city, the mystery of the Undulating Polyp continues to baffle apothecaries and Academy mages.

This wild magic conjures extraplanar energies and creatures into the ruins and has a particularly insidious interaction with the Shadowlands. The forces that draw the souls of the dead into the Material Plane are greatly magnified. Worse, the eldritch contamination corrupts the soul, fragments the mind, and distorts personalities, transforming these spirits into Warp Witches.

          "name": "The World Ender",
          "text": "<p>\n  \n  <span class=\"dropcap\">A</span>\n  colossal delerium crystal rests at the center of the Crater. This “Delerium Heart” is a piece of a distant unknown world utterly consumed and destroyed by the Haze. It is the largest source of the contamination spreading out from Drakkenheim. If there is any hope for stopping the slow progression of the Haze, it must begin with the destruction of the Delerium Heart. Characters mighty or foolish enough to accomplish this monumental task alone will not end the contamination of Drakkenheim, but instead unleash a destructive horror unlike anything the earth has ever known: The World Ender.\n</p>\n\n<p>No two individuals who bear witness to the emergence of The World Ender can describe its arrival in the same terms. One hero perceives it breaking free of the Delerium Heart like a creature hatching from a great egg; another describes it suddenly appearing from the mist in a flash of thunder and lightning; while a third sees a small creature nearby haplessly mutate into a colossal being when exposed to the powerful forces released upon the destruction of the Delerium Heart.</p>\n\n<p>The World Ender is only one possible moniker for this titanic engine of destruction. The Apocalypse, The World Eater, The Harbinger, Death, The Annihilator, The Last Nightmare, The Wrath of Gods, and The Chosen One are all other titles it may wear. It is unclear if the creature is a singular entity, or one of many which have appeared in the death throes of the countless worlds consumed by the Haze.</p>\n\n<p>The World Ender cannot be reasoned with, bargained with, or understood; its origins and purposes remain shrouded in mystery — it simply is. The complexities of human civilization — the sprawling cities, political conflicts, bloody wars, and the rise and fall of monarchs, mages, heroes, and priests — are utterly meaningless before it. Once freed, it tramples cities without awareness or concern, obliterating armies and toppling nations with the same dispassionate ease with which natural forces reshape landscapes. Indeed, The World Enders rampage is more akin to an unfathomable natural disaster, blind to the devastation it wreaks.</p>\n\n<p>Efforts to understand or influence it are as futile as ants trying to comprehend a river that threatens to wash them away. In the face of such power, humanity is left scrambling for survival. Mortals become painfully aware that in the grand scheme of things, our existence might be as transient as raindrops in a storm, unnoticed by the forces that alter our world.</p>\n\n<h2>Desperate Speculation</h2>\n\n<p>Once unleashed, The World Ender becomes the subject of endless speculation and rumor. Even if the characters manage to defeat it promptly, explanations about its origins and nature abound, though none are conclusive or supported by concrete evidence. Various factions, including the mages of the Amethyst Academy, warriors of the Hooded Lanterns, resolute Flamekeepers, devout Silver Order paladins, worshippers of the Falling Fire, and even the bandits of the Queens Men, all propose their own theories, which are often quickly disproven or contradicted by new information. The reality is that any true understanding of the creatures intentions, purpose, or origins remains elusive, with knowledge about its completely alien motives being particularly scarce. Here are just a few of the tales told about it:</p>\n\n<h3>Horror from Beyond the Stars</h3>\n\n<p>The mages of the Amethyst Academy have long researched delerium, and discoveries in the Crater enable them to paint a full picture about the origin of the stones. When delerium is left uncontained in massive quantities, it is possible it can slowly grow and seep into the heart of an entire planet, eventually rotting the core. The entire surface becomes a wasteland of octarine crystals as big as buildings, with a Haze-covered sky of eldritch storm clouds that blacks out the sun. Under these conditions, contamination runs rampant and no lifeform on the surface is free from endless mutation. As the planet festers and mutates to the point of destruction, the Haze and delerium cause all manner of abominations to grow and change. Given the hundreds of years it takes for delerium to infect an entire planet, the mutated monstrosities have ample time to grow to massive proportions. This creature is but the first of many which could be created if the Academy is not able to contain and control delerium.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually however, the delerium begins to expand at an increased rate, and some of these creatures end up encased in the eldritch crystals, being forced into a state of hibernation. When the planet is fully contaminated, it explodes sending massive chunks of contaminated rock through the cosmos. Some of these meteors have mutated monstrosities housed within their cores, waiting for a time to break free upon a new contaminated world. We have received the remnants of a distant dead world, and we must contain it before the same thing happens to ours.</p>\n\n<p>Grandmaster Wizard Eldrick Runeweaver postulates that containment of The World Ender is best achieved by sealing it back inside a massive delerium formation: essentially re-creating the Delerium Heart. Such a feat would require a massive flood of contaminated energy and a locus of delerium geodes.</p>\n\n<h3>Catastrophic Mutation</h3>\n\n<p>The Knights of the Silver Order are resolute that The World Ender confirms the destructive blight that delerium represents. It must be contained and destroyed lest it consume and contaminate the entire earth. This massive monstrosity is but the first of a new generation of titanic horrors which will devour the earth if delerium is not dealt with soon. The Knights</p>\n\n<p>have a blunt theory about how it was created: its just another big mutant caused by the eldritch contamination of delerium. They cite the many documented instances when destroying or damaging a large cluster of delerium caused rifts between the planes or sudden surges of eldritch contamination. If the Delerium Heart is the largest piece of delerium ever encountered, then it stands to reason that shattering it would cause the largest Arcane Anomaly ever known. Its possible that the monster is the result of this catastrophe: it may have been conjured forth from some distant and unknown dimension of destruction, or perhaps a cascading mutation took root within a nearby creature.</p>\n\n<h3>Harbinger of Sin</h3>\n\n<p>The Followers of the Falling Fire believe a terrible sin has been wrought for destroying the Delerium Heart, and the salvation of this world is now in doubt. This cosmic being was meant to be The Harbinger of the Sacred Flame, but it has been unleashed before its preordained purpose. It is now an infant, mewling and raging at its destiny denied. Any hope we have must now be found in a monumental sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>Lucretia Mathias believes the only solution is to perform a special variant of the Sanctification of the Falling Fire upon the creature. Instead of using normal delerium crystals, one of the player characters must sacrifice themselves before The World Ender, and the other characters must embed the sanctified delerium crystal bearing the sacrificed heroes soul into The World Enders body. Perhaps then, the righteous soul of the fallen player character will fill the creature and turn it into a divine vessel.</p>\n\n<h3>A Grand and Cosmic Scheme</h3>\n\n<p>Panic spreads amongst the Queens Men as the scoundrels speculate that this creature came here on purpose. Mad rumors insist that it is a scout from a distant planet of huge lizard-creatures, and that The World Ender “piloted” the meteor into Drakkenheim with an intention to take over the world.</p>\n\n<p>The Queen of Thieves laughs while dismissing such conspiracies, caring little about the origin of the creature. Instead, she sees opportunity. Instead, she sees opportunity and searches for a way to capture or control The World Ender. After all, if its power could be harnessed, if she could learn what the creature wants, tame it and use it against her enemies…well, who would be able to stop her then? She would have an even finer prize pet than Big Linda!</p>\n\n<h3>Great Egg</h3>\n\n<p>Amongst the Hooded Lanterns, a strange idea emerges that the Delerium Heart was in fact some kind of gigantic egg which bore The World Ender. Lain by some distant cosmic creature, its eggs shoot through the cosmos like meteors, eventually crashing into unknown and unsuspecting worlds. There, the egg incubates for a hundred or more years, changing the landscape around it into suitable conditions for its young. When the egg hatches, an infant version of this cosmic entity emerges, and the planet it finds itself on is its first hungry meal. This being cares not for the creatures inhabiting these planets, it wont even acknowledge them. It simply is following its own cycle of life, and we are unfortunate enough to be here when it awakens.</p>\n\n<p>Lord Commander Elias Drexel is determined to destroy the beast by any means necessary, before it can spread destruction to the rest of Westemär. He looks to the characters and his soldiers to assemble a vast collection of siege weapons and artillery, which can be found in the arsenals of Castle Drakken. While it will take far more than these alone to bring the beast down, the cannons will no doubt be a useful distraction until The World Ender annihilates them.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study The World Ender, learning the following based on their result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(20+) Force of Destruction. </strong>You recognize The World Enders Resistances, Immunities, and its Immutable Form trait.</p>\n  <p><strong>(25+) Blast of Energy.</strong> You learn of the Enders Charge Eradication Beam and Eradication Beam actions.</p>\n  <p><strong>(30+) Nearly Unstoppable.</strong> You are aware of the The World Enders Rejuvenation trait.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>The World Ender is a force of utter destruction. It cares little for the creatures or structures around it and merely tramples through them without hesitation or remorse. The World Ender unceasingly proceeds forward, and never halts unless it is somehow prevented from moving. It does not flee or hide and has no conception for surrender or fear. It is a force of nature that levels cities to the ground, leaving a path of utter destruction in its wake.</p>\n\n<p>Few creatures pose an actual threat to The World Ender, and it is content to simply smash them with its Necrotic Claws or devour them with its Bite. Indeed, it may not even attack them directly, making most of its attacks against structures or the environment itself and letting the falling rubble crush any it encounters. When confronted with a large obstacle or building, it stops to unleash its Eradication Beam to clear a path forward with no regard for anything in its way.</p>\n\n<p>However, if The World Ender is actually damaged by an attack or spell, it snaps into action and unleashes its Bellowing Roar in response. It follows up with its Ground Slam and then continue attacking until whatever injured it is slain. If it senses it is under attack by multiple foes (such as an approaching army), it aims its Eradication Beam to destroy them. The World Ender calls down Octarine Lightning Strikes against airborne opponents who target it from above, or against groups of foes on the ground.</p>\n\n<h2>Harvestable Components (Legendary)</h2>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Animus: </strong>Aberration.</p>\n  <p><strong>Fluid:</strong> Monster Blood, Contaminated Ichor.</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong> Organs:</strong>\n    Eyes, Heart, Brain, Guts, Flesh.\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Bones: </strong>Skull, Spine, Ribs.</p>\n  <p><strong>Natural Weapons:</strong> Claws, Teeth, Tentacles.</p>\n  <p><strong>Hair: </strong>Fur.</p>\n  <p><strong>Hide: </strong>Skin.</p>\n  <p><strong>Dust: </strong>Aberrant Dust.</p>\n</div>"

Even the crew she paid to deliver the caged beast met their deaths at the hands of a Hooded Lanterns patrol shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n<p>It remains a mystery what creature transformed to become Big Linda, perhaps a mutated bird, or an overgrown gecko. The only creature remotely resembling it is the old dinosaur skeleton in the Drakkenheim museum, but even then, the many differences bring up a slew of questions as to its origin.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Queen keeps Big Linda well-fed and securely contained, she is aware the monstrosity is barely under her control. Maintaining the beasts feeding schedule of fresh “challengers” is difficult and few handlers last more than a week before being gobbled up. The position is seen as a death sentence rather than any position of prestige amongst the Queens Men.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study Big Linda, revealing the following based on their result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(10+) Hard to Kill.</strong> You know Big Lindas damage Immunities as well as its Rejuvenation and Regeneration traits.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Acidic Mucus! </strong>Youre aware of her Acid Spew attack.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Big, Clumsy, and Dumb.</strong> You recognize Big Lindas highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>Big Linda sends Acid Spew against groups of opponents.

She resisted, believing there was no safer place than the castle. But as screams erupted from the city and the Haze flowed from the South Ward, she finally agreed. Her handmaidens gathered her finest dresses, jewelry, and possessions, then used a secret passage to reach the sewers. They were wisked away by a royal boat on a private waterway to the Queen's Park Gardens but no further.</p>\n\n<p>On arrival, the contamination had already reached the gardens.

She was extraordinarily vain, hopelessly narcissistic, and frequently inebriated.

He had published seven different Academy texts on transmutation, human anatomy, the effects of magic on the physical form, and arcane mutations. Well regarded by his peers, many would say that Friedrich was as charming as he was sharp, and that his appreciation and dedication for the young mages who worked under him was unparalleled. He was known for talking at length about his findings, like a child excited about a new toy. To be in a room with him was sure to either teach you some new cutting edge arcane\n</p>\n\n<p>discovery, or lull you to sleep as he droned on about the percentile chances of arcane anomalies causing beneficial reactions over problematic ones based entirely on whether or not you were carrying a wand made of elmwood or willow root.</p>\n\n<p>After Drakkenheim fell, Friedrich became increasingly engrossed in the magical properties of delerium, the Haze, and eldritch contamination. He published another book titled The Effects of Arcane Contamination, Mutations, and How to Control Them, which detailed some less than orthodox concepts about transferring mutation or contamination. He had begun collecting various forms of insects in his labs and experimenting on them with transformations caused by delerium.</p>\n\n<p>The Academy let him continue his work for a time, until an investigation into several missing mages quickly led to the discovery that Friedrich had kidnapped and experimented on his own apprentices. A secret lab was discovered, filled with caged Dregs of various types. They were all former Academy members, now twisted by monstrous experimentation. The most horrifying discovery was made when the Directorate sent in Academy arcane hunters, members dedicated to bringing in malfeasant mages, to apprehend Friedrich. The researcher blasted half of them away with never-before-seen contaminated magic, before dissolving into a swarm of bugs and vanishing into cracks in the walls.</p>\n\n<p>The Silver Order was promptly contacted, and a bounty was put on Friedrich's head, with both the Academy and the Silver Order attempting to track him. In time, all leads went cold. The Academy seldom talks about the 23 mages who died at</p>\n\n<p>Friedrich's hands; his lengthy writings were all removed from Academy shelves. Rare collectors covet his work as something of a legend, and rumors suggest that perhaps the strange and mysterious character known now as the Pale Man, working in secret in the Haze of Drakkenheim, helping contaminated individuals, and taking care of all the odd monsters of the city, might very well be what has become of Friedrich von Lichten.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study the Pale Man, learning the following based on their result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(15+) Contaminated Monster.</strong> You know of his Creature Type, Resistances, and Immunities.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Master of Contaminated Magic.</strong> You learn of his Contaminating Touch and Abrupt Contaminant Epic Actions, and his Aura of Fleshy Insects.</p>\n  <p><strong>(25+) Nearly Deathless.</strong> Your are aware of his Crawling Flesh trait, as well as his weakest ability score and saving throw.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>The Pale Man attempts to be polite and cordial to his guests.

Some suspect the honey farms on the outskirts may have been the main source of these strange mutations, causing the apiarists and their hives to warp together, fusing into a grotesque and tortured creature. Their upper torso and head are now a writhing mass of open pores like a beehive, with bugs swarming in and out. They lumber around the ruins looking for nesting places where their hive can thrive. Many Bloated Hives operate alone, but sometimes a much more horrifying event occurs, where a single colony begins to occupy multiple Bloated Hives, forming a horrifying network.</p>\n\n<p>The Bloated Hive tends to hide itself in the dark corners of ruins, often seeking the most damp and warm locations in the city. Many hives have been found along the Drann River within the Inner City, a large group of them living under Champions Bridge, and even more in the sewers, Queens Park Garden, and a sparse few in the woods to the north of Drakkenheim. Whenever traversing into dark and damp areas in the city, be on the lookout for an increase in insect activity and the sound of buzzing.</p>\n\n<p>A Bloated Hive cannot speak, and acts on the whims of its occupants more so than its own free thought. Its mind is now a broken thing, connected inherently to the hive mind of a swarm of insects, but within that is a tortured human struggling for sentience. Some Bloated Hives have been known to respond to kind words, trinkets of their former selves, or music they recognize. Though these moments of subtle sentience are fleeting, as the hive reacts quickly to the feeling of an unwanted psyche struggling for dominance within the hive mind and could trigger a frenzied tantrum if not handled delicately.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Bloated Hive, recognizing the following based on their result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(5+) Sightless Awareness.</strong> You know the creatures Immunities and senses.</p>\n  <p><strong>(10+) Endless insects! </strong>You are aware of the creatures Spawn Swarm action and Disrupt the Hive trait.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Frail.</strong> You recognize the Bloated Hives strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>The Bloated Hive is usually a solitary creature that spends its time cowering in dark corners living out its cursed life as nothing more than a conduit for its colony. In combat, they focus entirely on keeping their distance from threats and spawning swarms of insects to defend themselves. If cornered, the Bloated Hive uses its Claws and Distracting Swarm before moving back into the shadows and attempting to escape and find a new nest.</p>\n\n<p>Larger packs of Bloated Hives are much braver and more violent, and actively hunt and pursue targets until their numbers are less than their prey. Places where large colonies gather are dangerous. The Bloated Hives work in unison to protect their nests.

Often, these poor animals must be abandoned not long after entering the ruins, injured from the unstable terrain. Prime targets for other predators, the horses are often tragically slaughtered. However, when their corpses are left behind, a parasite-like mutation festers within them, causing their skin to erupt with spider-like limbs, pincers, and maws.\n</p>\n\n<p>Disguising themselves as mere corpses strewn across the dark and misty streets of the ruined city, one can hardly differentiate a Bojack from a dead horse. With their spider limbs they can scurry along walls and ceilings with ease, and barely make a sound. They move with lightning-fast speed, able to scuttle across a city street in mere seconds. This terrifying speed, ease of traversing the terrain, and ability to disguise itself have made them a deadly threat to adventurers in the city.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most horrifying recorded encounters with Bojacks in Drakkenheim came from an early report from Hooded Lantern scouts investigating old stables south of Champions Gate near the city outskirts. They reported finding “piles of dead horses buzzing with large, mutated flies feasting on the meat.” The report goes on to speak of several of the horse corpses suddenly “bursting open” with “insectoid legs and a horrible maw formed from the splayed rib cage of the dead beasts.” The report describes the speed and ferocity displayed in the immediate strike, with nearly an entire squad of eight Hooded Lantern scouts ripped to shreds in only a matter of seconds while the remaining Lanterns fled back out of the city.</p>\n\n<p>One of the surviving Hooded Lanterns, Sten Livingston Sr., was brave enough to volunteer to lead the following expedition into the ruins. On the road into the city a dead and bloated horse corpse lay on the side of the road. Livingston stopped his troops and approached the beast with weapons drawn, kicking the corpse to check if it would spring to life. The corpse remained motionless. It has since become a tradition spread through the Lanterns, and even into new adventuring parties, to kick the horse on the way into Drakkenheim. Many have chalked this up to a sign of good luck, not realizing the harrowing story and the lives lost that caused this strange tradition.</p>\n\n<h2>Study the Foe</h2>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Bojack, learn the following based on their result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(10+) Parasitic Mutation. </strong>You recognize the Bojacks Immunities and senses.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Acidic Ambusher. </strong> Youre aware of the creatures Corrosive Mucus and Impaling Limbs attacks.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Fast and Cunning.</strong> You know the Bojacks strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Combat Tactics</h2>\n\n<p>The Bojack is an ambush skirmisher.

The artist gained renown in Liberio for their incredible metal statues and art exhibits at the Conservatory of Creation. He was the artist responsible for the Statue of Goliath which sits in the central courtyard of the conservatory.</p>\n\n<p>When commissioned by House von Drakken to build a statue befitting Castle Drakken, the artist first declined. Two months later, Nicoletti wrote back to the queen explaining that a great dragon had come to him in a dream. He claimed that the dragon emperor, Minazorond, had spoken to him, and that this mythical dragon of his dreams desired to watch over the city of Drakkenheim. The artist packed his supplies and moved to Drakkenheim to begin construction, which cost a queen's bounty in resources. Nicoletti believed that Minazorond would be the greatest work of his life, but a tragic accident occurred while hoisting the final piece of the statue to its place atop the castle. A pulley snapped, crushing Nicoletti beneath his creation. The great dragon Minazorond would be the last work Nicoletti ever created.</p>\n\n<p>Now Minazorond is a contaminated construct, and swiftly defends the castle from any who dare to set foot within its courtyards or attempt to scale its walls.</p>\n\n<h3>Study the Foe</h3>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in History or any kind of artisan's tools gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine Minazorond.

          "name": "Executioner",
          "text": "<p>The Executioner is a hulking clockwork knight that originally carried out public death sentences in the Slaughterstone Square of Drakkenheim. This ancient machine was engineered by the dwarves of Glitter Peak during the height of their brilliance in distant antiquity. It was left buried deep beneath the avalanches which destroyed the magnificent dwarven capital, and subsequently unearthed by an expeditionary team several decades ago. The king commissioned the Amethyst Academy to bring the construct back into good repair; they altered its arcane programming to obey the commands of the monarch of Westemär.</p>\n\n<p>Laws and customs surrounding capital punishment in Drakkenheim have been a controversial matter ever since the tyrannical reign of Albrecht von Drakken, who issued a draconian decree that demanded family members of the convicted be the ones to carry out their execution sentence. After his reign ended, few were ever willing to serve the role of royal headsman, viewing the act of carrying out the killing as yet another act of murder. Although various devices and contraptions were used to create distance between the death and the administer of the punishment, these hesitations and public resistance to capital punishment remained. In the Executioner, the monarchy had the perfect solution to its judicial problem: the impartial construct is no mortal, and therefore none are culpable for carrying out the death sentence. That the machine makes an impressively terrifying show of the deed was certainly not an insignificant factor either.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the erratic magic of delerium has scrambled the machine's control protocols. Now contaminated by the Haze, the construct is an engine of destruction and terror which can call upon spectral chains and the spirits of its victims to aid its duty. It attacks anyone who enters the square. However, it never wanders outside the bounds of Slaughterstone Square. The large octagonal plaza features the Executioner's platform, and the surrounding buildings have narrow balconies and tall, dour-looking windows overlooking the square. Mountains of corpses are piled in the square—the grim toll of the Executioner's vocation. Nevertheless, scavengers and adventurers still occasionally risk trying to slip past the Executioner to loot the corpses for valuable equipment and magic items. For many, this mistake is their last, and rather than escape with new treasures, they join the pile of the Executioner's trove.</p>\n\n<h3>Study the Foe</h3>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in History or artisan's tools gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine the Executioner, learning the following based on the result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(5+) Unstoppable Machine.</strong> You know of the Executioner's Immutable Form, Dimensional Anchor, and Rejuvenation traits, as well as its damage Immunities.</p>\n  <p><strong>(10+) Strange Abilities.</strong> You recognize its Destroyer, Summon Grasping Shadow, and Guillotine Blade actions.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Powerfully Tough.</strong> You are aware of the Executioner's strongest and weakest saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Combat Tactics</h3>\n\n<p>The Executioner is not a foe to be defeated, but rather an obstacle to be avoided or a danger to escape. It is a reminder of the callous and uncontrollable dangers present in Drakkenheim. The Executioner's combat tactics vary based on whether it detects low-level characters trespassing in Slaughterstone Square or high-level characters trying to defeat the machine itself. The Executioner pursues its targets within Slaughterstone Square, but never leaves the plaza.</p>\n\n<p>When the Executioner detects creatures trespassing on Slaughterstone Square, it responds first by using Summon Grasping Shadows, followed up by Death Grip to try to prevent their escape. Meanwhile, it uses Lumber Forward to gain ground. You should embrace clever solutions that characters invent to escape or bypass the Executioner. As long as your players aren't trying to destroy it, the Executioner will only use Guillotine Blade against a Restrained target within its melee range, and does not make ranged attacks nor activate its Necrotic Vents aura.</p>\n\n<p>However, should your players engage the Executioner directly in combat, do not pull any punches. They have made an incredibly foolish mistake by confronting a well-telegraphed deathtrap and should be served their just desserts. It activates its Necrotic Vents, and then relentlessly attacks with its Guillotine Blade. The Executioner throws the massive weapon to hit targets trying to avoid it in melee, or those that try to harm it with ranged weapons or spells. If it encounters any impediment in its way (such as a <em>Wall of Force</em>), it crushes it with Destroyer.</p>\n\n<h3>Harvestable Components (Legendary)</h3>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>Animus:</strong> Construct.</p>\n  <p><strong>Fluid:</strong> Elemental Fluid, Contaminated Ichor.</p>\n  <p><strong>Natural Weapons:</strong> Blades.</p>\n  <p><strong>Hide:</strong> Plates.</p>\n  <p><strong>Dust:</strong> Elemental Dust.</p>\n</div>"

I've burned down my own workshop more times than I can remember, and I'll do it again.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Study the Foe</h3>\n\n<p>Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Chemist, learning the following based on the result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"hanging-indent-wrapper\">\n  <p><strong>(10+) Resistance from Exposure.</strong> You know of the Chemist's damage Resistances and Immunities.</p>\n  <p><strong>(15+) Masters of Compounds. </strong>You learn the Chemist's Critical Condition trait and Explosive Compound action.</p>\n  <p><strong>(20+) Mental, not Physical, Prowess.</strong> You are aware of the Chemist's AC and saving throws.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Combat Tactics</h3>\n\n<p>Chemists opt to start things off with a bang, unleashing their Explosive Concoction on the first round, especially against a grouped together party. They use Acid Rain to create a dangerous zone between them and their enemies and default to unleashing their Chemical Spray on enemies stuck in the difficult area. If a creature closes the distance on the Chemist, they use their Caustic Grip. If they find themselves surrounded or outnumbered in close quarters, they attempt to escape.</p>"

Trolls! They are stupid, violent creatures, and as a Caspian I would know! They come in many different forms, but the smell is pretty consistent. Before your empathy pours in, remember the countless Caspians I personally sent to deal with the trolls, who never returned to their families.\"\n    </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>—Pluto Jackson</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"drop-cap\">When the commonfolk think of monsters, trolls are often top of mind. Although slumbering dragons, hulking giants, and the eldritch horrors of Drakkenheim loom large in tales and imaginations alike, seldom do such terrors invade people's everyday lives. Trolls, however, roam far and wide throughout Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär. They are by far one of the most common and well-known monsters plaguing the continent; children hearing of trolls under bridges or as a cautionary tale to venturing into the woods at night. Indeed, those in rural villages, farmsteads, or unwary travelers taking the backroads, may sometimes run afoul of a hungry troll. Many such communities have their own stories about local run-ins with trolls, ranging from the comedic to the tragic and occasionally the terrifying.</p>\n\n<h2>Origins in the Faerie Otherworlds</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls tell few tales about their own origins, and so it falls to mortal scholars to speculate how they came to this world. Legend says that trolls came from the Faerie Otherworlds long before a great winter fell upon the world. Accounts vary on why and how; some tell of how they were driven from enchanted realms by fey tricksters. Other stories say that trolls are a curse sent by a vengeful Faerie King or Queen for some half-remembered trespass made by mortals millennia ago. Perhaps foolish warlocks accidentally summoned the trolls here in attempts to bargain with their patrons, opening rifts that allowed entities from the Otherworlds to enter the Material Plane. Perhaps the first few trolls simply got very, very lost searching for their next meal, and wandered through a Thin Place only to find that a local farm made for a fortuitous feast. The Faerie Otherworlds are after all the closest “neighbor” dimension to the Mortal World—creatures stumbling through the thin veil that separates these planes is more common than through any other.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of how they got here, trolls arrived so long ago that there is not a wild place on the continent that isn't home</p>\n\n<p>to some form of troll. Every major city and settlement has their stories of why you shouldn't traverse dark forests, old swamps, or deep caves alone, and the heroic deeds of great heroes who have rescued such wayward travelers from the clutches of these great beasts.</p>\n\n<h2>Caspian Legends</h2>\n\n<p>In the realm of Caspia, slaying a troll is considered a crucial test of valor and a rite of passage for proving one's worth as a warrior. Troll hunting has evolved into a sport among the Caspians, and many ale houses resound with tales of brave knights confronting fearsome trolls. Distinct varieties of trolls inhabit different parts of the region — the trolls of Trogrowth Forest, the cave dwellers of Caspian Canyon, the Storm Trolls of Bladeshatter Bay, and the Magma Trolls in the deep caverns beneath Dragon's Vault — each with their own legends deeply embedded in Caspian lore.</p>\n\n<p>Caspians take great pride in recounting their battles with these formidable creatures. They decorate their keeps with the skulls of slain trolls, and confronting a troll is widely regarded as a fundamental milestone for those aspiring to be recognized as true Caspian warriors.</p>\n\n<h2>Appetites and Bargains</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls are creatures defined by their insatiable hunger, often driven by the pursuit of their next meal. This relentless appetite shapes their interactions, behaviors, and societal structures. Securing food is paramount in their daily existence. Despite their fearsome nature and formidable size, trolls typically avoid complex strategies in favor of straightforward approaches to satiating their hunger. This simplicity in motivation, however, does not mean they lack cunning or adaptability when opportunities to feed present themselves without substantial effort. Trolls have a particular craving for fresh meat, wealth, and captives, reveling in the manipulation and terror they can instill in those they encounter, aiming to extract as much as possible before brutally dispatching their victims.</p>\n\n<p>Trolls often rely on their imposing stature, strength, and fearsome reputation to intimidate travelers into relinquishing goods, food, gems, or other valuables in exchange for safe passage. This method allows trolls to amass supplies without the need for hunting. When interacting with humans, trolls make demands they know will be unpalatable, such as threatening to devastate a</p>\n\n<p>farm unless the farmers surrender their prized livestock or even a family member. They have been known to demand adventurers sacrifice an arm and a leg for safe conduct, resorting to violence against those who cannot meet their steep demands.</p>\n\n<p>Trolls are largely solitary creatures, but occasionally form their own secluded communities, creating tight-knit groups that operate as small hunting packs. Strategically, they set up camps or outposts near pathways frequented by wagons or lone travelers, or at narrow passages like gates and bridges where travelers have little choice but to confront them.</p>\n\n<h2>Elemental Evolutions</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls inherently possess extraordinary regeneration. Their bodies rapidly heal any injury, even regrowing lost limbs and body parts in mere minutes. However, a troll's regeneration is somewhat flawed, prone to leaving behind scar tissue and imperfections which, over time, result in the knobby hide and thick outer skin of most trolls. However, in rare cases, a troll can develop bizarre mutations when they regenerate, such as sprouting additional limbs. Over time, this trait has driven rapid evolutionary developments among trollkin based on their environments. Trolls can adapt to thrive in remote and hazardous settings simply by surviving anything these places can throw at them, even taking on the elemental traits of their surroundings.</p>\n\n<p>In the dense forests, @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.709oaktroll00000]{Oak Trolls} have evolved as a dominant species, while the overgrown brushlands and marshes are frequent havens for @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.707humongousfung]{Fungus Trolls}. @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.705elementaltrol#winter-troll]{Winter Trolls} navigate the lofty peaks and the desolate expanses of Netherwind, while @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.705elementaltrol#storm-troll]{Storm Trolls} roam along the shores of the Crystal Coast and Bladeshatter Bay.

          "text": "<h1 class=\"banner no-toc\" data-split-here=\"Locations and Lairs\">Locations and Lairs</h1>\n\n<p>Trolls build their burrows or camps in secluded, hard-to-reach areas such as great mountain caves, or deep within treacherous swamps. They often live in small groups and hunt the areas surrounding their homes for wildlife or wandering adventurers.</p>\n\n<h2>Traps and Hazards</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls know their environments well and often purposely build near natural hazards or outfit the areas surrounding their homes with traps formed of natural elements. They are smart hunters and know how to protect themselves. Use traps and hazards freely when designing troll environments.</p>\n\n<h2>Scavenged Goods</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls are collectors. They keep anything shiny or that they deem interesting from adventurers they have killed. They often have sacks filled with combinations of mundane trinkets and potential magical items. Almost anything can be found amongst a troll's collection.</p>\n\n<p>Some items commonly found in a troll's bag are below. Choose 2–3 or roll a [[/r 1d12]] twice.</p>\n\n@Embed[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.tables.RollTable.hwxzZ6nkB2EqTcTR rollable]\n\n<h2>Natural Networks</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls build their homes in natural environments, preferring lairs that have more than one exit, possible secret passages, and multiple ways for them to get the drop on any unwanted intruders. They may not be the smartest creatures around, but they are good at defending their homes, and eating humans who try to trespass in them.</p>\n\n<h2>Minions and Pets</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls are known for taming creatures to aid them in hunting. Oftentimes these creatures are beasts or monstrosities that they keep as pets. Dire Wolves, Owlbears, Giant Lizards, or more exotic creatures can be companions to a group of hunting trolls.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to their lairs, oftentimes trolls find habitats with natural wildlife that can act as guards to their own burrows and camps. Finding a cave with a gelatinous cube already residing in it, or a swamp filled with giant crocodiles is perfectly fine for a troll. They try to use these natural predators to deter unwanted guests.</p>\n\n<h2>Known Lairs</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls typically reside out of the way of humanoid civilizations, knowing very well that humans and trolls do not often get along, they tend to occupy less hospitable locations. Trolls have a rare ability to regenerate, and this regenerative gene has made them quick to evolve and adapt to almost any environment.</p>\n\n<h3>Trogrowth Forest</h3>\n\n<p>The Trogrowth forest of Caspia is one of the most well-known locations for Caspian sport troll hunting. The woods are filled with all manner of trolls. Many of the typical trolls reside there, but one of the most fearsome troll types to be discovered in the forests are the @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.707humongousfung]{Fungus Trolls}, whose numbers swell quickly and can easily overwhelm an unprepared Caspian hunt.</p>\n\n<h3>Elvenmire Wetlands</h3>\n\n<p>Many of the continent's swamps are home to @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.707humongousfung]{Fungus Trolls} as well. In any place where fungus is common, there is a chance of a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.706trollhag00000]{Troll Hag} starting a garden of @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.708fungaltrollin]{Trollings}. Swamps are seldom inhabited by humans, and so make prime locations for Fungal Troll farms, and burrows of all sorts of trollkin.</p>\n\n<h3>Ruins of Drakkenheim</h3>\n\n<p>It's well known that many trolls took up at King's Gate and Queen's Park Gardens when Drakkenheim fell. But these trolls are of lesser concern than the ones who got lost in the city itself. Several trolls who fell to contamination still roam the city streets as mindless @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.705eldritchtroll]{Eldritch Trolls}.</p>\n\n<h3>Hagatha's Lair</h3>\n\n<p>Between the sister lakes of the Eastern Vales, deep in the murky Shadow Fens, lies a little cottage made of old, moss-covered wood, a quaint cobblestone walkway leads up to its yellow oak door. A stone chimney spouts puffs of black-gray smoke, and a canopy of green leaves cover it from the sun. mushrooms big and small grow upon the wooden exterior, and cover the mossy roof, some as small as a gold piece, others as big as a wagon wheel. The crude wood fence around Hagatha's cabin has an old wooden sign pointing down the swampy road that reads “Snaggletooth Road.” All manner of frogs, flies, gators, and other critters poke their faces out from the algae-covered waters surrounding the winding narrow path.</p>\n\n<p>Hagatha is a @UUID[Compendium.drakkenheim-monsters.guide.JournalEntry.drakkenheimTro07.JournalEntryPage.706trollhag00000]{Troll Hag} who delights in growing mushrooms of all shapes and sizes, using her magic to imbue them with sentience to employ them as minions around her cottage. She makes occasional journeys north to the main road and small villages to offer villagers some of her fine brews. She's known for making dangerous propositions to folks in desperate situations, and many have lost children, wealth, or health to her bargains.</p>"

It's likely that using trolls in groups of two or three is going to pose a great threat to most parties.</p>\n\n<h2>Regenerative Abilities</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls have the ability to regenerate. Depending on the type of troll, they have different vulnerabilities that stop their regeneration. Pay attention to what damage types are being used against the trolls. Some parties may be ill-equipped to take on some types of troll if they do not have the right spells, items, or abilities.</p>\n\n<h2>Harsh Environments</h2>\n\n<p>Trolls often look for an edge in battle by fighting in an environment that favors them and not their foe. Mucky swamps filled with toxic gases, burning volcanoes with falling magma, a treacherous storm with high winds. Keep environmental effects in mind when using trolls and think of the places they inhabit, and how they might use that to their advantage.</p>\n\n<h2>Aggressive Persistence</h2>\n\n<p>Unless a troll is facing foes who are using the proper damage types against it, they have no reason to let up. A troll who can regenerate is not afraid to die, as it will keep growing back and closing its wounds. They are territorial in nature, so as long as a threat remains in their territory, they defend it and continue their assault. A troll only flees if it receives damage it cannot regenerate and it has a chance to actually die.</p>\n\n<div class=\"blockquote parchment\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Trolls come in many shapes and sizes but they can all do one thing well; die.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</div>"

If travelers or adventurers try to bargain with them, trolls may ask to eat one of them as payment, unless offered something tastier or more valuable than a delicious adventurer.</p>\n\n<p>Trolls do not enjoy being fooled, ignored, or talked down to, and oftentimes those who try to converse with trolls soon find out the hard way what happens when they don't get their way.
