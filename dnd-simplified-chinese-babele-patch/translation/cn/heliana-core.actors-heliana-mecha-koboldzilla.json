Of course, the Kobold Resources department is under strict orders to keep this under wraps lest it make the kobolds begin to doubt their work.</p><p><em><strong>Paradox of Gullibility.</strong></em> This brings us to a paradox. Kobolds are pretty gullible, and will believe almost anything if enough big words and shinies are used. But, if enough of them start believing a lie, the lie can come true.
