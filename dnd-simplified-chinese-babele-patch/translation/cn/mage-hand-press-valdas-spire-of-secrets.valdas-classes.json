These dynamos can be configured to store their energy at a specific resonance, such that, when it is released, it perfectly replicates the effect of a spell. Indeed, these few alchemists have begun to brave the frontier of spellcasting without an ounce of arcane talent; just a knack for tinkering and endless inventiveness.</p><h3>Spectrum Analyzer</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, you have invented a small device shaped like a monocle capable of rendering magical auras visible to the naked eye.

The table also shows what the level of those slots held in each of your dynamos is; all of these spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your wizard spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell dynamo. You regain all expended spell dynamos when you finish a long rest.</p><p><strong>Preparing Spells.</strong> Unlike other spells, you must prepare the spells held in each of your spell dynamos in advance. When you finish a long rest, you configure each of your dynamos to cast a particular wizard spell you know. You can only use a spell dynamo to cast a spell to which it is configured. When you finish a short or long rest, you can reconfigure your unexpended dynamos to hold different spells.</p><p><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</strong> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation and transmutation spells on the wizard spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher.

Stat blocks for <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.rpgrJaE2VxQVOFhQ]{skeletons}</strong>, <strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.84veSFEcqHpz8TAp]{zombies}</strong>, and other <strong>thralls</strong> can be found in the @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.journals.JournalEntry.hVI5iJCrWudNt1t0.JournalEntryPage.J61JZKRvR7dB9Bg1#undead-thralls]{Undead Thralls} section at the end of the class description.</p><h3>Commanding Thralls</h3><p>You can mentally control all of your thralls while you are conscious without using any actions. If you are unconscious, your thralls will move to protect your body from harm, but will not attack.</p><p>In combat, your thralls take their turns immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice). All your thralls collectively share one reaction and bonus action, which a single thrall can use each round.</p><p>Thralls use your spell attack modifier to make their attacks.</p><h3>Maximum Thralls</h3><p>You can animate and control one thrall of challenge rating (CR) 1/4. As you gain levels in this class, you can animate more thralls. The combined CR of all your thralls can’t exceed the number shown in the Thrall CR Total column of the Necromancer table, and the total number of thralls under your control can never exceed your proficiency bonus.</p><p>At any time, you can use your action to sever your connection to one or more thralls, releasing them. Corporeal Undead crumple into a heap and incorporeal Undead flee to the Ethereal Plane.</p><h3>Animate Dead</h3><p>Beginning at 5th level, a necromancer can learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.SebqiByepbP7JWpg]{animate dead}</em> spell, a staple of the school of necromancy. Necromancers can cast this spell as an action, instead of over the course of 1 minute.</p><div><p>All Undead created by the <em>animate dead</em> spell (as well as any other magic, such as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.E4NXux0RHvME1XgP]{create undead}</em> spell, that allows you to control Undead) count as your thralls and can be commanded as such. If your new thralls granted to you by a spell cause you to exceed your total CR or number of thralls, you can immediately sever your connection to any of your existing thralls so as to stay within these limits. Your thralls can never command or create other Undead.</p><p>As always, you can’t reanimate Undead that have been reduced to 0 hit points. Your Animate Thralls ritual, the <em>animate dead</em> spell, and similar magic only affects Humanoid corpses, whereas your thralls are Undead creatures.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.journals.JournalEntry.hVI5iJCrWudNt1t0.JournalEntryPage.vGk02jpmgxkIeZ2v#variant-thralls]{Sidebar: Variant Thralls}</p></div>"

If you hit, the bullet passes through the target and continues in a straight line out to its normal range, stopping early if it strikes a solid object. Make a separate ranged attack roll against each creature in this line in order. On a hit, the bullet deals damage to the target and passes through it; on a miss, the bullet stops.</p>",

If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p><p><strong>Spells.</strong> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p><p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p><p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p><p><strong>Magical Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p><p><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong> A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p><p><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong> Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

You can have only one cohort at a time.</p><p>If your cohort is ever slain, you can raise them from the dead by the usual methods, such as the <em>raise dead</em> spell, or you can spend 8 hours initiating a new cohort. If you do so, your previous cohort loses all abilities granted by this ability, even if it is later returned to life.</p><p>Your cohort obeys your commands as best it can. Your cohort takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice), and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</p><h3>Cohort Features</h3><p>At 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, your cohort gains new abilities based on its archetype.</p><h3>Hit Points</h3><p>For each captain level you gain after 2nd, your cohort gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p><h3>Ability Scores</h3><p>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your cohort’s abilities also improve. Your cohort can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature, unless its description specifies otherwise.</p><p>When you improve a cohort’s ability scores, remember to also increase other relevant statistics, such as skill bonuses, bonuses to hit and damage, and spell save DCs.</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><p>Your cohort gains proficiency in skills listed in its statistics. It also gains proficiency with simple weapons, martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, or shields if its statistics contain weapons or armor from that category.</p><p>Your cohort uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. Because cohort statistics already include a +2 proficiency bonus, you need only adjust the attack bonus, skill proficiencies, and saving throw proficiencies starting at 5th level.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>Your cohort’s alignment is within one step of your own, and has a personality trait and flaw determined by the GM. Its bond is always, “I will follow my commander into any fray, and I will gladly fight by their side until my death.”</p><p></p><p>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.journals.JournalEntry.afVV4gM4mg7h6KOk.JournalEntryPage.CygO5eA6UtWMK1tL]{Sidebar: Customizing Cohorts}</p>"

On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the start of its next turn, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken.

You take half the damage (rounded down) and the hexed creature takes the remaining damage.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Black Sacrifice</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, if your familiar is within 10 feet of you, you can use your action to command it to dissolve its magical bond to this plane, which unleashes a torrent of necromantic energy. Each creature you choose within 20 feet of your familiar must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 10d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt. A target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Once you use this feature, you can’t summon your familiar again until you finish a long rest.</p>",

You gain two monstrous grafts of your choice. Additionally, you don’t lose hit points or Hit Dice from installing or removing grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft. See Appendix C for monstrous grafts.</p>\n<h3>Surgical Attack</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, whenever you take the Attack or prime and throw a bomb on your turn, you can make an unarmed strike as part of that action. You can only use this ability if your unarmed strike is improved by a graft, such as Bestial Features.</p>\n<h3>Necromatic Organs</h3>\n<p>By 10th level, you’ve learned how to tinge your own biology with necromancy through reanimated organs that will persist after your death. If you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.</p>\n<p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>It's Alive!</h3>\n<p>Beginning at 18th level, your research into the field of necromancy has culminated in an alchemical golem stitched together from discarded body parts. You can create an alchemy golem through an 8-hour-long procedure, which can be conducted over the course of a long rest. To complete this process, you must have a healer’s kit, alchemist’s supplies, and a knife (or a facility with access to such tools), as well as at least three recently deceased Humanoid corpses.</p>\n<p>Your alchemy golem acts independently on its own turn, but always obeys your commands. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command your golem if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the golem will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the golem only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the golem continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>\n<p>The golem can use your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus for its attack rolls.</p>\n<p>When the alchemy golem drops to 0 hit points, it dies. You can restore your alchemy golem’s hit points and reanimate it over the course of a short or long rest.</p>\n<p>You can attach up to three grafts to your alchemy golem. You can only have one alchemy golem at a time.</p>",

When it triggers, the ballista fires automatically, making a ranged attack against the creature.</p><p>This attack roll uses your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus.

When a Small or larger creature moves within the trap’s area, the trap clamps down on the creature. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 slashing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, it becomes trapped, rendering it unable to move. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t trapped. The trapped creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your Masterwork save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success.

The answer to this question may very well be at the heart of alchemy itself. Alchemists who choose to research slimes in depth are called ooze ranchers, for they breed and keep numerous slimes to experiment upon.</p><h3>Ooze Empathy</h3><p>Starting when you choose this field of study at 2nd level, you’ve developed a pheromone mix that endears all kinds of slime to you. Whenever an Ooze tries to attack you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your bomb save DC. On a failed save, its attack misses. On a successful save, the Ooze is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.</p><h3>Formula: @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.2ovYmMpUBmSmR2Qw]{Formula: Slime Bomb}</h3><p>At 2nd level, you can mix your bomb’s explosive contents with the remnants of an ooze, changing it into a slime bomb.

Slime can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water or by taking an action to remove most of it.</p><h3>Bottled Oozes</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you’ve learned a clever alchemical trick for condensing oozes into denser states and storing them in stasis for later use. Whenever you brew potions, you can spend 2 reagent dice to create an ooze bottle (see Chapter 5).</p><p>Your Oozes use your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus for their attack rolls, and use your bomb save DC in place of their save DCs.</p><h3>Liquid Anatomy</h3><p>By 10th level, you have injected yourself with ozoplasm, the gooey substance which composes oozes and slimes, mutating your form. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing (though your equipment doesn’t similarly compress). Moreover, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.</p><h3>Ooze Jug</h3><p>Beginning at 18th level, you’ve solved the problem that prevented large oozes from being bottled: you just needed a much larger bottle. You have an ooze jug, which functions like an ooze bottle, but contains a single larger ooze. You can only have one ooze jug at a time.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Long Arm of the Law</h3><p>At 10th level, once per turn when you hit a Large or smaller creature with a firearm attack, you can choose to deal half as much damage to hobble the target. The creature can’t move on its next turn unless it first takes the Disengage action.</p><h3>Gold Star Hero</h3><p>At 14th level, your capacity for heroism increases. Your features from this archetype gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>While a creature has temporary hit points granted by your Lay Down the Law feature, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li><li>The range of your Steely-Eyed Aura feature increases to 30 feet.</li><li>You regain the use of your Reach for the Skies feature when you finish a short or long rest.</li></ul>",

However, ambitious craftsmen from the Mechanauts’ Guild have drawn up designs for a new vehicle, mightier and more customizable than the old apparatus. This device is a walking tank, equipped with savage fists, scuttling legs, and climate control enhancements—a vehicle to dwarf all others, a true feat of engineering.</p><p></p><h2>Mechanaut's Apparatus</h2><p>At 3rd level, you complete the frame of a @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.bestiary.Actor.Yl22agBQ8SwgJwmP]{Mechanaut’s Apparatus}, with ample room for upgrades and improvements. Its blueprints are based on the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.lSd5QHnIJbKvP1bh]{apparatus of the crab}</em>, but you can model your apparatus after any Beast or as a Humanoid figure.</p><p><em><strong>Apparatus Statistics.</strong></em> The statistics of your apparatus are given in the Mechanaut’s Apparatus stat block. The apparatus’s Armor Class is based on your Intelligence modifier and its hit points are based on your craftsman level.</p><p><em><strong>Customizing the Apparatus.</strong></em> Your apparatus comes with two installed masterwork weapons, which you can modify with masterwork properties or replace with different weapons when you finish a long rest. Only one installed weapon can be ranged. Furthermore, you can only load or reload an installed ranged weapon by using your action while you are inside the apparatus (or two actions if the weapon has the Mounted property). Your apparatus is always proficient with its installed weapons, and can use masterwork weapons with Master and Legendary properties.</p><p><em><strong>Repairing the Apparatus.</strong></em> When your apparatus drops to 0 hit points, it can’t move or act, but can be repaired. You can spend 1 minute restoring the apparatus’s ability to move at half speed, which it loses if it takes damage again before it is repaired.</p><p>You can repair your apparatus at the end of a short rest by spending your Hit Dice, causing it to regain hit points as if it had taken a short rest. When you finish a long rest, you can repair your apparatus, causing it to regain all its hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to repair your apparatus. If your apparatus is lost, you can build a new one for 400 gp.</p><p><em><strong>Entering and Exiting the Apparatus.</strong></em> A creature can enter or exit the apparatus by using half its movement. While within the apparatus, a creature has total cover from effects originating outside of it.</p><p>Your armor properties have no effect while you are within the apparatus. Only one Medium or Small creature can be in the apparatus at a time.</p><p><em><strong>Piloting the Apparatus.</strong></em> A creature that is inside the apparatus can pilot it; the apparatus acts on its pilot’s turn. Any creature piloting the apparatus can command it to move on its turn (no action required). When you pilot the apparatus, you can use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. You can also command it to use a reaction, using your own reaction to do so.</p><p>Only one creature can pilot the apparatus at a time. The pilot takes half of the amount of damage the apparatus takes.</p><p>While you are outside the apparatus, you can command the apparatus to wait or follow you. While following, it moves on its turn to remain within 30 feet of you.</p><p><em><strong>Attacking with the Apparatus.</strong></em> The apparatus attacks with its integrated weapons as if you were wielding them, and uses your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (your choice) for its attack and damage rolls, using the same modifier for both. When you take the Attack action, it makes the same number of attacks you normally would.</p><p></p><h2>Cockpit Upgrade</h2><p>At 3rd level, you can customize your apparatus by upgrading its piloting compartment. Choose one of the following upgrades:</p><p><em><strong>Comfortable Amenities.</strong></em> The interior of the apparatus is particularly cozy, perhaps even including a warm blanket and pillow. You can sleep while within the apparatus without ill effect.</p><p><em><strong>Ejector Seat.</strong></em> This apparatus comes equipped with an emergency ejection system, allowing for quick escape. Exiting this apparatus costs no movement.</p><p><em><strong>Loudspeaker.</strong></em> The apparatus comes equipped with a system that magnifies your voice up to three times as loud as normal.</p><p></p><h2>Limb Upgrade</h2><p>By 7th level, you have redesigned your apparatus’s legs to achieve better mobility. Choose one of the following upgrades:</p><p><em><strong>Arachnotron Legs.</strong></em> The apparatus can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and ceilings, and it gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.</p><p><em><strong>Heavy Suspension.</strong></em> The apparatus’s jump distance triples, and it takes no damage from falling a distance of less than 100 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Telescopic Frame.</strong></em> While no one is inside the apparatus, you can use your bonus action to command it to collapse down to Medium size or return to Large size. While collapsed in this way, the apparatus can’t be entered.</p><p></p><h2>Passenger Seat</h2><p>Starting at 10th level, you have installed a second seat inside the cockpit, which takes an action to enter and exit. A creature can’t pilot the apparatus from this seat, but it does have total cover from outside effects.</p><p></p><h2>Attachment Upgrade</h2><p>Beginning at 14th level, you have installed an external attachment to your apparatus. Choose one of the upgrades below. Once you use the installed upgrade, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p><p><em><strong>Ballista Cannon.</strong></em> As an action, you can fire the apparatus’s integrated heavy ballista in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC, taking 5d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><em><strong>Gyro Module.</strong></em> You can use your action to rapidly rotate your apparatus, allowing you to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. You can't move between these attacks.</p><p><em><strong>Rocket Engine.</strong></em> You can use your bonus action to light the apparatus’s installed rocket engine, propelling you up to 30 feet in a straight line in any direction you choose. If you make a melee attack immediately after this movement, the attack is made with advantage. On a hit, this attack knocks the target prone or pushes it up to 10 feet away from you (your choice).</p><p></p><h2>Legendary Property</h2><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft.

      "description": "<p>The god-kings of ancient kingdoms practiced a unique style of necromancy, forgotten to time. Through the extraction of organs, the desiccation of flesh, and innumerable enchantments, those ancient kings were able to rule their subjects as divine, undead beings, long past their mortal deaths. While those kingdoms have been lost to the shifting sands and wild jungles of the world, their methods have been preserved in the carvings of colossal temples and revived by modern necromancers, who take on the guise of the erstwhile pharaohs. Their magic is a hybrid of divine and arcane influences, the legacy of god-kings from a forgotten age.</p><div><h3>Pharaoh Spells</h3><p>When you choose this ambition at 3rd level, you learn additional spells as noted in the table below. Each of these spells counts as a necromancer spell for you, but doesn’t count against the number of necromancer spells you know. New spells are marked with an asterisk.</p><p>Additionally, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MUO1uYN7JR1hm4dR]{thaumaturgy}</em> cantrip, which is a necromancer spell for you and doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8dzaICjGy6mTUaUr]{bless}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7buEm5KhI5lP8m1z]{guiding bolt}</em></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.6peH8olYNkDLlmRZ]{halo of flame},* @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify}, @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.I3nQcRiC9kV9YW9e]{snakestaff}*</em></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{death ward}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XqzXSKNR75ZdYTA9]{divination}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.OVikYmSdHliAG2YD]{insect plague}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Holy Symbol</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells.</p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you can channel your pseudo-divinity to fuel magical effects. You start with one effect: Ankh of Radiance. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Additionally, you can expend 15 Charnel Touch points as an action to regain one expended use of your Channel Divinity.</p><p>Ankh of Radiance. As an action, you can brandish your holy symbol and bless a number of willing creatures up to your Intelligence modifier that you can see within 60 feet of you with holy radiance, which lasts for 1 minute. The first time a blessed creature takes damage, it has resistance to that damage. If it took damage from a melee weapon attack, the attacker takes 1d6 radiant damage. The blessing then ends for that creature.</p><p>The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p><h3>Mock Divinity</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can convincingly reflect the trappings of a demigod walking the earth. You can create the following additional effects when using the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.MUO1uYN7JR1hm4dR]{thaumaturgy}</em> cantrip:</p><ul><li>You can brighten or darken the sun or moon, affecting the area within 120 feet of you for up to 1 minute. You can change darkness to dim light and dim light to bright light, or vice versa. Additionally, you can heighten bright light to a blazing radiance, which causes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks which rely on sight, or you can deepen darkness to a pitch black, which limits darkvision to a 30-foot radius. This deeper darkness has no effect on creatures that can see in magical darkness.</li><li>You manifest a Huge illusory avatar of a deity at a point you can see within 120 feet of you, which mimics your movements and projects your speech in a booming voice for 1 minute.</li></ul><h3>Channel Divinity: Scarab of Judgement</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to transfer life from the undead to the living. As an action, you can touch an Undead creature you control and choose a willing Humanoid you can see within 60 feet of you. The Undead is destroyed and reduced to dust, and the Humanoid regains hit points equal to the Undead’s hit points. Once a creature regains hit points in this way, it can’t do so again until it finishes a long rest.</p><h3>Lichdom: God-King</h3><p>At 20th level, you undergo the ancient funeral rites of the pharaohs, removing your organs and entombing your body in a sarcophagus amongst your worldly possessions. You become the oldest and most exalted type of lich: a god-king. You gain the following features in addition to the Lichdom feature:</p><p><em><strong>Canopic Phylacteries.</strong></em> Your phylactery has also changed with your transformation. Your stomach, lungs, intestines, and liver have been removed and placed into canopic jars. Each one has a specific weakness, which you will need to discuss with your GM, and your regeneration is only stopped when all four canopic jars are destroyed. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you reform at your sarcophagus.</p><p><em><strong>Mummy Rot.</strong></em> When you hit with a Charnel Touch attack and expend 20 or more points, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 3d6 for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or other magic.</p><p><em><strong>Whirlwind of Sand.</strong></em> As an action, you can magically transform into a whirlwind of sand, move up to 60 feet, and revert to your normal form. While in whirlwind form, you are immune to all damage, and you can’t be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned. Equipment you are wearing or carrying remains in your possession.</p></div>",

A magic weapon that adds a bonus to your attack and damage rolls doesn’t add this bonus to attack rolls.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Masterwork Properties</td></tr><tr><td>Properties</td><td>Craftsman Level</td><td>Cost</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apprentice</td><td>2nd</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Journeyman</td><td>5th</td><td>100 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Master</td><td>11th</td><td>250 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary</td><td>17th</td><td>400 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Masterwork Properties</h3><p>Masterwork weapons and armor can be modified with masterwork properties, advanced modifications that transform them into truly unique weapons and armor. Masterwork properties are separated into 4 levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, and Legendary. You can apply any number of Apprentice properties to a masterwork weapon, or up to three Apprentice properties to a masterwork suit of armor. Additionally, you can apply one Journeyman, one Master, and one Legendary property to each masterwork item.</p><p>If you add a Master or Legendary property to an item, only you can use it.</p><h3>Modifying Equipment</h3><p>Using the Active Crafting feature, you can modify a weapon or suit of armor when you take a long rest. This allows you to do the following:</p><p><em><strong>Improving Equipment.</strong></em> You can make any nonmagical weapon or suit of armor masterwork for a cost of 50 gp in materials.</p><p><em><strong>Adding Masterwork Properties.</strong></em> Adding masterwork properties of Journeyman level or higher requires a cost in gold pieces and also requires you to be of a high enough level in this class, as shown in the Masterwork Properties table. When you learn a new level of masterwork properties, you can apply a property from that level to a masterwork item at no cost.</p><p>Check the @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.journals.JournalEntry.c0JDR2nih70qZzW1.JournalEntryPage.tS0icsDcjhzw5aDo#weapon-exceptions]{Weapons Exceptions} sidebar before adding masterwork properties to a weapon.</p><p>Whenever you modify the properties of a masterwork weapon, you can change its damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, if its damage was already one of these types.</p><p><em><strong>Removing Properties.</strong></em> You can remove any properties of a masterwork item, including those a weapon had when you first created it. You can’t remove a property from an item that is a prerequisite for another of the item’s properties. If you replace a property of Journeyman level or higher with a property of the same level over the same long rest, you can do so without an additional cost in materials.</p><h3>Crafting Ability</h3><p>Intelligence is the primary ability you use when crafting items. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for items that you craft.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Masterwork save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>"

      "description": "<div><p>Through bubbling test tubes and sparking electrodes, you have discovered the true heart of necromancy: mad science. You’ve experimented in far-reaching disciplines of surgery, alchemy, and physics, using your animated minions as gruesome test subjects and walking surgical dummies. Most crucially, you have discovered that lightning can imbue almost anything with a semblance of life, from the smallest severed muscle to the most towering and soulless golems.</p><h3>Skilled Surgeon</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this ambition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill, if you didn’t already have it. You can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Wisdom, for Wisdom (Medicine) checks.</p><h3>Mad Science</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can spend 10 minutes installing a monstrous graft on one of your thralls that doesn’t have the Incorporeal Movement trait. Additionally, your thralls don’t lose hit points or Hit Dice from the installation or removal of grafts, and it takes them no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft. See Appendix C for @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.journals.JournalEntry.tbpIhS1BGMCaTkeL]{monstrous grafts}.</p><h3>Charnel Voltage</h3><p>At 3rd level, you supplement your necromantic energies with arcing bolts of electricity. You can choose to deal lightning damage instead of necrotic damage with your Charnel Touch. When you hit with a Charnel Touch attack that deals lightning damage and expends 5 or more points, you can cause the energy to arc to a second creature within 5 feet of the target. The second creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking lightning damage equal to half the number of Charnel Touch points expended on a failed save.</p><h3>Lazarus Bolt</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, as an action, you can drive a bolt into the torso of a creature within 5 feet of you that has died within the last minute and shock it back to life. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This feature can’t return a creature to life if it lacks a heart, has died of old age, or is missing vital organs. Once this creature returns to life, you can restore hit points to it using your Charnel Touch for 1 minute, as if the creature were Undead.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Arcane Stitching</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you’ve learned how to inscribe magical effects on your thralls using gruesome arcane stitches. You can expend 10 points from your Charnel Touch pool to apply an arcane stitch to one of your thralls in a process requiring 1 minute of work with a needle and thread. Only one of your thralls can have arcane stitches applied to it, and that thrall can only have one of each type of stitch.</p><p>A thrall can activate its arcane stitches to gain benefits in combat. An arcane stitch lasts until your thrall activates it, your thrall is killed, or you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can apply the following stitches to one of your thralls.</p><p><em><strong>Augmented Incision.</strong></em> The thrall gains advantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its turn (no action required).</p><p><em><strong>Bulwark Backstitch.</strong></em> The thrall casts the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.z1mx84ONwkXKUZd7]{shield}</em> when it is hit by an attack.</p><p><em><strong>Fleet Threads.</strong></em> The thrall’s speed is tripled until the end of its turn (no action required).</p><p><em><strong>Voltaic Suture.</strong></em> When the thrall hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 3d6 lightning or necrotic damage (your choice).</p><h3>Lichdom: Patchwork Golem</h3><p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. Through abominable works of alchemy and surgery, you have constructed yourself an artificial body to act as the vessel for your soul.</p><p><em><strong>Golem Form.</strong></em> Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 20 if they weren’t already higher, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t adamantine. Additionally, you don’t lose hit points or Hit Dice from installing or removing grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft.</p><p><em><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p></div>",

Tales of the nightgaunt are whispered of in fairy tales, casting them as a things to be feared: hunters of clerics and goodly vampire slayers. Their appearance always presages long nights and great rises in hungry undead.</p><p>You felt the calling of the moon bringing you to the graveside of living corpses. Though vampires, zombies, and skeletons are mighty, they are always outnumbered, hunted, and turned by clerics—never given a fair chance to live peacefully. They require an ally among the living to continue their ceaseless lives, and you have risen by moonlight to the task.</p><h3>Darkvision</h3><p>Starting when you hear this call at 3rd level, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p><p>Starting at 13th level, you can see through magical, as well as nonmagical, darkness.</p><h3>Marked for Death</h3><p>At 3rd level, your mark leaves a shadow of undeath on your target, beckoning it to die. If you deal damage to a creature you have marked with a melee weapon attack and its remaining hit points are lower than the damage you dealt to it with that attack, the marked creature instead drops to 0 hit points.</p><h3>Undead Empathy</h3><p>By 6th level, you are a friend even to mindless Undead. Whenever an Undead creature targets you with an attack, it must first make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, its attack misses and, if its Intelligence is 4 or lower, it becomes friendly to you and your allies for 1 minute.</p><h3>Evasion</h3><p>Beginning at 13th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an <em>ice storm</em> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p><h3>Gravelord</h3><p>At 20th level, you can use your action to invite the necromantic energies of true undeath into your body, divorcing yourself from life for 1 minute and gaining the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</li><li>You can use your @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.yv5BeA2owPNyrn0w]{Undying} feature up to three times without expending one of the feature’s uses.</li><li>Once per turn, when you deal damage to a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an extra 4d6 necrotic damage and gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt, which last until the start of your next turn.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p></div>",

As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature that is immune to being charmed automatically succeeds on this saving throw.</p><p>On a failed save, the target’s perspective of the world distorts into a horrific and alien place. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks.

Any creature that can see you perceives you as a figure of authority. A blacksmith might see you as a guild master, whereas a soldier might see you as a captain. The changes perceived by a viewer fail to hold up to physical inspection.

The disguise moves the sounds, smells, and other effects caused by each creature to their appropriate points of origin. Creatures under the effect of this disguise don’t perceive any part of the illusion.</p><p>A creature can use its action to examine a magically disguised creature and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can see both illusory creatures for what they are.</p><p>This illusion lasts for 1 minute, and it ends early if one of the illusory creatures takes damage, or if one of the creatures performs any physical interaction that reveals itself to be an illusion.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Frenzied Nightmare</h3><p>By 14th level, you can warp everything a creature sees into a hellscape full of terrible creatures that wish them harm. When a creature fails its saving throw against your Hallucination hex, you can further distort its mind, causing it to become frenzied.</p><p>A frenzied creature loses the ability to distinguish between friend and foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies. While frenzied, the creature chooses the targets for its attacks, spells, and abilities randomly from among the creatures it can see within range, and it must make an opportunity attack if any creature provokes one</p><p>This effect ends after 1 minute.

Its blueprints are based on the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.lSd5QHnIJbKvP1bh]{apparatus of the crab}</em>, but you can model your apparatus after any Beast or as a Humanoid figure.</p><p><em><strong>Apparatus Statistics.</strong></em> The statistics of your apparatus are given in the Mechanaut’s Apparatus stat block. The apparatus’s Armor Class is based on your Intelligence modifier and its hit points are based on your craftsman level.</p><p><em><strong>Customizing the Apparatus.</strong></em> Your apparatus comes with two installed masterwork weapons, which you can modify with masterwork properties or replace with different weapons when you finish a long rest. Only one installed weapon can be ranged. Furthermore, you can only load or reload an installed ranged weapon by using your action while you are inside the apparatus (or two actions if the weapon has the Mounted property). Your apparatus is always proficient with its installed weapons, and can use masterwork weapons with Master and Legendary properties.</p><p><em><strong>Repairing the Apparatus.</strong></em> When your apparatus drops to 0 hit points, it can’t move or act, but can be repaired. You can spend 1 minute restoring the apparatus’s ability to move at half speed, which it loses if it takes damage again before it is repaired.</p><p>You can repair your apparatus at the end of a short rest by spending your Hit Dice, causing it to regain hit points as if it had taken a short rest. When you finish a long rest, you can repair your apparatus, causing it to regain all its hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to repair your apparatus. If your apparatus is lost, you can build a new one for 400 gp.</p><p><em><strong>Entering and Exiting the Apparatus.</strong></em> A creature can enter or exit the apparatus by using half its movement. While within the apparatus, a creature has total cover from effects originating outside of it.</p><p>Your armor properties have no effect while you are within the apparatus. Only one Medium or Small creature can be in the apparatus at a time.</p><p><em><strong>Piloting the Apparatus.</strong></em> A creature that is inside the apparatus can pilot it; the apparatus acts on its pilot’s turn. Any creature piloting the apparatus can command it to move on its turn (no action required). When you pilot the apparatus, you can use your action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. You can also command it to use a reaction, using your own reaction to do so.</p><p>Only one creature can pilot the apparatus at a time. The pilot takes half of the amount of damage the apparatus takes.</p><p>While you are outside the apparatus, you can command the apparatus to wait or follow you. While following, it moves on its turn to remain within 30 feet of you.</p><p><em><strong>Attacking with the Apparatus.</strong></em> The apparatus attacks with its integrated weapons as if you were wielding them, and uses your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (your choice) for its attack and damage rolls, using the same modifier for both. When you take the Attack action, it makes the same number of attacks you normally would.</p>"

You learn additional necromancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Necromancer table.</p><h3>Spell Slots</h3><p>The Necromancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast spells of the 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the necromancer spell list.</p><p>You learn an additional necromancer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the necromancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the necromancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your necromancer spells, since your power is rooted in the fine manipulation of negative energy and research into magical secrets. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a necromancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell save DC</strong></em> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong></em> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p><h3>Ritual Casting</h3><p>You can cast any necromancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells. For a necromancer, these are typically objects with sentimental value, such as a locket, childhood toy, prison shackle, or wedding ring, which are altered with magically conductive materials.</p>"

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p><p></p><p><em><strong>*Foundry Note:</strong></em> Under the 'Details' Tab, the 'Item Uses' should be connected to the @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.Jh9iMxrRBziPBoij]{Enigma Arcane | Level 13} feature, which will keep track of the number of uses the player gets per long rest.</p>"

By contrast, death knights are predators among scavengers, seizing their goals through a melding of magic and traditional combat. Bolstered with dark energies and sturdy armor, death knights are simultaneously the vanguard and general of their undead forces, unafraid of getting their hands dirty when necessary.</p><h3>Intensive Combat Research</h3><p>Starting when you choose this ambition at 3rd level, your body and mind are attuned to the various tools of war.

Additionally, you can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.</p><h3>Charnel Strike</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, whenever you make a melee weapon attack as part of the Attack action, you can channel your Charnel Touch through the weapon. When you do so, make an attack with a melee weapon instead of a spell attack. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and it takes the necrotic damage of your Charnel Touch. You can only deal necrotic damage using this ability once per turn.</p><p>Additionally, whenever you deal damage using this ability or a Charnel Touch attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt, up to a maximum of half your total hit points.</p><h3>Extra Attack</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p><p>Additionally, your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p><h3>Overcharged Thralls</h3><p>At 10th level, your inner nexus of energy has spread to your thralls, turning them into your own personal pools of spare energy when the need arises. Whenever one of your thralls dies or you release it, your Charnel Touch pool regains a number of expended points equal to your necromancer level.</p><h3>Lichdom: Imperator</h3><p>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. Due to your martial capabilities and potent necromantic power, you have transformed into an imperator lich—an Undead creature unmatched in both arcane and combat prowess. You gain the following features in addition to the Lichdom feature:</p><p><em><strong>Completed Combat Research.</strong></em> You gain proficiency with heavy armor if you didn’t have it already, and you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p><p><em><strong>Peerless Charnel Strike.</strong></em> The necrotic damage dealt by Charnel Touch ignores resistance and immunity to necrotic damage.</p><p>Additionally, you can gain any number of temporary hit points from your Charnel Strike, instead of a maximum of half your total hit points.</p></div>",

While the traps do the dirty work, the trapsmith is free to lounge about some distance away, enjoying a cold beverage and dreaming up new, dangerous designs.</p><p></p><h2>Danger Sense</h2><p>Starting when you join this guild at 3rd level, your experience with traps gives you an edge when escaping danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p><p></p><h2>Traps</h2><p>You are an expert in designing ingenious and lethal traps. Starting at 3rd level, you can craft traps designed for quick deployment, which are detailed in the Traps section that follows.</p><p>When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one or more of your attacks to deploy a trap. You can deploy a number of traps equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended deployments when you finish a short or long rest. You can use an action to disarm and recover one of your traps that hasn’t been triggered, which also restores one use of your trap deployments.</p><p></p><h2>Booby Trap</h2><p>Starting at 7th level, you can take 1 minute to conceal one of your traps from an unsuspecting target. A creature can detect a concealed trap by using its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your Masterwork save DC, or by having a passive Perception score higher than that DC. The next time this trap activates before being disarmed, it deals twice as many damage dice.</p><p></p><h2>Ambush Modification</h2><p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes to modify a ranged weapon, or you can modify up to 6 ranged weapons during a short or long rest, each of which gains the following property:</p><p><em><strong>Hair-Trigger.</strong></em> This weapon has advantage on the first attack it makes using the Ready action.</p><p></p><h2>Rapid Setup</h2><p>At 14th level, as an action, you can deploy up to four traps.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p></p><h2>Legendary Property</h2><p>At 18th level, you achieve the peak of your craft.

The trap triggers when a creature enters the area within a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line extending from the front of the trap. When it triggers, the ballista fires automatically, making a ranged attack against the creature.</p><p>This attack roll uses your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 piercing damage.</p><p></p><h2>Man-Trap</h2><p>You affix this oversized hunting trap to the ground in an unoccupied 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of you. When a Small or larger creature moves within the trap’s area, the trap clamps down on the creature. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 slashing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, it becomes trapped, rendering it unable to move. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t trapped. The trapped creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your Masterwork save DC, freeing the trapped creature on a success. A Huge or larger creature that failed its saving throw rips the trap from its mounting the next time it moves.</p><p></p><h2>Razor Wire</h2><p>You deploy a tangle of razor-sharp wire in up to four unoccupied, contiguous, 5-foot-square areas you choose within 10 feet of you. Each of these areas becomes difficult terrain. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. Once deployed, the razor wire can’t be recovered.</p><p></p><h2>Trigger Bomb</h2><p>You toss this explosive device into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. As a reaction when a creature you can see or hear moves within 5 feet of the bomb, you can press the detonator, causing the bomb to explode. Each creature within 5 feet of the bomb must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Masterwork save DC, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.</p>",

Armed with a virulent touch and an army of infected vermin and thralls, plague lords spread filth to every corner of the world. Their fevers, chills, and poxes create fresh corpses for the hoard, making for an unending supply of undead.</p><h3>Charnel Toxin</h3><p>At 3rd level, even your touch can cause sickness. When you hit with a Charnel Touch attack and expend 5 or more points, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned until the start of your next turn.</p><h3>Vile Congregation</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, leagues of vermin cling to your skin and swarm over others nearby.

This ability has no effect on Constructs or Undead.</p><h3>Projectile Spew</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, your own inner nexus of power has become a volatile cocktail of disease, allowing your spells to have a far greater reach.

Make a ranged weapon attack against any number of creatures you choose within a 15-foot cone, making a separate attack roll for each target. If you target only one creature in this cone, your attack deals one additional weapon damage die on a hit.</p></div>",

These warmages have mastered not only a repertoire of cantrips, but also techniques to manipulate fortune itself, allowing them to risk everything, and more than often come out on top.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p>Starting when you choose this house at 3rd level, your light fingers and unscrupulous tactics help you win the day. You gain proficiency in the Sleight of Hand skill and dice sets, if you don’t already have it.</p><h3>Dice of Fate</h3><p>At 3rd level, you gain four Dice of Fate, which are d6s. Whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, saving throw, or damage roll, you can expend one Die of Fate and add it to the roll. You can wait until after you make the roll before deciding to expend the Die of Fate, but must decide before the GM determines the roll’s outcome.

Once on each of your turns when you roll a d6, you can flip the die upside down. Note that on a balanced d6, the top and bottom numbers add up to 7, so you can determine the bottom number by subtracting the top number from 7.</p><h3>Twisted Fate</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, the winds of chance follow your die rolls, rather than vice versa. When you make an attack roll or ability check with disadvantage on your turn, you can attempt to invert fate as a bonus action. Expend a Die of Fate and roll it. On a 5, you ignore disadvantage on the roll. On a 6, you instead have advantage on the roll.</p><h3>Roll the Bones</h3><p>Beginning at 15th level, you can channel the chaotic energy of your dice in an instant. As a reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see, you can expend two Dice of Fate to make a Chaos Roll.</p><h3>Steal Luck</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, when you roll initiative, roll [[/r 1d6]].

Yet, the clergy’s stubborn devotion to righteousness impedes them where it counts: you must sometimes be willing to do evil to counter evil. That’s where the inquisition comes in.</p><p>As a righteous inquisitor of the faith, you are tasked with rooting out heresy, exorcising demons, and stamping out any sign of the occult, and you are offered clemency for any action you take in the defense of the greater good. You may investigate anyone or anything you deem to be in line with the forces of evil, for you alone are a holy blade in the dark, the arbiter of your church.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiency</h3><p>Starting when you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor.</p><h3>Exorcist's Doctrines</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Religion skill, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses this skill.</p><h3>Trinkets</h3><p>By 3rd level, you’ve collected a number of magical trinkets to help you banish restless spirits and foul demonic forces. You can use the following trinkets:</p><p><em><strong>Alabaster Balm.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}</em> spell once without using a spell slot or spell components.</p><p><em><strong>Hallowed Chalice.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can utter a prayer and produce a volume of holy water from this cup sufficient to fill five flasks.

When you cast the spell in this way, you can only detect thoughts that are associated with negative emotions, such as guilt, apprehension, regret, and melancholy.</p><h3>Divine Strike</h3><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage to the target.</p><h3>Rote Piety</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you command a mastery of divine magic seldom seen among the clergy. You can use your Opportunistic Piety feature three times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Excommunication</h3><p>By 14th level, as an action, you can emblazon a mark of religious condemnation upon a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on your choice of a Constitution or Wisdom saving throw or be marked for 1 minute. While marked, the creature can’t regain hit points or have advantage on any attack roll or ability check. Additionally, whenever the creature takes an action, it takes 2d6 radiant damage as the mark burns with radiant light.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",

The friendly creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack or cast a cantrip that requires an attack roll, adding the battle die to the attack’s damage roll.</p><h3>Grandmaster</h3><p>At 18th level, when you roll initiative, choose a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. Each of the chosen creatures gains a battle die. You don’t expend battle dice for this feature.</p><p>Once within the next 10 minutes, a chosen creature can expend the battle die when it makes an attack roll, ability check, saving throw, or damage roll, adding the battle die to the roll. The creature can wait until after it makes the roll before deciding to expend the battle die, but must decide before the GM determines the roll’s outcome. A creature can have only one battle die from this feature at a time.</p><h3>Stratagems</h3><p>The stratagems are presented in alphabetical order.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.R67pGjyH88SfIkjS]{Blitz.}</strong></em> As a bonus action, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. Choose a friendly creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.OGBQoCAxXv9UBluG]{Check.}</strong></em> When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die as a bonus action to force that creature to flee. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. A creature that is immune to being frightened automatically succeeds on this saving throw. On a failed save, the target must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up to half its speed directly away from you.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.9H9bjXKDwq846lGc]{Flash of Brilliance.}</strong></em> When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check, you can expend one battle die to add it to the check. You can choose to use this stratagem after the ability check is rolled but must decide before the GM says whether the check succeeds or fails.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.MNQaLdbbv5nIej1L]{Gambit.}</strong></em> When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die to give your allies an opening. The next creature other than you to make an attack against the target adds the battle die to their attack roll.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.8WEX0LFoDwVNcqwU]{Mystic Counsel.}</strong></em> You can use a bonus action and expend one battle die to give counsel to a creature that can hear you within 30 feet of you. Once in the next minute when the creature makes a saving throw against a spell it can choose to roll the battle die and add the result to the saving throw.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-classes.Item.sfcZ0RbPfrA05pzi]{Stalemate.}</strong></em> When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one battle die as a bonus action to hold that creature in place. Until the end of its next turn, the target can’t willingly move unless it first takes the Disengage action.</p>",
