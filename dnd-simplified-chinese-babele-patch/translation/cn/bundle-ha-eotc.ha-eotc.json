Legends like the Fates sisters, Norns, Shai, and Kala swirl around in this space. Some follow these legends, while others encounter a weaver in their search for power and answers. Through their pact, they aim to take the threads of their fate into their own hands. The real question, however, is whether they are merely serving a fate already written, or can they truly rebel against a fate written with their own free will?</p><p></p>",

Her words burn the hearts of men who listen, her prophetic verses sprout madness in all. Death, apocalypse, and judgment are surely inevitable.</p><p class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Doomsayers are an infamous cadre of bards that despoils the hearts of their enemies within and beyond combat. Just as their proficiency with foretelling cataclysmic events through prophetic verses is legendary, so too are the instruments of their choice: brutalistic grand horns, quarterstaffs with brutish religious iconography, and overbearing prayer beads with gothic trinkets.</p><p class=\"flower centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 3: Impending Doom</h2><p>You receive signs of danger around you due to your eldritch affinity for foresight. By spending a Bardic Inspiration die, you gain one these abilities:</p><ul class=\"cross blue\"><li>You choose one of the following spells and cast it without expending a spell slot: <span class=\"italic\">augury, detect magic, detect evil and good, or divine favor</span>. This lasts for 10 minutes.</li><li>Your voice is infused with magic. You can awaken the feeling of impending doom in a creature you can see within 60 ft. of you as an action. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for the next minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This feature works as if you are concentrating on a spell, and it lasts for 1 minute. It doesn’t work on undead or constructs.</li><li>You can inspire your allies at the brink of twilight. With a bonus action, you can give +1d4 bonus to ability checks, saving throws, or the attack rolls of the allies within 60 ft. of you. They must be able to hear or see you. They can use this +1d4 only one time in the next 10 minutes and must add it before making the roll. This bonus becomes 1d6 when you reach 6th level, and it becomes 1d8 when you reach 11th level.</li></ul><p>In addition, you have advantage on Initiative rolls.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 3: Tale of the End</h2><p>When you reach the 3rd level, your consciousness starts overflowing with visions of the End. Aspects of these visions have taken root in your speech, music, and art. Using your action, you can start a performance and choose one of the aspects of doom below, and you can use each feature once per long rest.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Destruction</h3><p>A deep voice inflicts the minds around. Creatures within 60 ft. of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become paralyzed and have visions about the end of the world until the end of your next turn. Moreover, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration dice and roll it. You can spare people from this effect equal to the result, and they gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier. This feature does not work on constructs.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Conflict</h3><p>A mix of loud and chaotic melodies invade the room. You choose up to five creatures other than you that hear you within 60 ft. and grant them either +2 bonus to their Armor Class, or they can add your Charisma modifier to their damage rolls for the next 3 rounds (limited to once per turn for each creature). You can’t choose differently: all chosen creatures are granted the same benefit. You can extend this duration by rolling one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. The extended number of rounds equals the result.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Judgment</h3><p>A strong and short burst of a deep violin ranks with the sky. Every fey, fiend, celestial, and undead creature within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, you know their type and location precisely.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Salvation</h3><p>The hopeful voice of a beautiful woman is heard in the distance. One creature you choose within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier. You can increase this amount by rolling one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. The number of hit points gained equals the result.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 6: Imposing Prophecy</h2><p>At 6th level, the way you foretell impending doom is so powerful that you can manipulate the battlefield by using your words, dark melodies, and imposing rhythm. Using your bonus action, you can unleash a powerful melody and choose one of the effects from below:</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Repelling Melody.</h3><p>Each enemy within 15 feet of you must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, they are pushed 15 feet away from you. If they hit a solid object like a wall or a person during this process, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Towing Rhythm.</h3><p>Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Strength saving throw. On a fail, they are pulled 15 feet towards you.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier and regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 14: Fear of Doom</h2><p>Starting from 14th level, your mere presence can reek of doom and despair whenever you wish to have it do so. Every enemy within 30 feet of you gains vulnerability to every damage type as long as they are frightened.</p></div>"

A warrior embraces the darkness around her, sharpening her senses to accommodate the darkness within, and without. She senses where the fabric of reality is torn, and with her mind’s eye, catches glimpses of eldritch entities and worldbending powers peeking from the burst stitches that connect the weave of two worlds.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">With her iron will, she plucks the essence of the immaterial world beyond the veil and imbues her weapon with its power. A lethal course of action for all but a select few - herself included.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">Exposure to torn reality can change people, almost always in dreadful ways, but there are warriors who use these changes to pull strength from the void, the Al-Ghaib. Path of the Otherworldly Might is a warrior’s discipline passed down through lines of warriors who were marked by an arcane disaster, or a scarring spell rebound. This discipline allows the wielders to be aware of the reality rifts around them and use these rifts to draw upon martial aspects to enhance their combat abilities.</p><p class=\"flower ha-red centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 3: Otherworldly Aspect</h2><p>Exposure to magic and tears in reality make you aware of the differing arcane aspects that inhabit the edge of this reality. Through mental discipline, meditation, and careful experimentation, you open your body to one of these aspects.</p><p>When you reach level 3, you can embrace one of the arcane aspects and gain unnatural powers through it. Each aspect makes you resistant to fear effects. You have advantage on saving throws against spells or other features that may frighten you.</p><p>Any saving throw required by these features or future abilities will be determined by your Aspect DC. Which is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Aspect of the Fiend:</h3><p>Darkness and madness reign in your blood. You overcame the eldritch corruption of Al-Ghaib and bent this influence to your will.</p><p>You gain darkvision to a range of 30 ft. If you have darkvision from another source, this effect stacks on top of it, increasing the range.</p><p>Additionally, while raging you have resistance to fire damage and deal 1d4 extra fire damage with your melee attacks based on Strength.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Aspect of the Celestial</h3><p>Not all that the Al-Ghaib touches is corrupted with evil. You invite the power of belief and pure conviction into your body.</p><p>You can use your action to touch a creature and bless it. The blessed creature adds 1d4 to its attack rolls or saving throws for the next minute. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your maximum Rage (Also 6 at 20th level). You regain expended uses after you finish a long rest.</p><p>Additionally, while raging you see if there are other otherworldly creatures within 30 ft. of you. They have a faint aura around them that is related to their origin – for example, black for fiends, green for feys, purple for aberrations, red for dragons, etc. You also deal 1d4 extra radiant damage with your melee weapon attacks based on Strength.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Aspect of the Fey</h3><p>The trickery, the overflowing essence, and the way of the eerie. Your body is now home to the secrets of the Green Gate.</p><p>You have resistance to being charmed.</p><p>Additionally, while raging you deal extra 1d4 psychic damage with your melee attacks based on Strength. If you forgo your rage after a landed strike (no action required), the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it believes to be in a situation determined by you and looks awed, and it is stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Aspect of the Undead</h3><p>Some sought immortality in the world beyond - most found death and despair. But you are not most - your body is infused with the essence of undeath.</p><p>You have resistance to necrotic damage and you no longer need food, drink, and air.</p><p>Additionally, while raging, you deal extra 1d4 necrotic damage with your melee attacks based on Strength, and if you die while raging, you can’t be turned into an undead.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 6: Otherworldly Aspect Improvement</h2><p>Your body is a gateway through which the essence of arcane flows into this world. Being present in both ends of the bridge you see through the veil and sense the otherworld better than most.</p><p>Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on Intelligence checks to remember lore about arcane aspects, other worlds, and such matters.</p><p>In addition, you can choose one of the aspects below. You can take your early choice again or choose another, as your understanding and mastery over the aspects have improved.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Fiend</h3><p>While raging and after you deal damage, you can end your rage early (no action required) and deal fire damage to a 20 feet radius. You deal 6d8 fire damage. Anyone caught in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. Any flammable objects catch fire in the area.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Celestial</h3><p>You can use your action and your primal instincts become sharper than ever. You can discern lies for 1 minute and gain <span class=\"italic\">true sight</span> for 1 round. Your damage die for your extra damage becomes 1d6 (if you chose another aspect earlier, its damage die increases, but does not become radiant).</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Fey</h3><p>When your rage ends (you can also end it early to use this feature with a bonus action), your fey aspect unleashes its illusory powers. It works as if you have cast a <span class=\"italic\">mirror image</span> spell but requires no concentration.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Undead</h3><p>While raging undead have disadvantage if they attack creatures than you (or other creatures with this feature) if you are within their line of sight.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 10: Otherworldly Communication</h2><p>Starting at 10th level, you start to hear and understand beyond the veil, as if you have ears there. You learn the <span class=\"italic\">contact other plane</span> spell. You can only cast it as a ritual and you roll a Constitution saving throw instead of Intelligence saving throw as stated in the spell. You choose one of your aspects directly, and an appropriate creature answers you.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 14: Ultimate Aspect</h2><p>Starting at 14th level, the veil has shrouded you and you reach your ultimate understanding. You choose one of the aspects below and reach the epitome of your understanding of aspects.

A follower, a believer, strikes herself repeatedly while quoting the Holy Scripture. Her blood is spilt all over the place. Her face is reminded of the ultimate serenity, and pain only flashes in the moments of the strike. Her faith prevails, and her sins are taken away with each stroke. She knows that her back is full of scars and with the memories of pain. She knows, however, that her Lord suffered more, and she finds power and might with each strike.</p><p class=\"flower centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h4 class=\"ha-gold\">Flagellent Spells</h4><p>At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.</p><table class=\"roll color-gold\"><tbody><tr><td><p>cleric Level</p></td><td><p>Spells</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1st</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">sacred retribution, inflict wounds</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3rd</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">flagellant’s aid, celestial force of attraction</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5th</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">protection from energy, vampiric touch</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7th</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">healing litany, blight</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9th</p></td><td><p class=\"italic\">Omar’s justice, divine agony</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 1: Wounds of Faith</h2><p>From 1st level, your faith commands you to repent for your sins and remember martyrs and their pain. As a bonus action on your turns, you can strike yourself with a weapon and damage yourself. It is called “Atoned Damage”: you take normal damage from the weapon but don’t add your ability score modifier to the damage roll.</p><p>If you make a melee weapon attack on the same turn that you take Atoned Damage, it delivers your sins and the rot that corrupts your wounds to the opponent. If you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can choose one of the following:</p><ul class=\"blue cross\"><li>You force the target to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC.

It is equal to half of the Atoned Damage you took (rounded up).</li></ul><p>In addition, due to constant fighting with infections on your body from the cuts of your flagellant rituals, you are resistant to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 1: Repenting the Sins</h2><p>By spending an entire long rest dedicated to your flagellant rituals and forgoing recovering hit points, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul class=\"blue cross\"><li>In case of restoring hit points, you are counted as if you have taken a short rest. You roll your hit dice according to the rules of short rest, but all the hit points you restore through this process are counted as temporary hit points and your hit dice remain unspent.</li><li>You recover your Spell Slots as you would in a regular long rest. Also, if you have other features from feats, multiclasses or other sources that replenish when you finish a long rest, they also replenish your such abilities.</li><li>You gain +2 bonus to your Armor Class.</li><li>You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Insight) checks.</li><li>You have resistance against Atoned Damage.</li></ul><p>All features last until you finish a long rest.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 2: Channel Divinity: Redemption from the Lord</h2><p>With a divine gaze, you tear into the very minds of your enemies, making them endure the torment of every wound you bear. Your pain becomes their undoing, meted out in cruel, psychic reprisals. The more you've suffered, the more they will.</p><p>As an action on your turn, you choose up to six creatures within 60 ft. of you and force them to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. You deal psychic damage to the ones who failed the saving throw. The damage is coming from a pool which is equal to your missing hit points. For example, if you have 50 maximum hit points and currently have 10 hit points, the pool is 40. You can divide the number between the failed creatures.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Designer’s Note:</span>This feature is intended to work together with the Level 1 feature Repenting the Sins. Temporary hit points do not count. For example, if you have 10 current hit points and 30 temporary hit points and your hit point maximum is 40, the damage pool is 30.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 6: Faith is My Shield</h2><p>By the time you become 6th level, your unwavering faith has forged an ironclad bond with the divine. At the very moment you carve penance into your own flesh, you can channel this divine might, turning the pain into a testament of your unyielding devotion.</p><p>When you strike yourself to take Atoned Damage, you can choose to deal full damage. By doing so, you can use your reaction to expend a spell slot to nullify the damage you took.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 8: Punishing Strike</h2><p>At 8th level, the holy rage within you starts infusing your strikes with searing divine wrath; each blow bathes foes in sanctified agony.</p><p>When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to that creature.

Those who truly understood would dare to meet its gaze, finding solace in its brilliance. Recognizing its hand in the flourishing of both tender sprouts and towering titans, they hungered for such might, forging sacred circles.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">Within these radiant conclaves, a chosen few began to commune more deeply, their souls intertwining with the very essence of the sun. They became the keepers of its secrets, the whisperers of its ancient tales, and the bearers of its untamed energy, sometimes leading whole civilizations with banners beholding the sun’s golden visage, sometimes with whispers within temple complexes and catacombs. The land responded to their call, the beasts heeded their song, and from their hands, golden, blazing magic flowed. It was whispered among the shadows and sung atop the mountains that these chosen were not mere druids but the very embodiment of the sun's benevolence: The Circle of the Sun Druids, guardians of nature's most hallowed luminescence.</p><p class=\"flower ha-red centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 2: Sun’s Embrace</h2><p>When you reach 2nd level, you bind your soul more intimately to the sun's relentless power than any mere mortal caressed by its rays. As an action, by spending one of your Wild Shape uses, you choose one of the benefits below for 10 minutes:</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Eyes of the Sun</h3><p>Your eyes shine like the sun and they shed bright light in a 5 ft. cone and dim light for an additional 5 ft. Any creature within 10 ft. of you is considered under the sunlight. You can ignite flammable objects within 30 ft. of you. Any damaging spell you cast deals an additional 1d6 fire damage. This damage becomes 1d8 at 6th level, 1d10 at 11th level and 1d12 at 16th level.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Solar Touch</h3><p>Your hands seem as if they are aflame with golden radiance. Whenever you heal a creature within 30 ft. of you with a spell (including yourself), you heal the creature an additional amount equal to your Wisdom modifier. In addition, your unarmed strikes are empowered, or you can imbue non-metal weapons or ammunitions with the power of sun. You can use your bonus action to conjure the flames on your hands or a non-metal weapon of your choice (or 2 pieces of ammunition). Until the end of your next turn, if you score a hit with the chosen weapon or your unarmed strikes, you deal an extra 1d6 fire damage (any ammunition used like this loses its fiery power). This damage becomes 1d8 when you reach 6th level as a druid, 1d10 at 11th level, and 1d12 at 16th level.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Molten Will</h3><p>The ground you call upon ignites with your eldritch might, and the heat obeys your command. You gain resistance to fire and cold damage. You can use your bonus action to make a 5 ft. square floor a fiery ground that damages whomever that enters. The square stays on fire for the next minute or until a spell of 1st level or higher extinguishes it. You can choose creatures up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (including yourself) to be unaffected by the flames. Anyone other than the designated characters take 2d6 fire damage when they enter the area for the first time or start their turn there. You can have 2 such squares active at the same time. This number increases by 1 each time your proficiency bonus increases.</p><p>In addition, your movements do not provoke opportunity attacks while the Molten Will is active in at least one square.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 6: Might of the Golden Visage</h2><p>Basking in the sun's unyielding radiance, your form becomes nigh impervious, its golden armor deflecting blows.</p><p>While under direct sunlight or while using your Sun’s Embrace ability, you gain +2 bonus to your Armor Class, and each time you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you roll 1d8 and gain temporary hit points equal to the total.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 10: The Solar Form</h2><p>The sun's fierce ardor and your unyielding allegiance to the circle meld, forging you into a being of transcendent resilience. The inferno's wrath leaves you untouched, and the sanctified luminance finds it hard to scald your now-hallowed essence.</p><img style=\"shape-outside:url(modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/druid-kesme-payi234.webp);shape-margin:10px;margin-top:220px;float:right\" src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/druid-kesme-payi234.webp\" /><p>When you reach 10th level, your connection to the sun and your devotion to your circle empower you greatly. You are immune to the fire damage and gain resistance to radiant damage.</p><p>In addition, when you enter one of the Sun’s Embrace forms, you can use your bonus action to change your form. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 14: Scorched Eyes</h2><p>The sun's blazing majesty, which once might have seared the sight of mere mortals, becomes a mesmerizing dance for your eyes. Bathed in its pure luminance, you are shielded from all radiant harm and your scorched eyes are gifted with a sight beyond sight.</p><p>When you reach 14th level, you are immune to radiant damage and gain Blindsight (30 ft.).</p><p>In addition, when you take fire damage (you take no damage due to your immunity), you can use your reaction to embrace the damage. Until the end of your next turn, as an action you can direct the damage total to a creature within 30 ft. of you that you can see with a ranged spell attack. For example, if you are caught in the middle of a <span class=\"italic\">fireball </span>spell that deals 33 fire damage, you can use this feature to deal a creature (within 30 ft. of you) 33 fire damage if you score a hit. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p></div>"

During that minute, you can magically swap places or share damage. To swap places you must use your action, and the creature must be able to hear you. After you swap places, the bond between you and the creature ends.</p><p>If either of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to split the damage in half (rounded up) and divide them amongst two of you, if the creature is willing. When you do so, the one that originally did not take the damage reduces the damage by half and your bond ends.</p><p>At 6th level, your range for this feature becomes 40 ft. At 11th level, it becomes 60 ft.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Bound Time</h3><p>As an action you can rewind time for a brief moment whenever you or an ally that you can see within 30 ft. of you is endangered. If you or a creature you can see fails an ability check or takes a hit, you can use your reaction to reroll the dice. If the target is hostile to you, it can avoid the reroll by succeeding on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.</p><p>At 6th level, you can also rewind saving throws.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 6: Threads Intertwined</h2><p>The cryptic tapestries of destiny unfurl before your gaze, as your grasp over the intricate weaves of fate tightens, plunging you deeper into the world's shadowed secrets.</p><p>When you reach 6th level, you can magically control another humanoid’s fate within 15 ft. of you. As an action, you can force the humanoid to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you decide on its fate:</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Bound.</span> It is stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Speechless.</span> It can’t talk for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Ill-Fated.</span> It has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p><p>You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest or you can expend a spell slot to refresh it. If you expend a spell slot in this way, it can’t be restored until you finish a long rest.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 10: Threads Past and Future</h2><p>With the arcane rites whispered in forbidden tongues, you summon the audacity to beckon fate to your circle, demanding answers from the very cosmos that dares to weave destinies in its silent loom.</p><p>At 10th level, you can spend 10 minutes and 150 gd worth of special herbs that are collected under the blood moon to make a sacred ritual known to the weavers. You name a specific event, person, war, or place that existed in the past and ask up to five questions about it. Your patron or another entity related to that name answers the questions with one sentence. The answer’s accuracy depends on the nature of the creature.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Level 14: Foretold Life</h2><p>Bound to the very sinews of time, your communion with fate elevates you to an omnipotent apex, where you deftly pull and twist the strings of destiny, reshaping the world's narrative in your dark design.</p><p>A 14th level, you learn the <span class=\"italic\">foresight</span> spell and it doesn’t count against the warlock spells you know or Mystic Arcanum that is available to you. Until you reach 17th level, it works differently for you. You can cast it using an action, without expending a spell slot and its duration is 1 minute. When you reach 17th level, if you choose the foresight spell for your Mystic Arcanum, you can use this feature to cast it without expending a use of Mystic Arcanum, but the spell’s duration is 1 hour for you.</p><p class=\"h2 ha-gold\"></p></div>"

Wise and inventive arcanists from the cradle of civilization emerge, an enclave of scholars and artisans who weave together the ethereal mysteries of the cosmos with the tangible intricacies of metallurgy, engineering, and precise mathematics.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">These are not mere blacksmiths or scholars but visionaries who see the universe as a grand machine, its gears propelled by spells and equations. Their forges glow with both fire and arcane energy, crafting artifacts that bridge the chasm between science and sorcery. Every creation is an embodiment of precise calculations, underpinned by age-old enchantments.</p><p class=\"ha-red\">In their workshops, star charts lay beside intricate blueprints, and equations meld seamlessly with incantations. For a member of this conclave and one that follows the footsteps of minds from all corners, the universe is both a vast expanse to be explored and a complex mechanism to be understood. Their craft is not just about melding metal or channeling magic but about understanding the harmonious dance of existence, where stars align with gears and where the boundaries of artifice and arcane blur into one.</p><p class=\"flower ha-red centered font-size-x1.1\">CCCCCCC</p><h2 class=\"ha-red\">Level 2: Arcane Contraptions</h2><p>You learn how to craft eldritch machines and soulless automata, forged in arcane fire, to serve as silent sentinels and inexorable allies in your quests.</p><p>When you reach 2nd level, you learn several inventions and similar useful items and record them into your spellbook, as they contain arcane power. You can prepare 2 of the inventions when you finish a long rest and use them during the day.</p><h2 class=\"ha-gold\">Inventions</h2><p>You can use your action to invoke the arcane ways from your spellbook into reality and create the inventions. You must expend a spell slot to create them. Additionally, if they have a Ritual (-R) tag, you can prepare them beforehand without expending a spell slot but still must spend the cost on necessary materials. You can only prepare two objects at the same time with a ritual.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">You can work with your GM for additional devices to be available for you. The GM may add some blueprints during your adventure or enables some merchants, shops, or dealers to have plans for such devices to increase your arsenal.</p></div><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Wondrous Compass (-R)</h3><p>This compass has interesting carvings and some personal runes carved by Al-Jazari himself. When you expend a spell slot as a bonus action while holding this compass, you can whisper a location’s name to it, and it will magically point to that location until the end of your long rest. The location must be specific and one of a kind – for example, the city of Samarkand, House of Wisdom in Baghdad, Forbidden City in Beijing, or Mahmud al-Isfahani’s Blacksmith Shop. Personal residence and similar locations do not work (for example, Farhad bin Abu Bakr’s House won’t work); the location must be a public place or at least must be known to many people. In addition, whoever holds this compass has advantage on Survival checks.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Primitive Automaton (-R)</h3><div class=\"foundry-info\"><p>All Automatons are in the <span class=\"italic\">Primitive Automatons</span> folder in the Era of the Crusades actors</p></div><p>This robotic design resembles a metallic human or another creature of your choice.

You can use it to strike foes within 5 ft. of you. You make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the creature takes 1d4 fire damage.</p><p>When you reach 6th level, the firestarter can be used to produce other elements: acid, poison, lightning, cold.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Magical Mirror (-R)</h3><p>This mirror costs you 100 gd. It works and functions like a normal mirror and has other magical properties. Whenever you activate its magical powers, shapechangers, aberrations, fiends, feys, celestials and the undead shine with an aura in the mirror (if it can’t have reflections, only an aura is seen). The activation lasts for 10 minutes and can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p>When you reach 6th level, when such a creature’s reflection is caught in the mirror, you can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher as a reaction and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 psychic damage.</p><h3 class=\"ha-gold\">Wondrous Hook</h3><p>This hook works as a normal grappling hook with some magical properties. If a silk rope is bound to the hook, its magic prevents the silk from being ripped due to weight. It still can be torn by taking damage. Also, you can use its command word for it to cling to any surface you like or summon it back to your hand.</p><h2 class=\"ha-gold\">Level 2: Aspirant Inventor</h2><p>You learn how to properly focus your arcane essence to mend the broken by deconstructing the broken objects' intricacies.</p><p>You learn the <span class=\"italic\">mending</span> cantrip. It doesn’t count against the wizard cantrips you know, and it has different uses for you. You can repair twice the normal size and you can do it using an action.</p><h2 class=\"ha-gold\">Level 6: Machines of War</h2><p>You improve upon your arcane designs and material techniques, creating advanced automata and war engines, their cold steel and clockwork hearts ready to unleash havoc upon a world unprepared for your innovations.</p><p>When you reach Level 6, your Automata can be of medium size now and add your Intelligence modifier to their hit points when you first create them.</p><p>In addition, you can invoke your magic on inanimate objects. By spending 30 gd and 10 minutes you can give an object a walking speed of 20 feet and ability to obey one command from you (Chosen when you first use this benefit). These commands can be from prestidigitation spell or another command that would suit the object’s nature. You can issue the command as a bonus action. The object has 10 AC and 20 HP. Additionally, it can record a voice up to ten seconds and can repeat it one time. The voice recording takes 1 action and if not repeated in the next 8 hours, it is deleted immediately. You can have only three such items at the same time.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your Search action as a bonus action and when you do so, you can identify substances and materials of objects and items easily.</p><h2 class=\"ha-gold\">Level 10: Spirit of Everything</h2><p>Your feats of engineering are unparalleled, and you learned how to infuse your creations with an essence of your psyche. Your machines are yours and yours alone, ready to obey your orders.</p><p>By the time you are 10th level, your Automata can be of large size now and add your wizard level to their hit points when you first create them. In addition, they gain the Telepathic Bond feature of the homunculus, but it is limited to 1 mile in range.</p><p>You have a bond with handmade objects as well. When you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher as an action while touching an object, you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw.

We’re Sarp and Doğa from Metis Creative, and if there’s one thing we’ve learned from our adventures in creating worlds to explore, it’s that stories have the power to bridge worlds.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">When we first dreamed up this project, the idea of Historica Arcanum, the idea of running a Tabletop RPG Studio, we couldn’t help but worry about being left out of the global community. We were culturally, and geographically far away - and the dread of not being able to get our voices heard was overbearing. Yet, this was one of the instances that we couldn’t be happier to be proven definitively wrong.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">The love, passion, and unwavering support you’ve shown us have not just filled us with an insatiable hunger to create; they have truly made us feel that we were a part of the global Tabletop community. And for that, we are grateful. Honestly, we’re still pinching ourselves to make sure it’s real.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">“Era of the Crusades” is a project that’s close to all of our hearts at the office. It was a setting that we really wanted to make since we released the first Historica Arcanum - City of Crescent. Everyone in the team, from writers to artists, poured their hearts and souls into this book, making sure every page, every illustration, and every line of text captured the essence of the story and world we wanted to bring to life. It’s with this setting, where we’ve started to really nail the dark, mysterious, and slightly eerie tone we’ve always wanted the World of Historica Arcanum to have. This book marks a significant step in developing our universe, laying down even more pieces of the lore that will grow and evolve with time and new entries to the setting.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">Sharing this creation with you feels like sharing a piece from our souls. The late nights, the brainstorming sessions, the occasional frustrations, and the breakthrough moments—it’s all been a labor of love, a testament to what we can achieve together, as a team and as a community. Your enthusiasm and support light the way for us, encouraging us to keep dreaming, creating, exploring, and sharing new worlds that resonate with the depth and diversity of the human experience.</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-gold\">Thank you for joing this incredible journey with us. As you turn the pages of Era of the Crusades, know that you’re stepping into a world crafted with love, dedication, and a little bit of magic from everyone at Metis Creative.</p><p class=\"align-right\"><span class=\"ha-dark-gold\">With all our gratitude and love,</span></p><p class=\"align-right ha-dark-gold no-margin\">Sarp and Doğa</p><p class=\"align-right ha-dark-gold\">Metis Creative</p></div>"

Before diving into the setting and its magical concepts, it is important to examine the political situation and main actors of the era.</p><h1 class=\"ha-red\">War for the Holy Lands</h1><p>Since 1071 CE, the Seljuk Empire had grown into one of the most influential and powerful empires of its time, captured most of Anatolia, and threatened the very heart of the Byzantine Empire: Constantinople. Twenty years later, in 1095 CE Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos reached out to Europe and asked for help from Pope Urban II to fight against the advancing threat of the Turkish Empire. Urban II was organizing the councils of Piacenza and Clermont, and the emperor’s call for help resulted in Urban II taking action. He declared a holy war against the Turks, and the crowd raised their voices high, shouting “Deus vult!” “God wills it!”</p><p>After countless years of turmoil and hundreds of thousand deaths, The First Crusade was successful; the crusader armies reached their goal of taking Jerusalem in 1099 CE from Muslim rule, establishing the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The first king was crowned as “Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri,” the Defender of the Holy Sepulchre. The shores of The Levant were carved to be the home of the Crusader states, such as the County of Tripoli and of Edessa.</p><p>For decades, the Muslim states struggled to unite against the Armies of the Crusaders, until the Zengid dynasty’s rule came to power, first as the vassals of the Seljuk Empire and ruling the western frontier of the empire on behalf of them. The Zengid Emirs succeeded in taking down the County of Edessa, which ignited the fires of the Second Crusade that eventually failed to restore the fallen County.</p><p>Zengi’s rise to power did not stop until they succeeded in taking Egypt under their control during the reign of Nur ad-Din Zengi, a celebrated hero in the Muslim world in 1169 CE. Shirkuh, a General serving the Zengis, seized the political power in Cairo, only to leave this position after his death to his prodigious nephew Yusuf Ibn Ayyub, a talented commander of the Zengis Cavalry Corps, better known as Salah ad-Din, the “Salvation of the Faith.” who is better known as Saladin in the West.</p><p>Saladin’s personal talents in both warfare and diplomacy eventually saw him rising to be the sole ruler of Syria and Egypt, uniting all the Muslim forces of the Levant under one rule.</p><p>By the year 1185 CE, the Crusaders were trapped between the Muslim powers of Egypt and Syria - commanded by the legendary Saladin. With their attempts to expand into Egypt thwarted by the Zengis and combined efforts of the Muslim atabegs, the Crusader states now faced mortal peril. Yet a new hope was found in the ascendant King Baldwin IV - though the young King’s reign would prove to be significantly short, for his body was decaying under the effects of leprosy.</p></div>"

Legends may indeed be true, the queen that built this cathedral surely wanted to embrace the whole city with love.</p></div><p>The Cathedral of St. James stands in serenity in the city’s ambience, an important place for the Eastern Christians, especially for Armenians living in the Holy Lands. The cathedral has seen a fair share of the city’s history and was dedicated to the memory of two revered figures named James: Saint James the Greater and Saint James the Less.</p><p>The Cathedral of St. James has been transformed into a spiritual sanctuary. It reflects the religious heritage of the Armenian people and the Eastern churches. Its interiors, adorned with exquisite icons and intricate mosaics, exude a sense of ancient devotion. This sacred ground serves not only as a place of worship but also as a place for the ones that look for serenity, peace, and oneness of the heart.</p><p>The cathedral’s compound, with its cloistered courtyards and tranquil gardens, adds to the serene and sanctified ambiance. It stands as a place where history and spirituality merge, housing relics, and artifacts that span centuries. It saw many destructions and rebuilds, the latest one being under the guidance of Queen Melisende, the late queen of the City of God.</p><p>The leader of the church is a woman called<span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\"> Emma (Local Priest)</span>, and the cathedral serves as an important center of learning throughout the city thanks to her. Emma collects books, parchments, and similar things, and she usually teaches kids and other residents of the church how to read, usually doing this in secret. She invites scholars to lecture in the halls, and almost everyone keeps quiet about the situation. Balian of Ibelin is aware of the cathedral’s role as a place of learning, and he helps Emma personally as much as he can. Due to Balian’s help, the priests and nuns freely learn and lecture in the cathedral.</p><p>Emma has a library which, although small in size, contains very useful sources in Ancient Greek and Arabic regarding science, mathematics, astronomy and similar topics.

The creature will realize someone has reached into their minds with magic in the second casting of the spell. On the third time, they will know who is probing into their minds, but you will be able to choose a direct sin from the creature’s mind (You can ask questions, like “What is your biggest sin?” “What is the sin you regret the most?” “What does your heart yearn for that you regret the most?” and similar questions.).</p><p><span class=\"info\">Class Lists:</span> Bard, Cleric, Warlock, Wizard</p></div><p>He constantly seeks out sinners in the city and calls them out to repent. If someone does not join the repenting ceremony, he reports them to authorities. His dark secret is that there are sinners he does not report: the ones he believes beyond redemption. He and his followers ambush the sinner and take them below the church for their repenting ceremony without the consent of the sinner. The sinner usually dies after the ceremony due to wounds from whips and the “expulsion of his sins.”</p><p>Gabriel has many followers and people who come to him frequently to be free of their sins. Gabriel mostly teaches them his way, the way of Flagellation, and lets them repent for their own sins. However, some people come to Gabriel for redemption and Gabriel himself bleeds them, and preaches them during the ceremony. Gabriel is usually near the Temple Mount and the royal family, believing that their sins are the most destructive among all. Their sins could hurt the entire kingdom. Gabriel invests time to be around the nobles, constantly sees them on religious occasions and tries to find the sinners among them. When he finds one, he acts: Captures them without warning, plots their downfall, or reveals their sins to other great houses or the royalty.</p><p>Four of Gabriel’s followers – Rene, Alain, Marcel, and Damien (all <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Warrior Priests</span>) – are constantly roaming the streets and looking for sinners. Rene is the youngest among the group and the most devoted of them. He visits local temples and especially looks for the sinners who work as priests and chaplains. He believes that those who lead the people spiritually must be purged from sins first.</p><p>Alain is the strongest among them and roams around soldiers, levies, knights, and other warriors who defend the city. He believes that the defenders must be free of sin if the city is to be protected by the Lord.</p><p>Marcel roams around the noble quarters, and he is of noble birth himself. He abandoned his roots; however, he still knows their ways and traditions. He visits castles, manors, and similar places to find sinners.</p><p>Damien is out on the streets, observing ordinary people, and believes that they are the core of the city, and if they are corrupted, the city is doomed. He also looks for false preachers, corrupt street leaders, thieves, and beggar kings most of the time, believing they are at the root of corruption.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Sacred Blaze: </span>During Queen Melisende’s reign, a devoted Christian knight entered the church, which was only a shrine back then, and started to punish himself with the act of flagellation as a punishment for not being able to protect his comrades in battle. He punished himself so hard, he came close to death and the local priests and doctors were unable to save him. Queen Melisende became aware of the situation, and she found a way to help the injured Crusader. She found an <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Odparvar</span> named Alaz(Turkish word for flame, brightness), an elemental entity, and summoned the dead comrades. When the Crusader heard the voice of his fallen friends, he woke up and the treatments started to work. He forgave himself.</p><p>The queen made an agreement with the Odparvar and asked the creature to ensure innocent souls were not too harsh on themselves. Odparvar agreed and stayed in the church. It rarely uses its powers and even the masters of the church are unaware of its presence. If a master of the church goes beyond redemption, Odparvar either exposes them or kills them in their sleep.</p><p>Odparvar’s existence and soul are bound to the church and the area, and there is a continual flame at the altar of the church called Sacred Blaze which represents its presence.

Only one knight never left his post, and he kept watch more than he should have.</p><p>The word reached the queen eventually, and she disguised herself as a commoner and went to see the soldier. She realized the soldier had heard the voice of his mentor and didn’t want to leave his mentor all alone, believing his spirit still endured. Queen Melisende was a wise queen and knowledgeable in these matters, so she located the actual creature: it was a <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Viran-dahl-Asude</span>, <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Voiceless One</span>. It was not a spirit, only an elemental, and this one was harmless.

It almost seems to. The second thing you notice is an aura of anger. It oozes from the pores of every patron seated in their half-rotten, old chairs. Even beneath the smiles on the faces of the drunkards, there lurks a sort of misery, something almost every city resident can relate to but hates to discuss. The anger towards their lives and current circumstances ricochets from patron to patron like a charged lightning bolt.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">Then you notice two curious eyes that began watching you the moment you stepped in. Behind the broken-down bar, where a couple of men rest their heads trying to stave off the effects of the ale in their veins, are the bright eyes of Wilfred. Perhaps he looks at you with the excitement of welcoming new customers, or maybe it’s something more. Those eyes are difficult to read, but you sense there’s a story there. With a casual gesture, he signals the waiter to approach you. He shows you to a table, identical to the others, but just as he’s about to take your order, a large hand lands on his shoulder, stopping him mid-sentence. “I’ll handle this. You go take care of that table that’s been waiting for a while.” It’s Wilfred.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">Your gaze follows the waiter as he escorts a group to what seems like a back room, receiving a handsome payment under his cloak. No one appears to care about this mysterious room or the large group heading there. Everyone is too engrossed in drowning their sorrows.</p></div><p>The locals are regular patrons of Wilfred’s Eatery, which occupies a sizable space in a somewhat dubious part of the city. It thrives as a hub for underground activities, attracting those engaged in less conventional business ventures. Beneath the tavern, there are concealed tunnels that were once connected to the Temple Mount during its initial construction. Originally intended to function as a town hall, the tavern’s history has seen it go through periods of abandonment before being purchased by a family who transformed it into a recreational establishment where townsfolk can unwind and release their tensions.</p><p>While the ancient tunnels have been blocked off for years, small chambers remain, serving as storage areas and discreet spaces for customers to conduct private activities or carry out business transactions. The tavern owner, Wilfred, is a half-orc who assumes the guise of a muscular man and commands respect with every step he takes. However, it is wise not to incur his displeasure, as he possesses a formidable presence and maintains a loyal community of non-human patrons of the tavern who stand ready to support him when needed.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Wilfred (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</span><span class=\"dot-sup color1\">j</span><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">):</span> The esteemed proprietor of this charming establishment. He possesses a unique heritage as a half-orc, seamlessly integrated with both the human and the non-human community. His parents hail from Nordic origins, and their union, an orcish father and a human mother led to their banishment from their respective societies. During a fortuitous encounter with a priest en route to Jerusalem, they decided to follow his guidance, embarking on a prolonged journey until they found solace among the non-human populace of Jerusalem. In this vibrant community, their beloved son Wilfred was born.</p><p>After enduring years of concealment, Wilfred grew weary of the destitute living conditions and adamantly refused to engage in a life of crime. With resolute determination, he decided to remove his tusks and obliterate any remnants of his orc lineage in his visage. Seizing the opportunity, he took over an elderly man’s abandoned dwelling and ingeniously transformed it into a tavern catering to the needs of those on the fringes of Jerusalem’s society. Although not situated in the most affluent parts of the city, Wilfred’s establishment rapidly gained popularity, and he, in turn, embraced a life of integrity and respectability amidst all the strata of the city.</p><p>Presently, the Eatery also acts as a crucial institution for the non-humans of Jerusalem, assisting them in conducting their enterprises in the human world and keeping their guises.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Gwyneth (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</span><span class=\"dot-sup color1\">j</span><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">):</span> Gwyneth, a kindred spirit to Wilfred, shares his half-orc heritage and serves as a valued waitress in his bustling tavern. Among her non-human community, she is affectionately known as Gwyneth. She adopted the name Gülfem when introducing herself to the human folk, crafting an identity with roots in Persian culture - surely as a stubborn act of defiance against the Crusaders of the city. Before joining forces with Wilfred, Gwyneth had a brief stint in the palace kitchen, where her culinary talents shone. It was during this time that fate led her down a serendipitous path, crossing ways with the amiable Princess Sybilla.</p><p>A strong bond soon formed between Gwyneth and Princess Sybilla, who grew genuinely fond of her. However, the prevailing societal norms and biases surrounding non-humans prevented the princess from keeping Gwyneth within the palace walls. Undeterred, Gwyneth emerged as an invaluable asset to Sybilla, taking on the role of a discreet informant for the palace. Her unparalleled knowledge of everyday life and the intricate political landscape among the locals made her an invaluable source of information for the princess.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Ilana (@UUID[Actor.nW8Aj5aNHyswBvNs]{Traveling Artist}):</span> Ilana is exceptionally skilled with the lute and the lyre. Occasionally donning the title of the bard of this tavern, Ilana sings songs of sorrow and remembrance. With a lineage steeped in Celtic heritage mixed with elven blood, she embodies a captivating charm that draws many a gentleman to frequent the tavern, captivated by her songs and beauty. With a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, players notice, she slightly lifts the scarf wrapped around her head just enough to make one ear naked to hear what she is playing when performing.</p><p>As a testament to her undeniable talent, Ilana is sought after by esteemed figures, including high-ranking officials, who request private shows to indulge in her artistry. Among her known patrons are the illustrious Guy de Lusignan and Raynald de Chatillon (check out The Sigil of Jerusalem’s Characters section for further information). Though the majority of the tavern’s regulars remain unaware of this privileged clientele, Ilana herself does not hold a great fondness for either of them. Nonetheless, she finds solace in the generous rewards these engagements bring. If players chat with Ilana, they can make a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check to talk about Guy de Lusignan or Raynald de Chattilon; on a failed save Ilana, refuses the players, stating she can not share details about noble and powerful people. On a success, players are informed of Ilana’s opinion regarding them. She thinks Guy de Lusignan is much wiser than what his age shows and sometimes describes historical events as if he were there as they happened; Raynald de Chatillon, on the other hand, acts like a violent beast but is always very loyal to Guy.</p></div>"

The owner herself possesses an ashy complexion, a result of the thick layer of white paint she has applied all over her skin. Her cheeks are artificially flushed with an unnatural red hue, and her eyes are expertly adorned with smoky black soot, extending elegantly into a winged shape. Two exquisite purple headwraps are stylishly wound over her hair, skillfully crafted to create the illusion of two elegantly cascading ponytails that gracefully extend all the way down to the floor. Despite her artistic appearance, she appears visibly frustrated.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">“My love, wouldn’t you like to add some color to your ensemble? Just black, really? How dreadfully dull,” she remarks with a hint of disdain, as she hastily scribbles down the order. Once the man departs from the shop, she turns her attention to you with a warm greeting. “Oh, hello! Please tell me you’re here for something vibrant and colorful. Today, I’ve had three orders for black leather vests, and I must admit, it’s pushing me towards despair. I yearn for a touch of creativity and diversity in my creations.”</p></div><p>The town’s tailor, <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Seraphine (@UUID[Actor.1JK80RxGJvsa6UG4]{Artisan})</span>, is a striking tiefling woman who possesses a unique sense of style and artistry.

Her light green skin is disguised with the application of white ash and elaborate makeup, enhancing her already striking features. Many view her as an extravagant individual due to her distinct fashion choices.</p><p>Beyond her captivating appearance, the tailor possesses remarkable skill in her craft. She utilizes her innate magical abilities to weave enchantments into the very fabric she works with, allowing her to create extraordinary costumes that serve as effective disguises. Her expertise is particularly sought after by nonhuman clients, as she possesses an innate understanding of their unique needs and preferences.</p><p>In addition to her proficiency in costume design, the tailor is known for crafting durable armors specifically tailored for warriors. With her magical touch, she ensures that these armors not only provide reliable protection but also exhibit a touch of her artistic flair. Armors bought from this place grants +1 bonus to Charisma checks while wearing it, and noble folk who are unaware of nonhuman races are intrigued, as they don’t know who makes such fine garments.</p></div>"

However, fate intervened when she crossed paths with Isabel, the High Priestess of her coven. Under Isabel’s guidance, Willa was taken under her wing and initiated into the coven, gaining invaluable knowledge and skills.</p><p>Tragedy struck when Willa’s father passed away, leaving her as the sole heir to the butcher shop and their home, given that she had no other relatives. With the support of her coven, Willa erected a substantial house adjacent to the butcher shop, and together, they assumed control of her father’s business.

Instead, it appears almost abandoned, as if it has been the dwelling place of a hoarder with no regard for cleanliness. Empty, broken, and half-filled vials are scattered haphazardly throughout the space, giving an air of disarray and neglect. The bookshelf, laden with dusty old tomes, seems untouched for ages, their pages yellowed with time.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">As you explore the dim corners of the shop, a mumbling sound draws your attention. From the far corner emerges the figure of an old man who seems to be quite displeased by your presence. His frustration is evident as he exclaims, “Oh, great! What the bloody hell do you want?” His demeanor offers no warmth or kindness; rather, he gives the impression of someone who should have passed away long ago but somehow forgot to do so.

He carries an air of grumpiness and possesses a sharp tongue. The apothecary itself, rather than resembling a conventional shop, bears the semblance of a small, cave-like space. Bottles and potions line every available surface, requiring visitors to tread cautiously to avoid accidental mishaps. The owner typically remains secluded in some corner, engrossed in the meticulous preparation of medications.</p><p>Despite its somewhat dubious appearance, the apothecary holds the distinction of being the finest establishment of its kind in town, surprisingly earning a reputation for reliability and trustworthiness. The owner is a familiar figure to every resident of Jerusalem, as his presence extends back to their childhood memories. Curiously, no one can recall a time when he was younger, leaving the impression that he has been trapped within the confines of a temporal prison, eternally bound to stir his potions.</p><p>There exists an air of mystery surrounding the owner, as no one has ever witnessed him stepping foot outside his shop. The apothecary’s inner room serves as his residence, accessible through a connecting passage. The owner relies on his errand boys to deliver supplies, which he then diligently prepares within the confines of his secluded abode.</p><p>In a profound twist of fate, the truth behind the apothecary’s owner unveils a deeply tragic story. Over two centuries have passed since he first began working at the shop. In his late nineties, his beloved wife fell gravely ill, prompting him to undertake a desperate and daring venture. In an attempt to save her life, he concocted a risky potion infused with powerful magic. However, the spell misfired, resulting in a catastrophic event that caused his wife to vanish, ensnared within a binding vortex of magic.</p><p>Trapped within the confines of an unbreakable time bubble, the owner has remained in the shop for the past 150 years, perpetually haunted by the weight of guilt and grief. His existence has become a ceaseless penance for his perceived failure in rescuing his wife from her magical entrapment. The passage of time, both relentless and unforgiving, has found him eternally locked within the confines of the shop’s walls. Players can buy any common potions from this shop for 50 gd and some uncommon potions that are listed. If players attempt to steal a potion, they must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed save, they are noticed by Khaled, but he doesn’t care unless they steal more than one potion. In a situation where players steal more than one potion, he warns them, saying he didn’t care for one, but they shouldn’t be greedy. Players can roll a d8 on the list to see which potion they have stolen if stolen in a hurry.</p><table class=\"roll color-blue\"><thead><tr><td><p>prıces</p></td><td><p>PotIons</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>150 gd</p></td><td><p>Potion of Psychic Resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>125 gd</p></td><td><p>Potion of Poison Resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>150 gd</p></td><td><p>Potion of Necrotic Resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>175 gd</p></td><td><p>Potion of Fire Resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>110 gd</p></td><td><p>Potion of Greater Healing</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>125 gd</p></td><td><p>Potion of Animal Friendship</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>150 gd</p></td><td><p>Potion of Poison</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>100 gd</p></td><td><p>Potion of Sleep*</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Potion of Sleep:</span> Any creature who drinks this potion is under the effects of sleep spell.</p><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/doldurma.webp\" /></div>"

It was established by a group of former priests who made the personal decision to leave the priesthood. Their reasons varied: one fell in love and chose to pursue marriage, another experienced a shift in their beliefs and no longer held faith in God, while another simply had an unwavering love for alcohol. United by their shared experiences, they came together to create an inn that emulated the atmosphere of a monastery, maintaining the customs and even donning familiar uniforms that brought them comfort.</p><p>The Archbishop offers standard rooms to accommodate their guests, with the charges varying based on the owners’ affinity for each individual visitor. If the owners take a liking to a guest and learn of their need for accommodation despite limited finances, they may offer a considerable discount or even a complimentary stay. These rooms comfortably house 2-4 people and provide a cozy and welcoming environment.</p><p>The Archbishop’s reputation is further bolstered by the delectable meals prepared by one of the owners’ wives. With three courses of delicious cuisine, guests are treated to a memorable dining experience that adds to the overall charm of the establishment.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the inn carries a distinct aroma due to the presence of a makeshift brewery located in the basement.

Being the son of a priest, it seemed only natural for him to follow in his father’s footsteps. Until the age of 20, he resided in a monastery, and thereafter, he returned to his village to assume the role of a priest in the church, taking over from his retiring father. Their relationship was a complex yet deeply close bond. Blake held his father in utmost respect and adoration, but also couldn’t shake the fear that arose from his father’s stern and austere demeanor.</p><p>Unfortunately, after a few peaceful years, tragedy struck as Blake’s father passed away from an unidentified ailment. The swift and unexpected nature of his father’s death left Blake grappling to come to terms with it. Haunted by memories, he felt as if his father’s presence lingered, haunting him, questioning his worth just as he had during Blake’s childhood. Seeking solace, Blake turned to alcohol, finding temporary relief from his distress when he was intoxicated enough not to see the haunting visions. Regrettably, this coping mechanism eventually spiraled into a serious issue, leading to him falling asleep during masses and even behaving aggressively towards his own community.</p><p>In recognition of the deep respect he held for his community and the importance of his role as a priest, Blake voluntarily stepped down from his position. He couldn’t bear the thought of tarnishing the sacred space with his drunken state. Subsequently, he encountered others who, like him, had left the priesthood due to personal reasons. These kindred spirits provided Blake with a place where he could find respite from the burdens of social responsibilities and expectations.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Oswald (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{Priest}</span><span class=\"dot-sup color1\">j</span><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">): </span>When Oswald was a child, he experienced something inexplicable. He fell from a cliff, and just as he was certain he would meet his demise, he began to float miraculously. He floated all the way to the bottom, where he encountered a woman. Curious about this extraordinary event, he asked her for an explanation. The woman seemed panicked and attributed it to the work of God. Despite facing skepticism from others, Oswald remained devoted to the God he believed had saved him. As time passed, he pursued the path of becoming a priest in his quest to comprehend this divine occurrence. However, even religion could not provide an adequate explanation for the phenomenon.</p><p>Driven by an insatiable desire for answers, Oswald delved into more arcane readings. Through his studies, he gradually came to realize that the inexplicable event had nothing to do with God; it was magic! As his knowledge of magic expanded, his belief in God dwindled.</p><p>Eventually, Oswald reached a critical juncture where he recognized that since he no longer believed in God, his priestly work had lost its meaning. With deep remorse, he apologized to his community and decided to step away from his religious calling. Returning to his family home, he sought solace, and it was then that his uncle shared news of a house he owned in Jerusalem. Generously, his uncle offered him the property, suggesting that Oswald try his luck and see what he could make of it.</p><p>Taking a leap of faith, Oswald embarked on a journey to Jerusalem. Along the way, fate brought him into the company of Slade and Blake, both ex-priests like himself, who shared similar customs they had acquired during their time in the monastery.

At the tender age of 13, he solemnly took a vow of celibacy, embracing a path of spiritual dedication. However, destiny had other plans when he encountered Eden.</p><p>It was in the bustling marketplace where Eden showcased the bounties of her garden that their paths intertwined. Slade found himself drawn to her presence and the connection they shared during their fruit transactions. Each visit to the market brought an increasing sense of excitement, and their conversations grew longer and more intimate. Initially convincing himself that theirs was to be a wonderful friendship, Slade’s heart couldn’t deny the blossoming love he felt for Eden. As their bond deepened, he yearned to marry her.</p><p>But the rigid rules of his monastery came crashing down on him, confronting him with the ultimatum: his sacred priesthood or the love of Eden. Unable to bear the thought of losing her, Slade reluctantly severed ties with Eden, heartbroken and conflicted. The weeks turned into months, and the ache in his soul grew unbearable. Finally, on one fateful night, unable to suppress his feelings any longer, he composed a heartfelt letter renouncing his priesthood and gathered his belongings. Determined to forge a new life with Eden, he took her hand, and together, they journeyed to Jerusalem, seeking a fresh beginning.</p><p>During their travels, fate brought them in contact with Oswald, a fellow soul who had also abandoned the priesthood. In the warm ambiance of an inn, Slade and Oswald exchanged stories of their journeys and aspirations. Oswald spoke of an abandoned house, left behind by his uncle in Jerusalem, and his dreams of transforming it into a thriving inn.

Despite hailing from a halfling family, Eden stood as the tallest among them all, leading Slade to mistakenly perceive her as a short woman due to his towering height in comparison.</p><p>Within the confines of the kitchen, Eden’s prowess was truly exceptional. With just a hint of magic, she would enhance the flavors of her culinary creations, leaving patrons of The Archbishop utterly enchanted and flocking in large numbers. Her skills in the culinary arts were rivaled only by her talent in creating a warm and welcoming home, effectively assuming the role of the inn’s heart and soul. As the three men responsible for the inn’s operations proved woefully inadequate, she single-handedly shouldered the responsibilities, ensuring its smooth running.</p></div>"

Hanging on the back wall is a portrait of the woman and, presumably, her father, both smiling warmly at the arrival of a new customer.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">As she becomes aware of your entrance, her demeanor transforms unexpectedly from imposing to effervescent. Despite her striking presence, she exudes a certain charm that captivates. “Hello there. How may I be of assistance? Please feel free to explore; many of the pieces on the walls are available for purchase.”</p></div><p>The owner of the Knight Nurse, <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Sylvia (@UUID[Actor.1JK80RxGJvsa6UG4]{Artisan})</span>, has gained considerable renown for her exceptional craftsmanship and durable creations. As the daughter of a skilled blacksmith, she began her apprenticeship at a young age, learning the trade under her father’s guidance. When her father eventually became unable to continue due to age, she assumed responsibility for the business.</p><p>Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to expand her skills, the blacksmith embarked on journeys throughout the region, seeking out mages to learn arcane secrets. Through these encounters, she acquired a deep understanding of magic and its applications. This newfound knowledge allowed her to infuse magic into select weapons she crafted, creating extraordinary pieces imbued with additional properties and abilities.</p><p>The blacksmith is discerning in the distribution of these magical creations, reserving them exclusively for a select group of trusted customers. Word of mouth serves as the primary means of attracting clients to her forge, as those fortunate enough to have used her enchanted weapons recognize the unparalleled quality they possess. Any weapon bought from or reinforced here is infused with magic and grants an additional 1d4 radiant damage for the next 24 hours. Every infusion costs 25 gold dinars.</p></div>"

Surprisingly, the air carries a pleasant aroma despite the presence of horse stalls. This unexpected fragrance is a result of incense burning in every corner, thoughtfully used to purify the air and create a calming atmosphere. The farrier, who appears to be the one responsible for this ingenious idea, notices your interest in the incense and shares, “It calms the horses down. This place used to be an abandoned pagan temple. I discovered a good stock of these in one of the chambers, and to be honest, I could barely tolerate the stable’s natural scent before.”</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">With a warm and welcoming smile, he approaches you and inquires, “How do you do? How may I be of service? We have some robust and reliable steeds available for purchase or rent. Additionally, I am skilled as a farrier, so if you need any horseshoes or hoof care, I am here to assist.”</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">As you take a step closer to the farrier’s desk, an inexplicable sensation washes over you – the feeling of being watched. Instinctively, you turn your head to scan the surroundings, searching for the source of this peculiar feeling. The stable seems tranquil, the horses continuing their peaceful activities, and the farrier focused on tending to his work.</p></div><p>The Steeds of the Cross Farrier &amp; Stables hold a captivating history, once being an ancient pagan temple that lay dormant for many generations. It caught the attention of a young and ambitious farrier seeking a suitable space to establish his business. With a mix of courage and curiosity, he claimed the temple as his own, clearing out the interior and relocating the shrines and sacred scriptures to a hidden chamber beneath the ground. In their place, he constructed functional stables, transforming the once sacred space into a practical and bustling establishment.</p><p>Yet the farrier’s presence in the temple does not go unnoticed. Whenever he walks by the concealed chamber, where the pagan iconography and relics now rest, an eerie sensation of being watched washes over him.</p><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Esmond (@UUID[Actor.XiG03vgMTRXPTmh9]{Wilderness Commoner}): </span>Esmond had spent a decade as a dedicated farrier apprentice, learning the trade from an old friend of his father. With each passing year, his passion for the craft grew, and he developed innovative ideas to improve the business. However, his employer refused to let go of the reins and hand over the business, no matter how much Esmond insisted or how patiently he waited. After a particularly heated argument, Esmond made the tough decision to quit, leaving him unemployed and disheartened.</p><p>For a while, he wallowed in his situation, feeling lost and directionless, until his father decided it was time for Esmond to seek a new job, and pushed him to leave the comforts of home. Esmond, though, yearned to be his own boss and embarked on a journey around town, searching for a place to turn into his own shop. However, he faced repeated disappointments as he couldn’t afford any suitable locations.</p><p>In his search, fate led him to an abandoned building, which appeared to be an ancient pagan temple left to decay over time. Esmond saw potential in this forgotten structure and set to work clearing out any remnants of its past, converting it into a stable. Being naturally adept at caring for horses, word spread about his skills, and people began to flock to his establishment, aptly named “Steeds of the Cross.”</p><p>Little did Esmond know that during this transformation, he had unwittingly attracted the attention of a mystical being –<span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\"> Rahul (check out the Chor statblock in the Appendix)</span>, a djinni who had crossed over to our world in search of a hidden artifact. Rahul became enamored with Esmond’s presence and started watching him closely. Captivated by Esmond’s everyday life and the way he tended to horses, Rahul felt an undeniable love and decided to bind himself to Esmond to avoid being banished from the mortal realm. With unwavering determination, he pledged to shield Esmond from any who sought to cause him harm.</p><p>Despite the supernatural presence around him, Esmond remained unaware of Rahul’s existence. He could sense a strange energy at times and noticed some peculiar physical changes, like patches of his skin losing melanin, but he dismissed them as mere quirks. Oblivious to the djinni’s affectionate watchfulness, Esmond continued to pour his heart and soul into his newfound stable, focusing on building his business and establishing himself as an independent farrier, never imagining the magical companion he had gained along the way.</p></div>"

He managed to trap the<span class=\"italic\">Sacred Blaze</span> in the Church of Flagellation, and no fire can be created in the subsequent area. He must also capture the <span class=\"italic\">Celestial Wind</span> and<span class=\"italic\"> Holy Thunder</span> from the <span class=\"ha-gold bold\">@UUID[.K1RcDqGepPURAlt1]{Cathedral of James} </span><span class=\"ha-gold\">and </span><span class=\"bold\">@UUID[.UQ698t8bPyvU6G8w]{David’s Tower}</span>.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\"><span class=\"bold\">Possible Rewards:</span> 300 gd, uncommon magic items for each party member.</p></div><p>The master of the Church of Flagellation, Father Gabriel, informs the city guard that the Sacred Blaze is extinguished, and it can’t be lit again. The locals find out that within a 100 meter area, no flames can be produced, not even the candles can be lit. Even the people with knowledge of arcane business can’t create flame, fire, or anything of the sort. Most of the guards and knights prove to be useless in solving the mystery, and Father Gabriel offers a good payment to anyone who solves it.</p><p>The Sacred Blaze has been stolen by Dankaran, an interesting persona and a powerful bard hailing from the lands of Mali in West Africa. He crossed the Sahara desert with a group of travelers for the sole purpose of visiting the Holy Lands. He is following a legend he heard from a Muslim merchant: The Sacred Blaze, the Celestial Wind, and the Holy Thunder are the keys to resurrect the most beautiful queen, and she will take the one that resurrected her as her king, and they will ascend to the heavens.</p><p>He will stay at the Qadim Hookah and has a room there under a false name: <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Bilal al-Sawt Jabbar </span>(a character that can speak Arabic knows immediately that this name means “Strong-Voiced Bilal,” or a DC 10 Intelligence checks can also reveal this information if anyone doesn’t speak Arabic.).</p><p>Dankaran has a magic item called the Necklace of Binding. With its ability, he can bind the elementals inside it and thus come one step closer to achieving the prophecy mentioned in the legend.</p><div class=\"box-item very-rare\"><div><p class=\"title\">@UUID[Item.p1hWqFdds1uc6I8B]{Necklace of Binding}</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Wondrous item, very rare, requires attunement</p></div><div><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">The necklace has African totems and weavings made out of bone, wood, and straw. The totems symbolize the unity of air, clouds, and the hearth of the tribe.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">It has three tiny skulls. They represent the bound elementals of the necklace. Using an action, you can target an elemental with a CR equal to or below 5 within 60 ft. of you that you can see. The elemental must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is trapped within one of the skulls. You can have three elementals trapped in the skulls like this.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">Once trapped, an elemental remains in the necklace until released. An elemental trapped in the necklace doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">You can use an action to touch the necklace’s skulls and release the elemental it contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the necklace, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to activate the skull. A newly discovered necklace might already contain a creature/creatures chosen by the GM.</p></div></div><p>Dankaran arrived in Jerusalem a few weeks ago and started researching the mentioned elementals. He asked around and talked with many scholars, priests, and civilians. At Emma’s library (the priestess at the Cathedral of St. James), he found a book about Queen Melisende’s life, and he became sure the legendary queen from the prophecy was she.</p><p>He traveled to the Church of Flagellation and trapped the Odparvar in the church with his necklace by making sure to change his appearance beforehand.</p><div class=\"box-character1 ha-dark-blue-note\"><p class=\"centered ha-dark-blue-note bold font-size-x1.5\">@UUID[Actor.GPCzBmYzUfYywkBr]{Dankaran}</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-blue-character-subtitle\">Medium humanoid (human), chaotic neutral</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Armor Class </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-character-subtitle\">15 (Studded Leather Armor)</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Hit Points </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-character-subtitle\">65 (10d8 + 20)</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Speed </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-character-subtitle\">30 ft.</span></p><div class=\"box-character-attributes\"><div><p>STR</p><p>8 (-1)</p></div><div><p>DEX</p><p>16 (+3)</p></div><div><p>CON</p><p>14 (+2)</p></div><div><p>INT</p><p>13 (+1)</p></div><div><p>WIS</p><p>11 (+0)</p></div><div><p>CHA</p><p>19 (+4)</p></div></div><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Saving Throws </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Dex +6, Cha +7</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Skills </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Deception +10, Persuasion +7, Performance +10</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Senses </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">passive Perception 10</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Languages </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Bambara, Arabic, Turkish, French</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Challenge </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">6 (2,300 XP)</span></p><hr /><div><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Wonderful Illusions. </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">When Dankaran casts an illusion spell, a creature makes the Intelligence or Wisdom checks with disadvantage, regarding whether the illusion depicts something real or not.</span></p><p class=\"no-margin\"><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Spellcasting. </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">The enchanter casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):</span></p><p class=\"margin-left no-margin\"><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">At will:</span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note italic\"> friends, mage hand, dancing lights, vicious mockery (3d4)</span></p><p class=\"margin-left no-margin\"><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">3/each day: </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note italic\">alarm, expeditious retreat, healing word, disguise self, sleep (2nd level)</span></p><p class=\"margin-left\"><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">2/day each: </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note italic\">charm person, hold person, invisibility, suggestion, tongues</span></p><p class=\"font-size-x1.25 small-caps no-margin ha-dark-blue-note\">Actions</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Multiattack.</span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\"> Dankaran makes three Vicious Arcana attacks.</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold\">Vicious Arcana. </span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note italic\">Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:</span><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\"> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target.

He will also find out about the bell at the Tower of David from a <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Local Priest</span> called Alexander.</li><li>He will attempt to bind the Celestial Wind. If adventurers intervene, you can have the Celestial Wind roll for the save. If not, the roll automatically fails in the favor of Dankaran.</li><li>With the Celestial Wind gone, the area (100-meter radius) around the Cathedral will see no wind.</li><li>He will invite Alexander to the inn where he stays and will want to gather further information. He will kill Alexander after he becomes suspicious of the deeds Dankaran has done.</li><li>He will travel to the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Tower of David</span> and will be interrupted by Bartholomew. They will fight, and Dankaran will summon any elemental forces he has. If the adventurers aren’t around, he will steal the Holy Thunder without any trouble and kill Bartholomew.</li><li>With the Holy Thunder gone, people that are in the area (50-meter-radius) the moment the Voiceless One is trapped will lose the ability to speak or be deafened (GM’s choice, both effects could have an impact on different people. For example, ten civilians may be deafened while other twenty civilians may lose the ability to speak). After that, any creature who speaks really loudly or screams must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or lose the ability to speak or be deafened (GM’s choice for each time).</li><li>He will travel to the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Tomb of Virgin Mary</span>, where he will sacrifice the three elementals and resurrect the Queen.</li></ol><p><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Note:</span> Dankaran will use the <span class=\"italic\">disguise self</span> spell or other spells at his disposal whenever it is necessary.</p><p>The resurrection part of the legend is false. The original legend was that if three elementals gather at the Tomb of Virgin Mary, Queen Melisende’s memories will guide them to a very precious magic item she found when she was young: the Crown of Shahryar (Check out the Items section). The queen, if she deems the person worthy, will let a successor use the crown for better purposes. This information can be gathered at the library from a Latin text which can be found with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check.</p><h3 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Tomb of Virgin Mary</h3><p>The Tomb of Virgin Mary is a legendary place and the burial site of Queen Melisende.</p><p>Preceded by a walled courtyard to the south, the cruciform church shielding the tomb has been created in part by cutting through the rock and in part with masonry, and is entered by a wide descending staircase. The staircase is protected by two Crusader Infantry, but they will let a disguised Dankaran in. He will sacrifice and kill all three elementals at the altar of the church (a 20x50 ft. room) and will awaken the wrath of Queen Melisende.</p><p>Queen Melisende’s power will awaken and kill Dankaran immediately. Now that the elementals are gone, the effects will be permanent in the city.</p><h4 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Possible Resolutions</h4><p>If Dankaran learns the true legend, he will stop his actions. If he committed the murder of Alexander, he would attempt to run. Otherwise, he can be convinced to let go of the elementals he stole if he is promised that he can leave the city safely. He can also be easily persuaded to pursue the Crown of Shahryar peacefully with the adventurers, if he is the one to get the item.</p><ul class=\"blue moon\"><li>If the adventurers wish to complete the legend on their own, the elementals must demand something in return. Holy Thunder will ask for the most beautiful voice it can hear. Sacred Blaze will demand the confession from the most innocent person in the city. Celestial Wind will demand a hundred children’s laughter.</li></ul></div>"

He volunteered to be the champion. The knights were amazed by his courage and let him step forward. Gwalchmei thought he was being clever and beheaded the knight with one swift stroke. He thought he had won, but the disembodied head started to laugh, and the body picked it up. He congratulated the knight and expressed his enthusiasm for meeting him next week.</p><p>Gwalchmei is afraid to go, but his honor and his officers in the Order deem that he must go and do it alone. However, Gwalchmei wants to recruit help: adventurers, skilled warriors, and arcane dwellers.</p><p>If the adventurers agree to the quest, they can travel to the hill with the broken tree together. On the road, there can be some challenges to test their strength and honor.</p><ol class=\"blue\"><li>A poor <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</span><span class=\"dot-sup color1\">j</span> named Alexander will ask for a donation. He expects at least 1 gd from a knight in shining armor. (the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Honorable act</span> is to give the poor a good amount of coins, at least 1 gd) Gwalchmei has only 1 gd.</li><li>They will be attacked by a <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">@UUID[Actor.3x9eB5NzUd2eD8i6]{Fallen Crusader}</span> (the<span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\"> Honorable act</span> is to fight with courage), and Gwalchmei is terrified of the undead.</li><li>A traveling circus will spend the night with the group, offering them shelter and food. During the night, a hunter (Scout) named Bertilak will want to play a game called the Hunting Game. He will hunt during the night and give whatever he finds to Gwalchmei; in exchange, Gwalchmei will give whatever he finds during the night to the hunter. After the hunter Bertilak is gone, his wife <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Beatrice (@UUID[Actor.nW8Aj5aNHyswBvNs]{Traveling Artist})</span> will attempt to seduce Gwalchmei and initiate this by kissing him. She will give him a green girdle, a magic item that will save his life. When an <span class=\"italic\">identity</span> spell is cast on the girdle, this information is revealed: “When a player reaches 0 hit points, the girdle will disappear, and the user will drop to 1 hit point instead.” (the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Honorable act </span>is to stay away from Beatrice and respect her husband, but Gwalchmei is mesmerized by Beatrice).</li></ol><p>There are some important aspects of the quest:</p><ul class=\"blue moon\"><li>Gwalchmei does not want to die, but his honor is also very important to him. He’s torn between duty and his own preservation. If the adventurers do not intervene, he may choose dishonorable acts due to reasons stated within the challenges.</li><li>The knight in green actually wants to test the knight’s honor, and if he submits to the rules of the game, the knight will spare his life with only a small cut on his neck and give him a permanent blessing (the GM’s choice of a low-spell effect, such as “always under the effects of the <span class=\"italic\">bless</span> spell”).</li><li>If the adventurers helped him stay true to his cause, they will be rewarded with temporary blessings, such as a low-level cleric spell that is extended by duration or effect.</li><li>Without the adventurers’ help, Gwalchmei is most likely to fail.</li></ul><p>The knight in green is actually Godfrey de Saint-Omer, a founding member of the Knights Templar. He was beheaded by one of the grand masters wrongfully, but he protected another of his comrade’s honor: Hugues de Payens. Godfrey died in his stead and did it happily. His honor made him hold onto his life as a Dullahan, and he sometimes tests the members with different challenges. He sometimes hires some young knights to test others’ strength and devotion, just like in this case.</p><p>Resolutions:</p><ul class=\"blue moon\"><li>If Gwalchmei puts the girdle aside and faces the challenge directly, without any games or deceptions, he will be counted successful no matter what he does with 3 challenges.</li><li>If he is counted successful and acted honorably (or persuaded to act honorably) in all three cases, he will receive a magic sword (<span class=\"italic\">longsword +1</span>) from the Dullahan.</li><li>If attacked, the Dullahan will protect itself with all its might.</li><li>If the adventurers all acted like bad influences and persuaded the knight on all occasions toward the dishonorable acts, the Dullahan may turn hostile towards the adventurers.</li></ul><p>If Gwalchmei is successful, the knight in green will bid farewell to him by saying: “Off with your head.”</p></div>"

There is also a rumor of tremendous wealth lying in the graveyard. A recently wealthy artisan named James died, and the rumor holds that he was buried with all his wealth, despite the usual burial traditions here. It is said that James had two sons, and both of them brought disgrace to him, so he left them all out of his will.

He is one of the most powerful priests in Jerusalem and has the abilities of a 5th-level Life Domain Cleric in addition to the statblock and this feature: He can cast the healing word spell at will. Roger is an enthusiastic priest in his thirties with a respect towards all life and an interest towards the working mechanism of the human body as well as arcane matters. He usually is close to wherever combat and raids are and rarely spends time in the city. He helps injured soldiers all over the kingdom.</p><p>William Borrel is a middle-aged man with a short temper and great talent. He is one of the best duelists in the order and has never lost a one-on-one duel. He usually seeks out friendly competitions in the kingdom and tries to locate talented youth by observing them and organizing small tournaments. He also disguises himself from time to time and observes the youth in the city from afar to detect talented and dedicated ones.</p><p>Garnier is a man of high charisma and is a very perceptive knight. He adapts to the changing world quickly and embraces the new conditions better than most. He is a devout and good man, believing that taking up arms against foes must be the last resort. He occasionally talks about the good of the realm and that they should start discussing peace and co-existence with the Muslim world. He is constantly in touch with members and puts a keen eye on the order. Although the order was founded to help the injured and the ones in need, he believes that the threats to the order and the City of God are so great that one must secure one’s homeland before dealing with any external business.

Their entire being resonates with the commitment to safeguard their allies and uphold their sacred duty.</p></div><p>Possibly one of the most famous knightly orders in history, the Knights Templar consists of strong and devout warriors. Founded after the First Crusade, their main goal is to protect the pilgrims in Outremer and in the Holy Lands. Their base of operations is the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Mosque Al-Aqsa</span>, in their words, the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Temple of Solomon</span>, the east wing of the royal palace and one of the most sacred places in the whole of Jerusalem.</p><p>Their current Grand Master is <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Gerard of Ridefort</span> <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">(@UUID[Actor.oCV22rd7effi8QlD]{Crusader Champion}, LN)</span>, a devout and talented warrior.

He believes all members of the order should be as pious as he, disciplined in their religious rituals, and that their acts of faith must be sincere. Otherwise, it would be hypocritical to bear arms for the Lord. He occasionally visits the countryside and upcoming pilgrims on their road in disguise, secretly protecting them, looking out for their troubles, and personally observing the conditions of the roads of pilgrimage. He also pays regular visits to local nobles to gain donations, as the Knights Templar depends entirely on donations. Gerard’s flaw is isolation: his devotion to the order and its way leads him to believe that all members of the order are devout as he is, and his usual missions outside the city may make him blind to many internal problems. He is also aware of the arcane realm but considers it a distraction from the true duties of a Knight Templar. He has no problems with magic drawn from nature and holiness, but if he witnesses arcane power emanating from a darker place, he will consider it his mission to cut the source down.</p><p>If adventurers wish to help Gerard, they can either escort him in the wilderness and help fight off some potential threats (check out the table <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Wilderness Threats </span>below) or investigate the corruption within the order (check out table <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Internal Affairs </span>below).</p><p>Walter du Meslin is a devout and charismatic man with great leadership skills and a strong belief. He believes that the Crusade must continue everywhere, all the time. He is known as the “<span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Wolf under the Cross</span>” by the members of the order, as he is always ready to fight, devoted to the cause, and sees enemies everywhere. He has a personal grudge towards Saladin, often describing him as the “Anti-Christ,” and frequently checks Saracen activity around the city. He is strict on this business, and he is against letting Muslims into the city, as he thinks that they threaten the integrity of the city and may be spies of Saladin. He also disdains magic, seeing it as a taint on the face of the Earth. He is very respected and loved by the Western Crusaders, yet most of the Eastern Crusaders approach him cautiously. He constantly has disagreements with the Grand Master on these matters, but they are very old friends and both are very devoted to the cause of defending the City of God.</p><p>Walter’s brother, One-handed Aaron, has actually converted to Islam and turned to the side of Saladin years ago. Walter is keeping the matter a secret and does not wish it to be known publicly. He believes that Saladin tormented his brother and broke his will. In truth, Aaron met a traveling imam, a member of a Sufi order, while patrolling a border town. The imam and he had a chat, and Aaron started to read the Quran after a deep conversation. He decided that he believed in Allah the same way the Muslims did. He peacefully converted sides but swore an oath never to take up arms against his brother’s side. He often writes him letters from Cairo, but Walter immediately burns those letters. Aaron is known as <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Harun the Barbarossa (@UUID[Actor.kDX72EozbFjhaiYT]{Local Priest})</span> due to his copper beard. Aaron’s Arabic version is Harun, the biblical brother of Moses (Musa).

Their sigil of two knights riding one horse was a symbol of the meager financial situation of the order, as it solely depended on donations from other institutions and the wealthy.</p><p>The Knights Templar made a name for themselves at the Battle of Montgisard, when the Templars showed great courage and strength against the forces of Saladin, turning the tide and securing a decisive victory. Since the battle, trust in the order and the number of volunteers significantly increased. The order has about two thousand men at their disposal, two hundred of whom are actual knights.</p><h3 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Features</h3><p>There are four main ranks in the Knights Templar: Grand Master, Noble Knights, Non-Noble Sergeants, and The Chaplains. The Grand Master is the leader of the whole order, and he appoints masters in different regions, such as France or Aragon. Noble Knights are the knights that joined the order and make up the best armed warriors within the ranks. They wear white to symbolize their devotion and chastity. Sergeants are mostly non-nobles and bring in important crafts and artisanship to the order: blacksmiths, builders, cartographers, cobblers, and more. Chaplains are ordained priests and are there for the spiritual needs.</p><p>Noble Knights can use any Crusader statblock found in the<span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\"> Book of Ingenious Monsters</span>. Non-Noble Sergeants use less powerful Crusader statblocks, while the Chaplains can use <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">@UUID[Actor.hyc7JlRpp4jTTNdg]{Crusader Priest}</span> or <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">@UUID[Actor.kDX72EozbFjhaiYT]{Local Priest}</span> statblocks, as well as any priestly or spiritual statblock available or suited for your game.</p><p>Besides these statblocks, some members (even player characters) may be given these features if they are considered to be a part of the Knights Templar:</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold italic\">The Crimson Cross:</span><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\"> </span>Your enemies tremble before the Crimson Cross of the Templars. You have +2 bonus to your Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold italic\">Heavy Cavalries:</span><span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\"> </span>Templars have served as heavy cavalries and the backbones of the armies of the City of God. You spend only 5 ft. of movement to mount or dismount. While mounted, you have advantage on checks or saving throws made to dismount you.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold italic\">Pilgrims’ Protector:</span> The order’s fame for helping pilgrims and the poor has become legendary. You have +2 bonus on Charisma (Persuasion) checks with the ones that follow the same faith as you: Roman Catholicism.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold italic\">Deus Vult: </span>A Knight Templar is always ready for war. You have +1d4 bonus to your initiative rolls.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold italic\">Devoted Strike:</span> The devotion of the Templars is legendary. When you score a critical hit, you apply one of the conditions: prone, grappled, or frightened. The condition lasts until the end of your next turn.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold italic\">Armor Proficiency:</span> You gain proficiency in light, medium, heavy armor and shields.</p><p><span class=\"ha-dark-blue-note bold italic\">Weapon Master:</span> You gain proficiency in simple weapons and martial weapons.</p><h3 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Banking System</h3><p>While the Templar Order primarily focused on military endeavors, only a minority of its members engaged in combat. The majority served in auxiliary roles, supporting the knights and overseeing the economic framework. Despite their vow of personal poverty, the Templars managed substantial assets beyond mere donations. Nobles aiming to join the Crusades often entrusted their wealth to the Templars’ care during their absence. This practice allowed the Templars to amass considerable wealth across Christendom and the Outremer. By 1150 CE, the Templars pioneered the creation of letters of credit for Holy Land pilgrims. Travelers could deposit their valuables with a local Templar establishment, receive a receipt reflecting their deposit’s value, and then reclaim their wealth in the Holy Land, equivalent to the deposited amount. This early form of banking, potentially the first to utilize cheques, not only enhanced pilgrim safety by reducing robbery risks but also significantly boosted Templar financial resources.</p><h3 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Mosque Al-Aqsa | Temple of Solomon</h3><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">You almost hear the bells of a church, the preachings of a rabbi, and the call to prayer of a muezzin. Where you stand right now is the ultimate sacred place, carrying the prayers of all believers upon its shoulders and whispering all that is holy into your ears. Whatever you believe in your heart, when you stand here, you see devotion, dedication, and worship of thousands of years.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">Red crosses surround the area, the adorned walls, and the church that was a mosque before. The holiest of sights is under your feet.</p></div><p>The headquarters of the Knights Templar is probably one of the holiest places in the city. Granted by the King of Jerusalem in the 1120s, the Temple of Solomon has been the seat of power for the Templars and an important place for the city’s defense.</p><p>The place has been subject to legends, a possible home for relics and artifacts. No one knows if the rumors are true that the Holy Grail itself is barred safely behind the thick walls. Many Crusaders roam the area, and many Templars pray around the courtyard and in the buildings. Most of their quarters are interconnected with others – sleeping under the same roof makes the best of brothers, after all.</p><h4 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Mechanical Effects of the Temple</h4><p>As a sacred ground, the Temple Mount has some features that affect the members and possible allies. Each member of the order that finishes a long rest in the area can reroll a saving throw that they failed once a day.</p><p>You also can choose from the table below or roll for one.

It is designed to handle their daily needs: kitchen, library, chapel, training rooms, arsenal, bathrooms, storage, and personal quarters. Usually, the non-knightly and non-combatant members occupy these places and keep the order running and going by tending to daily problems and administrative matters, as well as economic integrity. Builders constantly address structural problems and add new places if necessary. The main person attending the needs of the Interior Quarters is a priest called <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Gundemar (Crusader Priest)</span>. Gundemar is a punctual and strict man handling the main discipline of the order. Usually, he oversees all schedules and approves them.</p><h4 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Courtyard</h4><p>The courtyard is a place of training, preaching, and meeting. It is part of the Royal Palace, so the knights and members must always be clean, respectful, and ready to meet a royal member. Stables are also in the courtyard and filled with horses, as they are the backbone of the order and military. Most of the archery training, mounted combat training, and similar activities are done in the courtyard.</p><p>The master of the courtyard is a <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Crusader Knight (with Level 3 abilities from Ranger - The Sentry)</span> called <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Arnold of Toledo</span>, one of the most skillful riders amongst the ranks. Arnold is a free spirit with a good understanding of nature and the mood of beasts, especially mounts. He has a warhorse, a riding horse, a camel, and a mastiff. They are named Cazador (hunter in Spanish), Trueno (thunder in Spanish), Andalucia, and Gordito (chubby in Spanish), respectively. It is rumored among the members that Arnold can even tame and mount a dragon. He is sometimes seen with more interesting mounts, such as elks or even wolves. For the related quest, check out The Hunt section below.</p><h4 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">The Chaplains</h4><p>Spiritual leaders of the order are the unseen leaders behind the barred doors. Grand Master Gerard’s personal mentor, <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Godfrey of Montferrat (@UUID[Actor.hyc7JlRpp4jTTNdg]{Crusader Priest}, LN)</span>, is one of the de facto leaders of the order. He is also the oldest member of the order. He was born the day Jerusalem was taken by the First Crusaders to a woman who died in the Temple Mount after her deep wounds.</p><p>Godfrey is one of the most devout Christians that can be found in all of the Holy Lands. His experience and wisdom help the members constantly, and his spiritual leadership is without an equal. He spends most of his time around the knights and other members. He doesn’t believe in seclusion and praying alone, distracted from the real world. He is a man of action, and despite his age, he is healthy and active. He is not very tolerant of those from other religions and especially keeps Saladin and his army at the top of his list of enemies. From his early days as a simple priest to his way to the top seats of the Templars, he always preached taking the fight to the Muslims, and unity amongst the Crusaders, whether it be newcomers from the West or the locals in the East.</p><p>He has a unique arcane ability: understanding lies without difficulty and seeing the truth in all things. From a mechanical perspective, he understands when he hears a lie and has truesight of 30 ft.</p><p>Godfrey has two young pupils: <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Jean Charles (@UUID[Actor.hyc7JlRpp4jTTNdg]{Crusader Priest}, NG)</span> and <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Jacob (@UUID[Actor.hyc7JlRpp4jTTNdg]{Crusader Priest}, LN)</span>. Both are very talented and respected priests in their mid-twenties. They participate in the activities and patrols at the border and in the countryside. Jean Charles has a family in secret in one of the border villages, although he is not allowed to marry. He has a wife named<span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\"> Lucia (@UUID[Actor.nW8Aj5aNHyswBvNs]{Traveling Artist})</span> and two infant children. Jacob is actually very afraid of combat and similar situations, but he has made a promise to a fallen comrade that was grievously wounded in the Battle of Montgisard to build up courage. Due to the promise, he never backs down from a fight and is known as one of the bravest priests in the order. Most warriors and knights come to him for blessings and confessions.</p><h4 class=\"ha-dark-blue-note\">Vault of Heaven</h4><p>The vault is a myth among the outsiders and even among the members. Its place is a secret and only known to a few selected individuals. Only the Grand Master could reveal the place and the ways of entering.</p><p>Four Fallen Crusaders are hexbound to the gate for protection. They have a unique feature: they can sense belief in living creatures, and ask two questions to those who approach. The first question is: “Who dost thou believe in?” The answer must be specifically “The Lord that died for our sins,” and one must mean it. The bound undead can sense any lie. The second question is: “Wherefore is thy cross crimson?” The answer must be specifically “The Lord bled for this.”</p><p>The vault is a 60 x 60 foot room with a 60-foot high ceiling, designed as a cube. Inside, there are fourteen chests that fill all three sides of the vault. All chests are large. Except for the one with the theta letter from the Greek alphabet, all other thirteen chests are actually <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">mimics</span><span class=\"dot-sup color1\">j</span>.</p><p>The marked chest has a lock on it (DC 20) and contains the following items: <span class=\"italic\">sundial of Alexandria, rod of the seeker, lantern of otherworldly ward, judge’s hammer, crusader armor, five 3rd-level spell scrolls, eight 2nd-level spell scrolls</span>, ten 1st-level spell scrolls, and a special item called the <span class=\"bold ha-dark-blue-note\">Holy Grail</span>. It is not the one in legends, but it has magical properties and is a powerful item for the order.</p><div class=\"box-item very-rare\"><div><p class=\"title justify-with-last-centered ha-red\">Holy Grail</p><p class=\"subtitle\">Wondrous item, very rare</p></div><div><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">A grail made of clay that seems ordinary but has wonders hidden in it.

With faith as his guardian, his power is unmatched. A fortune-teller in the city of Cairo gazes through the skies under the scorching sun and reads the tides of fate among the scattered clouds. A Mamluk stands ready at the towers of Damascus, ever watchful against the Crusader forces, facing the dreadful winds flying to the south and ready to face every danger that may stand in his way. A pilgrim and a traveler share bread and the dangers of the road together.</p><p>“Magick took her name and original form from Persia,” wrote John Baptista Porta in his Natural Magick (originally <span class=\"italic\">Magia Naturalis</span>, 1558 CE. The English translation is dated 1658 CE). “A magician is nothing else but one that expounds and studies divine things.”</p><p>In the world of Historica Arcanum, humankind discovered the power of magic in ancient times, through many different methods of channeling: chanting, dancing, rituals, prayers, battlecries, potions, and more. The unnatural power they possessed was rare, wild, and dangerous, as it broke the laws of reality.</p><p>No human knows the true origin of these abilities that can break apart reality, but it is known that, through practice, some <span class=\"italic\">words</span>, <span class=\"italic\">movements</span>, and <span class=\"italic\">materials</span> trigger the power. The raw talent of the practitioners from ancient civilizations slowly turned and diversified into the enlightened magicians, able priests and powerful sorcerers who developed methods of their own.</p><p>Yet one thing has remained constant: reality does not take kindly to those who break its rules. Time and space will expunge the effects of arcane powers either through “coincidences,” or, in more severe instances, collapsing the spells back on the arcanists, and even onto innocent bystanders in the proximity of the spellslingers. Beyond superstition, this is the reason why magic is forbidden in many cultures, and why species and races that carry the taint of magic are distrusted. Once you are involved in magic, reality will take its vengeance, one way or another.</p></div>"

On a successful save, nothing happens, and the character cannot trigger the same Spell Rebound until it finishes a long rest (A creature that fails can trigger the effects again). If it can trigger it by another means, the trigger will happen again. For example, a 5th level wizard casting a <span class=\"italic\">fireball</span> triggers the spell rebound.

For example, mystic arcanum of a warlock, divine smite (3rd level or higher) of a paladin.</li><li>Some vague but apparently magical features require the caster to succeed a Constitution saving throw. The DC is equal to caster level’s + its proficiency bonus. On a failed save, it causes a trigger.

Spellcasters can only be found if one knows where to look, eldritch creatures and non-humans are an even rarer sight, and objects with arcane properties are extremely hard to come by. However, in the cases of Jerusalem and Cairo, these cities hold many secrets, both arcane and divine, hidden in their dark alleys and underground places.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Magic is hidden.</p></td><td><p>Spellcasters, magical monsters, and arcane humanoid species exist throughout the Holy Lands, but they keep a very low profile - especially if they are sentient. In discreet districts of large cities and remote villages within the wilderness, humanoid species can be found - if you know what to look for. In Jerusalem, they often conceal their identities by wearing heavy armor or clerical robes. Cairo, with its wide and overcrowded streets and bazaars, provides ample opportunities for them to move about stealthily.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Magic is punishing.</p></td><td><p>Magic means breaking reality. It is a dangerous life, where the Vengeful Reality pushes back against the arcanists, by setting up traps disguised as coincidences, and most importantly, by rebounding the spells.</p><p>All magic users and arcane researchers are aware that spell rebound is real, and the cost of spellcasting can be harsh, even deadly.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Magic hunts Magic.</p></td><td><p>For the few that already exist behind the arcane veil, the Vengeful Reality ensures their doom by entangling them in the lives of others like them - curious coincidences, unfortunate accidents, or paranoid encounters. Once one is marked for death, they will keep stumbling upon eldritch creatures, spellcasters, or abhumans - and in such a dangerous world, these encounters always carry deadly consequences.</p><p>Only the very cautious, or the talented can hope to survive, for Lady Luck seems never to be on the side of the marked.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Divine matters are unknown.</p></td><td><p>Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs. One’s ability to harness divine power doesn’t have to prove or refute a religion or belief. Spellcasting may be achieved through faith, but magical prowess is primarily a result of one’s studies, mindset, and the power that lies within them. Believers from various faiths and religions can demonstrate remarkable feats in spellcasting, and many indeed believe that this is a reward for their faith.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Monsters are hidden or dwell among the common folk.</p></td><td><p>Monsters hide in the wilderness or disguise themselves in dark corners using their shape-changing abilities, spellcasting, or other talents. Some lurk under your beds, dwell within your stories, or scheme for a bloody hunt, or political power through sinister means.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><img style=\"margin-top:-100px\" src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/thiefling-spread-fin.webp\" /><h2>Non-Human Races</h2><p>As magic plays a vital role in the world of Historica Arcanum, non-human races hold significant importance. Players can select a non-human race for their characters, and they may also encounter NPCs from these races. The purpose of this table is to provide guidance for blending in within a city, town, or caravanserai, and to assist the GM in creating non-human NPCs, societies, and interconnected ideas that encompass the realm of non-human races.</p><h3>How to Disguise?</h3><table class=\"color-red\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Elf / Half-elf</p></td><td><p>Usually, concealing their ears is sufficient, but some of them resort to using makeup and similar substances to avoid drawing the attention of common folk.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dwarf</p></td><td><p>Dwarves are generally perceived as shorter individuals by common folk, making it easy for them to blend in. They are encountered more frequently than other non-human races, and most of the time, there's no need for them to disguise themselves.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Halfling</p></td><td><p>Halflings typically present themselves as children among the common folk, or by behaving like exceptionally short humans who were born that way. They don’t raise suspicion or fear, unlike a tiefling or an orc might. One thing they excel at is going unnoticed by taller individuals.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Orc /</p><p>Half-orc</p></td><td><p>Orcs who don't make an effort to move stealthily through a bustling city may encounter difficulties due to their distinctive features, such as tusks and fangs. They often conceal these attributes by wearing heavy cloaks and garments that obscure their appearance. It's not uncommon for orcs to hide their faces, as it helps them blend in with the human-dominated populace. Half-orcs, on the other hand, might find it easier to go unnoticed than their full-blooded counterparts, as their fangs are typically less prominent.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gnome</p></td><td><p>Like halflings, gnomes excel at sneaking around. While their facial features are more obviously 'non-human' than halflings, they rely on their talents and arts as a means of distraction. Their access to innate spells like illusions makes this easier for them. Additionally, if their illusions fail, they might pretend to be afflicted by a disease to divert suspicion. However, a failed disguise can arouse suspicion and subject them to the supernatural fears of common folk.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dragonborn<span class=\"dot-sup flower ha-red\">F</span></p></td><td><p>Dragonborns, with their scaly, dragon-like skin, require more extensive means of concealment than any other race. They heavily rely on masks, cloaks, and magical items to disguise themselves, often posing as individuals suffering from a skin disease to avoid drawing attention. Additionally, the GM may allow a dragonborn character to begin with the <span class=\"bold\">Amulet of Adam and Eve</span>, a powerful magical item that offers a range of beneficial effects. If a disguise fails, common folk may perceive a dragonborn as a monster or a threat.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tiefling</p></td><td><p>The tails and colorful skin of a tiefling can arouse suspicion and supernatural fear among the common people of the Holy Lands. Consequently, tieflings often take great care to disguise themselves effectively. Additionally, the GM may permit a tiefling character to begin with the <span class=\"bold\">Amulet of Adam and Eve</span>. If a disguise fails, tieflings may encounter hostility from common folk due to their resemblance to devils in folktales and urban legends.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class=\"flower ha-red\">F</span><span class=\"italic\">A GM could allow a character to play a dragonborn with a more human appearance, featuring scales on their body but a human-like face.</span></p><div class=\"box-item uncommon\"><div><p class=\"title\">Amulet of Adam and Eve</p></div><div><p class=\"subtitle\">Wondrous item, uncommon, requires attunement</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered\">While attuned to and wearing this amulet, a humanoid belonging to a non-human race will appear outwardly human without altering their general appearance features.

Most districts have signs here and there in Thieves’ Cant to explain the situation.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Secluded Settlements in Wilderness</p></td><td><p>Certain forests, deserts, valleys, and coastal areas provide secluded and hidden locations where many non-humans seek refuge to lead peaceful lives away from the cities. To deceive tax collectors and other officials, humans may reside among them and dabble in the arcane arts.

Again, the difficulty is not lower than 10.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Notes on Religions &amp; Divine Powers</h2><p>Within the Historica Arcanum Universe, real-world religions manifest in every corner of the Holy Lands. Abundant mosques, churches, synagogues, pagan shrines, ancient temples, and sacred sites are strewn across this realm. Faith constitutes a commonplace aspect of most individuals’ lives, occupying a significant position within their culture and psyche. Some individuals profess that their abilities stem from their convictions, pledges, deities, gods, beings, and benefactors. The landscape is populated with individuals assuming titles like clerics, druids, rangers, and paladins. Additionally, there exist warlocks who assert that their power flows through a pact with entities beyond this world.</p><p>All of these are true. They genuinely <span class=\"italic\">believe</span> that their power comes from a higher or deeper place, and they have strong proof through their achievement of amazing and unbelievable feats before your eyes. This raises the question: are religions <span class=\"italic\">real</span>?</p><p>Answers pertaining to the existence or nature of higher powers in the Historica Arcanum universe are inherently unknowable. Such beliefs are personal matters, influenced by one's individual faith, values, and spirituality. Magical and divine powers are not conclusive evidence of the existence or superiority of any particular deity or higher power.</p><p>For instance, a Muslim cleric might assert that their God, Allah, is the only true deity, yet they could witness another cleric from Kyoto harnessing similar powers in the name of Izanami. In the Historica Arcanum universe, divine powers are believed to be a consequence of an individual's devotion, hard work, prayer, and willpower.</p><p>When it comes to warlocks and their patrons, the matter is quite different. While the existence of divine beings like God, Zeus, Leviathan, Ishtar, or Osiris may be a matter of belief, demons, fey creatures, aberrations, celestials, djinns, and elementals are widely accepted as existing in the world. Warlocks typically form pacts with these beings, which are often of a lesser power than the divine beings mentioned previously. For example, they may make a pact with a specific succubus, a greater djinn, or a hag, depending on the nature of their powers and the terms of their agreement.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered font-size-x1.5 bold\">A Pantheon</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">Most TTRPGs, and especially 5th Edition, include pantheons for clerics, paladins, rangers or druids.

              "text": "<div id=\"ha-eotc\"><p class=\"h1 ha-red\">The People of the Holy Lands</p><p>The people living in the Holy Lands can be categorized into these: The Levantines, Eastern Christians, Eastern Crusaders, and Western Crusaders.</p><p>Levantines represent the local Arabs, Turks, and other minorities that live under the rule of Saladin. However, many Muslims may come from far lands to fight against the Crusaders. For example, they can be Seljuks, Khwarazmians, or even Indians. Most of the Muslim characters fall into this category, such as Saladin, Ismail al-Jazari, and more.</p><p>Eastern Christians represent the locals that lived here and had roots in the Holy Lands before the Crusades. Mostly, Greeks, Armenians, Copts and others fall into this category.</p><p>Eastern Crusaders represent the descendants of the First Crusaders that settled in Jerusalem and had a mixed culture of the West and the East. Usually second or third generations of Christians fall into this category, such as King Baldwin IV, Princess Sybilla, and Raynald of Chatillon.</p><p>Western Crusaders represent the warriors, priests, pilgrims and others that were born in Europe and came to Holy Lands in recent years. Characters like Guy of Lusignan fall into this category.</p><h2>The People of the Levant</h2><p>Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Dimashq, Konya, Baghdad… The people from Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt and Anatolia are of mostly Turkish, Arabic, Persian, or Kurdish descent. Syria and Egypt are under the control of a new rising dynasty: The Ayyubids.</p><p>Usually, the names appear like this throughout the Levantine lands:</p><p><span class=\"ha-red bold\">Masculine Names:</span> Mehmet, Muhammad, Ahmet, Hasan, Rıza, Halil, İbrahim, Selim, Mahmut, Aziz, Mustafa, Şevket, Emin, İsmail, Yusuf, Musa, Ali, Hüseyin, Ziya, Adem, Akif, Bahri, Bashir, Fuad, Haldun, Hamza, Jubayr, Kadir, Labib, Muhsin, Nusret, Omar, Shakir, Talal, Zafer</p><p><span class=\"ha-red bold\">Feminine Names:</span> Ayşe, Hatice, Behiye, Cemile, Dilşad, Hacer, Mihrimah, Mediha, Naciye, Şerife, Fatma, Berhayat, Nesrin, Nergiz, Emine, Esma, Fehime, Gülüstü, Elif, Ayla, Nur, Amina, Bushra, Dina, Esma, Farida, Hafsa, Nafisa, Nayla, Rabia, Sabiha, Yasmin, Zehra</p><p>Surnames were not common among the folk; they were usually identified with their birth place or a nickname that was earned:</p><p><span class=\"ha-red bold\">Place Names:</span> Al-Jazari, Al-Baghdadi, Al-Sham, Al-Rumi, Al-Isfahani, Al-Qudsi, Al-Halabi</p><p><span class=\"ha-red bold\">Nicknames:</span> Sayf ad-Din (Sword of the Faith), Nur ad-Din (Light of the Faith), Abadi (Eternal), Hakim (Wise), Abd al Haq (Servant of the Truth), Abd al Latif (Servant of the Kind), Sabah ad-Din (Dawn of the Faith), Ghazi (Warrior, The one that fights for the glory of Islam), Al-Ghalib (Victor), Al-Muzaffar (The Victorious), Jalal ad-Din (Glory of the Faith)</p><h3>Common Folk of the Levant</h3><p>Most of the common folk of the Levant are of Turkish, Arabic, Persian and Kurdish origin. The concept of “ümmet (ummah)” binds them together and mostly unites their cultures as one. Of course, many cities have their own flavor and differences from the others, but the ones that are controlled by the Seljuks or Ayyubids share many similarities. Thus, the common folk have certain aspects in common.</p><ul class=\"flower-mark red\"><li>The usual languages are Arabic, Turkish, Persian and Kurdish. Most of the common folk know Arabic and Turkish. Turkish is especially common among the military and Arabic in scientific or artistic circles and highborns. Persian is mostly used in bureaucracy, governing business and especially in poetry.</li><li>They are weary due to the Crusades. It is a time of troubles, and since the Zengis (The most notable Noble lineage) took power in the area, the fight against the Crusaders has accelerated, and this has cost the common folk mostly. They pay taxes and are raised as levies by nobles and commanders of the area. However, they are devoted to Saladin and his campaign, as most of them want to see the Kingdom of Jerusalem defeated and the Holy City reconquered.</li><li>Almost all do not know about the real magic of the world. Their aspect is limited by folktales, urban legends, stories, and superstitions. Most Muslims believe in the existence of the Djinnkind due to religious texts and oral tradition.</li><li>They live closely with the Crusaders and Eastern Christians. Not all relations are hostile. In the past, the Holy Lands have seen many alliances between Muslims and Crusaders that fought against other Muslim and Crusader alliances. Such an example happened in 1108: Tancred, the Prince of Galilee, and Rıdvan of Aleppo made an alliance against Baldwin II and Jawali of Mosul, an infamous Muslim commander and governor.</li></ul><h3>Military of the Ayyubids</h3><p>The army of Saladin consists of three main parts: levies, Mamluks, and Turkomans. Mamluks and the Turkomans are the main and most effective sources of power.</p><table class=\"color-red\"><tbody><tr><td><p><span class=\"bold\">Seasonal levies</span></p></td><td><p>Levies represent the seasonal warriors who are either volunteers to participate in the conquest of Jerusalem or the ones raised by noble emirs and beys.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class=\"bold\">Mamluks</span></p></td><td><p>Mamluk refers to a soldier who was once a captive or a slave but was granted freedom in exchange for joining the army. They receive excellent military training, and, as free men, they are able to marry, own land, and even become heirs to their masters. It is mostly derived from the Ghilman system of earlier caliphs. Mamluks eventually gained much more influence due to their military effectiveness. In the future, they established the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class=\"bold\">Turkoman Soldiers</span></p></td><td><p>The nomadic Turks that continue to live and fight like the people of the Eurasian steppes. Many Turkoman tribes lived in the borders of hostile countries and raided the lands. They rely on their mobility and their expertise on horseback archery to overwhelm and defeat the enemies. They mostly serve as vanguards, scouts, and cavalry for the Sultan’s army. They are mostly lightly armored and heavily trusting their mobilization.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Highborn of the Levant</h3><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">The nobility is ephemeral in the Muslim society. Ranks, lands, and castles could easily be gained and lost, as they usually relied on the relations with the Sultans and greater governors. Military successes, scholarly progress, serving the state and similar activities could make a man a noble, but failure, disobedience, strife and discord with the sultan could result in losing all titles and lands. “Noble families that last hundreds of years” as seen in the West are not that common in the Muslim lands.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">“Emir” is the given name to the lords and commanders.</p></div><p>Most of the nobles in the Levant are of Arabic and Turkic descent, usually assigned by the Great Seljuk Sultans and earlier bloodlines descended through the Umayyad and Abbasid emirs. They are mostly tasked with raising armies and organizing the fight against the Crusaders and defending their lands and trade routes from possible enemies.</p><ul class=\"flower-mark red\"><li>Most emirs have military characteristics due to ongoing wars: The Crusades, power strife between the Sultanate of Rum and the Great Seljuk Empire, and other conflicts. An emir is expected to know how to command an army and train the levies well. A good portion of them may have fighting abilities themselves.</li><li>They are mostly literate and educated. They know many languages due to the multicultural milieu of the area. Most of the emirs have an occupation at their disposal, such as being a poet, woodcarving, goldsmithing, blacksmithing, philosophy, or the like.</li><li>Some of them may be a witness to actual magic in the game. They may possess a magical weapon, an heirloom from their families, magical loot that was gained by plundering, or a similar item. They may be in pursuit of the arcane themselves and have an advisor that also possesses some arcane abilities, especially skilled with divination and augury.</li><li>Some emirs trust Saladin entirely and support him to the fullest. However, due to envy or the earlier failures of the Sultan, some emirs developed an enmity towards the Sultan and are showing open signs of displeasure and are putting a pressure on him to conquer Jerusalem. Some are sincere emirs that want to see Jerusalem conquered, while others want to see him fail and gain power themselves.</li></ul><img style=\"margin-top:-120px\" src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/ring3-4.webp\" /><h3>The Titles of the Land</h3><table class=\"first-bold color-red\"><thead><tr><td><p>Title</p></td><td><p>Meaning</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Sultan</p></td><td><p>An Arabic word coming from “to rule,” Sultan means “the one who has sovereignty.” The Caliph blesses the sultans so that they can rule their country.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Emir</p></td><td><p>Equivalent to feudal lords, it comes from the Arabic word “to command.”</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tegin</p></td><td><p>The Turkish equivalent of “prince.” It is usually used as a nickname among the highborn of Turks to denote nobility.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Beg/Bey</p></td><td><p>Equivalent to lords in nomadic cultures, mostly the leaders of Turkomans.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Atabeg</p></td><td><p>Another word for nobles. It actually means “Father Beg/Older Beg” but is used to represent the teachers of the nobles, princes, and other highborn children. It represents a lesser nobility.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Malik/Melik</p></td><td><p>Persian equivalent of “prince” and currently used by Muslim rulers, heirs and similar highborns, relatives of sultans, and their family.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hatun/Khatun</p></td><td><p>Hatun was the wife of a Khan/Khagan. It now means “woman of higher importance” in Muslim lands. Concubines, sisters, and relatives of the Sultan may hold this title.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hodja</p></td><td><p>Hodja actually means “teacher” but has a religious understanding during the time period of this game. Usually imams and other religious figures are called hodja.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Imam</p></td><td><p>The priests in mosques. They are respected among society. They conduct the prayers, teach the local kids how to read, and guide the people spiritually.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>What Did They Wear?</h3><table class=\"color-red\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Hijab</p></td><td><p>A usually religious headwear. Peasant women living in the outskirts of big cities usually wear a non-religious and more colorful head attire to protect their hair from sun and dirt.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sarik</p></td><td><p>Many officials, merchants, and other members of society wear sariks as headwear. A sarik is made up of several pieces of cloth wrapped around the head, and its color can signify different aspects of society. For example, white sariks are commonly worn by the clergy.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Shalvar</p></td><td><p>The long-legged traditional clothing is preferred by both men and women. It is baggy and long.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Turban</p></td><td><p>Traditional headwear of the middle and upper classes. There are many colors and types, often used for a sense of fashion.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Veil (Peche)</p></td><td><p>Many women preferred transparent veils when going out. This traditional outfit holds an important place in Turkish culture. Many different colors and types were preferred by the women.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>The People of Jerusalem</h2><p>The protectors of the Holy Sepulchre stood strong in the holiest of cities, and for a hundred years they ruled and defended the city with all their might. Either descendents of the First Crusaders or newcomer Crusaders, the people of Jerusalem face a great threat to their very existence.</p><p><span class=\"ha-red bold\">Names usually appear like this throughout the land:</span></p><table class=\"color-red\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Masculine names</p></td><td><p>Gerard, Giovanni, Albert, Guy, Raymond, Guiseppe, Bartholomew, Archibald, Robert, Thomas, Alaric, Balthazar, Conrad, Otto, Baldwin, Arthur, Henry, John, Richard.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Feminine names</p></td><td><p>Anna, Emma, Joan, Eleanor, Hildegard, Alice, Ursula, Mary, Abigail, Euphemia, Beatrice, Elizabeth, Margaret, Celestina, Valentina, Paola, Cristina, Sofia, Rosa, Caterina.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Eastern Christians</h3><p>After the capture of the city in 638 CE by Caliph Umar, the Jewish population were let into the city once again, and all three of the Abrahamic religions once again coexisted in the Holiest City. Umar made a treaty with the Patriarch, and the Christians were also allowed to live peacefully inside the walls. Patriarch Sophronius invited the Caliph to pray inside the church, but Umar declined so as not to set a precedent and thereby endanger the church’s status as a Christian site. Instead he prayed outside, on the steps east of the church.</p><p>The peaceful coexistence crumbled into dust when Jerusalem was conquered in the First Crusade.</p><p>When the First Crusaders took the city, it is said that their massacres were considered extreme even by medieval standards. Muslim holy sites were converted into Christians ones, and the very few Non-Christians that survived the bloodshed were expelled from the city. Many sources speak of Eastern Christians living in the City following the conquest, so they are considered to be relatively untouched by the Crusaders.</p><ul class=\"flower-mark red\"><li>They are mostly of Greek, Armenian, Coptic, and African descent. They are mostly Christians and follow the Eastern churches such as Eastern Orthodox Church or Coptic Orthodox Church.</li><li>They have had roots in the Holy Lands for a very long time. Most of their ancestors lived closeby or right in the heart of the Holy Lands. They know the area, its history and legends better than most. A good portion of them that live in the cities are literate.</li><li>They have a settled culture and usually are occupied with trade, all kinds of crafts and artisanships, husbandry, agriculture, and similar jobs. Since the advent of the Crusades, the Western Christians needed them as soldiers as well due to the failure of the 1101 Crusade and the Second Crusade.</li><li>Some of the ancient families (although not need to be nobles) are aware of the arcane matters, but most of them stay out of it. Some of the cities’ mages and divine spellcasters are among them.</li></ul><h3>Eastern Crusaders</h3><p>The followers of the True Cross stand proud in the hills where Jesus of Nazareth was believed to have ascended to heaven in the first half of the Common Era. They are the descendents of those who have reconquered this city from the hands of Muslims, and it is now their duty to protect the Kingdom of God.</p><ul class=\"flower-mark red\"><li>They mostly originate from Europe and are the followers of the Roman Catholic church. Most are of French, German and Italian origin and speak Latin, French, Italian and German.</li><li>They are the majority in Jerusalem and serve as soldiers, priests, monks, guards, blacksmiths, stablemen, armorers, knights, butchers, cavalry, and more.</li><li>Highborns are especially educated in Latin and Greek. Latin is important for religious rituals, and Greek is seen as important in philosophy and similar pursuits.</li><li>They have better relations with the locals of the lands, both Levantines and Eastern Christians. Most of the people are focused on protecting their kingdom and living in prosperity. Most trust their king, Baldwin, more than anyone else. However, his disease has had a major negative impact on the city, and the residents are in fear for their lives. They want to see a suitable heir to the throne.</li><li>Their daily lives have traces from both Muslim and Eastern Christian societies. Due to their differences over time, the local Eastern Crusaders sometimes struggle to get along with the Western Crusaders.</li><li>There may be arcane researchers and pupils among them, but most of them have never met with actual magic in our game. Mostly, urban legends and folktales are spread among them.</li></ul><h3>Western Crusaders</h3><p>The calling of the Holy War has never been stronger. Brave and foolhardy hearts in Europe set sail to the Holy Lands and hone the yearning in their hearts to see the Holy Lands and fulfill their destiny. They strengthen the lines of the kingdom against the Saracens and bring tidings from Europe.</p><ul class=\"flower-mark red\"><li>There are many knights, warriors, exiles, runaways, pilgrims, and wanderers among them.</li><li>Some of them sincerely joined this Crusade to defend Jerusalem against Muslims. However, there are many who pursue personal glory and other ulterior motives. Some failed to gain power and seek it in the Holy Lands. Some are running away from their families to start new lives. Others seek the wealth of the eastern lands, and some try to make a name for themselves.</li><li>There may be followers of the arcane business, some trying to find out the legends concerning the Holy Lands and see for themselves. However, few of them actually are aware of the arcane reality of the world.</li><li>Most of them are of European origin. Most speak French, Italian, English, and German.</li><li>Almost all of them are Roman Catholics.</li><li>They have trouble adjusting to local culture and living with different religions. Some of the warriors are seen as warmongers, vicious soldiers and stubborn individuals. A really good portion of them support military means and armed conflict against the Muslims. This creates a strife between the locals.</li><li>Some of them don’t feel like home here and regard this kingdom as a means of their divine duty or an extension of their loyalty to the kingdom. Their goal is to see the Muslims are defeated and the Kingdom of Jerusalem is put to safety. Others see the Holy Lands as a new home and want to be a part of it.</li></ul><h3>Nobles of Jerusalem</h3><p>Highborns of the Holy City are the ruling class in Jerusalem, and they decide the fate of the kingdom. Most of them are stationed in their own lands, castles and fields to protect the people and the realm. Some share similar traits:</p><ul class=\"flower-mark red\"><li>Most of them are proficient with heavy armor in case of war and emergency and one martial weapon, possibly longsword. They are used to the constant fighting and wars; thus, many have experience in commanding armies.</li><li>Almost all of them know several languages, including Arabic or Turkish, to be able to communicate with the minorities in their lands. They also learn Latin due to religious reasons.</li><li>Some of them are aware of the arcane matters and have appropriate means to access it, such as a mage servant or an advisor, a magical item found as loot, or tomes on magical lore of the world.</li><li>Some even know about where the non-human communities dwell and let them be. Some try to recruit them in secret business and arcane matters.</li></ul><h3>The Titles of the Land</h3><table class=\"first-bold color-red\"><thead><tr><td><p>Title</p></td><td><p>Meanıng</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri</p></td><td><p>Advocate of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

Many Jews that were captured from the Dome of the Rock were taken prisoners and were deported to Apulia. Most of the remaining were slain during the first siege and only a very small and hidden number of them remained in Jerusalem. Others were expelled and settled throughout the Levant.</p><ul class=\"flower-mark red\"><li>They are devoted to their religion and even practice it in hard times. If necessary, they practiced their religion while hiding from the governing factions.</li><li>They suffered from the Crusades harshly, and this made the communities deeply resentful of the Crusader factions. On the other hand, the relationship between the Jewish population and Muslim authorities has become considerably stronger.</li></ul></div>"

              "text": "<div id=\"ha-eotc\"><p class=\"h1 ha-red\">Religious Strife</p><p>A very complicated topic, but it is important to address the main conflicts in the area. First one can be considered the elephant in the room: The war between the Muslim countries and the Christian ones. It is not the only religious conflict in the lands, as each religion has its own sects that are in conflict. It may be useful to know the main differences of the sects.</p><h2>Christians: Great Schism</h2><p>In 1054 CE, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church parted ways, and this enmity is seen throughout the Crusades, even as the Pope agreed to help the Byzantine Empire against the invading Turks.</p><p>Both the warriors in People’s Crusades and the greater First Crusade’s army pillaged lands of the Byzantine Empire, causing great distress to the seat of the Orthodox Patriarch in Constantinople. The rift between the two peoples of the same faith has even resulted in infighting in the Crusaders’ ranks.</p><p>Witnessing the devastation that the Crusaders caused, Byzantine Basileos Alexios took it upon himself to make sure warriors from the West reached the Muslim lands as fast as possible.</p><p>During the Second Crusade, the Byzantines even fought against the armies of Conrad III, the Holy Roman Emperor, in the outskirts of Constantinople to evict the Crusaders from their lands. It is rumored that the Byzantines secretly supported the Sultanate of Rum against the marching Crusaders. Emperor Manuel and Sultan Mesud even signed a peace treaty and ended attacks on each other, resulting in a massive loss of trust between Byzantines and the Crusaders.</p><p>Ultimately, years after the events in this game (in 1204 CE) this enmity reached its peak when the city of Constantinople was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade. The Byzantine Throne, who first called for a Crusade, ended up being destroyed by the Holy War they initiated.</p><h2>Muslims: Schism Between Sunni &amp; Shia Sects</h2><p>The strife in united Islam began in 656 CE, when the Caliph Uthman was killed. The schism brought Ali and Muawiya, favored candidates for the seat of Caliphate, against each other. Supporters of Ali were known as Shiites; they did not accept the Caliphate of Muawiya, and they proclaimed their own Caliphate eventually, known as the Fatimid Caliphate.</p><p>Muawiya and his supporters, known as the Sunnis, won the civil war between the two sects, establishing the Umayyad Caliphate. Umayyads were out-throned by the Abbasids, and Abbasids eventually lost their influence but managed to remain important as they continued to rule in Baghdad. Their influence was limited and mostly the Sultanates that originate from Nomadic Central Asia ruled the Islamic world in their stead.</p><img style=\"shape-outside:url(modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/wallofswords3.webp);float:left\" src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/wallofswords3.webp\" /><p>In 1099 CE, the Fatimid soldiers were the ones that defended Jerusalem from the Crusaders’ siege. Following the fall of Jerusalem, the Fatimid Dynasty ruled in Egypt until Saladin’s rise to power. Saladin ended up swearing loyalty to the Sunni Caliphate in Baghdad, thus ending the influence of Shia.</p></div>"

Unpredictable and unfortunate events may happen to the adventurers other than getting hurt, such as dealing with too much stress, suffering the tragedy of a lost one, witnessing an otherworldly entity that devours mortal lives, or uncovering horrible truths. These situations may create scenarios where hit points and the like are not enough to represent them mechanically.</p><p>5th edition offers some alternate ways for these scenarios, such as Sanity ability scores and Madness Tables tied to them; however, they are mostly tied to alien contact and psychic damage, and we wanted to create new mechanics for enduring the stress caused during adventuring.</p><h2>How can you receive stress?</h2><p>Stress may be caused in three ways in this system: During combat, dealing with arcane mysteries, or through grim events that happen outside of combat that we call tragedy.</p><p>During <span class=\"ha-red bold\">combat</span>, an adventuring party may witness many occasions that can cause stress to one or all members of the party: death of a party member, extreme and permanent injuries, being defeated and cornered by an enemy, and so forth.</p><p><span class=\"ha-red bold\">Arcane</span> horrors may cause extreme stress, even to those who are attuned to magic, in such events like: Contacting otherworldly creatures for the first time, discovering horrible truths on arcane matters, sustaining mind-altering effects, witnessing excessive magic used in a less-than-savory way, and many other cataclysmic supernatural occurrences.</p><p><span class=\"ha-red bold\">Tragic</span> events may break even the most heartless. Suffering the loss of a family member, witnessing the fall of the city they grew up in, treachery by a beloved, trusted individual or an organization, dissolving the adventuring party, watching a friend walk away for good, scenes of merciless savagery, and other quite distasteful situations are all incidents that may cause lasting changes.</p><p>When such an event happens, follow the rules below and apply the written instructions. If some situations coincide in more than one category it is up to the Game Master to decide which category to apply.</p><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">If you have the card deck called<span class=\"bold\"> Deck of the Damned</span> instead of using the written section here, it is advised that a card from the deck is drawn when an event is triggered.

However, it is ultimately the Game Master’s duty to tailor the triggers to the feeling of the setting.</p></div><h2>General Rules</h2><ul class=\"flower-mark red\"><li>Severity I category usually deals with DC 12 saving throws.</li><li>Severity II category usually deals with DC 14 saving throws.</li><li>Severity III category usually deals with DC 16 saving throws.</li><li>Events usually contain negative outcomes for the adventurers and in times of success, the possibility of the negative is countered by a chance of smaller positive effect.</li><li>The GM always has the final say on the mechanics and role-playing effects.</li></ul></div>"

The Profession System is aimed at giving players opportunities to enrich their downtimes, backgrounds, non-combat activities, explorations, daily goals and occupations, and their characters out of adventure days.</p><p>Characters can take up the path of a Profession between Levels 1-3 and have access to Apprentice levels of the Professions if they meet the prerequisite for the intended profession. It is recommended that players should take at least 2 weeks of downtime to begin a Profession. It is not advised for characters to have more than one profession, as the system is not designed for multi-professions. However, at the GM’s discretion, players may take suitable perks from other professions if needed. If a character wants to start a Profession at later levels, GM may let them start with more Profession Experience (PEX) depending on the earlier experiences of the adventurer.</p><p>PEX is the main way of progressing through the Ranks and gaining new abilities. Most of the Professions explain how to gain PEX. For example, the very first Profession designed by us – The Bounty Hunter in <span class=\"ha-red bold\">The City of Crescent</span> – gains PEX through collecting bounties, and it is scaled with Challenge Ratings of said bounties.</p><p>To improve ranks, a character must spend their PEX for the current rank’s abilities (usually at least two of them), and also reach the designated PEX for the next rank and expend the experience as well. It should be noted that the rank system does not work like 5th edition class leveling; you must spend your PEX in order to rank up.</p><p>There are 4 ranks for each profession: Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, and Master. Apprentice is the starting level, and there is no PEX needed to enter that profession, but investments should be made beforehand or the backstory of the character must fit the profession.</p><p>For Journeyman rank, you must spend at least a total 100 PEX on abilities and spend 300 PEX to reach the rank.</p><p>For Expert rank, you must spend at least a total of 200 PEX on abilities and spend 1,000 PEX to reach the rank.</p><p>For Master rank, you must spend at least a total 400 PEX on abilities and spend 5,000 PEX to reach the maximum rank.</p><p>When you spend enough PEX to reach the next rank, you can also purchase other abilities as well. In addition, you can purchase earlier abilities from lower ranks.</p><h2 class=\"ha-dark-red\">Earlier Professions</h2><p>In earlier books (<span class=\"ha-red bold\">The City of Crescent</span> and <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Empires of the Silk Road</span>), there are several professions: Grave Robber, Oracle, Herbalist, Tinker, Beast Tamer, Smuggler, Ecclesiastic, Merchant, Bounty Hunter, Antiquarian, Burglar, Alchemist, Archeologist, and Spy. Most of these professions can work for the Era of the Crusades as well, so it is recommended to examine those books for inspiration.</p><p>Earlier Professions did not have prerequisites; they are provided here:</p><table class=\"roll color-gold\"><thead><tr><td><p>ProfessIon</p></td><td><p>Prerequisites*</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Alchemist</p></td><td><p>Intelligence 13 | Arcana |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Antiquarian</p></td><td><p>Intelligence or Wisdom 13 | Insight |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Archeologist</p></td><td><p>Intelligence 13 | Survival or History |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Beast Tamer</p></td><td><p>Dexterity or Wisdom 13 | Animal Handling |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bounty Hunter</p></td><td><p>Dexterity or Strength 13 | One martial weapon |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Burglar</p></td><td><p>Dexterity 13 | Sleight of Hand or Stealth |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ecclesiastic</p></td><td><p>Wisdom or Charisma 13 | Religion or Persuasion |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Grave Robber</p></td><td><p>Dexterity 13 | Survival |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Merchant</p></td><td><p>Wisdom 13 | Medicine |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Oracle</p></td><td><p>Charisma 13 | Persuasion or Deception |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Smuggler</p></td><td><p>Wisdom 13 | Insight |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spy</p></td><td><p>Dexterity 13 | Stealth |</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tinker</p></td><td><p>Dexterity or Charisma 13 | Stealth or Deception |</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=\"ha-gold\">*Mentioned tools require proficiency, not having the actual tool.</p></div>"

The great pharaohs ruled among the Nile and marched into the North, West and South. The great general of Alexander, Ptolemy, remade this kingdom in a Hellenistic image and passed the torch to The Roman Empire, with stories we still remember two millennia into the future. With the rise of Islam, Egypt has been captured by Muslim armies and has been a strong bastion of power and a symbol of legitimacy for all those who ruled it. Even as the reign of this Ancient Land passed from one power to another, however, the land, the culture, and the people held the true power over whoever was sitting on the throne.

He rules with might, justice, and wisdom, as well as a burning ambition to unite the Caliphate and retake the lands lost to the Crusaders. With an avenging army and a string of brilliant victories, Saladin stands at the top of the Islamic world, with his plan in motion to be the sacred commander who takes back Jerusalem, fulfilling the destiny Caliph Omar left behind.</p></div>"

              "text": "<div id=\"ha-eotc\"><p class=\"h1 ha-red\">Culture</p><p>The Ayyubid Dynasty is in charge of Cairo. In recent years, Saladin seized control of the city and overthrew the Fatimid Dynasty. With Saladin’s rule, Cairo has become a luminous beacon of Islamic culture and learning, pulsing with the vigor of a great civilization. Under his wise and just rule, the city is flourishing as a center of scholarly pursuits and architectural wonders. The air is perfumed with the scent of papyrus and ink, hinting at the thriving scholarship within the walls of grand libraries, where scholars of every discipline gather, their debates and discoveries as lively as the bustling markets.</p><p>The streets of Cairo are alive with the hum of a city that is both a sanctuary for the arts and a stage for the everyday drama of its people. Saladin, known for his chivalry and tolerance, encourages an environment where different faiths and cultures coexist and learn from one another, blending their distinct hues into the city’s rich canvas.</p><p>In the heart of the city, the call to prayer mingles with the bells of Coptic churches, intertwining with the marketplace’s symphony of bartering voices, the clatter of artisans’ tools, and the sizzle of street food. These are the tastes of Cairo: a feast where sweet meets savory, and the abundance of the Nile nourishes a culinary tradition that is as varied as its people.</p><p>Celebrations in Saladin’s Cairo are jubilant and inclusive, featuring poetry recitals, musical performances, and public feasts that welcome all. Even in times of conflict, the city remains a haven where the pursuit of knowledge, the appreciation of the finer things, and the care for the community are paramount.</p><p>This is Cairo, a city with an indomitable spirit, a crossroads of commerce and culture, a crucible of historical legacies. Here, amidst the winding alleys and majestic minarets, Saladin’s vision for a prosperous and enlightened realm have taken root, creating a legacy that would echo through the ages.</p><h2>Religious Strife</h2><p>Cairo was under Shia rule during the reign of the Fatimid Dynasty. Many of the Shia gathered in Cairo as their seat of power after the schism that divided the Islamic world. However, the power shifted when Saladin seized control and declared allegiance to the Caliph in Baghdad, which resulted in a Sunni victory amidst the ongoing religious strife. This victory, however, would not be the end of Shia, as they established dynasties in the future.</p><p>The city hosts a large number of Muslims that follow the Shia sect and some of the locals are against the rule of Saladin due to the enmity of centuries. This schism is led by a local preacher named Bilal al-Shair, Bilal the Poet (Priest). He usually preaches against the Ayyubid Dynasty. Saladin himself ordered that he is to be left alone by the local law enforcement and wants every religion and creed to be free in his dominion. Bilal wants Cairo to be the seat of the Caliph who would adhere to the Shia teachings once again. Due to Saladin’s power and tolerance, he keeps a subtle tone and waits patiently for a mistake to be made by the Ayyubids. During Saladin’s absence due to war, he usually attempts to force Al-Adil to make a mistake by organizing large crowds.</p><h2>The Duality of the People of Cairo</h2><div class=\"box-information\"><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">The main difference between the populations of the city is explained in the <span class=\"bold\">@UUID[JournalEntry.i02FgpKAFAt5qbM8]{Running a Story in the Holy Lands} </span>section.</p></div><p>The people of Cairo fundamentally fall into two categories: those from a sedentary culture, and those from a nomadic one. Apart from the settled population of Cairo, there are many who live in the desert and embrace a life of migration. They are usually known as Bedouin, but there are many interesting cultures that can be found in and beyond the desert.</p><p>The nomadic lifestyle was a key cultural point in Arabic and Turkic history. After the spread of Islam, both Arabs and newly Islamized Turks transformed their way of living, embracing a sedentary lifestyle. However, there were many tribes, both Arabs and Turks and also native Africans, that preferred a style of living that was free and in line with nature, away from the urban areas, only stopping by for trade or warfare. It is through these people that Saladin, a legendary cavalry commander, recruits his most capable soldiers.</p><p>Turks hailing from Central Asia have started migrating westward in nomadic hordes. These people form the backbone of Saladin’s military campaigns - as well as a decent part of his bureaucracy, bringing with them the political and economic innovations of Persia and the Silk Road. The balance between nomadic culture and sedentism has always been important for the Turks in the past centuries, a state of affairs that the adoption of Islam has complicated. Their earlier religion, Tengrism, was born out of the nomadic lifestyle and was a useful belief system for people on the move. While some Turks maintain their nomadic way of life, some have been actively trying to embrace a more settled existence away from the barren landscape of the steppes. Settled life was not possible in Eurasian steppes, so they migrated to western lands and eventually came to Persia, the Caucasus, and Anatolia. As they adapted to a settled culture, they converted to Islam and, in time, established Great Sultanates. However, there are many Turkomans, Uyghurs, Kipchaks, Pechenegs, Khazars and many other tribes that still won’t leave their nomadic roots.</p><p>Nomadic culture was also important for Arabs and native Africans. Arab children were raised in the desert and taught its ways, which was believed to be healthier for the child for the first few years of his or her life. With the spread of Islam, Arabs changed, and the tribal view of the country evolved into the word “Ummah,” the unity. They built cities, adapted to the ways of the settled empires, and founded one for themselves, eventually reaching Egypt very quickly.</p><p>There are some important aspects to both cultures:</p><table class=\"color-red\"><thead><tr><td><p>Nomadıc Culture</p></td><td><p>Settled Culture</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Horses and camels are really important for individuals. They are needed in most scenarios: Traveling, settling in new places, migrating, running away from enemies, engaging in raids. The mounts give nomads freedom over the lands. Some families have two or three mounts for each person.</p></td><td><p>Sheep, goats, and similar herd animals may prove to be more central in people's lives than horses. Camels are, of course, used frequently, but it is unusual for a person to have more than one horse. They are not an essential part of one’s life.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Usually nomads are harshly trained to survive in the desert’s difficult conditions.

The copper color is in unity with the sun and the walls hail it with all the power held by Saladin. They seem impregnable and ward off all enemies of Saladin.</p></div><p>The Citadel is where Saladin lives and rules his sultanate. In his absence, his brother <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Al-Adil Saphadin (The @UUID[Actor.0ast70TWeCYniW4V]{Commander Emir}, Noble of Levant statblock, Lawful Neutral, INT 16) </span>rules in his stead. Al-Adil’s name means “the Just One,” and he lives up to the reputation. While Al-Adil rules Cairo, Saladin’s son and heir, <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Al-Afdal b. Salah ad-Din</span>, currently serves as the Emir of Damascus. He resides there with his grandmother <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Ismat ad-Din Khatun</span>, who considers Damascus as her homeland.</p><p>Al-Adil is known as “Sayf ad-Din,” <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Saphadin</span> to the Crusaders - meaning the Sword of Faith. He is an effective minister of war and has shown great administrative skills as one of the most reliable councilors and generals under the disposal of Saladin. The sultan only trusts Al-Adil to defend Egypt while he assembles his army for the final confrontation at Jerusalem. Al-Adil also secures the flow of supplies and men to Saladin’s campaigns, playing a key role.</p><p>The citadel is filled with special 100 Mamluk soldiers known as the “Sayf al-Jannah,” the Swords of Heaven. These specially trained soldiers receive their training in the desert under their infamous commander: <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Kalender Zaim (Mamluk Ghazi)</span>. Originally a man of African descent and a stern warrior, Kalender takes new recruits to the desert and sometimes only returns with but one-tenth of the recruits. Once a recruit survives, they are then introduced to the sultan with these words from Kalender: “They now have beards.”</p><p>The citadel is usually off-limits for anyone besides the royal family, the Mamluks, and those invited by the high-ranking members of the court. Al-Adil hosts guests in the main courtyard, in a lovely and open-roof building surrounded by flowers and delicious aroma.</p></div>"

The beautiful palace turned into a place for civil lawsuits, and similar businesses where qualified administrators, judges, and other civilian officers conduct their business.</p><p>The main official in the Pearl Palace is a just man known as “Tenzede Terazu” which can be translated as “The Silent Scales.” His real name is <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Abd-al-Hak Suleiman (@UUID[Actor.OksiTzyq7R5pinZR]{Warrior Priest of Levant}; can cast </span><span class=\"italic bold ha-red\">zone of truth</span><span class=\"ha-red bold\"> once a day without expending a spell slot)</span>. Suleiman is known for his absolute sense of justice and even the richest and most powerful man in the land respects his justice. He even has the right to convict the sultan if he deems it necessary. Many times Saladin talked about him as: “If he would deem that I would be sentenced to death today, I will go into the gallows without hesitation; my heart will be sure that he is correct.”</p><p>Suleiman has two servants that he freed years ago: a woman named Vera Nalan <span class=\"ha-red bold\">(@UUID[Actor.nW8Aj5aNHyswBvNs]{Traveling Artist})</span> and a young boy named Tariq Halis <span class=\"ha-red bold\">(@UUID[Actor.XiG03vgMTRXPTmh9]{Wilderness Commoner})</span>, both of whom have expertise in Insight and Perception checks and usually listen to the hearings and report any signs of lie, deception, and similar situations. They also can be used to investigate some cases with the local Mamluks.</p><h3>Old Eastern Palace</h3><div class=\"box-description\"><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">The clamorous sound of clashing metal and the tension of drawn bows resonate through the skies, creating a symphony of training Mamluks-to-be. Under the eternal blue sky, men’s voices echo, a chorus of determination and strength. They are engaged in rigorous training, day and night, honing their skills and fortitude. Each strike of the sword and release of an arrow is a testament to their tireless pursuit of mastery in combat. The atmosphere is charged with intensity and the relentless spirit of warriors preparing for battle, their shouts merging with the metallic symphony, crafting an ambiance of unyielding resilience and martial prowess.</p></div><p>The Old Eastern Palace has been transformed into the center of the city guard and their training. The chambers have been reorganized into living, training, and administrating quarters for Mamluk soldiers and their training. It is commanded by Ziya Babur, the commander of all Mamluk forces in Cairo and one of Saladin’s most trusted warriors, who is entrusted with the defense of his throne.</p><h4 class=\"ha-red\">Commander of the Mamluks: Ziya Babur (@UUID[Actor.zT88dyVK2LfpMcWF]{Mamluk Ghazi}, LN)</h4><p></p><img style=\"width:50%;margin-left:-60px;shape-outside:url(modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/ghulam-guard1-tek-renk2.webp);shape-margin:10px;margin-right:15px;float:left\" src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/ghulam-guard1-tek-renk2.webp\" /><p>Ziya Babur is a distinguished Mamluk officer, renowned for his leadership as the head of law enforcement in Cairo, and a resident at the Old Eastern Palace. With a commanding presence and a keen eye for detail, Ziya stands out not only for his tactical acumen but also for his genial nature. His early life was marked by a natural affinity for strategy and an unwavering sense of justice, traits that guided him on his path to becoming a revered figure in law enforcement.</p><p>From a young age, Ziya displayed a sharp mind at the local mosque and a charismatic personality among the young population of his village, endearing him to both peers and elders. His journey to prominence began when he was noticed by a Mamluk recruiter during a local event: a cruel officer forcibly wanted to take some children to be trained but Ziya stood in his way and volunteered to be taken instead of his other friends. The cruel officer wanted to make him pay due to his fierce personality, and when Ziya turned back, he swung an attack. Ziya, although not able to see, responded to the attack quickly and proved his tendency to fight. In terms of mechanics, he has the ability to sense his surroundings: blindsight (15 ft.).</p><p>Ziya’s tenure is characterized by his innovative approaches to maintaining order and solving crimes. He has a reputation for being fair but firm, earning him the respect and loyalty of his subordinates and the community. Known for his ability to defuse tense situations with humor and wisdom, Ziya has become a beloved figure in Cairo. His leadership style, marked by empathy and efficiency, has led to significant improvements in the city’s safety and orderliness.</p><p>Beyond his duties, Ziya is known for his love of Cairo’s rich culture and history. He often engages with the local populace, sharing stories and participating in community events, which further solidifies his status as a personable and approachable leader. His life is a testament to the balance between authority and humanity, making Ziya Babur an admired and enjoyable character in the fabric of Cairo’s society.</p><p>Ziya Babur has hundreds of warriors at his disposal and usually has full responsibility for addressing internal crimes and possible problems in the city. He has two subordinates, two <span class=\"ha-red bold\">@UUID[Actor.xgNOVmJC7PrjTZ7l]{Mamluk Cavalries}</span> named <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Nadim-lenk Halis (Neutral Good)</span> and <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Zayd b. Khalid (Lawful Neutral)</span>.</p><p>Nadim-lenk Halis is an elderly man and a war veteran. He was retired to “desk duty” when he suffered an injury from an arrow. A Hashashin’s poisoned arrow in Syria pierced his leg and left him crippled, earning him the epithet “-lenk,” which means limping. He usually protects the weak against the powerful and usually has enemies among local emirs and nobles. He looks past small crimes especially by the poor folk and is harsh about the tax-evaders.</p><p>Zayd is younger than Nadim and a strict officer in his duties. He does not look past crimes and believes in a just punishment system, even how harsh that may be. Zayd, although feared by the locals, has their respect due to not taking sides and being just in delivering punishments. Some folktales about him say that he even stood up to Saladin when he believed he was overlooking a crime. He has a loyal cavalry unit called <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Barq-Fursan </span>(all twenty members use the <span class=\"ha-red bold\">@UUID[Actor.FJUpeOJhezl3A3Un]{Mamluk Veteran}</span> statblock), roughly translated to Thunder-knights.

Quills and vials of ink are scattered liberally, a testament to the fervor of learning in Cairo. The gardens teem with eager students, their voices a melodious blend of debate and laughter. Scholars, masters in their crafts, hold court beneath the whispering trees, their words weaving through the cool breeze. The essence of Cairo, a city steeped in peace, prosperity, and a hunger for knowledge, permeates everything.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">There, bathed in sunlight, stands the Al-Azhar Mosque, its presence a beacon of enlightenment. In this sacred space, under Saladin’s benevolent gaze, education thrives, generously funded by the royal coffers. You notice a subtle diversity in the attire of the students. Here, beneath the towering minarets, all are united in their quest for knowledge. Status is transient, and only the currency of intellect and scientific achievement holds any true value in this bastion of equality and wisdom.</p></div><p>One of the oldest universities in Egypt, Al-Azhar Mosque was founded for both religious and scientific research. Throughout time, it evolved into a full-fledged university that could dwarf the House of Wisdom in favor of the Fatimid Caliphate, pushing the Shia Fatimids ahead of their rival, the Sunni Abbasids in Baghdad.</p><p>Al-Azhar University prospered in scientific pursuit. When Saladin came to power, the <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Society of Banu Musa (explained below)</span> followed him here and established a seat in Cairo under the leadership of Al-Jazari (further information on Al-Jazari can be found in <span class=\"ha-red bold\">The Sigil of Jerusalem’s Characters</span> section) and conducted significant research on robotics and engineering.</p><div class=\"box-description\"><div class=\"border left first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right first\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right second\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right third\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border left forth\"><p></p></div><div class=\"border right forth\"><p></p></div><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">In ordinary times, the university’s headmaster is <span class=\"bold\">Ismail Al-Jazari</span>, the legendary father of robotics and a genius engineer. Despite his young age, his brilliant mind proved itself worthy at short notice. However, in the storyline of The Sigil of Jerusalem, Ismail Al-Jazari is away from Cairo, as explained in <span class=\"bold\">Act II: We Become What We Behold</span>.</p><p class=\"justify-with-last-centered ha-gold\">In his absence, a <span class=\"bold\">Mage </span>named <span class=\"bold\">Sitara al-Defne (LG)</span> (meaning Daphne of the Stars) is the acting headmistress. She is a tall woman in her early twenties with brown hair and tan and large eyes. Her affinity for magic has marked her with spell rebound - as parts of her limbs are in an unstoppable, arcane decay. However, even the curse of spell rebound hasn’t stopped her from pushing forward in her craft, as she is an incredible magician and expert in arcane creatures that do not originate in this plane of existence. She can cast the <span class=\"italic\">banishment, magic circle </span>and <span class=\"italic\">hold monster</span> spells without expending a spell slot 3 times a day (each), and she has advantage on Constitution saving throws. Sitara, much like Al-Jazari, is young but far more serious, devoted, and work-oriented. She usually spends time digging through arcane archives for knowledge on monsters, trying to figure out how to best fight them and immobilize them. She sees the world as a dangerous place and is constantly looking for ways to make it safer for those affected by spell rebound.</p></div><h3>Membership and Education</h3><p>In order to be a member or a student at the university, one candidate must bring forth a combination of these:</p><ul><li>A letter of recommendation from a member or a renowned scholar.</li><li>Proof of scholarly pursuits, arcane interests, literary talents or artistic virtues.</li><li>Fluency in at least three languages: Arabic, Persian, Ancient Greek, Classic Latin or a Mesopotamian language.</li><li>Undergoing a test or a quest given by the teachers.</li><li>A humble donation (~250 gd).</li><li>A humble donation in the form of a scholarly text, artifact or a similar important item.</li></ul><p>Non-members are not allowed in inner chambers and can’t borrow books from libraries. Members have access to inner chambers and some of the secrets depending on how far they are accepted and if they are able to borrow books. However, the rules on borrowing books are very strict and usually failing to bring the book back for more than a month could result in the death penalty.</p><p>There are interesting rules in the library that may seem odd at first: for instance, you can’t bring any form of fire to the library. It was the custom of the House of Wisdom, where they used fireflies inside lamps to see and read at night. Al-Azhar University rejected this solution and with a subtle touch of magic and engineering managed to light up every possible corner of the building.The walls are filled with small holes that are protected by glass. Inside the holes there are lamps that light the way. They are mechanically connected to the Headmaster’s Office, and when the sun starts to set, the lights follow.</p><p>Inside arcane chambers, harmless flames produced from the <span class=\"italic\">continual flame</span> spell or other methods of magical lighting are also in use.</p><p>For being a “talebe (the one who demands)”, a student, there is no age limit, but a monthly fee (5 gd) is required. With the Ayyubid Dynasty’s rise to power, there are many students who can attend freely, as long as they keep up with classes, chores, and given quests.</p><h3>Library</h3><p>Anyone who wants to conduct research here by spending at least 4 hours must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If they receive help from veteran scholars or other teachers during the research, or it is a group effort to find related books, it is rolled with advantage. Consult the table below to see the different availability of books on certain subjects. The DCs may be adjusted depending on the availability.</p><p>There may be other topics that are not covered in the table but fit the game you want to play. The Al-Azhar University can be considered a center for players with scholarly tendencies to freely conduct their research on a topic of their desire. For rarer topics, scholars from arcane chambers may be of more help.</p><table class=\"color-red\"><thead><tr><td><p>TopIc</p></td><td><p>AvaIlabIlIty</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Astronomy/Astrology</p></td><td><p>Common</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mathematics/Algebra</p></td><td><p>Uncommon</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Physics/Engineering/Architecture</p></td><td><p>Common</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chemistry/Biology</p></td><td><p>Rare</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Herbalism and Plants</p></td><td><p>Common</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Geography/Travel Book</p></td><td><p>Common</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medicine</p></td><td><p>Uncommon</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>History</p></td><td><p>Common</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Religion</p></td><td><p>Common</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Philosophy</p></td><td><p>Uncommon</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Language/Dictionary</p></td><td><p>Uncommon</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Occult</p></td><td><p>Very Rare (60% of the books contain no useful knowledge)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alchemy</p></td><td><p>Rare (30% of the books contain no useful knowledge)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Magic</p></td><td><p>Very Rare (60% of the books contain no useful knowledge)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rituals and Spell Scrolls</p></td><td><p>Legendary (75% of the books contain no useful knowledge)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bestiary</p></td><td><p>Legendary (75% of the books contain no useful knowledge)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Necromancy</p></td><td><p>Legendary (75% of the books contain no useful knowledge)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fiction/fairytale/fable/story/<br />theater/saga/mythology and similar fictions</p></td><td><p>Common</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Poetry and similar literary arts</p></td><td><p>Common</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Paintings, miniatures</p></td><td><p>Common</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Robotics</p></td><td><p>Very Rare</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The library’s master is <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Mina el-Katip (Mage</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-red\">j</span><span class=\"ha-red bold\">)</span>, a woman of Turkish descent. She is young and despite her age, she can read and understand 20 languages and has a flawless memory – she automatically succeeds in Intelligence (History) checks about remembering something that has happened to her, that she saw or heard. She is a chatty and easy-going person unless there’s a threat to a written document, then she unleashes a fury that could rival that of a hellhound.</p><p>When she was young, she was captured by Byzantine troops but saved by a Turkoman raiding party and fell in love with one of her saviors’ sons. She was granted freedom and married the son at a young age. Her intelligence didn’t go unnoticed, and she traveled to Egypt with her husband for further scholarly education. They attempted to go to Baghdad, to the legendary House of Wisdom, but the ongoing war at the borders between the Seljuks and Ayyubids made the already difficult journey insurmountable. During their journey, her husband fell ill and eventually died. Mina still has suitors but refuses them all; she does not want to marry again.</p><p>If the adventurers ever get in her favor by providing new materials to the library and acting carefully around written texts, books and documents, Mina may provide help in searching the library or other arcane businesses.</p><h3>Those Who Recite: Muzahir</h3><p>The title “Hafiz” is important for Islamic culture. It is a title given to those who can recite the holy texts perfectly, from memory. In the University, there are a significant number of people who carry the title Hafız. Inspired by the concept of Hafız, the Society of Banu Musa’s first leaders developed a construct that can hold and transfer information via reading or speaking. They look like mechanical parrots and pigeons, and for the uninitiated eyes, they truly seem like mere birds. These mechanical avians are called Muzahirs and have many uses: they can send messages, record information, or read written text. They have their own very limited intelligence, but they are built in a magical way to prevent them from harming other sentient creatures. Sons of Musa didn’t want these creations to be used as a means of destruction or killing. It was not in their desire to build an assassin or a warrior construct.</p><img style=\"margin-left:-170px;margin-bottom:-50px\" src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/art/gus.webp\" /><div class=\"box-character2 ha-dark-red\"><p class=\"centered ha-dark-red bold font-size-x1.5\">Muzahir</p><p class=\"centered ha-dark-red\">Tiny construct, unaligned</p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Armor Class </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">12</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Hit Points </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">5 (2d4)</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Speed </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">10 ft., fly 60 ft.</span></p><div class=\"box-character-attributes\"><div><p>STR</p><p>3(-4)</p></div><div><p>DEX</p><p>14 (+2)</p></div><div><p>CON</p><p>11 (+0)</p></div><div><p>INT</p><p>6 (-2)</p></div><div><p>WIS</p><p>16 (+3)</p></div><div><p>CHA</p><p>1 (-5)</p></div></div><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Damage Immunities </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">acid, poison, psychic, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from non magical attacks that aren’t adamantine</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Condition Immunities </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Senses </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">darkvision 60 ft., blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 13</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Language s</span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">can understand three languages but can’t speak, can only use Recite ability</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Flawless Memory </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">The muzahir does not forget anything that it has seen or heard.</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Challenge </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">1/8 (25 XP)</span></p><hr /><div><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Recite </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">The muzahir, when commanded, starts to describe what it has seen or heard on a specific topic, location, creature or a similar aspect it has witnessed.</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">No Aggression </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">The muzahir can’t take the Attack action.</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red small-caps bold\">Actions</span></p><p><span class=\"ha-red italic bold\">Flawless Immunity (Recharge 3-6) </span><span class=\"ha-dark-red\">The muzahir can use its action to be immune to all damage.

In addition, if one shares information with the Muzahir, he or she could earn the respect and favors of the university.</p><h3>Chamber of Ruh-u Tevhid (Oneness of the Soul)</h3><p>In the Chambers of “Oneness of the Soul,” the main teachings are about philosophy, religion, and Tasawwuf (Sufism). Its headmaster is <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Ekrem Imaro (@UUID[Actor.EcikReeMMNMXkAUy]{Scholar of Cairo}, in addition to 18 DEX and a 3rd-level Monk &amp; Way of the Pilgrim abilities, 16 AC)</span>, and he is of Sudanese origin. He traveled to many places in the world to search for enlightenment, and he is well-versed in many religions of the world and a very open-minded person. He decided to stay in Cairo due to an injury he received while helping a distressed wild animal. He especially enjoys long conversations about life, the journey, and the beyond. He rarely takes offense; children’s or innocents’ lives must be in danger for him to resort to violence.</p><p>In these chambers, if players actively contribute to the conservation (DC 15 Intelligence or Charisma check, proper proficiencies like Religion may apply) they will be inspired. This inspiration will let them add +2 bonus to ability checks in the next 24 hours.</p><h3>Chamber of Mucize-i Beden</h3><p>In the Chambers of “Miracles of the Body,” a physician named <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Laila Yasmin (@UUID[Actor.EcikReeMMNMXkAUy]{Scholar of Cairo}, INT 19, with expertise in Medicine)</span> discovers and lectures about the human body. Due to a genetic affinity to blood magic originating from a minor spell rebound at her birth, she is able to sense the flow of blood and the location of pain (she senses blood within 60 ft. of her; due to this talent, she can’t be surprised by creatures that have blood in their bodies). This ability helps her research and physicianship. She is a very curious and observant person, usually pointing out possible illnesses in people and advising ways to cure them. She’s married to another physician called <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Najm (Scholar of Cairo)</span>, who is an expert in crafting remedial concoctions. They were born and raised in Syria but followed Saladin into Cairo and chose to stay here. While a horrendous arsenal of blood magic and sanguinary hexes lies before Laila, she vowed never even to study let alone use them; and only use her unhoned powers for healing.</p><p>In these chambers, adventurers can also find frost-covered rooms to preserve dead bodies and conduct research on cadavers. The university pays good money (10 gd) for fresh corpses, but it refrains from purchasing those that died under less than legal circumstances. Storing dead bodies and not letting them rest under the soil is usually a topic of speculation and legends in the city. Most of the devout religious folk despise the act and defend that it is disrespectful to the dead.</p><p>Players can travel here in cases of injury or sickness. If one is brought here unconscious and stable, they will wake up with half of their maximum hit points 1 hour after the examination and tending.</p><h3>Chamber of Asm-i Alâ</h3><p>The Chamber of “Exalted Sky” is led by two women: <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Fatma al-Fihri </span>and <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Razia ad-Din Ahra Nazar (both use the @UUID[Actor.EcikReeMMNMXkAUy]{Scholar of Cairo} statblock)</span>. They craft lenses and similar objects to sharpen their skill in astronomy further. Razia ad-Din is also famous for curing illnesses that affect the eye and helps out the Chamber of Mucize-i Beden staff. She even invented wearable lenses that could be used by the poor-sighted.</p><h3>Chamber of Ulum al-Khafiya</h3><p>Most of the students are not aware that the higher floors of the mosque also host another division: the Chamber of “Hidden Knowledge.” This chamber is led by <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Avni Burhan (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]{Mage})</span> and his subordinates. There, research about magical secrets, limits of wizardry and other aspects of the magical world are researched, the main topic being the spell rebound. The acting headmistress spends most of her time in the Ulum al-Khafiya and is the former head of this Chamber.</p><p>Avni Burhan is an elderly, curious, and silent man who tends to be lost in the books he reads. His title is “<span class=\"ha-red bold\">Dud-ul Kuttab</span>,” which directly translates to bookworm. His primary research is about spell rebound, and he constantly conducts experiments on subjects suffering from the many side effects of the spell rebound. Due to his daily proximity to those burdened with the vengeance of reality, his body is affected by spell rebound as if he were an archmage. His body is filled with surgical scars from his many trials in removing the “organic tissue cursed by reality.” To hide these scars, he wears layer after layer of fabric - truly looking like a worm wielding books.</p><p>If the adventurers bring interesting items or spell scrolls and donate to this Chamber, Avni Burhan will reward them with a “<span class=\"ha-red bold\">potion of anti-spell rift</span>.” When drunk, it gives advantage on saving throws related to spell rebound effects. Avni Burhan has ten of these potions and states that it takes “a long time” to produce one. He gives two of them freely, as he wishes to see how his concoctions work out of the confines of his laboratory. However, the rest requires donations or can be bought for 150 gd. This potion can not be produced with item-creating spells, item-creating class features, or similar methods, and its effects can not be duplicated by any spell. Even Avni Burhan is not sure how he can produce the potions, and he is reluctant to share the methods, as they could be dangerous and deadly.</p><h3>Society of Banu Musa</h3><p><span class=\"ha-red bold\">Saghani al-Asturlabi (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]{Mage}</span><span class=\"dot-sup ha-red\">j</span><span class=\"ha-red bold\">)</span> and <span class=\"ha-red bold\">Ibrahim al-Yattara (@UUID[Actor.EcikReeMMNMXkAUy]{Scholar of Cairo})</span> are the spearheads of the society in the absence of Ismail Al-Jazari.

This intrepid blacksmith recognized Amar’s potential and extended an offer to share his craft, envisioning a prosperous future for them both. Together, they masterminded an underground passage linking Amar’s secluded abode to the heart of the city, where the blacksmith’s workshop thrived.</p><p>Through the passage of time, Amar underwent rigorous tutelage under his human mentor, honing his skills and absorbing the intricacies of the trade. Regrettably, the mentor eventually passed away, leaving behind a legacy for Amar to inherit. Yet, Amar found himself in need of a representative for the shop – a bridge between the enigmatic blacksmith and the world beyond. In a twist of fate, he encountered a destitute, yet undaunted, young boy affected by Spell Rebound named Faisal, whose fearless demeanor resonated with Amar’s compassionate heart.</p><p>In a gesture that mirrored the mentorship Amar had received, he took Faisal under his wing, assuming the role of a paternal figure. As their lives became intricately woven, Faisal became an integral part of Amar’s life and business. With Amar’s assistance, Faisal managed the daily operations of the shop while Amar himself remained veiled from the public eye.

Amidst a playful escapade in the forest, an unforgiving blaze consumed his home and family, leaving him grappling with loss and uncertainty. The young boy’s tragedy was not born out of a natural fire, but from an arcane explosion which also scarred parts of Faisal’s body. Young Faisal had to carry a memory of the blaze that reduced his life to ashes on himself as burnt tissue that will never heal.</p><p>The compassionate villagers rallied to his aid, offering fleeting refuge, but their resources proved inadequate to sustain his well-being. Faisal, bereft of options, embarked on a harrowing journey for survival, navigating the treacherous path of begging and petty thievery as he wandered the streets of Cairo.</p><p>Stricken by hunger and desperation, Faisal’s plight took an unexpected twist when he crossed paths with Amar, a figure both astonishing and approachable. It was an encounter that challenged his perception of humanity, as he bore the scars of fear from his past experiences. However, Amar’s benevolent demeanor provided a beacon of hope amidst the darkness that had cloaked Faisal’s existence.

These creatures are reputed to descend from the majestic serpents that once glided through the chronicles of the Babylonian Empire, embodying a legacy of power and dominion. However, the might they possess today is but a mere shadow of their ancestors’ formidable prowess. Unlike their predecessors, who perhaps once soared through the heavens or commanded vast realms, these contemporary behemoths find solace in the solitude of the shadows, choosing seclusion over sovereignty.</p><div><div><div><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-armour.webp\" /><p>Armor Class</p><p>15 (Natural Armor)</p></div><div><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-hitpoints.webp\" /><p>Hit Points</p><p>30 (4d8 + 12)</p></div><div><img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-speed.webp\" /><p>Speed</p><p>30 ft., fly 40 ft.</p></div></div><table><thead><tr><td><p>STR</p></td><td><p>DEX</p></td><td><p>CON</p></td><td><p>INT</p></td><td><p>WIS</p></td><td><p>CHA</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>15 (+2)</p></td><td><p>11 (+0)</p></td><td><p>16 (+3)</p></td><td><p>15 (+2)</p></td><td><p>10 (+0)</p></td><td><p>16 (+3)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>Saving Throws</span> Str +4, Int +4, Cha +5</p><p><span>Skills</span> Athletics +4, History +4, Arcana +4</p><p><span>Damage Resistances</span> poison</p><p><span>Damage Immunities</span> fire</p><p><span>Senses</span> passive Perception 10, darkvision 120 ft.</p><p><span>Languages</span> Arabic, Latin, Greek, Assyrian, Persian, Kurdish, Italian, French</p><p class=\"challenge\"><span>Challenge</span> 2 (450 XP)</p><p><span class=\"italic\">Shapechange.</span> The Aji Asil can shapechange into any beast with a CR 2 or lower using an action.

A growl punctuates the air as it takes a measured step forward. This is the Animal of Set, a daunting and sleek entity, its physique reminiscent of a large, muscular dog endowed with a long, curved snout and sharply pointed ears. It is revered as a physical manifestation of the god Set’s intentions, roaming the deserts and ruins, safeguarding ancient tombs, or preying on the unsuspecting amidst storm-induced chaos. Far from mere guardianship, it excels in tracking adversaries and serves as a lethal vanguard in ambushes laid by sorcerers and conjurers within the desert’s embrace. However, in some cases they can be trained and used for benevolent causes. It is rumored that Mansa Musa trained many Animals of Set and made them personally conduct charity works for the poor thanks to their invisibility. </p>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-armour.webp\" />\n                <p>Armor Class</p>\n                <p>14 (Natural Armor)</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-hitpoints.webp\" />\n                <p>Hit Points</p>\n                <p>58 (9d8 + 18)</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-speed.webp\" />\n                <p>Speed</p>\n                <p>40 ft., climb 40 ft.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <table>\n            <thead>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>STR</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>DEX</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>CON</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>INT</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>WIS</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>CHA</p>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>17 (+3)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>15 (+2)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>14 (+2)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>4 (-3)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>12 (+1)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>8 (-1)</p>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n        <p><span>Skills Perception</span> +3, Stealth +6</p>\n<p><span>Senses</span> darkvision60 ft., passive Perception 13</p>\n<p><span>Languages</span> understands two languages but can’t speak</p>\n<p class=\"challenge\"><span>Challenge</span> 3 (700 XP)</p>\n<p><span class=\"italic\">Keen Smell.</span> The Animal of Set has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.</p>\n<p><span class=\"italic\">Arcane Cloak.</span> While in desert terrain or in dim light, the Animal of Set can turn invisible as a bonus action, blending into the sand or the shadows.

In the crucible of war, lineage yields to the weight of steel and strategy.

These wraithlike demons possess their envious creators, driven to usurp the beauty or intelligence they lack. Shapeshifting into grotesque parodies of desired traits, they relentlessly pursue those who embody the qualities they crave. Yet with each victim, the gloombound’s hunger deepens, for they can never truly attain the brilliance they seek. Tragically, they embody the destructive nature of envy, a cautionary tale of the consuming void that such a vice can carve in the soul. However, sometimes it is said that the gloombound make friends with whom they possess.

This fascination causes them to live their lives within the sphere of El Naddaha and channel their magic to gain the ability to breathe underwater and eventually develop inhumanly strong muscles. In their devotion, they set aside their morals and use these newfound powers to drag and drown their master’s victims. Through the horrors they’ve witnessed and the violence they inflict, with the magic that pulses through their veins, they lose themselves. They lose their humanity, and with it, their form also changes. Their eyes lose their color, while their hair sways in the cold waters, as murky as moss. Their skin appears almost fish-like, and they slowly relinquish everything that once made them human.</p>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-armour.webp\" />\n                <p>Armor Class</p>\n                <p>13 (Natural Armor)</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-hitpoints.webp\" />\n                <p>Hit Points</p>\n                <p>18 (4d8)</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-speed.webp\" />\n                <p>Speed</p>\n                <p>30 ft.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <table>\n            <thead>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>STR</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>DEX</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>CON</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>INT</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>WIS</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>CHA</p>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>16 (+3)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>9 (-1)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>10 (+0)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>8 (-1)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>11 (+0)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>5 (-3)</p>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n        <p><span>Skills</span>  Athletics +8</p>\n<p><span>Senses</span> passive Perception 10</p>\n<p><span>Languages</span> any two</p>\n<p class=\"challenge\"><span>Challenge</span>  1/2 (100 XP)</p>\n<p><span class=\"italic\">Strong Muscles (Recharge 5-6).</span> The el rafiq can push its muscles beyond its limits.

Cries of the weak, vulnerable, innocent, sighful, desperate and sorrowful ones have an impact on the world and its fabric. They are animated by the sheer force of sorrow and find life among their trapped reality. In the folklore, they are known as Viran-dahl-Asude, the “desolation in the silence,” some scholars noted them as the Voiceless Ones, echoes in the night, fragments of lost memories and the regret left behind from the sorrowful dawns. They are elementals and find their meaning of life by the lost voices and usually accompany the fate of the voice, sometimes by avenging them, sometimes by completing their journey on their behalf. They are almost always invisible, they exist only as voices.</p>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-armour.webp\" />\n                <p>Armor Class</p>\n                <p>12 (Leather Armor)</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-hitpoints.webp\" />\n                <p>Hit Points</p>\n                <p>11</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"modules/bundle-ha-eotc/ha-eotc/assets/elements/icon-speed.webp\" />\n                <p>Speed</p>\n                <p>30 ft.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <table>\n            <thead>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>STR</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>DEX</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>CON</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>INT</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>WIS</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>CHA</p>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>8 (-1)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>13 (+1)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>11 (+0)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>10 (+0)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>10 (+0)</p>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <p>14 (+2)</p>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n        <p><span>Skills</span> Perception +8</p>\n<p><span>Condition Immunities</span> prone, exhaustion, grappled, restrained, petrified</p>\n<p><span>Damage Resistances</span> acid, lightning, fire, cold</p>\n<p><span>Damage Immunities</span> poison, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks</p>\n<p><span>Senses</span> blindsight 120 ft., passive Perception 18</p>\n<p><span>Languages</span> it can understand all languages but can’t speak without its Lost Voices ability</p>\n<p class=\"challenge\"><span>Challenge</span> 4 (1,100 XP)</p>\n<p><span class=\"italic\">Invisible Existence.</span> The voiceless one is a shapeless entity and therefore always has the invisible condition.
