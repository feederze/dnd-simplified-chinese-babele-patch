What a treat!</p><p>Who doesn’t love a good dungeon crawl, especially when we’re starting out roleplaying and everything is shiny and new? Dark, creepy places underground... which if we’re lucky, give way to endless networks of caverns, an entire world down there.</p><p>It did for me, and I happily met, was frightened by, and fought intelligent fungi, talking rocks, and all manner of creeping, slithering, oddly-glowing, ceilingclinging, nightmarish critters.</p><p>And was, of course, inspired to create my own. Yes, I added intelligent underground races to the official D&amp;D® rules, and even a subterranean-dwelling species of dragon—and I’m still doing it, with glee!</p><p>And why not? If the Underworld is a vast subterranean landscape, as big—or even bigger; layers!—as the surface world above, it’s a world. Vast and hopefully varied (all of these fearsome beasties we know are down there, entire races of them, have to live somewhere, and find food and drink; that takes space). If the surface world has hundreds of distinctly different sorts of critters, why not the Underworld? And what’s more fearsome than a roaring, horrible beastie? A race of intelligent roaring, horrible beasties who want revenge if you stomp one of them! And may even come hunting you ...</p><p>These subterranean landscapes are so much more, should be so much more, than labyrinths of caverns full of evil drow ruling everyone else (or at least trying to). Think of an Underworld so big it holds sentient races who’ve never heard of drow—or at least never actually seen one. It follows that for such a big, rich adventure playground to be rich, it will be full of new races, who live their lives in such different ways than humans on the surface that playing characters of these different races will demand new character classes.</p><p>Well, looky here! This gorgeous tome is brimming with details about subterranean-dwelling races, and new classes galore! I can’t wait to explore the Underworld anew with all these new toys!</p>"

          "text": "<p>Living in the Underworld of Aventyr for any period of time tends to alter one’s perspective. The lack of light or changes in temperature that normally indicate day and night vanish, along with the meaning of the terms. The senses run amok as constant sounds flit in and out of the limits of hearing, and the need to be able to navigate in three dimensions—as chimneys and crevasses suddenly appear in your path—discombobulate any natural talent for direction. Were that not enough, the creeping horrors that developed below the picturesque surface of Aventyr have a disturbing trait of “changing” people.</p><p>In the stygian depths, the claustrophobic tunnels, endless caverns, undiscovered realms, countries, and entire lands beneath Aventyr’s surface, the races that thrived have adapted to their home in ways unheard of in the Upperworld. Specialties suited to the peculiar and particular environs abound, while those that cling to sunlit ways fall prey to what lurks in the shadows.</p><p>The archetypes and classes in <em>Underworld Races &amp; Classes</em> are most frequently associated with characters in the Underworld of Aventyr but can be adopted either by other races in an underground setting or by a character with an Underworld influence in their history. If your campaign doesn’t have a subterranean bent, each class has other means and motivations for characters to pursue them detailed in their class entry.</p><h1>Underworld History</h1><p>The first of the four great historical events in the history of the Underworld of Aventyr came by the hands of the gods themselves during the <em>Forging of the Dvergr</em>. Finding the mythical creatures to be ultimately self destructive, the divine powers carved each into the four dwarven races (dweorg, dvergr, zwerc, and their foul kin, the gitwerc) and the immortals (elves and drow). The gitwerc removed themselves from the rest of these newly-created races, sealing a pact with the devils of Hel at the core of the world while their cousins were molded. Each of the different races of dwarves lived in tenuous peace deep below the surface of Aventyr while their slender, distant cousins sought refuge away and above. War would surely have erupted between the three great clans (dweorg, dvergr and zwerc) were it not for the sweeping changes soon to overtake the Underworld.</p><p>The second great event is known as the <em>Grand Sculpting</em>, when the Progenitors (the first race of Aventyr, mysterious entities still shrouded by the mists of time) mastered the primal dragons of the subterranean depths. Enslaved, the powerful creatures were made to shape the whole of the continent beneath the surface, carving out grand empires and rerouting magma flows, creating vast networks of caves and connecting peoples and creatures never before exposed to one another.</p><p></p><blockquote style=\"background-color:#C1AA91;padding:10px\"><h4><strong>GM Sidebar—Under the Surface</strong></h4><p>The Underworld is as separated as the surface world by oceans, lakes, and wide, turbulent rivers. Of course, on Earth, the subsurface is one complete mass, but Aventyr is different. Although no one is certain (largely due to the constant movement at the surface of Hel), many sages believe there are several continental Underworlds, each resting as an individual land mass on an ocean of internal fire—Hel, the realm that rests at the core of Aventyr. So rather than plate tectonics and shelf drift, the continents really can move quite spectacularly if monumental events take place within or on the surface of Hel; this might account for a number of the great extinctions, the raising of gigantic mesas and mountains, the isolation of races and peoples, and so on. The Underworld itself can take on an almost fluid characteristic as Hel moves, magma flows, and the previous configuration of caverns and tunnels is reshaped beyond recognition.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The dwarves scattered as the world around them was rebuilt by the potent draconic slaves; the dweorg to the relative safety near the surface, the dvergr to remote caverns to build cities of their own and the zwerc to isolated outposts barely tethered to the Material Realm, far removed from the rest of the world in pocket dimensions connected to the Elemental Plane of Earth (only accessible by the mystical Amber Roads—mysterious veins of orange crystal that bisect the realms of reality). The gitwerc and drow were already far removed from most of the Underworld (the former near the core of Aventyr and ruling the realms directly above Hel, the latter foraging in the darkness at the farthest reaches of the existing cave networks after their banishment from the Silent Forest) and had little interest in the massive reshaping of the Progenitors.</p><p></p><blockquote style=\"background-color:#C1AA91;padding:10px\"><h4><strong>GM Sidebar: Prehistoric Progenitors</strong></h4><p>The Progenitors remain a mystery of the past. Scholars believe the draaki to be the remains of the once great race that shaped the Underworld, but the many names attributed to the influential Progenitors—Kantaisa, Kantaa, Stamvader and more—leave the truth of their origins an enigma to even the finest historians of Aventyr. Legends suggest that the eldest primal dragons might know the truth of the mysterious, powerful, prehistoric peoples, but if they do know, they are keeping it to themselves.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The third event, the Great Schism, saw the downfall of those powerful slavers. Over centuries the dragons plotted in secret, subtly enchanting the tunnels and byways they carved through Aventyr, beneath the notice of their minders. In a grand ritual that promised to grant the Progenitor race great power, they instead awoke a seemingly impossible creature— the Dracoprime. Before the monstrosity could fully rise and form, the greatest mages of the once powerful slavers sacrificed the very essence of their species to see it destroyed, calling out with a cry that shook the most far flung planes. The Progenitors were saved, but much reduced in power, influence, and ability, rapidly mutating into the draaki.</p><p>Forming out of the bedrock beneath the oceans, most of the continent was safe from the Dracoprime’s calamitous fall—all save Picollo. Once a great archipelago that extended far from the mainland, the realm of the halflings was reduced in one disastrous moment to a single island. Countless small folk died that cataclysmic day, and their world became forever changed by the mountainous creature’s end. The drow took this opportunity to “save” numerous refugees of the Dracoprime’s fallout, becoming the new powerful slavers beneath the surface, forcing the lesser races under their charge to build magnificent cities hidden away in the endless caverns.</p><p>The desperate call of the draaki brought aid from a strange, otherworldly, god-like alien from far across the cosmos. Zagnexis transported his physical form (Zagn) and brood to Aventyr using a grand surge of divine power, placing them directly into the forming brain of the draconic idol. The Dracoprime’s skull erupted with the insectoid god’s body and its children, killing the monstrosity instantly. Many hoyrall, as its children were called, were carried to the Underworld where they prepared for a grand invasion, but the others remained on the surface engaging in a war that nearly consumed the remaining halflings of Picollo. Exis, the god’s essence, maintained a connection with his creations, granting them a hive mind that made them a threat poised to topple the entire Underworld— if not Aventyr itself.</p><p>However, more than one bizarre entity answered the draakis’ call for aid, and the colloid arrived in the Underworld in an event called The Confluence. Exis’ conduit to his children had been studied by another being known as the colloid for some time. After several centuries the alien stole Exis’ power to transport itself to Aventyr, shattering the hive mind that made the insect god’s creatures such a serious danger. Their race fell into disarray, their deity’s monstrous body turned into a mindless aquatic beast; the echoes of the colloid’s arrival would soon leave even bigger waves in the sea of history.</p><p>While its message only now reaches Upperworld, the denizens below have known the colloid’s touch for some time. One lich, obsessed with finding a way to protect himself from the otherworldly hive-mind, instead created two new species that survive in the subterranean world to this day (even if he does not). Each is a reflection of their creator; one a reduced version of himself but forever tied to stone (the dødelig), and the other that which he hated most—crystalline beings borne from contact with the alien creature (the colliatur).</p><p>It was during this latest period that the jungles of the Underworld saw the emergence of a fungal race that towers over its subterranean fellows with an aloofness and apprehension that sets them apart as surely as their intimidating presence, and they have propagated across Aventyr since.</p>"

          "text": "<p>In the days of darkness when the world was young, the gods forged a race from the very heart of the world itself. They called this race “Dvergr” and placed them close to the heart of Motherworld.</p><p>The dvergr thrived and prospered, but as time went on they became greedy, fighting over the precious metals and gems of the Motherworld.</p><p>The gods foresaw the self-destruction of the dvergr, and so they divided the race into five parts, each sharing the appearance of the first dvergr (but only a fragment of its whole).</p><p>The first were named dweorg, and were created from the dvergr’s hands and heart giving them honor and expert craftsmanship.</p><p>The second were made from the dvergr’s head, and kept its most proud of names. They stayed deep beneath the world toiling in their greatest cities, only an echo of their former selves.</p><p>The third were named the zwerc, created from the spirits of the dvergr. This granted them innate power over magic, their mystical nature making them loners and travelers with an endless thirst for knowledge.</p><p>The potent avarice of the dvergr, however, would not be undone by the gods. Their greed led them deep into Aventyr, much deeper than the gods had permitted them to go. Soon they had discovered Hel—where devils and demons dwell—and while the first three races were created, a pact was forged with the denizens there. The devils granted the dvergr’s avarice physical form and realms in the deepest, most foul and flaming depths of the Underworld—but they did not stop there. The devils gave these dvergr the ability to siphon souls from the other races to feed themselves, and in turn they granted the dvergr more power.</p><p>When the gods returned to forge the fourth, they found the dvergr’s entrails snatched up by devils who had turned them into a terrible creature, the gitwerc.</p><p>The gods, realizing their mistake in creating a race with no evil intent, vowed never to do so again and went to work creating the fifth race in secret, using all the remaining parts of the dvergr. The fifth and final race would be eloquent, honorable, knowledgeable, and nearly immortal, yet the race would be forever divided, torn between light and darkness. Their souls were permanently bound to the world, sentenced with a nearly endless life staring out upon the sea of eternity, never able to attain that balance which comes so easy to the other races. The gods placed this race above and below the world, both in light and in darkness; they became the elves and the drow.</p><p>Then the gods did something which surprised all of the races. They created a realm between Upperworld and the Underworld, using the culminating thoughts of all the new races to forge the “Gift from the Gods, ” the first humans: Ask and Embla.</p><p>This gift would bring balance to the world.</p>"

        "Ahooling": {
          "name": "Ahooling",
          "text": "<p>These are the children of the winged terrors of the Underworld, the ahool. Compared to their elders they are considerably smaller and seem less of a threat, but many denizens of the depths would disagree. The demanding life of ahool society irons out the failings and weaknesses of these youthful creatures quickly, but when one is led too far astray or abandoned by their tribe, they pursue whatever path life provides for them (sometimes never reaching their full primal potential). Small collectives of ahooling are said to live outside the brutal societies of the predatory ahool, eschewing the bestial traditions of their greater cousins.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/ahooling.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><p></p><h2>History</h2><p>The origins of the ahool are as mysterious and widely attributed as their strange transformations, but some facts are known to the most knowledgeable Underworld scholars. During the Forging of the Dvergr, the devils of Hel granted great power to the gitwerc but not without garnering the attentions of their demonic counterparts. The fiends capered about the endless caves, corralling vast swarms of lesser creatures— bats, crabs and rats, depending on where the demons found themselves—together into vast caverns prepared for the simple beasts arrival. When all was ready, they collectively engaged in a complex, wild, grand twostage ritual. First, they morphed thousands of the tiny minds into singular souls, and then they infused each with the essence of a primordial air spirit born in the core of Aventyr—the resulting creatures were the true ahool, predators supreme of the Underworld. The fierce, primal minds of the swarming creatures, melded with the predatory instincts of the aether spirits, created a race that easily rivaled the gitwerc. Unlike the changes wrought by the devils, however, the means of continuation for these powerful Underworld creatures was not so simple.</p><p>When killed, these powerful beastmen dissipated into swarms of demonic bats, crabs and rats, fleeing from whatever felled them to infest the endless caves as infernal creatures. When the lesser demonic vermin interacted with any other of their kind, each attributed a swarm and eventually—through an extremely gruesome and painful transformation—created the first ahooling. Those that survived are the ancestors of today’s ahool, carrying on the varied traditions required to catalyze their lesser forms and realize the true potential inherent in every ahooling.</p><p>Demons are said to occasionally create a new true ahool when the mood strikes them, but most of the originals have been destroyed by wayward adventurers or the infernal dwarves. The rivalry between ahool and gitwerc remains strong today—the beastmen crave the blood of the devilish stout ones, savoring what they believe to be the sweetest blood in all of Aventyr. A scant few of the true ahool still roam the Underworld (seemingly immortal) and are said to influence the events of all their lesser kin in a manner mysterious enough to be fitting for their kind.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Ahooling are not considerable in size, though they tend to be very lean and well-muscled. Each bears marks of what it may grow into as the ahooling ages, but the creatures are remarkably adaptive and their bodies evolve to suit their behaviors and environments. Still, they all bear some similar traits—long, piercing fangs that peek from out of their mouths, bodies covered in fine, coarse dark brown hair, vestigial wings that jut out of their shoulders, taloned hands, and large ears that rise from their narrow skulls in short triangular folds of flesh. The irises of ahooling are predominantly yellow—the eyes of nocturnal predators.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The core of their being demands a diehard approach to life from the ahool, and even their lesser cousins, the ahooling, lead brutal, hardscrabble lives. They collect trophy fetishes, though only the strongest wear them openly; duels for assuming the spoils of victory from another are commonplace.</p><p>Ahooling treasure the drinking of blood; the more types of creatures one can legitimately claim to have succored from heightens their social status. Thus the most respected of the beastmen are either fierce combatants or purveyors of their most valued cultural tradition: vino sanguinis (blood wine). While few in number, ahooling moss caverns (which are located on the floor of a cave rather than on the ceiling, unlike the ahool’s moss gardens) are always ruled over by a native that has traveled the Underworld and returned ascended, a full ahool. When found by their more bestial cousins, these conclaves are quickly subsumed, whittled down until only the toughest ahooling remain. Their warriors are as much hunters as anything else, but the lesser beastmen show greater reverence for the arts and magics, allowing for their settlements to survive hidden from their stronger cousins.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>Ahooling are respected and feared by other underworlders, regarded as powerful—albeit dubious— allies. Some can be quite civilized, but they are natural cutthroats. Most explorers remain wary of the ahooling; they avoid killing captives, instead subjecting them to long, torturous existences as preferred livestock for the vino sanguinis brewers.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Ahooling are predominantly chaotic and evil, but not exclusively so. More than a few of the true ahool’s demonic lesser forms were discovered by adventurers that cleansed them, creating good impurities in the creatures before letting them loose once again. Sometimes these impurities surface in an ahooling, creating a beastman devoted to the purest ideals and goals. Though quite rare, paladin ahooling (and ahool) are spoken of in hushed tones by the malicious elder denizens of the endless caves, and hunted down whenever a true ahool learns of their existence.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>The demanding lives of ahooling turn them into exquisite hunters, effective scouts, deft warriors and brutal barbarians. Those that leave their home cavern exemplify the drive and focus of their race—these explorers find their primal urges prove invaluable as they travel across Aventyr. While they are normally best suited to bear a weapon, some take to spellcasting and make powerful sorcerers or oracles.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Asht’haht, Gympth, Kolschak, Riktha, Rorsk’haht, Tek’ta’kaht, Worlpth</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Errell’atht, Fisscourth, Graix, Nedrazt, Preall’atht, Sol’kla, Syrralth, Vanes’satht</p><h2>Ahooling Moss Caverns</h2><p>The homes of ahooling are expansive networks of caverns overgrown with moss that hangs from the ceiling and traps in moisture, making the interior warm and inviting compared to the cold passages of the Underworld. Were it not for the greater respect that lesser beastmen show for magic, these settlements would never survive. A PC that succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check can determine from the tribal markings shown around an ahooling moss cavern just how barbaric and dangerous its residents are likely to be. A moss cavern of ahoolings typically becomes an ahool moss garden (suspended in the air) after whatever initial founder’s influence passes into the annals of history.</p><h2>Ahooling Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.Rxqo06ht9yxyuweI]{Ahooling}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Ahooling Subraces</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.R0G6LInBWubcHbox]{Aquatic Fledgling} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.6qNLVajq3EXp9uSb]{Terrestrial Fledgling} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.mRCHmfy4FaNZIfQf]{Vampiric Fledgling}</p><h2>Ahool Keener (Cleric Domain)</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/classes/ahool-keener.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><p></p><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.subclasses-urc.RzjJuVkYP7DyWSgD]{Ahool Keener Domain}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Ahool Keener Domain Features</h3><p>1st Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.WR7Oe20HvU8qpv6d]{Sanguine Supplicant} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.WqU819PoYXCEYVPo]{Stealth of the Predator}</p><p>2nd Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.v7pyAOYsBBVoUKE8]{Channel Divinity: Keening}</p><p>6th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.vmID3VY3VXfWtIzo]{Smashing Keening}</p><p>8th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.6B5EtsYe91wUyp4g]{Potent Sonics}</p><p>17th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.ewf3NauImi11Gq5y]{Lord of Caverns}</p><h2>Ahooling Feats</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/classes/iron-singer.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><p></p><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.2P11YGHC9yGh4cpT]{Ahool Senses} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.TPdlZsPMwScafWEm]{Ahooling Flight (25')} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.6oYnhIZy7YhUIKsw]{Ahooling Flight (60')} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.NvaY49CbbkZfae4l]{Ironsinger}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.mWKM1yYNtdfBcvVc]{Primal Speaker} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.SE0bRLlaGpJRAkgz]{Terrifying Revelation} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.A2YobYsAzoca1p92]{Vampiric Charge}</p><h2>Ahooling Equipment</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/equipment/ahooling-macuahuitl.jpg\" width=\"350\" /><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.RuZXj2F4oSdcB2y9]{Ahooling Macuahuitl} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.9xnBQMJTwIm5ToZW]{Moss Net} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.G2WJrOyxdoSQnmir]{Moss Rope} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.uo6WfeoOT05GPdDl]{Staunching Moss}</p><h2>Ahooling Magic Items</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.NA5pzbWBaorVSLIb]{Blood Dart} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.9SoRQgN5sAWO9Bia]{Demonic Tooth} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.dL1UcDBgwo7coWxF]{True Ahool Crown}</p><h2>Ahooling Spells</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.AIWVeiiqmYjCFpmu]{Ahool Frenzy} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.EaesbEZ14eogbFcx]{Haunting Glide} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.EN9jx7bc6mHknvVo]{Wine to Blood}</p>"

These microorganisms cannot completely stop the advance of the alien biology’s invasion of a host body, but they do prevent them from becoming completely sublimated to the otherworldly entity’s will. The limited time available to the undead wizard prevented wide dispersal of the anti-colloid virus, leaving the extraterrestrial sentience puzzled by how any creature could resist its psyche (there is a 1% chance that a PC has been exposed to this otherwise benign virus and is immune to the detrimental effects of the colloid). Colliatur are often found leading the subjects of the colloid—their independence proving to be an attracting force to the alien’s thralls—and may be encountered anywhere in the Underworld or Upperworld.</p><h2>History</h2><p>The colliatur are a new race to the world of Aventyr, created by the mad designs of Udødelig after The Confluence. Their “parent”, the colloid, is a creature from the far flung stars of the cosmos and unlike any other on Aventyr (even the hoyrall, though they share some eerily similar traits). A collective intelligence that rivals deities in its mental powers, it sensed the mass transposition of life forms across the galaxy during the Great Schism. For centuries it studied the conduit maintained by the alien half-god Exis, engineering a means to take that power for its own.</p><p>Eventually the colloid’s chance came; through incalculable machinations for nearly any other entity, the colloid seized the half-god Exis’ divine connection to the hoyrall, subverting it to catch upon an asteroid headed for Aventyr. The hive-mind of the alien insects in both Underworld and Upperworld was destroyed instantly, and as the bizarre entity hurtled across the galaxy, their societies fell in upon themselves.</p><p>When the colloid and the meteor it used to traverse the cosmos landed in the First Hive, the overload of stimulation in its reentry to the atmosphere left the alien entity confused and distraught. In the onslaught that ensued, thousands of hoyrall died as the colloid rampaged away to solitude far below in the Underworld, where it could regain its senses of purpose and understand all that had occurred since it’s relatively quiet journey across the stars.</p><p>As it re-assembled itself and re-encountered sentient life, the colloid began to understand more of what had occurred and recognized the great threat represented by the necromancy of the first lich, Udødelig. Centuries before he had fled below the surface of Aventyr, taking refuge in an undertower near the First Hive. When the colloid landed in the Underworld, his shambling minions were the first formidable force the alien encountered and the hatred it feels for all undead knows no bounds.</p><p>Before the colloid could reach and consume the obsessed lich, the undead wizard managed to enact one of his countless ploys to undermine the alien entity. Though the ancient mage’s mastery of biology was largely useless to the creation of an entire race of undead, he was well-suited to craft an organism which could aid the living against the otherworldly entity.</p><p>After fleeing from the colloid’s arrival in the First Hive, Udødelig crafted a grand undertower that stretched far into the bedrock of Aventyr, a place where he thought only his kind could survive. For decades he employed advanced arcane techniques and powerful spells to hone his craft and eventually, using the bacteria and countless other creatures invisible to the naked eye, Udødelig created a microorganism tailored to modify living tissue to resist the colloid. Immediately, the undead mage set off to disperse his fabrication across Aventyr, releasing batches of the creatures into the many waters of the Underworld. While he was away, the colloid discovered the location of Udødelig’s undertower. The colloid lay in wait, and on the mage’s return struck a fatal blow. Udødelig did not survive to create more of the virus, but enough propagates that the colliatur have begun to appear all across Aventyr.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Colliatur appear much like the base creature does, save for a few subtle changes. Their hair has several strands that are crystalline, their pupils appear to be distorted into the shape of many pointed stars, and their fingertips become reflective and metallic. Perhaps most disturbing of all, the teeth of all colliatur are a perpetually clean, stark white.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>These children of the colloid are inclusive, kind and friendly to all races. When left entirely to their own devices, colliatur are disturbingly quiet and seemingly lethargic, though they’re more likely to be in deep contemplation. There is little celebration for the arts or purportedly impressive deeds, but the few stories told of settlements of their kind speak of architecture that defies understanding and resonances that shake men to their cores.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>Most upperworlders and underworlders greet the colliatur with open arms, accepting their warm embrace with either a hidden dagger or hand out for mercy. Their tendency to deeply value life make them fast allies in both cases, but their hatred of undead make them mortal enemies of the dødelig. Hoyrall that recognize them for what they are will attack them instinctively (which anyone who knows their true purposes is wont to do). Despite all of that, aside from the dweorg, they are the most celebrated and desirable race from the Underworld as far as most of Aventyr is concerned.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Colliatur typically gravitate towards the Neutral alignment over time, but may be of any alignment they please. They rarely worship any of the gods, instead gaining quasi-mythic abilities from the colloid. Those few that turn their backs on the alien entity find solace in He who Renews, Eureum.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Exploring is a natural impulse for the colliatur, and spreading the message of the alien overmind is their first priority. Spellcasters are common among them, but warriors of particular prowess are frequent as well.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Colliatur tend to keep the names they had before their transformation.</p><h2>Emissaries Across Aventyr</h2><p>Some colliatur take refuge with the colloid, but not all; the otherworldly entity is pleased when creatures immune to its call ally with it regardless, but it does so with a cold, calculating plan to segregate these unique beings from the areas of itself most likely to be tread across. Other colliatur create their own settlements, hybridizations of the culture they once knew and the otherworldly forces at play within themselves. Duplicating architecture from Upperworld and Underworld, their buildings have an architecture that seems to twist when looked upon, their structural points truly bizarre and difficult to comprehend.</p><p>Whether on the surface or below it, the vast majority of these wondrous towns and villages are said to be extremely amicable to passersby, providing them with free lodging and foodstuffs. Explorers, however, should be reticent when entering a colliatur settlement; some of their race have become militant to the dangers presented by the colloid, and travelers that take of their kindness are soon to find themselves conscripted into service against the alien entity. An Intelligence (History) check (DC 20) gives warning enough that a colliatur settlement has taken on this aggressive stance before it’s too late.</p><h2>Colliatur Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.E9wPP4k7Hbw4oips]{Colliatur}</p><h2>Colliatur Reaver (Monk Variant)</h2><h3 style=\"border:none\">Creating a Colliatur Reaver</h3><p>When you make your colliatur reaver, think about your awakening as a colliatur. Do you remember your life before the transformation? Perhaps you once were a true blackguard, a dastardly foe, now mellowed out by the influence of the colloid. Or you once were a divine champion of good, now struggling to adapt to a new world-view. Your ability to control your crystalline parts is impressive and beyond what other colliatur can accomplish—so how were you chosen? Do you simply have a talent for the art? Or were you groomed in a strange process within the colloid’s crystalline depths to be its executioner? Perhaps you have deliberately sought the art and transformation to execute your own revenge against the forces of darkness? The existence as a colliatur reaver may be a journey to self-awareness via combat, an enlightenment arising from conflict or it may be a revenge-driven quest to annihilate undead. Work with your GM to make the unique concept of your character shine as brightly as the crystalline filaments you’ll use to wreck your foes.</p><h4><strong>Quick Build</strong></h4><p>You can make a colliatur reaver quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

Some colliatur reavers must make a pilgrimage to a node of colloid containing the respective information, while others already have the required impulses dormant within their very bodies.

          "name": "Dødelig",
          "text": "<p>These small stone skeletons caper about the Underworld, living immortal lives of abandon and casual investigation wherever they go. The only known locale that dødelig are sure to be found is the corpse of the Dracoprime—a mountainous subterranean expanse made from the draconic idol’s dead body, buried far below the surface of Aventyr. The only things they take seriously are the uncovering of more of their kin and avoiding the colloid, an alien entity intent on the destruction of all undead.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/dodelig.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><p></p><h2>History</h2><p>Dødelig are a race that were never intended by the gods of Aventyr—their creator was the lich Udødelig, a mad wizard intent on preserving the legacy of undeath. Their existence is still something of an anomaly to the Underworld; the truth is that their entire species’ animation owes as much to the Great Schism as it does The Confluence. When the body of the Dracoprime fell upon the islands of the halflings during the Great Schism, countless small folk were instantly crushed to death under its mountainous corpse. The very marrow of their bones was forced into the stones under the draconic idol, simultaneously immersed in the potent and arcane energies of its passing.</p><p>For centuries afterward their lifeless, crushed bodies remained, mystically ingrained within the very rock. Udødelig was once a simple man, but came to be one of the first to successfully master the workings of magic before his mortal coil ran short. His distinction as the first lich of Aventyr did not at all go unnoticed by upperworlders and in his haste, he fled to the Underworld sometime after the Great Schism. For several decades he enjoyed exploring the subterranean seas, jungles and emerging realms, eventually settling not far from the First Hive of the hoyrall, keen to see how their obvious plans for martial domination would play out.</p><p>The Confluence changed his demeanor considerably as the colloid arrived and threw the insectoids into disarray. It didn’t take long for Udødelig to realize the alien entity’s intent to destroy all undead it encountered and he fled to the far reaches of the Underworld to plot, scheme and develop a means to combat the otherworldly threat or preserve his legacy. While he managed to enact one scheme that still puzzles the colloid to this day, the lich would never know the success or failure of his most vital contribution to the Underworld. Unfortunately the colloid is as persistent as it is pernicious and the lich was ill-prepared for the alien’s attack, left encased entirely within its form and fighting a losing battle against its endless minions.</p><p>In the farthest reaches of the mad wizard’s undertower, Udødelig’s skeletal familiar made a surprising discovery: the skeletons of halflings were magically fossilized within the very bedrock. Without recourse, the lich played at a gambit that ultimately cost him his very existence, but forever changed subterranean Aventyr. Expending his own being in an arcane ritual of a potency unseen since the Progenitors, Udødelig spread his spark of undeath to each and every one of the halfling skeletons fossilized by the Great Schism, binding it to the very magics that infuse their calcified bodies. The colloid was largely confused by this final tactic employed by Udødelig, but as the most powerful undead foe the alien had ever seen, the unusual strategy did not seem so impossible. Besides, it instantly found hundreds of undead souls to destroy, created as a byproduct of the lich’s desperate attempt to escape. The otherworldly creature continues on through the Underworld, undaunted by the few dødelig it encounters (if it notices them at all; the clever skeletons are able to fool it briefly, often just long enough to hide and escape).</p><p>While dødelig only very rarely remember any part of their life before transforming into undead, they are much like the mortal halflings they once were. Jovial, adventurous and well-suited for traveling the Underworld, these small, intelligent skeletons have become increasingly common across subterranean Aventyr not too long after The Confluence. They are reckless, fearless, and durable despite their size, but penultimately concerned with entertaining themselves.</p><p>Their settlements are likely to sprout anywhere— literally; it is said that the Dracoprime’s fall and the energies dispersed by its destruction flung debris (and settlements) all across Aventyr, each imbedded deep within the earth by the gargantuan inertia that carried them through the sky. The chief concern of the dødelig is the preservation of their kind, leaving them to be surprisingly martial when there is a demand for it and encouraging them to search for their kin with regularity as they wander the Underworld.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Dødelig are identical to halfling skeletons, save that they are not made of bone. Their bodies are composed of variously colored stone writhing with a dark blue hue of the magical energies that sustain them. A dødelig’s body is made of whatever stone its skeleton was once encased within, a byproduct of the marrow they once had centuries before and the mystical powers enacted upon it.Dødelig are identical to halfling skeletons, save that they are not made of bone.

A dødelig’s body is made of whatever stone its skeleton was once encased within, a byproduct of the marrow they once had centuries before and the mystical powers enacted upon it.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Loyal to one another without exception, dødelig value the life of each and every member of their race as if it were their own. The devotion dødelig show to one another creates tightly-knit social groups that ensure the safety of their settlements. Despite their light-hearted natures, they are instinctively aware of the massive danger the colloid poses to them all and are woe to ever drop their guard lest it destroy them and their kin.</p><p>Once halflings, their love of surprise, pranks, and merriment surprises none, but upperworlders often find them off-putting. Nonetheless, musicians and artists from both Upper- and Underworld show particular reverence for their much sought after talents.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>Initially it is hard for members of any race to befriend the dødelig—save the enlightened and the necromancers, most of the peoples in Aventyr react poorly to undead, intelligent or not, but the dødelig themselves are often quite amicable, even if their appearance does engender fear.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Dødelig take after the essence of the soul that granted them a second chance at existence and are Chaotic in the main. The dødelig are not sure how they came to be or what they ought to worship, and pay tributes to deities determined by whim more than anything else. Still, some find a kinship in the Dark Governess, Nearru, becoming clerics or warlocks in her name.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Becoming an explorer is a required obligation placed upon every dødelig as soon as they are freed from entombment. The remains of the traveler’s blood still haunts their stone bones, but more importantly, all dødelig are charged with uncovering more of their kin in the Underworld. Once one is found, more are certain to be nearby and every undead settlement carries the name of its founder and savior in respect. While they might not excel as warriors or barbarians, dødelig are suited for any spellcasting class and are exceptional rogues or—very rarely—monks.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Dødelig don’t really identify very strongly with gender, and both “sexes” use the same names; Cain, Dack, Gazz, Herbet, Irk, Jurgen, Kynt, Lim, Xot, Ziz.</p><h2>Age</h2><p>Dødelig are undead and effectively immortal; they do not accrue age bonuses or penalties.</p><h2>Dødelig Communes</h2><p>The free spirited, boisterous nature the dødelig once knew as living beings persists with them still. While it might be an initially disturbing experience, once an upperworlder has spent a little time around dødelig, their frightening undead appearance becomes less noticeable. What their settlements do and how they run, however, often leave travelers mystified for quite some time after their departure. All dødelig societies have a militaristic bent and artistic drive to entertain; sometimes these two qualities are in balance, but often times one overtakes the other. Some dødelig communes are rampant parties that last all day, night, week and month (if they ever stop at all) while others are like massive thespian colleges, far unlike their highly codified, strictly artistically segregated counterparts. These latter settlements have become obsessed with uncovering the complete origins of their race and seeing the dødelig propagate across Aventyr, sometimes at the cost of their living kin. Halflings and gnomes must remain wary of some dødelig communes; a successful Intelligence (Religion) check (DC 20) is enough for them to realize whether or not they too might soon lose their lively qualities.</p><h2>Dødelig Racial Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.OVxyY04jVEfjdhcP]{Dødelig}</p><h2>The Mirthful Mariachi (Bard College)</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.subclasses-urc.S52490dx1EU9JEge]{College of The Mirthful Mariachi}</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/classes/mirthful-mariachi.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h3 style=\"border:none\">College of the Mirthful Mariachi Features</h3><p>3rd Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.fC3R9kEaiE06prQc]{Bonus Proficiencies} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.ga74EjWM1ZOqYNvI]{Crossover of Destruction} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.zN3We4hjmBilkxGQ]{Crossover Crafting}</p><p>6th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.5D224FXfd6Ene8vv]{Subterranean Song} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.e983OOyNfERPtGfj]{Improved Crossover Crafting}</p><p>11th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.2K62GZEGE27RdHSe]{Hail of Missiles}</p><p></p><blockquote style=\"background-color:#C1AA91;padding:10px\"><h4><strong>Can I have that with firearms, please?</strong></h4><p>It should be pretty evident that the mirthful mariachi was intended as a tribute to the trope of the Wild West mariachi with gun/instrument hybrids.

From the drow to the dwarves, all of the subterranean civilizations were affected by the Progenitors, for it was they who tamed the many primal dragons that kept their lairs below the surface. Using arcane magics long forgotten to all of Aventyr, they subjugated the primal dragons to their will, using them to carve out entire regions for colonization, re-route the thousands of magma flows throughout the stone and destroy thousands of the untold prehistoric monsters that once roamed the countless caverns miles under the surface. This, the Grand Sculpting, made the Underworld into what it is today. Their obsession with the primal dragons eventually became the originators’ undoing.</p><p>In an intricate plan that crossed the span of centuries before reaching fruition, the draconic slaves enacted their revenge. Promising far greater powers and abilities, one of each of the primal dragon types offered up their soul to the Progenitors in a ritual that would transform every member of their race. This carefully planned and perfectly manipulated ruse instead revoked the powers that once allowed them to bind and control the primal dragons, transforming each of their species into a strange amalgamation of reptilians that only barely resembled their supposed creators: draaki. Baffled, caught largely unaware and temporarily sapped of strength and will by their transformations, they proved to be no match for the freed primal dragons, which quickly fled into the Underworld to recoup their strength—or so it seemed. Meanwhile, the terrifying true threat hatched by the primal dragons began to stir and the Dracoprime gathered strength.</p><p>Hours after the disastrous calamity, the draaki were thrown into total disarray as the mountainous creature began to rise from the depths, crafted over hundreds of years by thousands of dragons, hidden from the Progenitors by the gitwerc, it instantly destroyed most of their civilization as it rose from the Underworld. With little recourse the high mages of the draaki that remained enacted a ritual that called out a plea which shook the Planes, killing each instantly as a buzzing, resonating voice answered their desperate cry for help.</p><p>The Dracoprime’s skull instantly erupted with thousands of small insectile humanoids— the hoyrall— and the immediate threat to the forever cursed draaki came to a quick end.</p><p>The primal dragons, however, were not even close to sating their thirst for vengeance (and in truth, they never will be) and they did not rest long after the destruction of their idol. The subterranean civilizations of the draaki quickly fell to the claws of their former slaves and eventually the reptilians retreated into The Rifts, their scant sorcerers and high enchanters enacting one final ritual to grant their people solace against the draconic menace.</p><p>In the hollowed out magma tunnels below the Fungi Forest, the Draaki Caverns, they have lived peacefully for centuries and only the bravest and most inquisitive of the primitive tribes sets out into the Underworld (and their return is a rare and celebrated event. ) The draaki have five distinctive subtypes, each emblematic of one or another trait belonging to underworld dragons. Traditionally they have gotten along, but the numbers of the draaki are swelling and tensions rise as game grows scarce and the need to expand into the Underworld grows. They once had the ability to assume the shape of any humanoid (as a dragon does) but became so complacent with impersonating the nearby drow of the emerging Holoth that now they can only assume the form of a dark elf.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>These reptilian humanoids stand a head higher than a man but are truly much taller from toes to snout, craning their thick necks forward in a constant stoop. Their bodies are exceptionally powerful and graceful, and they have a surprising magnificence granted by a potent echo of their former grand presence.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The draaki each have different cultural traditions reminiscent of the practices of tribute they were once made to pay to their former draconic slaves as tensions between each dispersed. Reaching adulthood is an event celebrated by the entire settlement, as the many dangers of the Underworld still prey on the draaki for their ancestral doings, even if their former slaves have abated. Survival and martial disciplines thrive, and they greatly value any member with the magical talents they all once possessed.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>First and foremost, the draaki are paranoid—many underworlders still bear them ill will and their suffering never seems to end. This overriding instinct to remain paranoid serves them well, however, and they continue to survive despite their tribal practices and lack of proper civilization. Using their ability to blend as drow, they move about the society of the Underworld and trade the valuable ores they find emerging in the decaying bedrock for weapons, tools and goods they cannot produce on their own. The draaki’s natural presence gives them an advantage in this charade and they are raised to be deceitful about their true identities. When found out they become skittish and fearful, but when their trust is fully gained they prove to be capable allies well-versed in the dangers of the Underworld.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>While they aren’t all of Chaotic alignment, most draaki tend to be. Whether they abandoned their gods or if they themselves were abandoned, they don’t worship any specific deity, though draaki particularly value both community and nature.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Draaki adventurers are more likely to be exploring Aventyr by necessity rather than a desire to do so. Still, once they’ve ignited their inner passion for dominating the Underworld, it is difficult for them to stay in place for too long. The draaki make phenomenal sorcerers or warlocks and although extremely rare, paladin draaki are legendary in their prowess.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Getzrai, Lyrvak, Kortehn, Retzgar, Saygwyk, Verja</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Aslaug, Gro, Oydis, Pernille, Rygna, Sunyyva</p><h2>Draaki and the Underworld</h2><p>Draaki are universally disliked for the part they once played in the unfolding of the Underworld and left lacking in sense by the Progenitor’s dramatic call to the reaches of the cosmos. They are a suspicious people, equally feared and preyed upon by others, leaving them to value strength above all else. Tribal leaders are often the most physically powerful, though some are usurped by potent spellcasters and particularly clever, underhanded dissenters. Their cultures all still practice rituals once meant to appease the dragons that plagued them; sometimes these can be exceptionally dangerous to the unwary, and travelers that succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 20) recognize the telltale signs of practices that spell trouble for foreigners when they approach a draaki settlement.</p><h2>Draaki Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.iHQWgGlejkk7b91F]{Draaki}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Draaki Heritage</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.nAX1eUgpE3DHrElE]{Abbsin} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.M2QDhZM1ikDDSVBl]{Graldrin} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.1LuSKQZNj8mJWRqU]{Kastrik} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.icNclgjcUSTliFmc]{Prulan} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.33q4nBGGxgSVPxhx]{Yuralith}</p><h2>Draaki Feats</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.bh5UF88mQJpef6Gi]{Abbsins Pliable Tail} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.0xb7d5FBb7TRSean]{Breath of the Draaki} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.ULXtZJYMucIuBkDZ]{Draakistorian}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.X5K2HnDqDrWzN13B]{True Draaki} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.EG3E3tuuYhEY3HUa]{Wyrmblooded Paragon} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.07wtzHDqu2JN9vBs]{Yuralith Flight}</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/classes/wyrmblooded.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>Draaki Equipment</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.xpf1Tob7Upe7axoB]{Dragonbone} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.4LINU8oCFZIT7NQZ]{Draaki Tail Spurs} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.uM8iNC7WKEPmFPnB]{Draaki Sinew Bowstring} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.CQnwokyAop6SgylV]{Draaki Fangs}</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/equipment/draaki-tail-spurs.jpg\" width=\"350\" /><h2>Draaki Magic Items</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.eyJihUVAJ2DUxZ98]{Dragonbone Focus} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.nuiqkNwBf4Nt6Qjt]{Periapt of the Draaki Savage} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.ri1NpMYBrBV1Ka1B]{Scales of Bounding Descent}</p><h2>Draaki Spells</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.s4vSnXp6B1u2kphS]{Breath Weapon Crossfire} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.EIPt4uM4uqdMCdQX]{Draaki Breath} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.8aUPrSTdO3e8Fczq]{Draaki Savage}</p>"

          "name": "Drow",
          "text": "<p>The drow were once denizens of Upperworld, sharing the realm with their elven brethren without consequence. Thousands of years have passed since those mythical times, and the drow have fallen far from their original state. The drow live far beneath the surface of known lands, deep in the Underworld, in large cities dedicated to Naraneus, the Queen of Venom.</p><p>Drow societies are matriarchal, and females hold almost every position of power within a city, their priesthoods always led by women of potent ability and foresight. Cold, cunning and manipulative, the drow live to obtain power over those around them. Their entire race is inherently evil but there are rare occasions—when the moon is full and Naraneus’ attentions are devoted elsewhere—that a good-aligned dark elf is born. Children born during these periods are generally sacrificed to Naranaeus without a second thought, but mothers with a strong parenting instinct who are unwilling to make the sacrifice give birth in secret, sneaking away and passing the child to an upperworlder or asking an underworlder of another race to care for the newborn. They may follow their offspring, secretly assisting from afar to see that their child grows and adapts to life amongst the other races.</p><p>Unless otherwise permitted by the GM, any drow character in Aventyr is of evil or at best neutral alignment. Any drow of a good alignment will have been raised by one of the good-aligned races of the Underworld, or—rarely—by humanoids of Upperworld. Evil drow PCs hail from the subterranean metropolises of the Underworld, and a rare few are connected to Hivaka or Leahcim, the lone good and neutral drow deities.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/drow.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>History</h2><p>During the <em>Forging of the Dvergr</em> the immortals, both light and dark, were left alone in the Underworld. Unwelcome in the dwarven cities and smart enough to avoid any involvement with the gitwerc (despite their many innocuous offerings), they traveled throughout the endless caverns as nomads. Their patron gods— Naneth the Leaf Mother, Onael the Forest Lord, and Naraneus, Queen of Venom —watched over them, enforcing in each a sense of control, the nature of their wild souls, and the skills they would need to survive in the harsh world of Aventyr. Their exodus came to an end with the founding of the Silent Forest, home of the elves. With the need for fierce survival instincts at an end, the darkest of the immortal’s gods took up far less of the elves’ attentions; whereas Onael was still needed to tame their savage spirits (although as they became more civilized, he too became abandoned) and Naneth garnered greater devotion as the slender folk finally found a true home and hearth, Naraneus, the Weaver of Shadows, has forever been a dark god.</p><p>The Queen of Venom dwelt in the shadow cast by the Prime Event’s brilliance, waiting like the creature of her namesake. When the gods created the elves, she felt a kinship with their eternal plight and joined the Forest Lord and Leaf Mother in guiding the immortals to the Silent Forest. Naraneus taught them the nature of true deception and stealth, making them cunning warriors and silent hunters, well-suited to survival in the Underworld. After emerging upon the surface, however, her worship faded as Naneth and her mothering ways flourished. It was not long before Naraneus struck back at her sister, inciting a feud between the darkness and the light. After a time this came to consume both races, embroiling the drow and the elves in bloody battles that marked the Silent Forest with thousands of immortal corpses in a war that lasted decades. Eventually, Naneth and the elves proved victorious, banishing the Queen of Venom and her followers back to the Underworld.</p><p>This suited the Weaver of Shadows and her devoted peoples well; their natural stealth, cunning and ruthless efficiency made them ideal denizens of the Underworld. By the time of the Grand Sculpting, the drow had dispersed far from the Silent Forest and into the farthest reaches beneath Aventyr, establishing small settlements generally removed from the cave networks left by the Prime Event. Naraneus blessed her female children, making the strongest among them into matron mothers, whose iron rule sustained the fledgling noble houses of the Silent Forest in inexorable marches to prominence.</p><p>By the time the Great Schism came, the diminutive outposts had quickly grown into thriving villages brimming with potential, but limited by the murderous, self-inflicting instinct of its citizenry. The many fleeing refugees of the Dracoprime’s calamitous fall sated the self-destructive tendencies of these drow populations however, and provided enslaved backs upon which to build the first grand city of the dark elves—Holoth.</p><p>Finally seeing the value in the lesser, inferior races, the children of Naraneus found their place in Aventyr. The initial (and greatest) metropolis of the drow, Holoth was ideally situated to collect the masses of displaced underworlders and expanded quickly. Its earliest years are rife with turmoil as warring noble houses and subterranean terrors destroyed the settlement in countless conflicts.</p><p>The drow are, however, nothing if not determined, and the skeletal remains of the city’s many previous incarnations sit below the current Holoth. Reeling from the loss of the <em>Vidrefacte</em> and the Fall of House Gullion (see <em>Rise of the Drow</em>), the first city of the dark elves is still a powerhouse in the Underworld. Like the many drow settlements that exist in the realm hidden behind the cardinal metropolis (the drow locale closest to Upperworld), it boasts arcane academies and temples of the most dangerous and highest regard, warriors of the greatest prowess and rulers with insight that leaves their peers baffled and dismayed.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Drow are tall and slender like their elven counterparts, with graceful and pleasant features that belie their evil nature. Their hair color can range from brunette to gray or white. They are quick in both body and mind, their slightly enlarged and pointed ears keen to hear the slightest scuffle in the Underworld.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The drow are matriarchal and exist entirely to do the whim of the Matron Mother of their home settlement. Women are valued far more highly than men; most of the latter are little better than smart dogs—fit to serve as guards but easily worth a few gold pieces as a youth. They are uniformly slavers, and even the lesser houses of nobility can count dozens of indentured servants to their estate. While they all answer to the Matron Mother of the first house, all drow vie for power and prestige; they will (and many times have) slaughter their own parents without a second thought if it means the acquisition of greater influence.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>Cunning to the last, dark elves are sly, subtle and resourceful individuals. They rarely expose themselves until they’ve assumed a considerable upper hand, and by then, few who’ve survived what follows managed to escape to tell of it. Ruthless, efficient and capable of mindless savagery the drow are, at best, extremely dangerous allies (to both those they profess to aid and their perceived enemies).</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Drow are of the Evil alignment, be they chaotic, neutral or lawful. Most of the former are quickly beaten into submitting to the latter or sacrificed to appease Naraneus, who only truly blesses a few of her female subjects and even fewer of her male devotees. Naraneus is by and far the most revered of their gods, but demigods of Shadow and Pain have begun to take hold in a few drow cities without their orders falling to blades in the night.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Dark elven adventurers can be of many different mindsets, but most are dissatisfied with drow life for one reason or another. Women born into lower castes seethe with jealousy for their high born peers, and males from any house literally live at the whim of their female counterparts, a dangerous proposition that they would be keen to escape should the opportunity to safely do so arise. Females may be of any role, although they specifically seem to excel as clerics. Men are rarely clerics (and if so, only have one or two levels of the class) and chiefly master the art of mundane combat, with perhaps some dabbling in the graceful arts of the rogue or, in the event they’ve a talent for it, pursuing the arcane workings of the wizard.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Diun, Gal, Gylor, Ieot, Quanot, Slior</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Aranreae, Haermadia, Lilith, Maethon, Maeronea, Slienaia</p><h2>Age</h2><p>Some dark elves in Aventyr enjoy lifespans that far surpass their peers. These wizened wizards, elder priests, devious warlocks and treasured oracles see their longevity extended by hundreds of years either by their deity or through deftly sustained arcane magics.</p><h2>Female Drow</h2><p>Raised to rule, dark elven women have deft tongues and cunning wits but lack the grace and natural instincts of their ancestral counterparts on the surface. Female drow in Aventyr receive skill proficiency in their choice of two of either Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion).</p><h2>Male Drow</h2><p>Dark elven society subjugates males, reducing their roles into defenders of their settlements and little else. They are trained from birth to hone their keen senses, agility and ability to remain unseen and unheard, but their lack of social commitments leave them less able to maneuver in conversation as their female counterparts. Male drow in Aventyr receive skill proficiency in their choice of two of either Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), Dexterity (Stealth), or Charisma (Deception).</p><h2>Drow Enclaves in Aventyr</h2><p>The subterranean dark elves rule over a large region of the Underworld protected from the rest of the endless caves by the bastion metropolis of Holoth. All of their settlements are built upon the backs of enslaved races, ruled over by matriarchs that worship the Queen of Venom, Naraneus. The infighting and intrigue that suffuses their cities makes them a moderate threat to the whole of Aventyr, but travelers should beware any chance encounter with a drow settlement. An Intelligence (History) check (DC 20) reveals to an Underworld explorer how likely it is they will be caught by dark elven magic when making their way through a drow settlement (if it absolutely cannot be avoided). The vast majority of incarcerated interlopers are forced into slavery and in some cases, have their very souls extinguished in mystical rituals.</p><h2>Drow Traits</h2><p>Drow in Aventyr use the standard race traits for drow.</p><h2>Naraneus Domain (Cleric Domain)</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.subclasses-urc.056vVNLR9ay112Y7]{Naraneus Domain}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Naraneus Domain Features</h3><p>1st Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.9jayETuzgDwfiqUj]{Blessing of Poison}</p><p>2nd Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.OUxJtM2c2hmnZkIL]{Channel Divinity: Poisonous Cunning}</p><p>6th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.ZubfBlAiQajWgtJV]{Pure Spite}</p><p>8th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.1WVOntLn2TSB4u0W]{Poisonous Shadows}</p><p>17th Level: —</p><h2>Masters of the Web</h2><p>Living in the Underworld of Aventyr for any period of time tends to alter one’s perspective. The lack of light or changes in temperature that normally indicate day and night are gone, as are the meaning of the terms. The senses run amok as constant sounds flit in and out of the limits of hearing, and the need to be able to navigate in three dimensions as chimneys and crevasses discombobulate any natural talent for direction. Were that not enough, the creeping horrors that developed below the picturesque surface of Aventyr have a disturbing trait of “changing” people. In the stygian depths, the claustrophobic tunnels, endless caverns, and undiscovered realms beneath Aventyr’s surface, the paths taken by humanoids of the Upperworld warp considerably. Specialties suited to the peculiar and particular environs abound.</p><p>Those that adapt to their surroundings live, while those that only hold fast to the old ways fall prey to menaces that lurk around every corner. The archetypes and classes in Underworld Classes are most frequently associated with dwarves and drow, but can be adopted either by a race in an Underworld setting or by a character with an Underworld influence in their history. If your campaign doesn’t have a subterranean bent, each class has other means and motivations for characters to pursue them detailed in their class entry.</p><h2>Masters of Deception</h2><p>In the labyrinthine, nefarious politics of the underworld and in the face of the uncounted ways one can fall prey to deadly predators, few races have managed to eke out a means of survival, much less established a civilization that has reached a proper level of sophistication. Those that manage this feat are among the hardiest and most adaptable beings one can find. It is testament to their wiles that the feared drow have managed to create a truly impressive array of bustling empires built on deceit, murder, treason, and poison.

          "name": "Dvergr",
          "text": "<p>Dvergr are subterranean dwarves that spend most of their time building massive cities and sealing off passages to the surface. They are isolationists that seek little or no contact with peoples outside of the Underworld; preserving a rich cultural heritage unspoiled by upperworlders is a dvergr’s way of life.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/dvergr.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>History</h2><p>After the Forging of the Dvergr, each of the different races of dwarves lived in tenuous peace deep below the surface of Aventyr. War would surely have erupted between the three great clans (dweorg, dvergr and zwerc) were it not for the arrival of the Great Sculpting. Before their very eyes, the cities of each fell to draconic claws and magics as quickly as the forces they could muster to their defense. Unwilling to forge an alliance, each struck their own path through the Underworld, leaving their shattered homes behind them. While their kindest kin struck toward the surface, the sullen dvergr made for the farthest reaches of the Underworld to build new cities of their own, forever swearing off the other races. Filled with spite for the wholeness denied them by the gods, eventually each of the clans separated, seeking sites to build upon as far away from their fellow dwarves as possible. Their journeys lasted for generations, seeing successions of leaders rise and fall until only the strongest willed dvergr led these seemingly endless expeditions to the untamed caves beneath Aventyr.</p><p>The dynasties of those first dwarves continue to this day; once a dvergr clan has made up its mind, only the most dire of circumstances can change it. The leaders that saw to their survival took them to far-flung chambers and uninhabited expanses never before seen by mortal eyes. In these great caverns the genuine dwarves set about rebuilding the great cities they once engineered with their unwanted kin. Their staunch belief in tradition is greater even than their cousin the dweorgs’. The great clans all convene under an armistice every 500 years (if that—records of the event are fastidiously kept, but they expressly forbid any but their grand historians from accessing documents so old) known as the Grand Convene. It is at these rare meetings that the dvergr determine what it is they are collectively to do in order to strike the pride of their true names into the annals of history in Aventyr; they have taken it upon themselves, as a species, to expand their isolationism to prohibit all of the Underworld from the surface above.</p><p>At the Grand Convene, each greater clan submits what their city has learned about the Underworld—its dimensions, what lives within, and the most exposed exits to the surface (always with convenient ideas for other settlements to close them off).</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>For the most part, dvergr look similar to their cousins the dweorg; they are uniformly between four and five feet tall, with stout shoulders and equally powerful frames. Unlike their kin the dvergr’s hair is typically white or light grey, which contrasts greatly with their skin (which can be as black as night or any shade of grey). It is rare to see a dvergr with freshly made equipment; their devotion to tradition and stubborn unwillingness don’t allow them to let go of goods they treasure, no matter how worn they might be. That said, their armors, clothing and weapons are always of exceptional quality, though they chiefly favor the hammers, axes and heavy mail-suits of their forefathers.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The way of life for the first dwarves is one of preservation; a dvergr’s entire existence might well be devoted to nothing but recording the legacy of their clan in the enduring medium of stone. Each city has multiple institutions devoted to the mastery of mining or engineering, and every great clan employs countless historians that meticulously record the goings on of their city with unmatched resolve. Outsiders—if they are tolerated at all (which is a rare occurrence at best)—are not treated kindly, either being ignored or even jeered at for their intrusion to the sacred grounds of the dvergr. Between themselves the sullen dwarves aren’t much kinder—their societies leave little patience for one another and competition is fiercely enforced. Craftsmanship in construction is valued only as highly as properly recording a great dvergr deed or accomplishment, and their wondrous cities rival the greatest architectural achievement across the planes.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>The dvergr do not get along with each other very well and are even worse when other races are concerned. On the rare occasion that a first dwarf agrees to an alliance or takes another into their heart, they start a companionship that can easily last a lifetime (and sometimes even longer). Gruff, stubborn, devoted to tradition, and proud historians, the dvergr are dependable and trustworthy, even if they can at times be difficulttotolerateorwork with. They have little mirth and are known for their unwillingness let go of a grudge.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Dvergr are predominantly Lawful Neutral and oddly, atheistic. This is not to say that they do not believe in the gods—their presence is not at all in question—but rather that they do not accept them or their place in the cosmos. The first dwarves’ reluctance to resolve being wronged persists and they remain staunchly disowned by the divine. Clerics among the dvergr are rare; those with a devout nature become druids instead.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>It is not unheard of for a dvergr to permanently leave their city, but it’s rare thing all the same when they do. The entire settlement gathers to bless an outgoing expedition and pay their respects, as it isn’t uncommon for exploratory parties to never return—for dvergr that wish to see the world beyond their home, this is the chief means to do so. Dvergr adventurers always leave their cities equipped well enough to near the surface or any of the main byways of the Underworld, and should they disappear during the journey, there is only a minimal investigation as the core group moves on to continue surveying or sealing the caves beneath Aventyr. While some take easily to spellcasting, few of these follow divine paths and most dvergr become talented fighters, learned rangers or cunning rogues.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Alviss, Brokkr, Dain, Fafnir, Galar, Otr</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Brigida, Edda, Flinna, Hildr, Nefja, Ragna</p><h2>Age</h2><p>While one might expect the isolationist dvergr to have longer life spans than their dweorg cousins, constant excavations throughout the Underworld expose their undercities to some potent and dangerous substances. They live slightly shorter lives as a result.</p><h2>Dvergr Undercities of Aventyr</h2><p>Few upperworlders (and underworlders besides) have seen the fabled undercities of the dvergr. The wonder bestowed by tales of their impossible architectures and soaring feats of engineering is so magnificent that rumors of their location persist regardless.</p><p>Of all the subterranean races, the dvergr are by far the most xenophobic, rarely suffering the presence of foreigners.</p><p>Still, some of their settlements find the glitter of gold to be of great appeal and tolerate travelers if it suits their needs. Explorers that succeed on an Intelligence (History) check (DC 20) can tell from the quality of tunnel maintenance whether or not a dvergr settlement may be willing to parley with outsiders at all.</p><p>Very few intruders live to be imprisoned—a fate that often lasts for several years of dark loneliness before the prisoner is knocked unconscious then left naked and alone to fend for their survival in the Underworld.</p><h2>Dvergr Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.qkE6svtPYexKbbHL]{Dvergr}</p><h2>The Dour Destroyer (Paladin Variant)</h2><p>Clad in ragged, time-worn armor, a single dvergr marches on through the lightless depths, with eyes as black and empty as the wasteland that is the ultimate fate of the world. Where he treads, things fall apart and the center truly cannot hold. Rough and bestial, he slouches onwards, weapon ablaze with power, as the works of mortals crumble before his inexorable stride towards a goal and fate unknown. Whatever their origin or mission, dour destroyers are united by their oaths to the forces of entropy. Whether sworn in the ruins of his erstwhile home amidst the bodies of friends and family or in the presence of his masterworks undone and ruined by catastrophe, the dour destroyer’s oath is a binding, powerful force as he takes up an implement that symbolizes the vanity of mortal striving and goes forth, bringing destruction.</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">The Vortex of Entropy</h3><p>The dour destroyer swears to end the illusions of all creatures—just as his epiphany has robbed him of any sentiment pertaining hope, goodness or similar merits, the dour destroyer is an instrument of entropy: Decay and dissolution follow where he treads, and neither art nor hope is left in his wake, as all things uplifting, all joy, ultimately, is but a veil concealing eventual destruction. To the dour destroyer, all existence is akin to a man stranded in a maelstrom, clinging to a raft in futility. He has accepted the inevitable, and the suffering endured by those who resist it is what he seeks to alleviate, permanently.</p><p>It is said permanence is what makes dour destroyers work within the context of less scrupulous adventuring groups, for while they tend to have a sapping effect on morale, they are completely devoted to the ending of the revels of anything that is deemed immortal—whether it is fiends, angels, fey or the undead—it matters not to the dour destroyer, for said beings, resisting the vortex of time and entropy, are anathema and must be destroyed.</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Creating a Dour Destroyer</h3><p>The most important aspect of a dour destroyer is the moment of epiphany. Almost all dour destroyers are born in a moment of trauma, where all their work, effort and passion is snuffed out in a cruel twist of fate. Whether by pillaging rovers, unthinking creatures, or even adventurers—the dour destroyer has lost all and from the wreckage, he takes an implement of destruction... and it begins whispering the truths of futility to a mind already savaged. Those that witnessed the birth of a dour destroyer often commented that they could see the light die within their tear-streaked faces. Of course, there are those that arrived at the same conclusions via vastly different paths, be it philosophical rumination or just a feeling that existence is pointlessly cruel. How did you experience the awakening? What conclusions did you draw from it? How do you perceive your interaction with your implement of destruction? What aspects of your code of conduct are most important to you? How does your instrument of destruction communicate with you? Perhaps through visions, whispers, taste? What personality does it have?</p><p><strong>Quick Build</strong></p><p>You can make a dour destroyer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be the highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the outlander background.</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Class Features</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.classes-urc.0D765UbqDBnlnFO6]{Dour-Destroyer}</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/classes/dour-destroyer.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><p>1st level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.6sAGZUXPm0gvcOk2]{All is Dust} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.q2uUB2b88nNlF8Ao]{Entropy’s Sense} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.iDGWTA4sLAe6GKYt]{Instrument of Entropy} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.SO8u5tyxk0XvWVWu]{Touch of Entropy}</p><p>2nd level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.nHVYhzSf87vGYIfI]{Entropic Smite} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.052gStdnqtgszV22]{Fighting Style} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.TZ526QHkhPhGyfE3]{Inevitable} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.l2dOrqi4wk4S0Heh]{Spellcasting}</p><p>3rd level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.WF1YqmO9KtlNL5jP]{Plague Carrier} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.ORrfXo4wpxSMNe43]{Oath of the Endtimes}</p><p>4th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.LqeIjObXG69Eehd5]{Ability Score Improvement}</p><p>5th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.Byn2lecUul5Outwz]{Extra Attack}</p><p>6th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.0UJajpa3ziXohFhh]{Aura of Decay}</p><p>10th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.MQMSvbdDBD3iph7S]{Aura of Despair}</p><p>11th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.TgwtzhEDZxW8Nei9]{Improved Entropic Smite}</p><p>17th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.mavIpn32tpTM6RGD]{Superior Entropic Smite}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Oaths of the Endtimes</h3><p>Becoming a dour destroyer requires a mindset characterized by an absence of hope, a belief in the finality of all things and a commitment to tearing the comforting illusions and distractions of other creatures away to make them realize the truth of your vision.

          "name": "Dweorg",
          "text": "<p>Dweorg are the most common dwarven subtype, denizens of the Underworld that enjoy mining and blacksmithing. While rare outside of the Underworld, upperworlders are often accepting of these stout folk— the legends tell that the first two humans, Ask and Embla, were themselves forged by the ancient dweorg. This belief has warmed even the cold hearts of the Klavekians, who freely accept these dwarves into their villages and homes. Although they are friendly with upperworlders, the dweorg tend to keep to themselves and rarely allow outsiders to travel into their realm.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/dweorg.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>History</h2><p>After the Forging of the Dvergr, each of the different races of dwarves lived in tenuous peace deep below the surface of Aventyr. War would surely have erupted between the three great clans (dweorg, dvergr and zwerc) were it not for the arrival of the Great Sculpting. Before their very eyes, the cities of each fell to draconic claws and magics as quickly as the forces they could muster to their defense. Unwilling to forge an alliance, each struck their own path through the Underworld, leaving their shattered homes behind them. The dweorg consulted their historians and clerics, ultimately following the same path as the first two humans, leading the stout folk toward the surface near Upperworld. Their journeys from the darkness of the deep Underworld are the stuff of legend, playing a large role in the devotion the dweorg show to their ancestors and traditions. As prophesied, this removal from the lowest reaches preserved their race, buffering them from the fallout of the Dracoprime and its death. Having settled in stable areas, the dweorg’s defensible cities proved to be a bulwark against the many races born from the mythical creature’s essence, saving the world above from most of the dangers created by the recently liberated primal dragons.</p><p>Some traveled a more wayward route, living a nomadic existence before finally establishing the city of Stoneholme after an enduring trial that intertwined its history with the devilish influence of the gitwerc.</p><p>The most famous dweorg settlement was far humbler, a simple outpost made to act as a place of commerce that would maintain contact between the disparate clans as they sought new homes near the surface. For ages it remained a small village, but since it has grown considerably and now it is known throughout Aventyr as Embla, the city of fair trade.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Dweorg are anywhere between four and five feet in tall, with stout shoulders and bodies that defy their diminished height. Their hair colors are commonly brunettes or blondes, but some clans sport great red manes that weave into their beards. Nearly all dweorg men wear beards, often carefully tended to with rings of precious metals stylized to honor their ancestors or traditions. Both genders are tough and possess strong core muscles; the color of a dweorg’s skin ranges from pale to reddish white and olive. They favor armors made from metal and pride themselves on craftsmanship, often wearing expertly crafted equipment made by their own hands.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Smithing and craftsmanship are the backbone of dweorg society, but these dwarves are keen on all of the aspects each entails. They are well-known for having keen eyes for gems, ores and precious stones of all kinds, as well as a penchant for trading them. Their warriors and defenders pose a threat alone or at the backs of allies, each with an instinctive understanding of their equipment (often forging their weapons and armor themselves). Miners and engineers are just as common as soldiers, known throughout both the Upperworld and Underworld for their natural penchant to intellectually grasp the complex calculations required for large-scale excavation and construction.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>Though their past is filled with hardship, dweorg maintain the friendliest demeanor of all the dwarves in Aventyr. While travelers are normally granted only temporary asylum within their settlements, they have been known to accept foreigners into their cities—so long as they embrace dweorg culture and tradition. They are a just people filled with pride and often able to recite their lineages to the founders of their settlement (and in the case of nobility, even farther). This isn’t always fully understood by other Aventyrians, and sometimes their strange ways isolate the dweorg but more often than not, they are openly accepted into upperworlder society, valued for their talents at the forge and staunch loyalty.</p><h3>Alignment and Religion</h3><p>While they can be of any alignment, most are Lawful Neutral and follow Balir, the Burning Hero and Master of the First Forge. His teachings, condensed in the 3,000 page tome The Life of Balir, call for practicality and humble magnificence, traits embodied by both his temples and followers. While there are some that pursue the arcane arts, most tend to frown at a reliance on magic and only show their respect for the mystical arts to devout members of the clergy.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Many dweorg leave their homes to act as scouts or wardens, trekking across the Underworld to map out emerging cave systems, identify dangerous geological movements and locate threats both old and new that prowl the depths close to the dwarven cities. Others endeavor to expand the reach of their clan by establishing new trade routes both above and below the surface, or take to lives as mercenaries with ambitions to bring back glory to their family’s name. While they are not disposed to ostracizing, dweorg society doesn’t treat those without a reverence for history very well and dwarves that defy traditions often leave of their own accord.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Alvis, Brocker, Danik, Frednir, Maylorin, Otis</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Bridgette, Edna, Franlina, Hlazel, Normja, Ragnarose</p><p>Dweorg close to the surface tend to marry traditional dvergr names with those of the surface dwellers, so names can differ wildly from region to region.</p><h2>Age</h2><p>Living nearer to the surface of Upperworld than any of their kin, dweorg enjoy slightly longer lifespans than their counterparts deeper in the Underworld (as well as those from other material planes). Depending on how much interaction they have with humanity and the other surface races, sometimes dweorg find the spans of their lives to be significantly reduced by upperworlder assaults or dangers awakened by meddling explorers.</p><h2>Dweorg of Aventyr</h2><p>The dweorg cities and kingdoms of the Underworld are as varied as the human settlements on the surface, save that all of them show reverence to crafting in some fashion or another, and a staunch appreciation for tradition. Still, the dangers of the endless caves have hardened the resolve of some dweorg settlements, making them unkind and unwilling to accept foreigners for any period of time (unless they’ve proven themselves worthy).</p><p>A traveler can determine that a certain dweorg settlement is on good terms with interlopers by making a successful Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 15). Notably less vicious than the other races, most intruders receive a fair trial and brief imprisonment before being dropped off outside the gates.</p><h2>Dweorg Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.5cjl06fRFIGDcZ7X]{Dweorg}</p><h2>Fortune’s Smith (Martial Archetype)</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.subclasses-urc.BhqrHkBTC5QCskBe]{Fortune's Smith}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Fortune’s Smith Features</h3><p>3rd Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.XaCsSQ8Dnwqv62IP]{Bonus Proficiencies} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.aWkIotnftg3JJxaS]{My Own Fortune}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">7th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.gLilNX0XjfzmYFck]{Shared Fortune}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">10th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.MlhMfrrAFVlXMUPk]{Fortunate Flexibility}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">15th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.9wfXBPmqBAH971hN]{Improved Fortunate Flexibility}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">18th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.ae9FWFZSX0nRwqx2]{Superior Fortunate Flexibility}</p><h2>Smithkin (Martial Archetype)</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.subclasses-urc.Bp5XkttP1GIht8X5]{Smithkin}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Smithkin Features</h3><p>3rd Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.WW97cWeTjikBQKkD]{Dweorg Prowess}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">7th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.NmzQssw9nqVjprL6]{Strength of the Forge}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">10th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.abdopBmFsULp1oIc]{Improved Dweorg Prowess}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">15th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.oIrd6yn1HAYsrUuR]{Unstoppable}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">18th Level: Forge Dice upgrade</p><h2>Dweorg Feats</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.LKZQT2rTV3ldd2Pz]{Dweorg Weapon Mastery} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.EJ3DJaW1PgRQJoOI]{Smithkin Resistance} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.pccrJHaMpEtJM71j]{Clanmind}</p><h2>Dweorg Equipment</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.VQcs1dc4RBfvrSlh]{Dweorg Rock-singer}</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/equipment/dweorg-rock-singer.jpg\" width=\"350\" /><h2>Dweorg Magic Items</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.rxdn6ib6LZ11VT5t]{Instant Forge} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.78FX1tgd81EtwayT]{Pocket Anvil}</p><h2>Dweorg Spell</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.i46VWsiJn46I3QS1]{Dweorg Stew}</p>"

          "name": "Funglet",
          "text": "<p>These are the children of the mushroom jungles of the Underworld. They are true children of nature, embracing the fungal forests they call home as though each individual capped stalk growing in the subterranean soil were a cousin or sibling. Philosophers have come to believe that they are the sentient expression of lush Underworld forests, literally made for and by the mushrooms themselves. While they are predominantly loners, a small society of funglets have gathered in Dregharka’s Bayou, a fungal jungle bordering the Forever Deep.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/funglet.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>History</h2><p>The fall of the Dracoprime in the Great Schism presaged the arrival of the funglets in the mushroom jungles below Aventyr, but their true origins are disputed both amongst themselves and Underworld scholars. They aren’t a particularly private or xenophobic race, but their reverent worship of the subterranean groves that birthed them keep the funglets from traveling the breadth of the world, and most folk who even know of the fungal men make no distinction between their individual beliefs.</p><p>Fantasfunglets have deduced that they are the natural evolution of mushroom life. Acting as the historians of their race, they place phenomenal value on reasoning and logical skills—all the pertinent information at their disposal ultimately concludes that while some catalyst may or may not have been present at the time of their appearance after the Great Schism, they are undeniably birthed by a fungal forest.</p><p>Audirefunglets believe they are vestiges of the Dracoprime’s life force, carried to the mushroom jungles by its blood. They refer to the massive draconic idol as the Natural Force (NG, minor deity) and refuse to recognize the claims made of its origin with the Progenitors and their slaves. Instead they personify it as a deity of their own image, a powerful force that persists through each of them.</p><p>Maculosfunglets worship the oldest living thing on the planet, the Honningsop Mushroom, as their patron god and creator. According to their legends they were born within the enormous rhizomorphs of Aventyr’s eldest organism, carried across the Underworld to the many mushroom jungles that fill its endless caves. Any trace of the Honningsop is treated with even greater reverence by maculosfunglets than their kin, but the Natural Force sees their faith as equally worthy devotion.</p><p>However they came to be, the funglets quickly spread throughout the Underworld in the years leading up to and after The Confluence. They have become the wardens of nature beneath the surface of Aventyr, respected by all for their services as caretakers of the exotic, bountiful, mushroom jungles that provide so many subterranean races with means to survive the desperate environments. Were it not for the funglets, the lush fungal forests throughout the endless caves would never have prospered into the enormous groves that dot the Underworld today.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Funglets are a tall and thin race, typically no shorter than 7 feet in height. Despite their prodigious size, they are a slight peoples and are actually rather weak given their stature. There are three types of funglet, each patterned to have different colors: the fantas are reddish-brown in complexion (with darker spots), the audires are colored much like a bright, sprouting flower and the maculous are a light tannic brown, covered in off-yellow spores. The eyes of these fungal giants are hooded by the mushroom caps that comprise their skulls, often casting shadows over their surprisingly small mouths.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>In the past, funglets were lonesome creatures, tending to the groves of their birth rather than their relationships with other underworlders. Now that The Confluence has come to an end, some of the giant mushroom men have taken to traveling away from the fungal forests they call home and establishing relations with races they previously ignored or gathering together to form communities of their own. Their tightly-knit settlements are seamlessly woven into Underworld groves across Aventyr, typically in burgeoning mushroom jungles being expanded and tended to by the funglets.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>The solitary lives led by their ancestors have left the funglets rather at a loss when dealing with other races of the Underworld. They are rarely perceived as the gentle giants they are, and they see the fear at their prodigious height and ultimately become quite apprehensive with others. Despite their poisonous appearance, masculosfunglets are the most well-liked variety, though the fantasfunglets are valued repositories of knowledge and audirefunglets are respected for their deep connection to the natural world.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Overwhelmingly, funglets are a race of Good-aligned creatures (a true rarity in the Underworld), although there is always the occasional, anomalous growth of an evil funglet, they are uncommon at best. The Natural Force is the principal god of funglets, worshipped by each in their own way.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Funglets may be adventuring for any number of reasons: to carry abundant spores to new regions of the Underworld, seek out areas recently reached by the Honningsop Mushroom or, in the rare case their own grove has been destroyed or overtaken, to establish a new fungal forest. They are capable warriors of every stripe despite their slow reflexes and lacking strength, but prove to be truly potent spellcasters. Many of these mages or holy mushrooms leave their homes inadvertently on unintended rites of passage inspired by hallucinogenic minerals found in locales known only to their proudest shamans. On the whole, however, they are largely druids or rangers, though not exclusively so.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Bollet, Carssish, Ergan, Mraln, Rork, Yawlohh</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Bidoa, Fettla, Helnaa, Lortta, Solvi, Tallaa</p><h2>Funglets And Mushroom Jungles</h2><p>Previously they were quite sparse, but now funglets are becoming a common sight in the fungal forests of Aventyr. When entering into a mushroom jungle, an Intelligence (Nature) check (DC 20) informs a traveler if they near a settlement of the funglets. Signs of their passing are ubiquitous to those that know them, the giants tromping through the subterranean soil and tending to the vast mushrooms that dominate the regions they inhabit. Of all the Underworld races, they are often perceived as the most kindly and approachable; many survivors of Underworld expeditions praise them highly for providing a safe place to rest from the countless dangers of the endless caves. Explorers ought to be wary, however; myceloids have been known to enchant themselves to appear as funglets to lure unsuspecting travelers to their untimely deaths.</p><h2>Funglet Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.NT1fCmCuo7SesTAi]{Funglet}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Funglet Subraces</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.wvbZZm04xFhM0hax]{Audirefunglet} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.EvpeWAT0jLBe7QVL]{Fantasfunglet} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.Lbsg0xl8gK8bj4Fz]{Maculosfunglet}</p><h2>Psilocybists</h2><p>The wilds of the Underworld are not dominated by trees, but mushrooms.

Audire boletus subsist on sound as much as they do the nutrients that most mushrooms thrive on and when introduced to an environment with sufficient aural activity they prove to be a vital resource to subterranean humanoids.</p><p>Underworld rangers plant these mushrooms in hidden areas of caves they frequent, using their growth as an indicator of how much traffic the chambers have seen in their absence and legends tell of a team of devoted dwarves that utilized Funneling Fungi to successfully avoid a siege of their patron city. Anyone standing directly under the cap of a Huge Funneling Fungi receives advantage on hearing-based Perception checks made to hear a noise as the runnels within the inverted cap subtly shift at the introduction of new sounds to its environment (Large mushrooms instead grant a +2 bonus). When these unique mushrooms are successfully harvested they may be used in conjunction with spell components for thunder blasts and other thunder-based energy damage spells to increase the damage die of the spell by one step or increase the DC to resist its effects by 1.</p><h2>Fantafungus “Peaceful Giant”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/fantafungus.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"535\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Fantafungus “Peaceful Giant”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Fungi Forest</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Common</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Strength (Athletics) DC 25/30 (ascend/cap); Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 20</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: Dubbed “Treeshrooms” by visiting upperworlders, these giant mushrooms are common throughout the Fungi Forest and tower high above the heads of most creatures dwelling here. Growing an incredible 1–2 feet per day until reaching maturity (50–60 feet in height), these mushrooms make for an excellent renewable resource for the humanoid residents of the forest. They are generally cut down when they reach half-maturity before being formed into planks to be dried by the locals. Once dry, the boards created from these mushrooms are as strong as the wood of a cedar tree but with the flexibility of bamboo. Many of the homes and various structures found throughout the Fungi Forest are made using this material. It is also surprisingly resistant to fire and only takes damage if a strong and consistent source of flame is applied to the same area for more than 6 continuous rounds—fantafungus is treated as having a damage threshold of 5 against fire damage. Climbing these mushrooms is possible, but ascending to the cap can be quite difficult and in most cases climbing equipment is required.</p><h2>Glaucan-Deporphus or “Glistening-Saucer”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/glaucan-deporphus.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"464\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Glaucan-Deporphus or “Glistening-Saucer”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Kombucha Ponds</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Common</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 10</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: These contain some of the same good bacteria present in kombucha but eating this mushroom provides different benefits due to the digestive process the microorganisms go through after the fungi absorbs it. Eating a 1-ounce serving of these fungi raw begins the healing process for any existing infection or disease allowing the PC to reroll a save versus such an existing condition. If the same serving size is cooked, it reduces down to 1/2 ounce once the moisture is removed and loses this potency; however, local dwarves and gnomes swear by either a cooked or dried variety as a digestive aid and this has been known to help nausea and mitigate the worst brunt of poisonous effects. After eating cooked Glaucan-Deporphus, you may, as a reaction to taking poison damage, remember the delicious taste of the mushrooms, fortifying your system. This reduces the poison damage taken by [[/r 1d4]], to a minimum of 0. If this reduces the poison damage to 0, you are not affected by any effects of the poison. If the poison damage is tied to an ongoing poisoned condition and you successfully reduce the poison damage to 0, the poisoned condition ends immediately. You may only benefit once from the benefits of this mushroom in a given week.</p><h2>Kekel’Ji “Fountain of the Gods”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/kekel%E2%80%99ji.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"562\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Kekel’Ji “Fountain of the Gods”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Jungle</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Uncommon</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 30</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: While a fairly common mushroom within the jungle, the Kekel’Ji holds a secret ingredient used in many healing potions (despite how difficult it is to harness). The cap of the fungi is hollow and typically holds between 1–4 gallons of water depending upon the size of the mushroom. The water, while seemingly normal and quite clean, it is infused with powerful vitamins and minerals deposited and refined by the mushroom (which are recycled each time it empties its core water). The core water is used by the plant should there come a time in which the surrounding soil is low on precious vitamins and minerals. If one gallon of this water is reduced (by 90%) and combined with no less than two other beneficial healing or restorative herbs, one may craft a healing or restorative potion that doubles the normal strength of the curative (depending upon the creator’s skill, the potency of the other two chosen herbs and subject to GM approval).</p><h2>Lunarae “Moon Child”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/lunarae.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"454\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Lunarae “Moon Child”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Scattered</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Legendary</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 30</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: Long ago a Lunarae fungus spore came to this planet from the moon, carried into the atmosphere on the back of a giant meteorite. The surprisingly tough fungi survived the impact and the spores took hold but struggled in the Upperworld environment. As time went on the Lunarae spores eventually made their way into the Underworld where the environment was more suitable to their needs. While Lunarae mushrooms grow heartily within the Fungi Forest, they are very rare. Generally growing in groups of 1–4 mushrooms with a larger “moon mother”, they are considered so scarce that even the residents of the forest themselves have only had the pleasure of glimpsing a “Moon Child” once or twice in their lives. Lunarae Mushrooms are imbued with lunar power and the “moon mother” mushroom watches over the small fungi, bathing them in a soft blue glow and exercising a small field of gravity which stabilizes the surrounding environment. Once per week a “moon mother” may let out a gravity blast which strikes everything surrounding the mushroom group. All creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 ([[/r 4d6]]) force damage, or half as much on a successful save. Remains of creatures attempting to damage or eat the mushrooms are generally found in the nearby vicinity, tipping off would be intruders of the danger. If the glowing blue gills of the “moon mother” are picked and distilled in alcohol for a period of [[/r 1d4+4]] weeks a potion is created which gives the drinker the ability to channel a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ERCv7yuRkQ0YjGx6]{reverse gravity} effect once during the next 24 hours (identical to the spell; the user’s caster level is equal to their hit die). Additionally, they gain the benefits of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.aYmUMcQfSIqYWpKk.JournalEntryPage.9jyye7TeGlY4FRf3#darkvision]{Darkvision} for 1–2 hours, depending upon the ability of the alchemist crafting the potion (proficient versus non-proficient).</p><h2>Mortem Diasporus “Necroshroom”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/mortem-diasporus.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"705\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Mortem Diasporus “Necroshroom”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Ruins of the Rift</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Very Rare</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 25</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: Few speak of the dreaded Necroshroom for fear that the very utterance of its name might draw the netherworldly spores of the fungus to the speaker, entombing their bodies in a birthing embrace that ends with their death and the growth of a new mortem diasporus. These are folktales and myths told to the children of kind races in the Underworld and the legends are vastly over-exaggerated; a Necroshroom is just as morbid as the stories tell, but rarely seek out victims from which to gestate. Necroshrooms are actually an aberration in the Underworld and would not exist naturally were it not for meddling spellcasters. Sometimes when a more mundane fungus is accidentally (or intentionally) targeted by magics steeped in negative energy, the mycelium grows a fondness for the necromantic force and begins to draw the ambient negative energy from the atmosphere around it (some studies show that the reach of the greatest Necroshrooms can be numbered in miles).</p><p>Whenever a radiance energy effect is used within 30 feet of a Necroshroom, increase the die by one step; for necrotic energy effects, reduce the die by one step. Necromancers and evil clerics alike seek out Mortem Diasporus to harvest its negatively-infused stocks and caps. When a dried ounce of Necroshroom is used as a component for a necrotic energy spell, one target of the spell suffers disadvantage on saving throws to resist it; if consumed, the subject suffers 14 ([[/r 4d6]]) necrotic damage should they fail a Constitution saving throw against DC 18, or half as much on a successful save. Additionally, on a failed save, the target is poisoned for 10 minutes.</p><h2>Pizmutiaas “Poison-Pods”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/pizmutiaas.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"643\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Pizmutiaas “Poison-Pods”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Scattered</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Very Rare</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 30</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: The globule spores of this fungus fill up with a liquid vapor and then separate from the mother plant, floating throughout caves on Underworld drafts. After landing they grow another mother plant in 45–90 days; this new plant begins producing spores 10–20 days later. These floating globules of gas erupt from popped spores and immediately change into a liquid vapor when exposed to oxygen. When inhaled this vapor causes a violent reaction similar to mustard gas; a successful Constitution saving throw against DC 17 reduces the effects to 2 ([[/r 1d4]]) poison damage, but on a failure the PC begins coughing and choking, falling prone to the ground and taking 4 ([[/r 1d6+1]]) poison damage per round for a period of [[/r 1d4+2]] rounds (after which they recover for 1 round before resuming normal  breathing). For the next [[/r 1d2]] days this character finds excessive activity difficult, resulting in suffering from disadvantage on saves prompted by any prolonged physical activity or effect that may cause exhaustion. This is a poison effect and any ability or magic that eliminates poison ends this effect. Bottling this liquid vapor is nearly impossible, but if one is able to harness it, they may use it to incur the same effects as listed above (treat this as a flask of this substance with the same rules as those for an acid flask but with no splash effect).</p><h2>Sangre-Tigre “Tiger Blood”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/sangre-tigre-red-glow.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"644\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Sangre-Tigre “Tiger Blood”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Jungle</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Very Rare</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 30.</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: A pool of crimson liquid forms on the top of this mushroom; the substance has the consistency and smell of real blood but is actually a natural attractant formed by the fungus to beckon forth various carnivorous creatures. No harm comes to its benign subjects but if they attempt to eat or drink a part of the mushroom they take a number of spores with them. These spores mature in the belly of the creature and grow to twice their size before being excreted from the body with normal solid waste [[/r 2d20+20]] days later. There is a 5% cumulative chance per ounce of liquid consumed or mushroom eaten that one of the spores gets trapped in the digestive tract, doubling in size every 20 days; after 2–3 months the intestines swell and finally burst, causing the creature to die from toxicity unless the fungus is surgically removed within 4 rounds after going critical—a procedure which requires a Wisdom (Medicine) check against DC 20, supplemented by immediate magical healing within 2 rounds after removal. This process must be performed by another individual and not the victim; if below half hit points during the surgery, the infected creature goes unconscious regardless of abilities that might otherwise disallow it to.</p><p><strong>Secret Lore</strong>: These mushrooms are used by only the eldest drow matrons in ritualistic sacrifices where the blood of an enemy is joined with the liquid produced by this fungi. They then force one of their own children to drink the blood, after which they slit their throat and drain their life essence into a scrying pool. This pool allows the matrons to see the future for a period of 1 day (although the time and location could be off by as much as 1–2 hours and 1 mile).</p><h2>Scutum Boletus or “Shield Mushroom”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/scutum-boletus.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"603\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Scutum Boletus or “Shield Mushroom”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Fungi Forest</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Common</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 20</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: The residents of the Fungi Forest find a number of uses for the caps of these mushrooms, often converting them into makeshift umbrellas (or hats) to keep dry while walking under waterfalls. Denizens of the Underworld are also known to cure them for use as shields. Finally, they may be shredded, treated with kombucha, and fermented to make a tea which, when consumed, provides hallucinogenic properties to the user for [[/r 1d4]] hours. These hallucinations are intense and sometimes (5% cumulative chance per ounce imbibed) result in an individual temporarily losing their sanity and wildly attacking their kin or companions (Constitution saving throw DC 15 negates).</p><h2>Suffocatio “Poisonpuff”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/suffocatio.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"492\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Suffocatio “Poisonpuff”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: The Rift, Ruins of the Rift</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Uncommon</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 20</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: The Suffocatio is an extremely dangerous and volatile fungus; the slightest tap or vibration expels a cloud of poisonous spores from the bloated puffball. Inhaling this poison is nearly fatal for most creatures; bones and partially rotted corpses litter the ground near groups of Poisonpuffs. Suffocatio fungi grow in groups (of [[/r 2d4+2]]) and are found scattered throughout the ruins near the Rift as well as the walls and interior of the region itself, making climbing into or out of the huge canyon a suicidal effort for those unable to avoid the toxic fungus. Once expelled, a cloud of these spores fills a circular area (20 feet across and 10 feet high on the first round) that spreads an additional 20 feet out and 10 feet up each round for two more rounds (finally occupying a cylinder with a 60-foot radius and 30-foot height.) Anyone within the cloud must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or begin violently coughing and choking (gaining the poisoned condition); a successful save means that the character manages to hold their breath and when they eventually take a breath, the save will automatically fail. The cloud dissipates after [[/r 1d4+4]] additional rounds after reaching its maximum size.</p><h2>Sumulis-Tangrielis “Meaty Mushroom”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/sumulis-tangrielis.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"444\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Sumulis-Tangrielis “Meaty Mushroom”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Ruins of the Rift</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Rare</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 10</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: These mushrooms are quite edible; in fact they are both meaty and delicious whether raw or cooked. Considered a delicacy of the Fungi Forest, all manner of creatures may be encountered around these mushrooms, much like Upperworld beasts huddled around a waterhole. Those that consume at least 5 ounces of this fungus during the course of a day will be allowed to reroll the first Constitution saving throw incurred by strenuous physical activity the during next 24 hours (they will also have a very strong urge to eat more of these mushrooms once this time has passed, although this has no statistical effect).</p><h2>Videre Spongos “Twilight Caps”</h2><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/fungi/videre-spongos.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"576\" /><p><strong>Name</strong>: Videre Spongos “Twilight Caps”</p><p><strong>Location</strong>: Entrance/Exit</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong>: Common</p><p><strong>Successful harvest and use</strong>: Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Survival) DC 15</p><p><strong>Information</strong>: These mushrooms can be found throughout the Underworld and always grow relatively close to the surface, thriving on the lighter gases denied to subterranean caverns. They are edible and while not exactly poisonous, habitual consumption of Twilight Caps (an ounce a day across three days) transforms the retina of anyone that eats 3 dried ounces of the mushrooms, granting them both @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.aYmUMcQfSIqYWpKk.JournalEntryPage.9jyye7TeGlY4FRf3#darkvision]{Darkvision} 30 ft. and light-sensitivity. This condition persists for as long as the Twilight Caps are continuously consumed (3 ounces a day) and ends [[/r 1d3+2]] days after the dosage has been reduced or eliminated entirely. When the mushroom is used as a spell component for any spell that grants a type of sight or unusual Perception, treat the spell as though it was cast using a spell slot of one level higher and increase the duration of the spell by +50%.</p>"

          "name": "Gitwerc",
          "text": "<p>These kings of the Underworld live in the deepest, darkest caves far below the surface of Aventyr. Surrounded by hot, bubbling lava and sulfur vents, their rule near the depths of Hel is undisputed. Little to nothing is known of these rare dwarves, and those that dare travel to their lands rarely return. Spoken of only in legend, the gitwerc are rumored to have dark dealings with devils, using souls as currency. Living so close to Hel, they are foul creatures one and all, turned fiendish by their infernal associations. They are both feared and hated by all of their dwarven kin, and many upperworlders are quick to immediately brand them devils. They are sneaking, scheming creatures and while nearly all of them are evil, it is well known that when they forge a pact they will uphold it (although these are rarely with anyone other than dark and powerful beings).</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/gitwerk.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>History</h2><p>During the <em>Forging of the Dvergr</em>, the gitwerc shunned the gods’ meddling and traveled down to the very core of the world of Aventyr. Only devils lived in this hellish realm, powerful beings as old as time with malevolent intent. The avaricious dwarves negotiated with the ancient entities, arguing that playing their hand in this game with the gods would be a boon to both parties; the gitwerc would gain power and rule over the levels of the Underworld directly above Hel with undisputed authority derived by the infernal gifts exchanged in the compact. In return the gitwerc would siphon souls down to Hel for the devils enjoyment and consumption, until the end of time. Each of the absconded dwarves signed their oaths with the evil powers in blood, and all of their descendants are sworn to uphold the bargain or forfeit their own essence to the chthonic beings (often hunted down without remorse should they refrain).</p><p>While they would never admit it freely, the gitwerc were actually greatly concerned with the <em>Grand Sculpting</em>. They knew of the coming of the Dracoprime far before the Progenitors did—were it not for their efforts, the cunning plans of the primal dragons would surely have been noticed long before they could come to fruition. Moreover, the <em>Grand Sculpting</em>, was something the potent and insidious gitwerc had been waiting for since they made their fell agreement with Hel. The devils—keen to strike a deal that would entice the dwarves that had foolishly entered their infernal realm—had foreseen the calamitous event and traded the foretelling secret to seal the diabolical compact. The spite-filled gitwerc saw the great opportunity presented by the sundering of the three divine dwarven races, seeding hundreds (or perhaps thousands—may fortune smile on any that find out the exact number) of their kind throughout the societies of their kin.</p><p>These agents of Hel make good on their devilish agreement, often acting as the morticians of the settlements they’ve infiltrated (stealing away the souls of the recently departed) or ingratiating themselves with the rulers of the realm, plying their ears with insidious lies and calamitous plans. Incursions to the lands of the gitwerc are not unheard of but survivors are (though some live on as slaves, and even then, not very long). The primal dragons chiefly disbelieved any claim that the foul dwarves proved vital to enacting their liberation; some were foolish enough to assault the infernal stout folk— none are said to have been seen ever again.</p><p>Refugees from The Great Schism briefly sought sanctuary with the gitwerc, but after the first several thousand were sacrificed on the spot in gigantic plumes of hellfire, they fled for the dangerous collapsing caverns above. Many of them developed into empires all their own and struck at the infernal dwarves in revenge— their names are lost to history as the vicious gitwerc literally scoured the Underworld of any trace of their existence in reprisal. Even the highest and mightiest of drow, most potent zwerc, and wisest funglets show a cautious respect to the blasphemous mention of the gitwerc.</p><p>They are the most terrifying race beneath the surface of Aventyr and their very name inspires fear in those that know of the infernal dwarves, and their reach is so great as to be of concern to even the rulers of Upperworld.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Gitwerc are by and far the most bizarre dwarves in terms of appearance. Although built similarly to their cousins (stout of body and between four and five feet tall), their rough skin is always a hue of red, covered in hardened patches of flesh or jutting bits of horn. A gitwerc’s hair is always the orange of flames, jet black, or stark white and were that not odd enough, their eyes are either pools of inky black or blood red, and lack pupils of any kind. They rarely wear the accoutrement of their homeland, but gitwerc prefer to dress themselves in the flayed skins of their tortured victims, often stylized to fit the newest cultural trend in the realms above Hel.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The only thing that allows gitwerc society to function (keeping them from killing one another in their sleep) is their respect for an agreement. Before venturing into Hel to make the compact that defines their race, leaders were chosen among them—they continue to rule to this day, and their edicts are law, whether the infernal dwarves agree with it or not. Depending on where one is in the expansive realm of the Gitwerc, cultural traditions can be completely different; some ruling lines have devolved into gluttony, while others are obsessed with sensation or the fickle hand of fate. Despite these variations, one thing remains ultimately true of the gitwerc lands no matter where one might be: they are despicably evil.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>To the calculating gitwerc, members of any race (especially their own) are resources to be used, whether in death or in life. They utilize their infernal charm to ingratiate themselves with anyone they deem valuable, going to every reasonable length to gain their trust and compliance. Once this bond has been forged, the foul dwarf considers them to be yet another expendable pawn for the acquisition of more power. This is all under the guise of a dweorg; any that know the gitwerc for what it truly is are often given the choice between striking a bargain or losing their life to the ruthless infernal dwarf.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Lawful evil is the most common alignment among gitwerc, but any variation one step away (NE, CE, LN) can be found throughout the foul dwarves, but their obligation to siphon souls to Hel entraps nearly all of them to life of evil. The abominably rare occurrence of a child of good alignment has almost always been quickly (and viciously) perturbed, but the incredibly few that survive have become legends wherever they travel (it’s hard to maintain a low profile when you’re being chased by devils). They worship the darkest and most despicable deities, if they do so at all, and prefer to strike deals with the devilish powers they know to gain divine power rather than appeal to the gods they despise.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Gitwerc sometimes venture into the Underworld in search of new avenues of souls to fill the demands of their infernal obligations. It’s said that when an opportunity to amass an impressive number of dying spirits is imminent that the foul dwarves are sure to be nearby, even as far as Upperworld. While it is a rare thing, some gitwerc (pure or otherwise) attempt to flee the realm of their kin to escape their chthonic compact; these individuals are always on the run from or patiently awaiting the arrival of devils intent on capturing their souls.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Belial, Diavolo, Horangi, Mastema, Setan, Vrag</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Caocao, Diable, Luciefra, Shetani, Teufel, Velnias</p><h2>Age</h2><p>The levels of the Underworld ruled over by the gitwerc are rife with a plethora of toxic and radioactive substances in the Deepworld near Hel. Were that not dangerous enough, infernal infections and diseases can sometimes wipe out those not acclimated to the intense conditions. Their lifespans are decreased considerably from the dweorg, though those that accumulate a great deal of souls earn a longer life than their kin and some particularly malicious gitwerc are said to have lived for many centuries.</p><h2>Gitwerc and the Chasms of the Underworld</h2><p>Spoken of in hushed tones by those who know of them, the terrifying gitwerc occupy the subterranean lands directly above Hel (the realm of devils in the core of Aventyr). Every one of these kingdoms is ruled over by an iron fist, with one overriding law that all the undermonarchs share: contracts must be met to the letter. Those that fail to see through the deals they strike find themselves hunted down by the freakish infernal dwarven guards and enslaved monsters, eventually losing their souls to devils down below. Even for those that live by their word, the lands of the gitwerc are a dangerous place. Gitwerc laws are often written with misleading text, so that murdering foreigners is only legal for two specific hours of the day, or that the value of a certain good triples after a lava geyser flares up within a hundred feet of the seller’s location. A Wisdom (Insight) check (DC 20) is required to learn the most important and obscure statutes to abide by when entering into the strange and chthonic realms of the infernal dwarves.</p><h2>Gitwerc Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.rD6ClOZUjEUrW6Je]{Gitwerc}</p><h2>The Soul Burner (Sorcerous Origin)</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.subclasses-urc.XGvmHjVisFgmSmqg]{The Soul Burner}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">The Soul Burner Features</h3><p>1st Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.1o6Upcgjdo1YadCD]{Font of Magic}</p><p>6th Level: —</p><p>14th Level: —</p><p>18th Level: —</p><h2>Underterror</h2><h3 style=\"border:none\">Chthonic, Mutating Shapechangers</h3><p>The foul gitwerc’s chthonic compact with the devils of Hel gave them extraordinary powers and abilities in exchange for a continual boon of souls.

          "name": "Hoyrall",
          "text": "<p>Hoyrall are insectoid humanoids that burst from the skull of the Dracoprime, killing the monstrosity instantly and heralding the Great Schism. Vicious and barbaric in their alien ways, they live within the Woven Warrens, a series of tunnels that they rule over with virtually no dissent.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/hoyrall.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>History</h2><p>The hoyrall are not from Aventyr. Scholars, seers, high mages and venerated oracles have all attempted to determine from whence these strange creatures came, but none have had much success in that regard. All they know is that the destructive hoyrall are from somewhere far across the Material Realm. Their arrival in Aventyr, both above and below the surface, was brought about by the Great Schism, and their race was forever changed by The Confluence.</p><p>During the first great event, the Progenitors (mutated now into the draaki), sacrificed most of their remaining high mages in an effort to call for aid against the rising Dracoprime, and it was the god of the hoyrall, Zagnexis (CN, minor deity), that answered the call. It transported its physical form, called ‘Zagn’, along with many of the hoyrall, across the cosmos and directly into the forming brain of the draconic idol, killing it instantly. The massive half-god erupted from the enormous, collapsing figure’s skull, many drowning to death in the oceans of Aventyr but more still surviving on their patron deity’s enormous back or emerging in the caves of the Underworld.</p><p>For centuries the dual-god watched over its children; on Upperworld, Zagn swam the hoyrall to the southernmost shores of Picollo and supported their booming population by shepherding thousands of schools of fish into their nets. Meanwhile, Exis extended its essence across the cosmos to grant his children a great hive mind, allowing them to act in concert to terrifying effect. After a time however, the insectoid aliens turned to expansion. The halflings of Picollo, at first only thinking the hoyrall to be a minor threat, soon found themselves utterly besieged by their invasion. In the Underworld, they hoyrall had mined out countless tunnels (some leading to Upperworld) making honeycombed fortresses in preparation for a grand martial campaign to capture the entirety of Aventyr in the name of Zagn and Exis. As the time to strike neared they had nearly subjugated the island of Picollo, and their hives below the surface were becoming overpopulated, creating a ripe army to overwhelm all that could stand in their way.</p><p>Then The Confluence came to Aventyr.</p><p>While the colloid is a magnificent entity, it is not actually a divine being. It did however sense the massive displacement of life forms when Zagnexis transported the hoyrall and its physical self (Zagn), and continued to assess the conduit the god used to connect with its charges. After centuries of studying the anomaly, the timing was right and the colloid struck; an asteroid passing by the alien collective was traveling straight for Aventyr. The impossible calculations of the colloid allowed it to wrest away the Exis’ energies using the comet’s cosmic power, and the bizarre creature used the hurtling chunk of space rock to carry it away into the universe. The link between Exis, Zagn, and the hoyrall was severed by the colloid’s maneuvering, leaving Exis half-formed on the other side of the galaxy. The hoyrall were left without their hive mind, and Zagn was reduced to an uncontrollable, mindless beast wandering the oceans of Aventyr.</p><p>The halflings, ever quick, seized the initiative and fought the hoyrall to a standstill on Picollo that persists today. In the Underworld, things went very differently. In the First Hive (the most populated of all the subterranean bastions), the hoyrall attempted to combat the colloid, but they stood no chance against the alien entity and it quickly grew to overwhelm the few insectoids that managed to organize against it. The primary hive was quickly abandoned to the colloid, and the hoyrall left to travel across the Underworld without the instinctual communication on which they had come to rely so heavily. Tens of thousands died while traveling to the fortress hives of their kin.</p><p>What they came to find in these honeycombed bastions nearly broke the hearts of the proudest of their race. The overpopulated fortress-hives had fallen in on one another, all falling to cannibalism as they were besieged by the ever-hungry predators of the Underworld. Still, the heroes from the First Hive brought order to the barbarized hoyrall, marshalling the survivors into parties of warriors that came to carve the insectoids a new place in the Underworld.</p><p>The hoyrall from the First Hive began dynasties that largely endure in the Underworld, though any semblance of unity between them fell away some time ago. Now every hive-fortress is a world unto itself with laws and traditions as different from one another as the hoyrall are to upperworlders, ruled over by whatever government the populace is willing to tolerate. The only common trait among them is their reverence for the seers, priests and clergy of Zagnexis. These holy hoyrall are their only connection now to the god that once made them each a part of one whole, and they all feel a primal urge to see that divine gift restored.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Hoyrall aren’t very tall, only three or so feet in height, but they are powerfully built and possess two sets of arms. Their entire bodies are covered in a glossy, hard chitinous exoskeleton that varies in color by region. Talons surround their fanged maws, which have three small tongues inside rather than one (making them difficult to understand when they speak Common), and the uneducated mistakenly believe them to have two sets of eyes or to see through the large, gem-like stones in their faces, but in truth these were once focuses for their god to exert power through them. The arms and legs of a hoyrall end in claws as sharp as their teeth, each of their bodies patterned with different colored markings that denote to which hive-fortress they belong.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The hoyrall are unfailing in their pragmatism and ruthless, with little room for emotion, a trait only introduced once their deep connection to Zagnexis was sundered by The Confluence. In lieu of familial ties, they identify with their home hive-fortresses and are cold to one another even in those social confines. Power structures vary from subterranean bastion to bastion, but on the surface they have become deeply militarized in an effort to attain the kind of order they once knew from the influence of their patron deity. Hoyrall rarely record the events of their past and when they do so, it is often in bizarre arrangements difficult for even their elders to interpret correctly. These sparing, primal paintings can be found in the most removed caves of the Woven Warrens, the most populated and well-known honeycombed tunnels the hoyrall call home.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>While other underworlders might engender hate because of their appearance, the hoyrall inspire revulsion. Their totally alien bodies are extremely disturbing to upperworlders in particular, and their equally strange mannerisms rarely go over well. Still, centuries of cohabitation(albeit largely aggressive) have forced many of them to adopt behavior more suitable to their adopted home—some have transcended these potent social barriers to form extremely valuable alliances with other races and are highly valued for their otherworldly mindset and abilities.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>While they once might all have been the same alignment (indeed, of the same mind) in the centuries since The Confluence the hoyrall developed into as myriad a peoples as any other in Aventyr. While their cultures and traditions may vary, the hoyrall that do not worship Zagnexis are extremely rare and find themselves turned into pariahs instantly when their faith is discovered, if they are not murdered on the spot.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Life in a hive-fortress can be a daunting experience for any hoyrall, even those with great resolve. While reticent to leave their defensible homes, when one ventures out into Aventyr they typically fare quite well in the wilds, taking easily to the role of barbarians, druids and rangers. Arcane casters among them are rare, and greater honor comes to the most potent warriors of their people.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Dexx, Fargn, Kotor, Marx, Skrex, Zexis</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Agn, Darizz, Kistriss, Oxxa, Treksga, Zagness</p><h2>The Hive Fortresses of the Hoyrall</h2><p>The hoyrall still live in the original honeycombed cave systems dug out by their ancestors. Many differ from one another—some monetize or even celebrate cannibalism while others abhor it, some happily accept travelers and others kill foreigners on sight— and a Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 20) is the only means to find out just how dangerous entering a particular hivefortress might be. Being from the same clan within a hive-fortress means very little, save that killing or consuming your kin in plain view of others is extremely taboo. The infractions against whatever laws prevail in the region are also typically met with little patience. The militarization that persists in hive-fortresses does not tolerate criminals, and the chopping off of a hand is disturbingly common.</p><h2>Hoyrall Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.OiA3LnjgHXSR0pso]{Hoyrall}</p><h2>Hoyrall Shredder (Ranger Archetype)</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.subclasses-urc.n1Y3DSSQdh03Ihd4]{Hoyrall Shredder}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Hoyrall Shredder Features</h3><p>3rd Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.SzPaJqxxXgCguqQn]{Multi-Arm Specialist}</p><p>7th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.oDKAI0lfdpD1JkWs]{Web of Steel}</p><p>11th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.cd13CaDFDee0U0Bz]{Improved Web of Steel}</p><p>15th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.16kOea2PraZs1jBw]{Superior Web of Steel}</p><h2>Hoyrall Feats</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.UcK2RqiWChs02I8W]{Alien Communication} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.aiXpJfxv7epTs08A]{Coordinated Fighter} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.SCXkPE2sNQNd2S2r]{Siktauryi Specialist}</p><h2>Hoyrall Equipment</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.TkJ36soahs5hMZkn]{Hoyrall Capblades} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.zM4Y1ImKUW3jl2yp]{Hoyrall Shellcracker} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.MiGYzuPoLqW6eTPJ]{Mating Vencegran} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.SViiIZG7VNCJkcJ6]{Siktauryi} </p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/equipment/hoyrall-shellcracker.jpg\" width=\"350\" /><h2>Hoyrall Magic Items</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.BuMklNbLfL2qAoj9]{Alien Antennae} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.CV95r1dWkbcOeWi8]{Bandolier of Endless Daggers} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.GIWsZGf1cWK1V1Q7]{Phantom Limb}</p><h2>Hoyrall Spells</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.TyDwTwG0R48B2r9E]{Fascinating Countenance} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.lHUoMPrei2lSuZql]{Hive Mind} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.PJupSyPwstXWQevO]{Lesser Hive Mind} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.DFa4x2M06nrKw8lV]{Prismatic Eyes} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.V5sRL9AIyen3V0XR]{Spit Poison}</p>"

After the titanic Dracoprime’s fall during the Great Schism, however, an entire race of animalistic scions of death began to prowl the Underworld, striking fear into even the hearts of the dark elves and devil dwarves: the fearsome kraidyl.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/kraidyl.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>History</h2><p>Long before the Great Schism, in the primordial past of Aventyr, before even the first children of the gods, the kraydiles quickly rose to become the apex predator of the watery depths under the surface. The subterranean reptile’s talent for blending into its surroundings and its powerful jaws made it a scourge of the coastal Underworld.</p><p></p><blockquote style=\"background-color:#C1AA91;padding:10px\"><h4><strong>Kraydiles and Kraidyl</strong></h4><p>Kraydiles are unevolved primordial predators, still a danger in the Underworld but simple beasts (use the statistics for a crocodile but with a superior darkvision of 120 feet). Kraidyl are the ultimate expression of the potential locked within simple kraydiles and can cite the creatures as their ancestors, but unlike their reptilian predecessors, kraidyl are intelligent, have full limbs, and walk upright.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>For a great many years kraydiles remained as they were, apex predators propagating without incident and masters of their domain—simple beasts for a simple, if strange, world. When the gods wrought the first races the reptiles swam on, oblivious. As the draconic slaves of the Progenitors sculpted the tunnels of the Underworld kraydiles hunted the fools that fled into their territories, but otherwise paid the reshaping of the world around them no heed. It wasn’t until the impossibly huge Dracoprime came crashing down into the endless caves that the kraydiles became something more, beastmen more unholy and dangerous than anything seen elsewhere in Aventyr.</p><p>Many speculate that the energies of the Dracoprime’s tremendous being spread into the flora of the Underworld, responsible for the funglets—perhaps this is true, but powerful kraidyl shaman know the truth of their origins, and that the wealth of the ire and wrath that drove the Dracoprime flowed down into the swamps, and transformed the reptilian beasts, forever changing their species. Powerful energies changed short, stubby arms and legs into powerful limbs as long as a man’s.</p><p>Since their ascendance after the Great Schism, kraidyl have almost completely driven vestraadi from coastal settlements, deeper into the waters of the Forever Deep. Only the most powerful funglets dare to oppose the reptilian menace, and the half-eaten corpses of gitwerc and drow spies can be found across Underworld bayous. Though the Underworld races have little to band together and stand against, loose alliances are forming in fear that the tribes of kraidyl may join together, creating a force capable of wreaking bloody havoc throughout the endless caves, a rampage that none could stand against alone.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Kraidyl are densely muscled and extremely heavyset with huge torsos containing lungs capable of inflating to quadruple their normal size. The off-white and light purple arms, legs, back, and neck of a kraidyl are covered in hard bony ridges that protect it from harm. Baleful red eyes stare out of its predatory head, placed just above its many-toothed snout and powerful jaws. Huge cords of thick muscle run down a kraidyl’s spine into a long, powerful tail that sways behind it.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>There is little hidden beneath the surface of kraidyl society. Their lives are similar to the apex predators they evolved from—highly territorial and extremely aggressive. There is little trade or teaching shared among kraidyl outside of tenuous apprenticeships for the retention of vital trades and skills, or brief mating periods. Aside from essential commerce, each keeps to their own, fiercely protecting their young. Weakest before reaching maturity at the age of 11, the young are almost always found in the company of a parent (typically the mother), learning how to hunt and stalk in silence. In larger territories under kraidyl control, an alpha female rises to a tenuous position of power, meeting opposition to her authority with swift, violent reprisal.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>More hated than even the gitwerc, kraidyl are feared for their aggressive natures, often snapping (literally) at a moment’s notice for perceived slights. They have contempt for all the living races and though they find the dødelig to be amusing and dvergr to be amiable, kraidyl instinctively hate colliatur and draaki, the profane remnants of the Dracoprime, often striking out at them with at the first opportunity.</p><p>The kraidyl harbor an extreme distaste for religion of any kind, destroying shrines whenever they are encountered and often attempting to make meals of clerics, druids, paladins, priests, and the devout of any kind.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>The core tenets of what passes for faith among the kraidyl can be found in the drive debauched rites performed before a great hunt or raid on another kraidyl territory, and they believe their souls are sustained by the death throes of creatures slain by their jaws. Clerics, oracles, paladins, priests, and shamans are not common throughout kraidyl society. They may be paid a measure of respect, but they are kept at an even further distance. These fanatics worship death in all its forms, but it is their love of chaos that brought Leahcim’s attention. Since their evolution after the fall of the Dracoprime, the Divine Prankster has used his power to fuel the few kraidyl zealots in the Underworld, giving them divine abilities despite their apparent atheism.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Most kraidyl worship entropy and death, and can only access the following domains: chaos, death, deception, entropy, luck, trickery.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Kraidyl adventurers are stealthy, resilient warriors. The powerful forms and menacing jaws of the kraidyl make them natural-born barbarians and fighters, lethal rangers and charismatic kraidyl can become menacing bards or sorcerers. Though rare, divinelyempowered kraidyl are fearsome combatants, capable of sustaining their kin while destroying their foes.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Alrdag, Craindee, Krekarr, Loxar, Praskk, Tarkalgar</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Agral, Drethsa, Gralza, Nollsgra, Raassei, Sorrlesk</p><h2>Kraidyl Hunting Grounds</h2><p>Though most kraidyl live solitary lives, small enclaves do come about in territories too large and abundant with prey for just one of these Underworld terrors to rule over. These tribal societies are incredibly militant and primitive, treating each other with open disdain and most outsiders with extreme hostility. A traveler that succeeds on an Intelligence (Religion) check (DC 20) can pick out the subtle profane signs and innocuous blasphemous markings of kraidyl hunting grounds, as well as just how much game has died as of late. Though almost always aggressive, a sufficient show of strength or prowess can earn travelers a short respite from the wrath of these primordial Underworld predators—so long as the kraidyl aren’t too hungry.</p><h2>Kraidyl Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.oKvTwxNml1CsFhbG]{Kraidyl}</p><h2>Primordial Predator (Primal Path)</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.subclasses-urc.ZcItMZGxiEjNMR5R]{Path of the Primordial Predator}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Path of the Primordial Predator Features</h3><p>3rd Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.eY2IeiSBO9MDm983]{Savage Jaws}</p><p>6th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.6l5BQ2vJCVUaubiC]{Primordial Frenzy}</p><p>10th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.P0EFaFF21egrr0xD]{Savage Grab}</p><p>14th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.NsQGGgrAHLDMcTT9]{Death Roll}</p><h2>Kraidyl Feats</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.A5NqVOOkd3BP5xa1]{Deadly Maw} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.uq6TnWZcALRzfC0G]{Expanding Torso} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.ot3w8Dh8tImFvwuC]{Grabbing Jaws}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.IYQ3qTsVZSHfbGPy]{Hypnotic Predator} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.dECiMSsAMVzZmlYA]{Patient Predator}</p><h2>Kraidyl Equipment</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.fv7Vdk0gpw80xbd3]{Camouflage Grit} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.1wBymvyqRRiSWIwV]{Kraidyl Decoy} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.UcOYWWMAVURdcNGS]{Kraidyl Helmet}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.2Kz1lnLUEKp2JIip]{Kraidyl War-Banner} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.c9k1e0Y4rlOUob68]{Severing Maw Trap}</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/equipment/kraidyl-helmet.jpg\" width=\"350\" /><h2>Kraidyl Magic Items</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.GMpXa6wE3AS5vk6P]{Blasphemous Effigy} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.PxiiRZk9qtmimMY4]{Insidious Incisors} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.f10hEHHKMa7WjixY]{Predator’s Lenses}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.dOkzqjApmJLAjo1j]{Kraidyl Slaying Sword (greatsword)} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.mySyuKNP32sOkBT5]{Kraidyl Slaying Sword (longsword)}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.OoZUBm5b56rsbf2i]{Kraidyl Slaying Sword (scimitar)} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.AGG1VCOCQH5Mc8CM]{Kraidyl Slaying Sword (shortsword)}</p><h2>Kraidyl Spells</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.6UiZ7OgYDCAgCogh]{Ancestral Nemeses} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.UBypLR4C4rPccWxI]{Aquatic Stealth} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.2RvVkQo9Iy5D1nwM]{Sate the Hunger} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.bVRldzGE0uGnWN8N]{Gaze of Nothingness}</p>"

Welcomed as kin, their mastery of magic was impressive and became a valued asset among the different but affable gnomes of the surface world. Working the arcane into these newfound mechanical wonders, the master tinkerers and mages—the descendants of the Svirf clan—took their experimentations too far.</p><p>It was never the intention of the Svirf clan to access energies beyond their control—the calamity that struck during The Great Schism could possibly have been contained given their augmented automated devices, but the release of the Dracoprime’s energies reached even as far as their continent, exacerbating a situation that was already spiraling out of control. Details of the event remain sketchy, but something went horrendously wrong during a quasi-magical scientific experiment, and the ensuing explosion vaporized hundreds of gnomes, maiming or wounding thousands more.</p><p>While they pleaded a fine case, the Svirf were still banished from the continent, and the use of magic to augment mechanical devices was banned for centuries. Their fellows did not care where the “svirfneblin” went, simply that they did not ever return. Using quasimagical mechanical attenuators and spectrometers, the exiled gnomes returned to the Amber Roads.</p><p>The Svirf clan took to the mystical byways with ease, leading the rest of their folk—now known as svirfneblin across the lands—but their esteemed scientists recognized quickly (with the use of mechanical devices) that anyone who spent too much time within the enchanted tunnels would be forever changed by them. After the debacle which saw them all exiled, they agreed to each settle in a different part of the Underworld, spreading themselves far and wide in the centuries following The Great Schism.</p><p>Isolated and uninhibited, the cleverly hidden enclaves of svirfneblin prospered in the Underworld, seeing their sciences advance in leaps and bounds matched only by their increased understanding of magic. For a long while, all was well with the slowlychanging undergnomes, until the first clan’s ambition once again outgrew their sense.</p><p>Frustrated with containment in the dangerous Underworld, High King of the First Clan Galdross Svirf devised a means to greatly mitigate his people’s exposure to the magical energies that suffuse the Amber Roads. Using the wealth amassed by his enclave, the High Kin developed a massive enchanted machine called the <em>Svirfdozer</em>, a capsule that could not only burrow through earth, but replicate the material of the Amber Road, allowing the svirfneblin to craft their own transitways across the Underworld.</p><p>At first nothing seemed awry and the svirfneblin let out a collective sigh of relief, enjoying their new means to pave safe paths across the endless caves by connecting the many isolated settlements established centuries before. <em>Svirfdozers</em> became more and more common, quickly adopted by each of the enclaves and used to great effect beneath the surface of Aventyr, all of the settlements gradually becoming more dependent on one another. It was not long, however, until the doings of other races would see calamity fall upon the svirfneblin.</p><p>The colloid’s momentous arrival in the First Hive sent both seismic and ethereal shockwaves throughout the Underworld, rocking some settlements to their cores. The delicate, intricate latticework of Amber Roads connecting the numerous svirfneblin enclaves was shattered like glass when the alien entity landed. Once more, the undergnomes found themselves cut off from their kin by the lethal, endless caves of Aventyr.</p><p>The self-reliance they had been lulled away from was difficult to re-attain, but the svirfneblin are wiser and more loyal to one another than ever before. They still pursue the synthesis of the magical and mechanical, toiling (rather inefficiently, dwarves are quick to point out) in the Underworld for ever more ore to craft into tools, though now they have taken a mindset of adaptation, enhancing and incorporating the world around them into their society.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Svirfneblin look very much like gnomes, save that many have stark white hair and all of them have dusky, dark skin that blends in easily with the caves of the Underworld. They favor light armors and almost always have a set of tools about their person, if not an odd-looking device or two as well.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The undergnomes are very polite, amicable people, but most outsiders fail to understand their esoteric, extremely rational approach to problem solving and life. The pursuit of science and magic are penultimate, only in the shadow of loyalty to kin. Svirfneblin are woe to betray another of their kind, and are revolted by the very thought of doing so to a direct relative. Their settlements run efficiently, using magically augmented mechanical devices throughout to create wondrous cities filled with clockwork amenities.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>Svirfneblin are often mischaracterized as cold, calculating and pessimistic—in truth, they are thoughtfully efficient, comprehensive thinkers, and pragmatic, often determining what to do by weighing the probabilities of success or failure. Their aloofness makes it difficult to establish a true bond of trust with an undergnome but those that do find an extremely resourceful, productive companion of unwavering loyalty.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>Svirfneblin are typically of a good alignment but not exclusively so; their positive morality is a societal trait and not a racial compulsion. They sometimes pay homage to Nearru but for the most part, svirfneblin don’t much care for the gods. Little attention has been paid or given to the undergnomes by the deities, and with their penchant for overwhelming self-confidence, it should be no surprise that most svirfneblin worship science over faith.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>While they aren’t keen on leaving their kin, many svirfneblin find themselves exiled from their home enclave. Overly ambitious students that let experiments get out of control receive periods of banishment for punishment, though they typically survive the enduring trial (thanks to allies that refuse to leave their side) and are the better for it. When a posse of svirfneblin finds a foe too powerful to defeat or hide from, however, surviving undergnomes attach themselves to the most likely means of continuing their existence, which has led to many of the subterranean gnomes achieving great glory in the endless caves of the Underworld.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Bezkyzan, Dryleno, Haszinzk, Mynakysk, Plykk, Tzenri</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Cyzil, Ellyaz, Fyllyz, Naztali, Ryllzi, Zessyssi</p><h2>Svirfneblin Enclaves</h2><p>While svirfneblin enclaves are by and large liberal lovers of culture and knowledge, the steep bent towards a logical existence (a harsh lesson learned twice already) can sometimes lead a city of under gnomes into totalitarianism—rarely of the sort friendly to travelers. The signs are there for those with an eye to see them, however, and an Intelligence (investigation) check (DC 20) tells explorers whether or not they should seek cover or comfort in a svirfneblin enclave.</p><h2>Svirfneblin Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.Jarvd18cYO0LWTwy]{Svirfneblin}</p><h2>Svirf Slugs</h2><p>With the troubles of <em>Svirfdozers</em> indelibly marking the history of svirfneblin, there is a sensible aversion to the creation and use of mechanical vehicles. After the fall of the last network of Amber Roads during the Confluence, most undergnomes have taken to adapting the Underworld to their advantage and developed a pervading fondness for riding slugs. Virtually every svirfneblin enclave, regardless of its technological prowess, boasts stables and pens of mollusk mounts for traversing the endless caves of Aventyr. The two most common breeds are the riding slugs and the rare, ill-tempered siege slugs. Svirfneblin beast masters may select svirf riding slugs as their ranger’s companion. See the underworld bestiary for stats for svirf slugs.</p><h2>Gemcaster</h2><p>Gemcasters are a rare breed who have learned to harness the inherent power of gemstones. These energies are remnants of the yearly ritual known as the Shedding, a time when the magi of Timaeus celebrate the start of a new Shard Year. The residents of the Underworld know nothing of the annual ritual, and who knows what would happen if the gemcasters of the Underworld gained direct access to the pentagram and the crystal shards of Timaeus.</p><p>A svirfneblin crushes a gem between his nimble fingers as he speaks the arcane words to cast a fireball. His opponent, a human wizard, trusts in his enchanted cloak to defend him from the blast, but the explosion of ice permanently captures the expression of shock on his face.</p><p>The laughter of the orc is cut short, when the undergnome lifts up his glittering, jewel-encrusted blade and strikes. Rather than the scratch the orc was expecting, the blade slashes through reality itself, and the powerful orc finds itself burning alive on the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p><p>Each of these gemcasters has mastered a different facet of gem magic. They have studied the secrets of precious stones and use them to amplify the effects of their spells. For gemcasters, precious stones are not baubles to hoarded or sold. They are spell components that refract, diffuse, and enhance their magic. Foolish surface dwellers see only the value of the stones in gold pieces, but the dwellers of the Aventyr’s Underworld know that these stones contain near limitless power in the hands of a skilled gemcaster.</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">The Facets of the Gem</h3><p>Like sorcerers, gemcasters do not need spellbooks to cast their spells. Instead they draw their power from the strange energies of the Underworld. Because of the cost associated with becoming a gemcaster, few are wealthy enough to harness these skills. Most gemcasters become adventurers to earn or take the necessary gold to pursue their studies. What other profession offers the opportunity to divvy up a dragon’s horde of gems?</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Creating a Gemcaster</h3><p>When creating a gemcaster character, consider how your power first manifested. Talk with your GM about how your character mastered the skills of a gemcaster. Did a mentor teach her how to exploit the inherent power of gems? Or, did your character learn the secrets of gem magic through trial and error? Because gemcasters require polished stones for their magic, most come from the large cities of the Underworld where stones are easier to acquire – whether stolen or purchased. Others may travel the tunnels of the Underworld finding and polishing their own gemstones. Nevertheless, a gemcaster requires a ready access to a variety of cut stones, and the source of those stones should play an important role in a gemcaster’s tutelage.</p><p>Why did you leave behind your life to begin adventuring? Were you looking to explore the Underworld? Did some calamity or misfortune drive you from your home? Gemcasting is not a cheap profession, do you need to acquire more gold to further your study of the art? Did you join a mercenary band to earn honor and glory? Perhaps you just wanted to prove that gemcasting was the superior art and put those long-bearded wizards in their place.</p><p><strong>Quick Build</strong></p><p>You can make a gemcaster quickly by following these suggestions. First put your highest ability score in Charisma followed by Constitution. Second, choose the miner background. Third, choose the firebolt, mage hand, and prestidigitation cantrips, along with the 1stlevel spells mage armor and sleep.</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Class

          "name": "Vestraadi",
          "text": "<p>Vestraadi are a strange race of man-like aberrations that rule over the Forever Deep of the Underworld. Their lack of any visual senses is easily compensated by their retinue of tactile, auditory and olfactory organs, but it is their bizarre appearance that makes them so reviled and hated among the few upperworlders that have seen them. They are only now traveling across Aventyr, though none are sure why, and the mysterious nature of the vestraadi does nothing to encourage them to find out.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/vestraadi.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>History</h2><p>The vestraadi are one of the many races attributed to the fall of the Dracoprime in the Great Schism, but records of their race are some of the rarest tales in the Underworld. Scholars and historians say that when the impossible beast’s blood leaked into the subterranean rivers and streams, some of the fiercer aquatic creatures mutated into the sightless men. The eldest of their race, the few that have survived the fantastic dangers of the Forever Deep, know the truth of their origins and carry that secret until their dying breaths. Their greatest rites of passage are one of the most dangerous endeavors throughout the Underworld and only ever taken by the truly intrepid vestraadi or those disputing rights of rulership.</p><p>Far down toward the core of Aventyr, in the darkest waters of the world, ruins that date back to the Prime Event persist despite the incredible pressures cold, and currents that dominate the depths. The most well-traveled bards and loremasters of the Underworld speak of these primal cities with reverence and fear—few but the most powerful vestraadi are able to penetrate these briny dungeons with any safety, and the countless others that have tried all fall to the truly massive sea beasts that occupy the bottom of the Forever Deep.</p><p>For those strong enough to survive the dangerous environmental hazards of the aquatic pits of Aventyr, there are treasures galore and objects of power that rival the greatest artifacts of Upperworld. Chief among these are the <em>Song Spheres</em>. The legends of the vestraadi elders, told only in song during great rites of passage, speak of the ancient orbs and their part in the history of their race, and that of the entire world. None have ever been recovered—they sing out into the deepest waters in placating melodies that keep the enormous beasts that once roamed the world freely in repose on the ocean floor.</p><p>When disturbed by a living being, a <em>Song Sphere</em> trills out in joy—interrupting the lullaby they normally croon—and wake the dangerous sea monsters, quickly leading to the deaths of explorers in the Forever Deep that attempted to plunder her treasures. Underworld sailors, keen to avoid the many hazards of the Forever Deep, have come to believe that the songs are the keening of the sea beasts themselves—a rumor the vestraadi have done nothing to stop from propagating, for the <em>Song Spheres</em> carry more than the honor of their race. Some of the sacred orbs tell the true tales of why the vestraadi abandoned their empires on the ocean beds of the world, and fell prophecies of their seers foretell that the knowledge itself will bring the danger from below to haunt those that would learn of them.</p><p>Still, these mysterious, sightless creatures have propagated throughout the waters of the Underworld since the Great Schism. They are an aloof peoples that keep tribal societies throughout the Forever Deep, each ruling over their territories with a savage zeal. The bizarre nature of the vestraadi still puzzle the few scholars of Aventyr that have researched them, and their strongholds are rarely breached by any army or invasions—the few that try meet deeply unpleasant ends.</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Vestraadi are approximately the same shape and size as a human, but bear extremely little resemblance past that point. Their powerful arms end in three large fingers with half a dozen digits, and all of their bodies are covered in frills and tendrils that constantly shift and writhe about. A vestraadi’s misshapen skull elongates towards the left or right (none are sure why) forming into a sort of ‘tuning fork’. In the middle of their ‘face’ is a large gaping mouth filled with wavering thread-like appendages and gnashing teeth. Openings on the sides of their heads spiral inwards and seem to create a type of ‘pupil’, often mistaken by Aventyrians as the creature’s eyes.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The vestraadi are a tribal, secretive peoples often misunderstood by other races of the Underworld and instantly designated as monsters. Despite appearances, they are in fact extremely sophisticated, and have developed forms of tactile language and other nonverbal communication that colorfully flavor their exchanges in Straad. Still, they have not recovered the means to record their history in any fashion other than oral renditions and thus they deeply prize historians, bards and any other tellers of tales. The place of a vestraadi in their society is determined by what they can offer to the other members of the tribe, be they mages, seers, warriors, scouts or healers. Those who cannot carry their weight are left to wither in the underwater regions they call home, left to defend themselves should a predator come prowling.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>For the most part, the other races of the Underworld are ignorant of the vestraadi. The gitwerc know who they are and what more, they know from whence they came, and the infernal dwarves (rightfully) keep a respectable distance from the sightless men. The funglets find them to respect nature and typically when they interact it is one of the only peaceful, casual interactions the vestraadi can enjoy (though they also get along with the dødelig, as well as anyone does anyway). The hoyrall, ironically, find them to be infuriating in their bizarre ways and the ahool find sightless men to be foul of taste, albeit simple prey in a dry cave.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>The vestraadi are of many different minds and alignments, but they all show reverence to the Current (N, minor deity), a mysterious force that seeps and flows around the core of Aventyr with an agenda unknown to any but itself. It is said they once had other gods, but once the Current found them after the Prime Event, an understanding between the strange, bizarre entity and the sightless men overrode their old faiths in a bloody war in the annals of legend.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>The sightless men are not typically explorers; they only ever leave their tribal homes when forced to by decree from on high, passion or great need. When they do, however, leave the home, many compose long ballads that record their deeds as well as their route of travel, or collect bits of specific plants and rocks along the way to better smell their way back.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: Bs’burigh, Fetzgryth, Glotf ’lty, Jes’thlint, Srelakth, Thyg’dzen</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: Ds’bai, Ig’zall, Meddriz, Oliev, Res’zdra, Vhyg’dzei</p><h2>Vestraadi and the Forever Deep</h2><p>The sightless men might once have been a great empire, but that was long ago. They have fallen back onto tribal practices and hierarchies that persist in the dangerous underseas of Aventyr. While not nearly as xenophobic as the paranoid and aggressive dvergr, the bizarre nature of vestraadi often drive away upperworlders and underworlders alike. Those that persist typically find the weird water dwellers to be gracious and kind hosts despite their fundamental differences. Vestraadi settlements are not uniformly magnanimous, however; after seemingly endless invasions by misunderstanding or murderous neighbors, some of them have laws that call for unidentified intruders to be killed on sight. A successful Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 20) reveals to travelers whether or not they should be concerned with an aggressive response to unintended intrusion.</p><h2>Vestraadi and Perception</h2><p>Unlike other PC races, the vestraadi lack a key sensory organ and the reliable means to gain visual information. Rather than simply giving them a greater range of blindsight (which a GM is welcome to do at their discretion), we’ve developed a different system exclusively for vestraadi.</p><p><em><strong>Vestraadi Sonar</strong></em>. The mysterious sightless men emit an enigmatic partially-subsonic pulse keyed to each individual vestraadi, sensed only by them (unless they decide otherwise, in which case they may make their location known to any vestraadi within 120 feet or 240 feet as a bonus action) every turn they are awake.</p><p>This inexplicable energy extends to a maximum radius of 240 feet, and provides the vestraadi with a means to discern their physical surroundings. Static structures (walls, ground, ceiling, chairs, tables, etc) are automatically detected, but any creatures or dynamic (moving) objects are more difficult to perceive. A vestraadi can “charge” a number of objects equal to character level + Wisdom modifier to respond to its sonar to automatically identify a creature or dynamic object (within 240 feet) with @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.aYmUMcQfSIqYWpKk.JournalEntryPage.9jyye7TeGlY4FRf3#blindsight]{blindsight} (usually allies).</p><p>In combat, the vestraadi rolls a Wisdom (Perception) check to perceive each creature and dynamic object in a 30-foot radius whenever they roll initiative or enter back into the initiative order or on their turn—this very precise pulse is known as <em><strong>Combat Sonar</strong></em>. The DC for this check is equal to 3 + a creature or dynamic object’s size modifier (+4 for Tiny, +2 for Small, –2 for Large, –4 for Huge, etc. ) + a creature or dynamic object’s attribute modifier used for attack and damage rolls or a creature’s Dexterity (Stealth) check, if it is actively hiding. Ammunition of ranged weapons is treated as part of the creature or ranged weapon firing the piece of ammunition. Thrown weapons are treated as part of the throwing creature or object lunging the weapon.</p><p>The vestraadi is granted blindsight against targets he succeeds these checks against until a perceived target actively attempts to hide from the vestraadi. Hiding from a vestraadi who has perceived the target is a Dexterity (Stealth) check made at disadvantage; if successful, the target stops being perceived by the vestraadi’s blindsight. The vestraadi maintains this reliable understanding of the battlefield until he rolls a 1 on a Wisdom (Perception) check, is deprived of the ability to smell or hear, or is knocked unconscious.</p><p>During combat, a vestraadi may take an action to send out another pulse that plays out exactly as the first except that it is made at advantage against targets it can perceive with blindsight. This pulse is known as <em><strong>Discerning Pulse</strong></em> and provides more information, depending on the vestraadi’s level. Targets the vestraadi can see with its blindsight that are successfully beaten on this Wisdom (Perception) check more keenly perceived, depending on the vestraadi’s level. A vestraadi may continue to make Wisdom (Perception) checks in this manner so long as they have available actions to do so.</p><p>The vestraadi is completely unaware of the location of dynamic objects or creatures around it if it fails to perceive them with these checks. A vestraadi is considered to be at disadvantage against any creatures or dynamic objects it fails to detect (even in the middle of combat) and such creatures’ or object’s attack rolls have advantage against the vestraadi.</p><p>At 2nd level and every level thereafter, the range of a vestraadi’s combat sonar increases by 5 feet, to a maximum of 125 feet at 20th level.</p><p><em><strong>Focused Sonar</strong></em>. Starting at 3rd level, The vestraadi may also focus the pulse of the combat sonar on a single creature or object, willfully blinding itself against all other dynamic objects and creatures; for the duration, it is even @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.0b8N4FymGGfbZGpJ]{blind} to “charged” creatures or dynamic objects. Attacks made against the target of the vestraadi’s sole attention are made at advantage. A vestraadi may decide to end this focused sonar whenever it emits a new combat sonar pulse.</p><p>At 3rd level, objects and creatures perceived by a vestraadi’s <em><strong>Discerning Pulse</strong></em> are treated as though they were subject to the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{detect magic}</em> spell while the vestraadi was concentrating on it.</p><p>At 5th level, objects and creatures perceived by a vestraadi’s <em><strong>Discerning Pulse</strong></em> are treated as though they were subject to the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Mzh95utKDPIrjiH8]{detect evil and good}</em> spell while the vestraadi was concentrating on it.</p><p>At 11th level, objects and creatures perceived by a vestraadi’s <em><strong>Discerning Pulse</strong></em> are treated as though they were subject to the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ppWAAEul0QHtm4er]{detect thoughts}</em> spell while the vestraadi was concentrating on it.</p><p>At 20th level, the vestraadi immediately perceives creatures and objects detected with its sonar as though it emitted a <em><strong>Discerning Pulse</strong></em> also perceives them via @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.aYmUMcQfSIqYWpKk.JournalEntryPage.9jyye7TeGlY4FRf3#truesight]{truesight}.</p><p></p><blockquote style=\"background-color:#C1AA91;padding:10px\"><h4><strong>Can I have that in quick-and-dirty, please?</strong></h4><p>As a simple (but much less interesting) alternative to the sonar, you can just give the Vestraadi the following:</p><p><strong>Vestraadi Blindsight</strong>. You have blindsight 30 feet. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, the range of your blindsight increases by 5 feet, to a maximum of 125 feet at 20th level.</p></blockquote><p></p><h2>Vestraadi Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.9hk0MrqI67lCzCBG]{Vestraadi}</p><h2>Blind Duelist (Martial Archetype)</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.subclasses-urc.4sVXYZpiVZ8A31zD]{Blind Duelist}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Blind Duelist Features</h3><p>3rd Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.ij3cA8oCNRCcHEwz]{Crippling Focus}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">7th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.F0kJBqY0YDuM4ws4]{Prescient Pulse}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">10th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.bMVSCtnAuJq30pXy]{Perfect Parade}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">15th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.2yPV89jwMkVVwsDV]{Improved Prescient Pulse}</p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">18th Level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.ETPJ8MOGD3s8sUqp]{Legendary Focus}</p><h2>Vestraadi Feats</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.uvziJXTDWaRswEWP]{Discerning Senses} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.feats-urc.H22sLD8TOHMMuc78]{Alien Wisdom}</p><h2>Vestraadi Equipment</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.hpEc8vq6c11eUVka]{Sponged Undercoral} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.KBFYeoIbZmgfNiVy]{Underslick} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.YSmx9tcBJiu1X0TK]{Vestraadi Katana-Eku}</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/equipment/vestraadi-katana-eku.jpg\" width=\"350\" /><h2>Vestraadi Magic Items</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.qqwqxrE3PVXiFc3r]{Resonating Bow} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.1I0jBL5nVQdvUhzM]{Slicked Boots} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.items-urc.8y1YvBnCJdjh4VwW]{Whip of the Current}</p><h2>Vestraadi Spells</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.VB143AEVitaXnVQ0]{Charming Pulse} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.c21fHIGcZ3FDzDzm]{Dominating Pulse} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.spells-urc.DG0uzGuEinaFgHTC]{Pressure of the Forever Deep}</p>"

        "Zwerc": {
          "name": "Zwerc",
          "text": "<p>Long ago these mystical dwarves coped with the dangers of the Underworld by steeping themselves in the understanding of magic. While the dvergr withdrew as a people, the zwerc did so as individuals, hiding themselves deep below Aventyr as their studies of the arcane and divine progressed. The few enclaves that survived have developed into truly magical beings able to focus their supernatural energies to devastating effect. Shunned by other dwarves, the zwerc are seen as aloof intellectual superiors by both their kin and themselves. They have always been nomads in Upperworld, and are persecuted by their dwarven brethren throughout the Underworld.</p><img src=\"modules/underworld-races-and-classes/art/races/zwerc.jpg\" width=\"500\" /><h2>History</h2><p>After the Forging of the Dvergr, each of the different races of dwarves lived in tenuous peace deep below the surface of Aventyr. War would surely have erupted between the three great clans (dweorg, dvergr and zwerc) were it not for the arrival of the Great Sculpting. Before their very eyes, the cities of each fell to draconic claws and magics as quickly as the forces they could muster to their defense. Unwilling to forge an alliance, each struck their own path through the Underworld, leaving their shattered homes behind them. The passage of the zwerc through the Underworld is by and far the strangest of all their kin. Once unified by their devotion to the study of magic, these dwarves used divination spells to guide their journey away from the tumultuous seismic effects the Great Sculpting wrought throughout the caves. After only a few months of travel they struck a strange, magically imbued vein of orange stone unlike any known to mortals. Only a limited amount of mining was required to break through it—and the hollow channels they found were perfectly sized for the zwerc to travel freely through.</p><p>Dubbed the Amber Roads, they have proven to be these enchanted stout folk’s chief defense against the myriad dangers of the Underworld. The magical byways did not, however, lead farther into the reaches of Aventyr. Instead—to the delight of the magically talented dwarves—it split off into numerous tunnels that led to limited demiplanes tethered to the Material Realm but based in the Elemental Plane of Earth. Each clan of zwerc set off down a different channel, building settlements to rule over within their very own worlds. These enclaves focus on schools and pathways of magic, but their line of rulers are always stonespeakers: dwarves with a mystical connection to the earth far beyond that of normal magics.</p><p>The stonespeakers, devout holy men, and high mages of the zwerc thought they came to fully understand the Amber Roads. They crafted their own quasi-magical routes out of the orange rock, connecting outposts of like-minded settlements and cities that shared areas of research. Unfortunately for the enchanted dwarves, the assumption that they understood the mystical tunnels was incorrect; over time their meddling degraded the Amber Roads substantially (and while they still don’t know it, the svirfneblin are also partly to blame). Many of the channels collapsed entirely during The Confluence for reasons still unknown to the zwerc, and only the first true veins of the magical mineral retain any dependable strength.</p><p>Traveling through the Amber Roads quickly became a dangerous and undependable endeavor, rarely taken willingly. The insular zwerc grew even more distant from one another and esoteric in their studies, though now each ruler insured that there were a minimum of magical practitioners able to perform any spells required for smoothly running their isolated enclaves. As the decades and centuries passed, each demiplane developed unique and strange customs scarcely understood by outsiders; some only ate magically crafted foods, others came to live in cities grown out of gigantic mushrooms, and rumors persist of an entire demiplane where they eschew clothing of all kinds, instead wearing magically-lightened jewelry that (sometimes) covers their entire bodies.</p><h2>Zwerc and the Bastions of the Amber Roads</h2><p>Very little is similar between one zwerc enclave and the next, but two things seem to be universally true; all zwerc citizens must serve a function in the settlement, and travel on the Amber Roads leading to or from the settlement is never to be impeded or sabotaged. While the entire race was once fastidiously scholastic, the numberless different research experiments they all engaged in have led to wildly different customs and cultures. Were it not for the need to be self-sufficientin their demiplane, most of the zwerc enclaves would surely have fallen in on themselves long ago. Particularly astute travelers that succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check DC 20 can reasonably predict the sorts of taboos bound to be present in a particular bastion on the Amber Roads. Some of the most common infractions include wearing the color purple, smelling of onions, and openly carrying a weapon that deals piercing damage. Entering or exiting these mystical realms requires finding a byway of the Amber Roads, which is dependent on a Wisdom (Survival) check that varies in difficulty by region,as determined by the GM (typically DC 20).</p><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>The zwerc are physically similar to the dweorg; standing between four and five feet tall, they are stocky, but not as powerful in form as their distant kin. Their hair—always a color between blue and black but typically a shade of turquoise—floats away from their bodies, distended by the potent magical energies each of the enchanted dwarves carries within them. Centuries of travel through the Amber Roads and habitation in demiplanes connected to the Elemental Plane of Earth has changed the hue of their skin to brown and orange tones. Zwerc equipment, clothing and individual characteristics are widely varied, each developed in isolation from dwarven culture as a whole; some proudly wear tattoos that cover their entire bodies, others fashion armors made from mystical stone and some wield simple weapons crafted from crystals otherwise unseen in Aventyr.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>While traditions between zwerc outposts can be extremely different (indeed, many of the social taboos most consider natural are eschewed by the nudist enclave) they all have a number of similarities. Chief amongst them is the pursuit of knowledge, specifically of the mystical variety. Foreigners are rare and depending on what sort of value they have to the zwerc—bards and oracles are particularly sought, but spellcasters of all varieties interest them—they may be treated as prized guests or with open disdain. The classes of society in the enchanted dwarven demiplanes are rigid but not restrictive; one merely has to serve a function and they are encouraged to choose their own. While the menial laborers, merchants and guards aren’t treated very well, they still receive a certain amount of respect for their place in the structure of zwerc culture. The art of their cultures are particularly interesting, and each of the settlements boasts an expertise in a discipline fitting to their focus of research.</p><h2>Relations</h2><p>While ostracized outside of their enclaves, zwerc still retain a stubborn curiosity that often sets them at odds with others. Their enchanted natures can be off-putting as well, but immediately command the attention of people that encounter them and sometimes engenders respect or abject fear. Still, their unwillingness to relent can often overcome the apprehensions their exotic appearance causes and once befriended, they prove to be extremely resourceful allies.</p><h2>Alignment and Religion</h2><p>The ingrained drive to learn make the zwerc predominantly Neutral. They worship the natural force of earth, but pay respect to all gods of knowledge. The predominance of spellcasters among the enchanted dwarves has led to temples in all of the enclaves devoted to every deity that champions information.</p><h2>Adventurers</h2><p>Zwerc that are cut-off from returning to their home demiplane via the Amber Roads are often left to find a new path through the world of Aventyr, which suits them just fine. They fastidiously catalog all of the new information they come across, compiling great tomes of their experiences, some of which make it back to the settlements from which they hail. While there are fighters and other warrior zwerc, they are uncommon—the vast majority of the enchanted dwarves become spellcasters of one type or another, or learn the ways of the stonespeaker.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Male Names</strong>: boldr, eldur, erde, magz, rok, terra</p><p><strong>Female Names</strong>: aqua, ignis, flo, liqui, scori, zrak</p><p>Zwerc traditionally name their children after elemental lords. Their names are never capitalized — scholars of dwarven lore believe the regression (though some call it evolution) from traditional dwarven society has given rise to a new way of dwarven thinking. The zwerc capitalize Us and We to show their admiration for solidarity and community, leaving the first person pronoun “i” (as well as first names) lowercase to denote a lesser importance as an individual apart from the rest of the clan or family.</p><h2>Age</h2><p>The vast majority of zwerc enclaves require their citizens to travel the world at some point to research new ways of manipulating magic or esoteric arcane mysteries. They leave their wondrous pocket dimensions to travel across distant and breathtaking vistas, ancient ruins, and locations of great magic. Their reverence and deep connection with nature, lives steeped with mysticism, and exposure to clean air and water increase the lifespan of the zwerc considerably.</p><h2>Amber Roads</h2><p>These veins of strange translucent orange crystals are permeable to living creatures, changing how quickly and safely one may travel through Aventyr’s Underworld. What’s more, these pathways are planar, and certain branches lead directly to pockets of dempilanes connected to the Elemental Plane of Earth. To the uninitiated and unwary, they can be deadly, but for those who know the Amber Roads, there’s no better means to journey. Finding an entryway to the Amber Roads typically requires a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check (Subject to GM’s discretion. ) Amber Roads generally tend to have the following features:</p><p><em><strong>Restricted Space</strong></em>. The vast majority of passages that make up the Amber Roads are rarely taller than 10 feet across.</p><p><em><strong>Heavy Gravity</strong></em>. All Athletics, Acrobatics and Stealth checks are made at disadvantage while in the Amber Roads. Additionally, ranged weapons have their range halved and all items are treated as though they weighed twice as much for carrying capacity purposes.</p><p><em><strong>Finite Size</strong></em>. The Amber Roads are thought to have limitations, though efforts to map them in their entirety are not yet complete.</p><p><em><strong>Enhanced Earth Magic</strong></em>. All spells that deal with earth, stones or the like (subject to GM’s discretion) cast within the Amber Roads are cast as though they had been cast using a spell slot that is one higher than the spell slot used.</p><p><em><strong>Fragile</strong></em>. The Amber Roads have suffered greatly from the doings of the svirfneblin, making them unreliable. There is a 5% chance per hour that an Amber Road tunnel that is traveled by larger groups suffers a cavein. Excessive use of thunder damage causing magic or effects and loud noises similarly are known to cause cave-ins.</p><p><em><strong>Refractions</strong></em>. Non-dwarves, non-gnomes and creatures not associated with the Elemental Plane of Earth are prone to being lost on the Amber Roads. Creatures of other races must succeed a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check (subject to GM’s discretion) every 8 hours to avoid being lost.</p><h2>Zwerc Traits</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.racial-features-urc.8ZdLxOFbAApxTPc7]{Zwerc}</p><h2>Stonespeaker</h2><h3 style=\"border:none\">Scions of Stone</h3><p>These (mostly) dwarven geomancers are venerated for their supernatural connection to the earth. Even the dweorg, dvergr, and gitwerc show them respect (and fear) for their divine abilities, knowing full well the terrible powers at their disposal. Their mastery of the terrain is unmatched and they are talented combatants regardless, but within a subterranean arena, their elemental control makes them supreme warriors.</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Creating a Stonespeaker</h3><p>As you create your stonespeaker character, spend some time thinking about your culture and race and how it views your gifts and connections with the earth. How did your gift manifest? Was it a cause for celebration or fear? Is your power the result of deliberate study or being chosen by forces beyond your ken? How do you view your own power? As a gift or curse? Do you know why you have been bestowed with the powers of the stonespeaker? Work with your GM to determine how big a part your potential obligations may have in your daily adventuring life and how you view upperworlders and the more common races of the underworld—do you, for example, fear the open sky? If so, then why? Do the stones literally speak to you in a voice only you can perceive or is your communion with the earth a more empathic, spiritual experience? Some stonespeakers pray to deities, while others worship nature or are atheists—it all depends.</p><p><strong>Quick Build</strong></p><p>You can make a stonespeaker quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte (for pious stonespeakers) or guild artisan or miner (for secular stonespeakers) background. Third, choose the resistance and acid splash secrets of the stone.</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Class Features</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.classes-urc.lN0n2x74lfWahLZh]{Stonespeaker}</p><p>1st level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.7ysMAvUZBoJnyER8]{Exploding Earth} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.ZSDhWgDJLrngTsYo]{Stone Lore} @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.qzLpFNwqeTgf7QWQ]{Secrets of the Stone}</p><p>2nd level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.ARO0queKj5nfDukV]{Tremorsense}</p><p>3rd level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.socZwtw2f2znMbR5]{Stonestride}</p><p>4th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.LqeIjObXG69Eehd5]{Ability Score Improvement}</p><p>5th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.KyXRcWd8eMERcrmW]{Tough as Granite}</p><p>10th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.O4dnN2osIGlY1SKI]{Enforced by the Earth I}</p><p>11th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.6s2igQojPtMiAFFE]{Siege Master}</p><p>13th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.28unRRib3Yr2BNuU]{Earthen Path}</p><p>15th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.oipMGT2HsAKYlPkx]{Monument to the Ages}</p><p>18th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.KkkHsrt2UyDcExu4]{Enforced by the Earth II}</p><p>20th level: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.GNknJO9pw02Gp8hV]{Eternal Monument}</p><h3 style=\"border:none\">Stone Lore</h3><p>Different stonespeakers claim different origins for their mastery over earth and rock.

The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use, cannot be salvaged and has the specified range of the respective weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Broken</strong></em>. When a critical miss is made with a firearm, there is a chance of jamming and mechanical failure. Upon rolling a critical miss, the wielder must succeed a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw to try to fix the problem quickly. On a failed save, the firearm gains the Broken condition until repaired. When a firearm has the Broken condition, all attacks made with it suffer from disadvantage on attack rolls until time is spent repairing the firearm.</p><p><em><strong>Capacity</strong></em>. Each firearm has a Capacity to hold a number of bullets before requiring a reload. This is denoted by the firearm’s Capacity rating.</p><p><em><strong>Maintenance</strong></em>. Each day, during a long rest, the character must spend a minimum of 1 hour cleaning and maintaining the firearms carried. Failure to do so means that the firearm automatically receives the Broken condition on a natural roll of 1 or 2 when the firearm is used. A character can maintain a maximum number of firearms this way equal to his Intelligence modifier, minimum 1.</p><p><em><strong>Loud.</strong></em> All firearms generate a thundering blast that can be heard up to 300 yards away. Creatures that are only 100 yards away can pinpoint the direction of the gunfire.</p><p><em><strong>Proficiency</strong></em>. Unless otherwise noted, proper use of these firearms is more complex than the ones we are used to. Hence, they are classified as one- or two-handed martial ranged weapons, respectively.</p><p><em><strong>Rate of Fire</strong></em>. Most firearms that can be encountered in the quasi-Early Modern Period can only fire one or two bullets before requiring a reload. However, in a fantasy environment, there is no reason why firearms with a larger rate of fire than single shots shouldn’t exist. We have thus included rules for other rates of fire in the variant rules below.</p><p><em><strong>Reload</strong></em>. Each firearm holds a different amount of ammunition, as denoted by the Capacity value of the firearm. Reloading a firearm once its Capacity is emptied takes an action during combat.</p><p><em><strong>Targeting</strong></em>. When firing a weapon that requires targeting, an action is required to be spent aiming, and reloading the weapon. This sets movement to 0 ft. The weapon can thereafter be fired on the next turn and after that, the wielder may move normally once again.</p><p> </p><h3>Rates of Fire</h3><p><em><strong>Single Shot</strong></em>. The weapon fires one piece of ammunition per round. This is the assumed default and unless otherwise noted, all weapons are assumed to be capable of delivering single shots.</p><p><em><strong>Burst</strong></em>. The weapon can fire short bursts, improving its damage. A burst consumes at least 3 shots of ammunition, but allows you to increase the damage inflicted on a successful attack by an additional damage die. A revolver would deal +1d6 damage, for example, while a repeating shotgun would theoretically deal + 1d8 damage.</p><p><em><strong>Spread</strong></em>. Weapons with the spread property allow the wielder to affect more than one creature or object per shot, but only at normal range. When firing this firearm, any creatures adjacent to the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + wielder’s proficiency bonus + wielder’s choice of either Intelligence or Dexterity modifier) or take damage equal to one die step lower than the base damage die of the firearm used. A firearm with a base damage of 2d6 would for example deal 1d4 piercing damage from the shrapnel, while a firearm with a base damage of 2d8 would deal 1d6 piercing damage due to shrapnel.</p><p><em><strong>Automatic Fire</strong></em>. Instead of shooting at a single target, weapons with this rate of fire property can target a 10-foot cubic area within long range with bullets. Every creature in that area must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + wielder’s proficiency bonus + wielder’s choice of either Intelligence or Dexterity modifier) or suffer the damage of the attack. Creatures take no damage on a successful save. Targets have advantage on their saving throw if the distance is equal to or greater than the weapon’s normal range. An attack with an automatic fire weapon consumes at least 10 shots worth of ammunition.</p><p> </p><h3>Variant Rules</h3><p>Particularly if you wish to emphasize the increased potency, but also risk, involved with firearms, here are some additional rules:</p><p><em><strong>Unstable</strong></em>. The wielder of this firearm, suffers a catastrophic mishap on a natural 1 (or 2, for more experimental firearms). Treat the wielder as though he had just been shot, as the firearm explodes and gains the Broken condition.</p><p><em><strong>Lethal (Exploding Dice)</strong></em>. Reroll any maximum number rolled on a given firearm’s damage die and add it to the total tally. This can result in ridiculous damage and truly cheer-worthy moments, but it also renders the game more volatile. It is recommended to offset <em><strong>Lethal (Exploding Dice)</strong></em> with <em><strong>Unstable</strong></em> to maintain the risk/reward ratio.</p>"
