The adventurers’ past actions in disrupting his ritual will not go unpunished.

The few survivors of these attacks speak of the dragon’s wrath, recounting how it interrogates its victims before incinerating them, demanding to know the whereabouts of a particular group of adventurers.</p><p>No longer hiding in the depths of his lair, Volcathar has taken to the skies, hunting his enemies. The threat to the region has become undeniable, and panic spreads as the destruction draws closer to civilization. Fearing for their safety, regional authorities command the adventurers to put an end to the menace, warning them that if they fail, they will be banished and held responsible for the dragon’s wrath.</p><p>With every moment that passes, Volcathar's rage grows. The adventurers must prepare for the inevitable confrontation. Can they stop the dragon before he reduces everything they hold dear to ashes?</p>",

The central fountain gently trickles, providing a calming ambiance as the party goes about their business. There is no warning, no hint of danger until it's too late.</p><p>Without warning, a shadow looms over the square. Townsfolk glance up in confusion, their faces turning to horror as the sky above them darkens with the silhouette of massive wings. A roar reverberates through the streets, shaking windows and scattering birds. Panic grips the square as people scream and flee, dropping goods and overturning carts in their desperate scramble to escape.</p><p>Volcathar, consumed with rage, swoops down from the clouds. His wings create gusts of wind that scatter loose items across the square. The party, caught off guard, has only moments to react. Before they can even raise their weapons or cast their first spells, Volcathar releases a blast of fire from his maw, engulfing the nearest market stalls and setting the square ablaze.</p><p>The smell of burning wood and flesh fills the air. Volcathar lands with a crash in the middle of the square with his eyes fixed on the party.</p><blockquote><p>\"Did you think you could hide from me, mortals? Now, you will burn!\"</p></blockquote><h3>Dragon's Tactics</h3><p><strong>Surprise Attack from Above:</strong> Volcathar spots the party from the air and strikes without warning. His initial attack is a blast of flame to scatter and intimidate them, aiming to create chaos and separate the group.</p><p><strong>Targeting Vulnerable Party Members:</strong> Volcathar focuses on party members that are out in the open first. He will aim for spellcasters or healers, seeing them as a potential threat to his power.</p><p><strong>Flame Breath to Burn Buildings: </strong>If two or more adventurers enter a building to take cover, Volcathar will immediately shift his focus to that structure. He will unleash his breath upon the building, setting it ablaze with the intention of trapping or forcing the adventurers out. Everyone inside the building must make a Dexterity saving throw with advantage, taking only half damage on a success. In [[/roll 1d4]] rounds, the building collapses.</p><p><strong>Town Guards: </strong>If the town guard starts to gather, Volcathar may retreat to avoid an overwhelming counterattack.</p><p><strong>If the Party Flees:</strong> If most of the party flees, Volcathar laughs cruelly.</p><blockquote><p>“Flee, cowards! You can run all you want, but my flames will find you again!”</p></blockquote><p>He watches them scatter before setting a final building ablaze and soaring away into the sky, leaving the town square in ruins.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:center;font-weight:bold\"><strong>Lava Fall</strong></h2><img src=\"modules/boss-loot-magic-items-advanced/assets/006-adult-red-dragon/Lava_Fall_Clean_No_Grid.png\" /><p>This map can be used if the previous lair was destroyed by the party actions during their first encounter with Volcathar. Now, having tracked the dragon back to his domain, the adventurers find a dark, rocky plateau rising above a surrounding river of molten lava.</p><p>Furious at their daring intrusion, Volcathar prepares to make his final stand. This plateau is all that remains of his sanctuary, and seeing the adventurers invade it fills him with rage. Here, encircled by the river of lava, the dragon plans to fight to the death, determined to turn his enemies into ashes.</p>",

People are barring their doors and traveling only in groups, for those who venture out alone never return. Whispers of shadows in the night and an unnamed terror have seized the hearts of the villagers. Friends, family, and even passing travelers have mysteriously vanished without a trace, leaving the community gripped by dread as the disappearances continue.</p><p>A fanatical cult, hidden in the nearby mountains, is to blame for the disappearances. Led by Father Korvan, the cult worships a young red dragon named Volcathar the Flameborn. They believe that through worship and sacrificial offerings, can bind the dragon to their will. Unknown to them, Volkathar only pretends to be controlled, fully aware of the cultist’s intentions. Knowing that the ritual will transform him into an adult dragon, he tolerates the cult’s presence. A group of adventurers are hired to investigate the disappearances. Can they traverse the treacherous terrain, rescue the captives, and stop the cult before Volcathar's power becomes unstoppable?</p><p>The clock is ticking, and every step they take brings them closer to confronting a danger far greater than they could ever have imagined.</p>",

Weakened by the interrupted ritual, Volcathar will fight briefly, engaging the party for a round or two before retreating to his lair. Enraged and humiliated, he commands his cultists and Father Korvan to kill the intruders. Korvan, still deluded into thinking he can control the dragon, may also flee to the lair in desperation.</p><p>Arriving at the lair, the party will find Volcathar in a foul mood, devouring the last prisoner while Korvan grovels for mercy. When the dragon sees the party intruding into his domain, his anger flares, and he orders Korvan to deal with the intruders. With his plans shattered and his pride wounded, this is the party’s best chance to defeat the dragon. If they can creatively taunt or lure him into fighting in the open, they stand a chance of slaying the young red dragon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong></p><p>If the party does not disrupt the ritual, Volcathar successfully transforms into an adult dragon. However, weakened by the rapid transformation, he retreats to his lair, leaving the cultists to engage the adventurers. Korvan will also attempt to flee to the lair.</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Outcome 1:</strong></em></p><p>If the cult leader manages to escape, the party can follow him there.</p><p>Reaching the lair, the party will overhear a brief exchange between Korvan and the dragon. Still deluded, Korvan believes he can control Volcathar, but the dragon, amused by the cult leader’s arrogance, mocks him before incinerating him in a flash of fire. If the party chooses to engage the dragon and wounds him too severely, he will submerge into the lava, swearing revenge once he fully recovers.</p><p>Volcathar will require 1d6 + 6 months of sleep to fully complete his transformation. Should the party touch his hoard, the dragon’s wrath will trigger a magical collapse of the cavern, and they will only have a few minutes to escape before being buried alive.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Outcome 2:</strong></em></p><p>If Korvan does not manage to escape.</p><p>Reaching the lair, the dragon will remain hidden until they discover his hoard. Once they do, Volcathar will either engage them in battle or attempt to bargain. If he chooses to fight, his abilities remain the same as before, though his size has increased due to the ritual. Despite this, he still requires 1d6 + 6 months of sleep to fully complete his transformation.</p><p>If the battle turns against him and he is critically wounded, Volcathar will retreat into the lava, swearing to hunt the party until the end of time. Should the players attempt to steal from his hoard, the cavern will violently tremble, causing the lava to rise. They will have only a few minutes to escape before the lair collapses.</p></li></ul></li></ol></div><div style=\"flex:1;max-width:49%\"><img src=\"modules/boss-loot-magic-items-advanced/assets/scenes/Rnebo3f18BDooi9F-thumb.webp\" alt=\"Image 2\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;object-fit:cover\" /><h2 style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:5px;font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\"><strong>Dragon Lair</strong></h2><p><strong>If the party goes straight to the lair.</strong></p><p>When the party enters the lair, they find it mostly empty, with only one prisoner held captive.

However, having achieved his goal, he will begin to bargain with the players. He will offer a deal: he will not attack the nearby village and will retreat to sleep for an extended period if they bring him the heads of the cultists and their leader, Korvan, who tried to control him for his own ends. Just as the dragon makes his offer, Korvan and his cultists will arrive at the lair, prompting the dragon to say:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Volcathar</strong>: \"The betrayers arrive just as I expected.

The young red dragon Volcathar circles in the center of the vortex, surrounded by flames, waiting for his transformation into an adult dragon to be completed.</p><h3><strong>Tactical Information</strong></h3><p>Every round, a cultist throws a prisoner into the vortex.The GM may choose to have Volcathar unleash his fire breath at this moment.</p><p>If 3 prisoners are sacrificed, the ritual will be complete, and Volcathar will transform into an adult dragon.</p><p>Once transformed, the adult dragon will fight for 1-2 rounds but weakened by the transformation, he retreats to his lair.</p><p>The party can attempt to stop the ritual by attacking, imobilizing or killing the cultists or the prisoners.</p><p>If the ritual fails, Volcathar will join the fight for 2 rounds before retreating to his lair weakened by the incomplete ritual.</p><p>Depending on the party's power level, the GM can adjust the timing of the sacrifices to 2 or 3 rounds between each prisoner being thrown into the vortex to maintain an appropriate level of challenge.</p><p>Volcathar canot engage the party until the ritual either succeeds or is disrupted.</p><p>The cultists are fanatically focused on their task of throwing prisoners into the vortex, and only if directly threatened will they stop their actions to defend themselves.</p><p>After the ritual is complete or intrerrupted, Korvan will fight but eventually will try to flee to the lair beleaving that the dragon is under his control.</p><h3><strong>Flavor Dialogue</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Father Korvan</strong> (in the middle of the ritual): \"Witness the flames that will birth a god!\"</p><p><strong>Father Korvan</strong> (in the middle of the ritual): \"Volcathar’s ascension is upon us! No one can stop the Flameborn!\"</p><p><strong>Father Korvan</strong> (in the middle of the ritual): \"The fire consumes, the dragon awakens!\"</p><p><strong>Father Korvan</strong> (as the dragon retreats): \"Fools! You see? Volcathar obeys my will! The Flameborn is mine to command, his power bound to me by the ritual.\"</p><p><strong>Father Korvan</strong> (as the dragon retreats): \"You thought to disrupt the ascension, but you’ve only delayed the inevitable!\"</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>Cultists</strong>: \"Your deaths will fuel our master's rise!\"</p><p><strong>Cultists</strong>: \"The Flameborn shall devour the skies!\"</p><p><strong>Cultists</strong>: \"Another soul to stoke the flames of ascension!\"</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p><strong>Volcathar</strong> (if the ritual is completed): \"Fools... You have witnessed the birth of true power!\"</p><p><strong>Volcathar</strong> (when he retreats): \"Pray that I sleep for a long, long time... for when I awaken, your world will be nothing but cinders!\"</p><p><strong>Volcathar</strong> (after a prisoner is thrown in the vortex): “Each sacrifice fuels the inferno, and the flames will soon consume all!”</p></blockquote><h3>Map Notes</h3><ol><li><p>Entrance</p></li><li><p>Fire Vortex</p></li><li><p>Father Korvan</p></li></ol><hr /><h2 style=\"text-align:center;font-weight:bold\"><strong>Dragon Lair</strong></h2><img src=\"modules/boss-loot-magic-items-advanced/assets/005-young-red-dragon/Map_volcathar_lair_notes.webp\" /><h3><strong>If the party skip the Ritual Site and goes straight to the lair</strong></h3><p>When the party enters the lair, they find it mostly empty, with only one prisoner held captive. As they explore further, they discover murals in the Great Hallway. A successful <strong>Religion DC 15</strong> check reveals the dragon’s plan to reach adulthood through a sacrificial ritual. At this point, the dragon will arrive in the lair from the ritual site in its adult form, though still weakened by the ritual. It will retain the same abilities and stats as its younger form. He needs [[/roll 1d6 + 6]] months of sleep to fully complete its transformation.</p><p>Initially, the dragon will engage in combat for a few rounds. However, having achieved his goal, he will begin to bargain with the players. He will offer a deal: he will not attack the nearby village and will retreat to sleep for an extended period if they bring him the heads of the cultists and their leader, Korvan, who tried to control him for his own ends. Just as the dragon makes his offer, Korvan and his cultists will arrive at the lair, prompting the dragon to say:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Volcathar</strong>: \"The betrayers arrive just as I expected. Punish them in my name and I shall reward your deed.\"</p></blockquote><p><strong>If the party accepts the deal:</strong></p><ul><li><p>They will engage in battle against Korvan and his cultists, with the dragon observing. After Korvan is defeated, Volcathar will honor his bargain. He will retreat to his slumber, telling the party to leave immediately and warning them not to test his patience again.</p></li></ul><p><strong>If the party refuses the deal:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Volcathar will mockingly turn to Korvan, asking if he seeks mercy and offering him the chance to kill the party. Korvan, still believing he can control the dragon, will submit to the command.</p></li></ul><p>In any situation, if Volcathar's health drops too low, he may retreat into the lava beneath his lair, vowing to return and hunt down the party once his transformation is complete.</p><p>Should the players attempt to steal from his hoard, the cavern will violently tremble, causing the lava to rise. They will have only a few minutes to escape before the lair collapses.</p><h3><strong>If the party disrupted the Ritual Site at Toothmaw Cliffs</strong></h3><p>At the lair, the party will find Volcathar in a foul mood, devouring the last prisoner while Korvan grovels for mercy. When the dragon sees the party intruding into his domain, his anger flares, and he orders Korvan to deal with the intruders. With his plans shattered and his pride wounded, this is the party’s best chance to defeat the dragon. If they can creatively taunt or lure him into fighting in the open, they stand a chance of slaying the young red dragon.</p><p>If the party kills Volcathar and Father Korvan, they can loot the dragon’s hoard.</p><h3><strong>If the party does not disrupted the Ritual Site at Toothmaw Cliffs</strong></h3><p>If the party does not disrupt the ritual, Volcathar successfully transforms into an adult dragon. However, weakened by the rapid transformation, he retreats to his lair, leaving the cultists to engage the adventurers. Korvan will also attempt to flee to the lair.</p><p><em><strong>Outcome 1:</strong></em></p><p>If the cult leader manages to escape, the party can follow him there.</p><p>Reaching the lair, the party will overhear a brief exchange between Korvan and the dragon:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Korvan</strong>: “You’re mine, Volcathar. With this ritual complete, you’ll serve my will. Your power will be ours to command!”</p><p><strong>Volcathar</strong>: “Foolish mortal, you think you can chain a storm of fire? Your arrogance blinds you. Witness the true cost of defying me.”</p></blockquote><p>Still deluded, Korvan believes he can control Volcathar, but the dragon, amused by the cult leader’s arrogance, mocks him before incinerating him with dragon fire.</p><p>If the party chooses to engage the dragon and wounds him too severely, he will submerge into the lava, swearing revenge once he fully recovers.</p><p>Volcathar will require [[/roll 1d6 + 6]] months of sleep to fully complete his transformation. Should the party touch his hoard, the dragon’s wrath will trigger a magical collapse of the cavern, and they will only have a few minutes to escape before being buried alive.</p><p><em><strong>Outcome 2:</strong></em></p><p>If Korvan does not manage to escape.</p><p>Reaching the lair, the dragon will remain hidden until they discover his hoard. Once they do, Volcathar will either engage them in battle or attempt to bargain. If he chooses to fight, his abilities remain the same as before, though his size has increased due to the ritual. Despite this, he still requires [[/roll 1d6 + 6]] months of sleep to fully complete his transformation.</p><p>If the battle turns against him and he is critically wounded, Volcathar will retreat into the lava, swearing to hunt the party until the end of time. Should the players attempt to steal from his hoard, the cavern will violently tremble, causing the lava to rise. They will have only a few minutes to escape before the lair collapses.</p><h3>Map Notes</h3><ol><li><p>Entrance</p></li><li><p>Sacrifice Platform</p></li><li><p>Prisoner Cell</p></li><li><p>Caves</p></li><li><p>Magma</p></li><li><p>Lava</p></li><li><p>Great Hallway</p></li><li><p>Volcathar Hoard</p></li></ol>",

However, it does not immediately notice the adventurers. A Stealth (DC 14) check allows them to observe its frantic searching. It seems to be looking for objects of valor, items it believes are worthy of the dragon egg, as though it is trying to appease the egg or something within it.</p><p>If the party’s presence is detected, the Giant Abomination immediately turns to face them.</p><blockquote><p>What... what is this?

The cold is immediately noticeable, and their breath hangs in the air as mist. The darkness is interrupted by a faint glow emanating from deeper inside. The <strong>cold light</strong> reflects off the icy walls, casting ghostly shadows and faintly illuminating the path forward. Snow crunches beneath their feet as they step into the open central area. The source of the glow becomes clear as the adventurers proceed: the <strong>white dragon egg</strong> resting in an alcove, glowing faintly.</p><p>The <strong>Giant Abomination</strong> is hunched over a pile of broken wood and debris. Its grotesque form is illuminated faintly by the egg’s glow. He suddenly halts as it senses the adventurers’ approach. With an enraged, guttural cry, it lurches forward, saying:</p><blockquote><p>“You’ve come to steal the treasure! I’ll rip it from your corpses!”</p></blockquote><p>When the Abomination is reduced to half its HP, it retreats to the egg chamber and lets out a desperate, guttural howl:</p><blockquote><p>“No!

His eyes gleam like molten gold within his skull-shaped head. He wears a crimson robe and a flowing cape, the color of dried blood, hangs from his shoulders.</p><h2>Actions</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Pyroblast.</strong> As an action, The Flame Tyrant can target a creature within 120ft that it can see. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 fire damage. On a failed save, the target is also set ablaze, taking an additional 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until it takes an action to extinguish the flames.</p></li><li><p><strong>Infernal Explosion (Recharge 5-6)</strong>. The Flame Tyrant casts a fireball at a point he can see within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inferno Wave (Recharge 5-6).</strong> As an action, the Flame Tyrant slams the ground, causing waves of intense heat to ripple outward, igniting the ground with flames that persist for 1 minute. All creatures within a 15-foot radius, as well as any creature that enters the area for the duration, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes vulnerable to fire damage for as long as it remains in the area. A creature that successfully saves is not affected by the vulnerability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flame Shield</strong>. As a bonus action, The Flame Tyrant creates a shield of fire around himself. Until the spell ends, any creature within 5 feet that hits him with a melee attack takes 1d8 fire damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Molten Resurgence (1/Long Rest). </strong>As a bonus action, the Flame Tyrant can submerge himself into a pool of lava or magma and regain hit points equal to half of his max current hit point total.</p></li></ol><h2>Legendary Actions</h2><p>The Flame Tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Flame Tyrant regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Infernal Glide</strong>. The Flame Tyrant can move up to half its speed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pyroblast Retaliation</strong>. The Flame Tyrant can cast Pyroblast at a creature he can see.</p></li></ol><h2>Legendary Resistances</h2><p>The Flame Tyrant has 1 legendary resistances. He can choose to succeed on a saving throw he fails.</p><h2>Lair Actions</h2><p>On initiative count 20 (losing ties), the Flame Tyrant takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Fire Wall</strong>. The Flame Tyrant creates a wall of fire in a 20ft long, 10ft high, and 5ft thick rectangle. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.</p></li><li><strong>Fire Tornado</strong>. The Flame Tyrant creates a tornado of fire in a 20ft radius, 30ft high cylinder centered on a point he can see within range.
