It does not hunt. It simply is, and as it is, less of everything else becomes real. It is a cosmic force, a pulse in the firmament that spirals back into reality across vast stretches of time. No one knows whether it was caused, created, or simply always was. But when it draws near, the rules of existence bend, and the world forget it ever existed.</p><p>Axarum projects fragments, avatars of itself, birthed from the curvature of light, time, and memory.</p><h2>Zal’murak, the First Avatar</h2><blockquote><p>Where it walks, names die, and voices fracture.</p></blockquote><p>Zal’murak is the first, the scout, the ripple before the collapse. He appears humanoid only because minds require shapes to survive. Though terrible by mortal standards, it is only the edge of Axarum’s return. It is drawn downward when the world’s invisible anchor tugs at the anomaly’s orbit. Zal’murak is feared, but it is not the end.

The learned ones named it the Shur-Axar (The Pale Avatar). The people watched, prayed, and panicked.</p><p>Days passed. No voice, no flame, no judgment. And yet, we began to unravel. Words lost their weight. Fathers no longer knew their daughters. Guilds forgot their purpose. Even the stars in our charts shifted, or vanished entirely.</p><p>A war followed, not with the being, but with each other. Faith against fear. Doctrine against memory. We fought to define it, and in doing so, lost ourselves more completely.</p><p>When the last conclave of mages attempted to strike it, out of desperation or clarity, it responded. Not in anger, but in correction.</p><p>Now there is nothing, and the names of our cities scatter like ash. I write only what I can still remember: it did not want. It did not ask. It only was.</p><p>And so, we are no longer.”</p><h1>Shur-Axar, the Second Avatar</h1><p>Shur-Axar is the second known manifestation of Axarum, a cosmic force that exists beyond time, and memory. It is not a being in the traditional sense, but a projection—an imprint of Axarum’s presence into reality. Whereas the first avatar, Zal’murak, is a herald that weakens identity and distorts memory, Shur-Axar is the deeper convergence: a point of collapse where reality forgets how to hold shape.</p><p>Shur-Axar has no desires and no intention. It does not act until provoked. But its very presence unravels memories decay in its vicinity. Some believe it is not a being, but the echo of a truth too vast to name.</p><p>Shur-Axar’s appearances are often catastrophic. It is drawn to regions of high cognitive density—places where life, knowledge, or magical resonance accumulate. While it can be forced to retreat, its connection to Axarum ensures it will eventually return—unless the orbit itself is severed.</p><p>Some cults revere it as a divine correction. Others view it as a cosmic anomaly to be studied, contained, or destroyed. But none who have confronted it speak with certainty. In most cases, they simply no longer speak at all.</p>",
