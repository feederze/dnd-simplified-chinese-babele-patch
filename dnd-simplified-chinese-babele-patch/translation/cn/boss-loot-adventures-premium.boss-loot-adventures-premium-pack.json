This 3-4 hour adventure is perfect for groups who enjoy haunting atmospheres and uncovering forgotten history.</p><p>Once a sacred ground, this forgotten shrine was sealed long ago, guarded by the spirits of those who swore to protect it—even in death.</p><p>A recent collapse in the ruins has exposed the shrine’s entrance, and the party is tasked with finding Sir Emil Corvian, a knight sent to investigate the shrine alongside his men. What they uncover within its halls may test their courage, honor, and fate itself.</p>",

This chamber has doors on both the north and south sides, with two statues flanking the southern door, possibly depicting guardians of the shrine. The room is furnished with stone benches, urns, and remnants of ritual objects, hinting at past ceremonies held in reverence for the deceased.</p><h3>Signs of a Recent Presence</h3><ul><li><p><span>Boot prints in the dust are clearly visible under any light source.

What is the honorable course of action?”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong> The players must verbally state a response that upholds the shrine’s tenets of honor, justice, and mercy (e.g., accepting surrender, delivering fair judgment, or offering redemption).

Responses that emphasize compassion, responsibility, or placing the well being of others above convenience will be accepted.</p><p><strong>Failure:</strong> If the players suggest leaving the traveler behind, questioning their worthiness for aid, or prioritizing their mission over an act of kindness, the shrine rejects their answer. A response that treats devotion as conditional or selfish is considered unworthy.</p><p>Whatever the response, the door open, but any character who fails to answer correctly or tries to force the door open [[/check ath 18]] is marked with a curse.

If the creature dies, your next attack has advantage.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Phantom Strike. </strong>As an action, you can use Phantom Strike. When you hit a creature with this ability, it must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target enters an ethereal state for 1d4 rounds, existing simultaneously on both the Ethereal and Material Planes but having minimal interaction with either. The target can see both planes and see invisible creatures within a 60ft radius. Its attacks have disadvantage, it cannot pass through walls, and it is susceptible to damage from attacks in both planes. At the end of this duration, the target reappears in the Material Plane. You can use this ability once per long rest.</p></li><li><p><strong>Soul Reap.</strong> Once per long rest, as an action, you can spin The Harvester releasing a burst of necrotic energy that targets all creatures within 10ft. Each creature in this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/roll 1d10]] slashing damage plus [[/roll 1d8]] necrotic damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Spirit Call.</strong> As a bonus action, the Soulbound Knight can command two souls from the swirling pool to attack his enemies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Soul Sacrifice.</strong> As a bonus action, the Soulbound Knight can destroy one of his Soul Servants to activate Soul Rejuvenation.</p></li></ol><h2>Features</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Empowered Phantom Strike.</strong> The Soulbound Knight can use Phantom Strike again if no target is affected by etherealness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empowered Soul Reap.</strong> This ability recharges on a roll of 5-6 on a d6.</p></li><li><p><strong>Phantom Recall.</strong> As a bonus action, the Soulbound Knight can teleport The Harvester into its hand from any location.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong> The Soulbound Knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ethereal Sight.</strong> The Soulbound Knight can see 60ft into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.</p></li><li><p><strong>Soulbound Fortitude</strong>. If damage reduces the Soulbound Knight to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or a critical strike. On a success, the Soulbound Knight drops to 1 hit point instead.</p></li></ol><h2><strong>The Soulbound Knight Quotes</strong></h2><blockquote><h3>Before the Battle:</h3><ol><li>\"You trespass upon sacred ground.

His eyes gleam like molten gold within his skull-shaped head. He wears a crimson robe and a flowing cape, the color of dried blood, hangs from his shoulders.</p><h2>Actions</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Pyroblast.</strong> As an action, The Flame Tyrant can target a creature within 120ft that it can see. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 fire damage. On a failed save, the target is also set ablaze, taking an additional 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until it takes an action to extinguish the flames.</p></li><li><p><strong>Infernal Explosion (Recharge 5-6)</strong>. The Flame Tyrant casts a fireball at a point he can see within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inferno Wave (Recharge 5-6).</strong> As an action, the Flame Tyrant slams the ground, causing waves of intense heat to ripple outward, igniting the ground with flames that persist for 1 minute. All creatures within a 15-foot radius, as well as any creature that enters the area for the duration, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes vulnerable to fire damage for as long as it remains in the area. A creature that successfully saves is not affected by the vulnerability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flame Shield</strong>. As a bonus action, The Flame Tyrant creates a shield of fire around himself. Until the spell ends, any creature within 5 feet that hits him with a melee attack takes 1d8 fire damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Molten Resurgence (1/Long Rest). </strong>As a bonus action, the Flame Tyrant can submerge himself into a pool of lava or magma and regain hit points equal to half of his max current hit point total.</p></li></ol><h2>Legendary Actions</h2><p>The Flame Tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Flame Tyrant regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Infernal Glide</strong>. The Flame Tyrant can move up to half its speed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pyroblast Retaliation</strong>. The Flame Tyrant can cast Pyroblast at a creature he can see.</p></li></ol><h2>Legendary Resistances</h2><p>The Flame Tyrant has 1 legendary resistances. He can choose to succeed on a saving throw he fails.</p><h2>Lair Actions</h2><p>On initiative count 20 (losing ties), the Flame Tyrant takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Fire Wall</strong>. The Flame Tyrant creates a wall of fire in a 20ft long, 10ft high, and 5ft thick rectangle. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.</p></li><li><strong>Fire Tornado</strong>. The Flame Tyrant creates a tornado of fire in a 20ft radius, 30ft high cylinder centered on a point he can see within range. The inferno whips up the terrain, melting or burning the ground and filling the air with ash and embers. For the next minute, the area within the cylinder becomes difficult terrain.</li></ol><h2>Tactics</h2><ol><li><p>The Flame Tyrant will use his Fire Shield and Infernal Glide to deter close combat and maintain distance from the players.</p></li><li><p>He will use his helm ability Ember Gaze on wounded enemies.</p></li><li><p>When engaged in melee he will use Inferno Wave.</p></li><li><p>He targets players vulnerable to fire with Pyroblast.</p></li><li><p>He will cast Infernal Explosion, aiming to damage as many players as possible.</p></li><li><p>When his hit points are halved, he will utilize Molten Resurgence to heal.</p></li></ol><h2>The Flame Tyrant Quotes</h2><blockquote><ol><li><p>\"I am the Flame Tyrant, and my rule shall scorch the world's pages with tales of my glory!\"</p></li><li><p>\"Fire cleanses, purifies, and destroys. You think yourselves strong enough to command it? Let us test your resolve.\"</p></li><li><p>\"Extinguish my flames? Foolish mortals. My flames are eternal, as is my dominion over them. You will burn or bow.\"</p></li><li><p>\"Negotiate? There is but one negotiation: my will or your demise. What could you possibly offer that matches the power of fire?\"</p></li><li><p>\"My flames are eternal, my power unyielding. Bow or burn.\"</p></li><li><p>\"The inferno that courses through me cannot be tamed by mortals. I am a living testament to fire's supremacy.\"</p></li><li><p>\"Ah, the ants dare to challenge the Flame Tyrant himself. Your defiance shall be a testament to the power of the inferno!\"</p></li><li><p>\"Knowledge, you say? Power's true nature lies in wielding it, not in understanding it. But if you seek power, then face me and prove your worth.\"</p></li></ol></blockquote></div>"

People are barring their doors and traveling only in groups, for those who venture out alone never return. Whispers of shadows in the night and an unnamed terror have seized the hearts of the villagers. Friends, family, and even passing travelers have mysteriously vanished without a trace, leaving the community gripped by dread as the disappearances continue.</p><p>A fanatical cult, hidden in the nearby mountains, is to blame for the disappearances. Led by Father Korvan, the cult worships a young red dragon named Volcathar the Flameborn. They believe that through worship and sacrificial offerings, can bind the dragon to their will. Unknown to them, Volkathar only pretends to be controlled, fully aware of the cultist’s intentions. Knowing that the ritual will transform him into an adult dragon, he tolerates the cult’s presence. A group of adventurers are hired to investigate the disappearances. Can they traverse the treacherous terrain, rescue the captives, and stop the cult before Volcathar's power becomes unstoppable?</p><p>The clock is ticking, and every step they take brings them closer to confronting a danger far greater than they could ever have imagined.</p>",

Every initiate, with the help of their fellow cultists, must capture and offer a victim as part of their initiation. The cultists believe that true power comes from within and that weapons are for the weak, for only those who rely on their own strength are deemed worthy of channeling <strong>Volcathar’s</strong> flames. They aim to reflect the might of the dragon, who needs no mortal weapons to instill terror. At the heart of their combat style and ritual practice are the <strong>Bracers of Ignition</strong>, magical items crafted from Volcathar's scales. These bracers are gifted to each cultist after they take the Vow of the Burning Flesh. They see the flames that erupt from their bracers as a sign that the dragon’s magic flows through them.</p>"

The cultists, fanatical and aggressive, immediately attack, shouting:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Cultist</strong>: “You’ll be fuel for the ritual!”</p><p><strong>Cultist</strong>: “Burn in the name of the Flameborn!”</p></blockquote><h3><strong>If any cultist is still alive</strong></h3><p>The party can use <strong>Persuade DC 14</strong> to extract information. The surviving cultist responds cryptically, his gaze fixed on a distant glowing red light. He says:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Cultist</strong>: “Look, the fangs of the world are awakening. His true power is nearly here! Father Korvan will bind the god to his will, and we will be reborn as fire lords!”</p><p><strong>Cultist</strong> (pointing in another direction): “The lair where the god will be resting.”</p><p><strong>Cultist</strong> (gasps with his last breath): “More lost in chains, both in the god's lair and where the flames claim their prize.”</p></blockquote><h3><strong>If no cultists are alive</strong></h3><p>The party can <strong>Investigate DC 12</strong> by searching their bodies. They find cryptic drawings and notes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Drawing:</strong> Shows jagged cliffs beneath a red sky, with the caption: <em>\"Where the flames rise, so does he.\"</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refers to the lair: <em>\"Return to the nest before the god is truly born.

Anyone within 25ft of the center of the vortex must make a <strong>Constitution DC 14</strong> saving throw or take [[/roll 2d6]] fire damage at the start of their turn. Surrounding the vortex are sharp, rocky spires that rise up to 20ft in height, resembling the fangs of some enormous creature. Players can climb or descend these spires, but if they want to jump, they need to succeed on a <strong>DC 12 Acrobatics</strong> check.</p><p>The party arrives just in time to witness a dark ritual in progress. Father Korvan and five cultists are preparing to throw prisoners into the vortex to fuel the ritual. Five other cultists stand guard. The young red dragon Volcathar circles in the center of the vortex, surrounded by flames, waiting for his transformation into an adult dragon to be completed.</p><h3><strong>Tactical Information</strong></h3><p>Every round, a cultist throws a prisoner into the vortex.The GM may choose to have Volcathar unleash his fire breath at this moment.</p><p>If 3 prisoners are sacrificed, the ritual will be complete, and Volcathar will transform into an adult dragon.</p><p>Once transformed, the adult dragon will fight for 1-2 rounds but weakened by the transformation, he retreats to his lair.</p><p>The party can attempt to stop the ritual by attacking, imobilizing or killing the cultists or the prisoners.</p><p>If the ritual fails, Volcathar will join the fight for 2 rounds before retreating to his lair weakened by the incomplete ritual.</p><p>Depending on the party's power level, the GM can adjust the timing of the sacrifices to 2 or 3 rounds between each prisoner being thrown into the vortex to maintain an appropriate level of challenge.</p><p>Volcathar canot engage the party until the ritual either succeeds or is disrupted.</p><p>The cultists are fanatically focused on their task of throwing prisoners into the vortex, and only if directly threatened will they stop their actions to defend themselves.</p><p>After the ritual is complete or intrerrupted, Korvan will fight but eventually will try to flee to the lair beleaving that the dragon is under his control.</p><h3><strong>Flavor Dialogue</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Father Korvan</strong> (in the middle of the ritual): \"Witness the flames that will birth a god!\"</p><p><strong>Father Korvan</strong> (in the middle of the ritual): \"Volcathar’s ascension is upon us!

The central fountain gently trickles, providing a calming ambiance as the party goes about their business. There is no warning, no hint of danger until it's too late.</p><p>Without warning, a shadow looms over the square. Townsfolk glance up in confusion, their faces turning to horror as the sky above them darkens with the silhouette of massive wings. A roar reverberates through the streets, shaking windows and scattering birds. Panic grips the square as people scream and flee, dropping goods and overturning carts in their desperate scramble to escape.</p><p>Volcathar, consumed with rage, swoops down from the clouds. His wings create gusts of wind that scatter loose items across the square. The party, caught off guard, has only moments to react. Before they can even raise their weapons or cast their first spells, Volcathar releases a blast of fire from his maw, engulfing the nearest market stalls and setting the square ablaze.</p><p>The smell of burning wood and flesh fills the air. Volcathar lands with a crash in the middle of the square with his eyes fixed on the party.</p><blockquote><p>\"Did you think you could hide from me, mortals? Now, you will burn!\"</p></blockquote><h3>Dragon's Tactics</h3><p><strong>Surprise Attack from Above:</strong> Volcathar spots the party from the air and strikes without warning. His initial attack is a blast of flame to scatter and intimidate them, aiming to create chaos and separate the group.</p><p><strong>Targeting Vulnerable Party Members:</strong> Volcathar focuses on party members that are out in the open first. He will aim for spellcasters or healers, seeing them as a potential threat to his power.</p><p><strong>Flame Breath to Burn Buildings: </strong>If two or more adventurers enter a building to take cover, Volcathar will immediately shift his focus to that structure. He will unleash his breath upon the building, setting it ablaze with the intention of trapping or forcing the adventurers out. Everyone inside the building must make a Dexterity saving throw with advantage, taking only half damage on a success. In [[/roll 1d4]] rounds, the building collapses.</p><p><strong>Town Guards: </strong>If the town guard starts to gather, Volcathar may retreat to avoid an overwhelming counterattack.</p><p><strong>If the Party Flees:</strong> If most of the party flees, Volcathar laughs cruelly.</p><blockquote><p>“Flee, cowards! You can run all you want, but my flames will find you again!”</p></blockquote><p>He watches them scatter before setting a final building ablaze and soaring away into the sky, leaving the town square in ruins.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:center;font-weight:bold\"><strong>Lava Fall</strong></h2><img src=\"modules/boss-loot-adventures-premium/assets/006-adult-red-dragon/Lava_Fall_Clean_No_Grid.png\" /><p>This map can be used if the previous lair was destroyed by the party actions during their first encounter with Volcathar. Now, having tracked the dragon back to his domain, the adventurers find a dark, rocky plateau rising above a surrounding river of molten lava.</p><p>Furious at their daring intrusion, Volcathar prepares to make his final stand. This plateau is all that remains of his sanctuary, and seeing the adventurers invade it fills him with rage. Here, encircled by the river of lava, the dragon plans to fight to the death, determined to turn his enemies into ashes.</p>"

Each aspect has its own agenda, shaped by the Architect’s failed experiment to sever an unwanted part of him.</p><p>The adventurers must traverse the tower’s levels, solving puzzles, navigating traps, and overcoming challenges, while deciding which aspects to aid and which to exclude from the experiment. Along the way, they uncover the tower’s secrets, including its unstable void-powered magic, its connection to a petrified blue dragon, and the wizard’s struggles with ambition, love, and regret.</p><p>The adventure combines exploration, moral dilemmas, and combat, challenging the adventurers to balance logic, emotion, ambition, fear, and curiosity as they unravel the mystery of the tower.</p>",

Expending 2 charges allows you to summon a tornado that travels to a creature within 60ft. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.

This action does not consume any charges.</p><p><strong>Thunderstorm of Misery</strong>. Expending 9 charges you can summoning a powerful storm around you in a 50ft radius for 1 minute. The storm creates dangerous terrain, making the ground slippery and filled with debris, making it difficult for creatures within the area of effect to move around. The winds, lightning strikes and heavy rain make it hard for creatures to see or hear, imposing disadvantage on any perception checks made while within the storm. The storm also unleashes bolts of lightning, forcing creatures within the affected area, to make a Dexterity saving throw.

Each aspect has its own agenda, shaped by the Architect’s failed experiment to sever an unwanted part of him.</p><p>The adventurers must traverse the tower’s levels, solving puzzles, navigating traps, and overcoming challenges, while deciding which aspects to aid and which to exclude from the experiment. Along the way, they uncover the tower’s secrets, including its unstable void-powered magic, its connection to a petrified blue dragon, and the wizard’s struggles with ambition, love, and regret.</p><p>The adventure combines exploration, moral dilemmas, and combat, challenging the adventurers to balance logic, emotion, ambition, fear, and curiosity as they unravel the mystery of the tower.</p><p>The adventure can be summarized in 3 acts:</p><p><strong>Act 1: The Puzzle of the Entrance</strong><br />The adventurers explore the lower levels of the tower, meet the five aspects representing the different personalities of the Architect, and solve the orb puzzle at the entrance. Completing the puzzle stabilizes the tower’s arcane flow and unlocks access to the upper levels.</p><p><strong>Act 2: The Roof Confrontation</strong><br />The adventurers ascend to the roof to retrieve energy cells required to power the experiment and reunite the fractured personalities of the Architect. On the roof, they face environmental hazards and battle voidling elementals drawn to the unstable energy.</p><p><strong>Act 3: The Experiment and the Final Confrontation</strong><br />In the Arcane Circle room, the adventurers power the experiment, solve the light-beam puzzle, and select a maximum of four aspects to reunite in the Architect’s mind. When the Architect is summoned, the excluded aspect exerts control over his mind, while any aspects whose quests were not completed turn hostile. The adventurers must defeat these enemies, stabilize the Architect, and determine the tower’s final fate.</p>"

The device is unstable and linked to the tower's arcane systems. On the opposite side of the room, a stone throne is positioned between two larger orbs. A staircase leads upward, and another staircase descends to a lower level.</p><h2>Puzzle</h2><p>The puzzle in the entrance room involves eight energy orbs that can be turned on or off. To solve it, the adventurers must determine which orbs need to be activated and the correct sequence to activate them. The first clue is found in the @UUID[JournalEntry.Y3ga0FQtUAMPQNaU]{Handout: Codex of the Arcane Engine}, located in the Bedroom. If the adventurers bring the codex to the @UUID[Actor.qkJAdaRGhEk5CSXu]{Scholar}, he explains that each orb at the entrance is linked to specific rooms in the tower. The adventurers must identify which orbs are pulsing in each room and activate the corresponding orbs at the entrance in ascending order based on the tower's levels.</p><p><em>Hint: Pulsing orbs can be seen more clearly in the dark.</em></p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> In the Entrance Room, there are two large orbs, but only one is pulsing. This orb must be pressed first. The next set of orbs is in the Specimen Room, where three of the five orbs are pulsing at varying speeds. These three orbs can be pressed in any order after the first. The final pulsing orb is located in the Bedroom and is the only orb in that room. At the entrance, the corresponding orb must be activated last to complete the sequence.</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The levitation glyph in the Bedroom is now active and provides access to the Arcane Circle room.</p><h2>Hazards</h2><p>The small orbs are interactive and can be switched on or off. Activating the orbs in the incorrect order cause the crystalline device to release harmful energy or summon elementals:</p><ul><li><p>On the first incorrect activation, the crystalline magical device summons three elementals to attack the adventurers.</p></li><li><p>For each subsequent incorrect activation, the following effects occur in sequence:</p><ol><li><p>Sonic damage, use the Sonic Damage from the orb's abilities.</p></li><li><p>Lightning damage, use the Lightning Damage from the orb's abilities.</p></li><li><p>Necrotic damage.</p></li></ol></li></ul><p>After these three effects, if the adventurers continue pressing the orbs in the wrong sequence, the GM can choose which ability of the crystalline magical device to activate next.<br />Additionally, when the crystalline device triggers any of its harmful abilities due to an incorrect sequence, all the orbs turn off, forcing the adventurers to start the sequence again.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The crystalline magical device cannot be destroyed. While players may attempt to attack it, it is immune to all types of damage.</p><p>Because of the tower's volatile arcane energy and chaotic weather, aerial movement is far too dangerous to attempt. <br />Climbing the tower requires DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check every round for climbing the polished surface. Failure results in a slip, losing 15ft of progress, and requiring a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling. A creature affected by the Spider Climb spell bypasses the need for climbing checks entirely. <br />Falling damage is 1d6 bludgeoning for every 10ft fallen. Each floor has a height of 14ft. <br />If they manage to climb to level 5, they will find a balcony with locked doors. A DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check is required to pick the lock, or a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to brute-force the door. Similarly, if they climb to level 6, they will encounter another set of locked doors with the same requirements. If they climb to level 7 and reach the roof, they will trigger a combat encounter.</p><h2>Interactive Map Features</h2><p>@UUID[Macro.kfOzqfjgG8VQErb5]{Enable/Disable Regions} (enables or disables teleporting regions)</p><p>@UUID[Macro.pL9tL6WRxevy4dzt]{Lights Orb Puzzle} (easily turn on/off the puzzle lights)</p>"
