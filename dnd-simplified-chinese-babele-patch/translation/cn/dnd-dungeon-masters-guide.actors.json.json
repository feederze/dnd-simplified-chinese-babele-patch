Until a vicious vine moves, there’s nothing to distinguish it from an inanimate vine.</p><p>Each vicious vine has AC 11; HP 16; and to Immunity Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Psychic damage. When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the vine for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the vine tries to coil around that creature. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or have the Grappled condition (escape DC 12). While Grappled in this way, the target takes 5 (1d10) Necrotic damage from the vine’s life-draining thorns at the start of each of the target’s turns. The vine can grapple only one creature at a time.</p><p>As an Influence action, a character under the effect of a <em>Speak with Plants</em> spell or similar magic can try to persuade the vine to release its victim, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A creature released by the vine in this way won’t be attacked by that vine again for the next 24 hours.</p><p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Necrotic damage, the save DC, and the escape DC, as shown in the following table.</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Levels</p></th><th><p>Necrotic Damage</p></th><th><p>Save/Escape DC</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>5–10</p></td><td><p>11 (2d10)</p></td><td><p>14</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11–16</p></td><td><p>22 (4d10)</p></td><td><p>16</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17–20</p></td><td><p>55 (10d10)</p></td><td><p>18</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",
