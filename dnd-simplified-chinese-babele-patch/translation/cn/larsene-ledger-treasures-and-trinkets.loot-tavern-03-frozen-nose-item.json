Instead of a melee weapon attack, make a ranged weapon attack against a target within <strong>30 feet</strong> of you, using your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and it must succeed on a <strong>DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</strong> or become <span id=\"was-tagged\"><strong>grappled</strong></span> (<strong>escape DC 15</strong>) as the thread wraps itself around it. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is <span id=\"was-tagged\"><strong>restrained</strong></span> while it is <span id=\"was-tagged\">grappled</span> in this way. Huge or larger creatures have <strong>disadvantage</strong> on the saving throw. The <span id=\"was-tagged\">grappled</span> creature or a creature within reach of it can attempt a <strong>DC 15 Strength</strong> check, ending the grapple on a success. The grapple also ends if you pull the axe's blade back towards the weapon (no action required) or if you let go of the axe. While you have a creature <span id=\"was-tagged\">grappled</span> in this way, you can't attack with the <em>suneater axe</em>. As a bonus action, you can try to reel the creature in, making a <strong>Strength (</strong><span id=\"was-tagged\"><strong>Athletics</strong></span><strong>)</strong> check, contested by one from the <span id=\"was-tagged\">grappled</span> creature. On a success, you pull the target up to <strong>15 feet</strong> towards you.</p><p><em><strong>Light.</strong></em> A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Thrown.</strong></em> If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p>"
