          "text": "<p>Welcome to Weapons of Lore—a 5E supplement of wondrously magical weapons.</p><p>This book contains more than 140 magical weapons, including cursed, rechargeable, traditional, and weapons that increase in power. These unique creations can be handed out as treasure, provided as a reward, found in forgotten and lost locations, or be wielded by an adversary.</p><figure class=\"wol-img-right\"><img src=\"modules/weapons-of-lore/assets/weapons/Eclipses Edge.webp\" width=\"200\" /></figure><h1>What's Inside?</h1><p>This supplement contains several sections: Weapons of Lore, Cursed Weapons, Rechargeable Weapons, Enterprising Entrepreneurs, and Traditional Weapons.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Weapons of Lore</strong>. Weapons that increase in power as the attuned creature gains experience, completes tasks, or fulfills quests. Each of these entries includes the weapon's Lore, Location, Encounter Ideas, Progression Rules, and the Weapon's Progressing Statistics.</p></li><li><strong>Cursed Weapons</strong>. Weapons that give and take.</li><li>Rechargeable Weapons. Weapons with limited charges, requiring the successful completion of a ritual or task to replenish the expended charges.</li><li><strong>Enterprising Entrepreneurs</strong>. NPCs that can help the adventurers recharge their weapons.</li><li><strong>Traditional Weapons</strong>. Weapons that do not increase in power, are free of curses, and recharge with a rest.</li></ul><h1>Weapons of Lore</h1><p>The first section of this supplement contains Weapons of Lore. Each of these entries features lore, encounter ideas to give GMs inspiration on how to add the weapons to their campaign, and fantastic artwork. We also include progression rules for advancing the weapon's power (which rises in tandem with its rarity). The criteria for advancement might range from character level, character tier, a character's proficiency bonus, or quests and tasks that need to be completed. Examples of these tasks include sacrificing hit points or Hit Dice, ability score reduction, or the acquisition of additional weapon parts.</p><h3>References to Cthulhu</h3><p>Several weapons in this supplement reference Cthulhu, a concept created by H.P. Lovecraft whose work is considered public domain.</p><h2>Attunement</h2><figure class=\"wol-img-right\"><img src=\"modules/weapons-of-lore/assets/weapons/Mariways Staff 1.webp\" width=\"150\" /></figure><p>Since Weapons of Lore advance as the character advances, the character must link themselves to the weapon, forming a bond so they can grow in power together. This is achieved via attunement. It is important to note that even the common version of a Weapon of Lore requires attunement. This is an atypical characteristic for a common magic weapon.</p><p>Some of the weapons have special attunement requirements. You may choose to remove these special requirements, but if you do, please note that they do help balance the weapon's long-term power so removing them might affect your campaign's difficulty curve.</p><p>Let's look at the Mariway's Staff as an example of special attunement requirements.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Common</strong>. <em><strong>Mariway's Cost</strong></em>. When you attune to this magic weapon, you must permanently sacrifice one Hit Die to the weapon. The sacrificed Hit Die empowers the weapon's future traits, increasing its unique ability as it progresses.</p><p><strong>Uncommon.</strong> You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.</p><p><em><strong>Mariway's Health</strong></em>. While holding this weapon, you can use a bonus action to expend a 1st-level spell slot to regain hit points equal to your Cost die roll + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p><strong>Rare.</strong> When using Mariway's Health, you can now expend a higher level spell slot (up to a maximum of 3rd level) to increase the healing by one Cost die for each slot level above 1st.</p></blockquote><p>A GM may find players, or their characters, ask why they must attune to a common magic item. If the GM wishes to keep the weapon's true nature secret, they may simply state, \"you can tell there's something unique about this weapon,\" or, \"this item feels more powerful than a common magic weapon,\" or, \"you believe the item contains power yet to be unleashed,\" or, \"when you attuned to this weapon, you felt something weave through your body, as if connecting to your very lifeforce.\" In addition, a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check, the DC of which is at the GM's discretion, might reveal the weapon is of special power. The use of the identify spell may also reveal the item is a Weapon of Lore. At this time, the GM may wish to divulge all the weapon's mechanical details to the player, allowing them to see the potential of the weapon's power and how it will change as its rarity increases.</p><h3>Attuning at a Higher Level</h3><p>Weapons of Lore are meant to be introduced to a character as a common magic item. This means a high-level NPC who wields the weapon cannot simply perish and leave a low-level character to inherit a high-level weapon. The weapons, when they are attuned to by the character, form a link, which resets the weapon anew as a common item. However, during attunement, the character can attempt a Wisdom saving throw (see Attunement DC in the Rarity and Level Equivalents Table). If the character succeeds on the saving throw for their current character level, the weapon begins at that corresponding level of rarity. If a high-level character fails against their character level DC, but succeeds versus the lower DCs, they gain the lower properties. For instance, a 17th-level paladin attuning to a Weapon of Lore rolls an 18 on their Wisdom saving throw; this result means the item begins at rare, instead of common or legendary rarity.</p><h2>Magical Weapons</h2><p>All Weapons of Lore, even those of common rarity, are magical.</p><h2>Merchants</h2><p>The untrained eye may have a difficult time recognizing a Weapon of Lore. Someone familiar with these weapons, like a seasoned merchant or weaponsmith, might recognize a Weapon of Lore by succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Also, a scholar or historian succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check may recall a tale or two about the weapon and know of its ability to progress in power.</p><h3>Pricing and Selling</h3><p><strong>Pricing</strong>. Weapons of Lore are difficult to price. If the weapon's extraordinary ability to grow in power is known, then the merchant's selling price begins at 1d6 + 14 thousand gp, giving them a price range of 15,000 to 20,000 gp. Though the weapon may not be at its most powerful now, the merchant knows its true power. 15,000 to 20,000 gp is a fair starting price for a weapon of such quality and legend. A character successfully haggling with the merchant may see the price decrease by up to 20%.</p><p>If a merchant is unaware of the dormant weapon's potential, they price the weapon somewhere in the range of 250 to 1,000 gp and consider the weapon to be of common or uncommon rarity.</p><p><strong>Selling</strong>. If the weapon has been successfully identified as a Weapon of Lore, a merchant offers to purchase the weapon for 1d6 + 4 thousand gp, giving them a range of 5,000 to 10,000 gp. The merchant knows that they will be hard pressed to find a suitable buyer for the weapon and will have to disclose the weapon's powers and progression conditions to the potential buyer.</p><p>If the weapon has not been correctly identified, a merchant may offer to purchase the weapon for 20% more or less gold depending on the weapon's current rarity. However, a merchant who purchases a Weapon of Lore for a large sum of gold, only to witness its power diminish when the character ends their attunement would find it difficult to trust the characters in the future and may even accuse them of swindling them.</p><h2>Weapon Spell Casting</h2><p>Many of the included weapons have the ability to cast spells. Those weapons all share the below Spell Casting trait.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Spell Casting</strong>. Spells cast from the weapon require that you hold the weapon.</p></li></ul><h2>Uses</h2><p>Many weapons have Uses. For all Weapons of Lore, cursed, and traditional weapons, the following provides more information on how a weapon regains expended uses.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Once per long rest</strong>. Once used, you cannot use this property again until you finish a long rest.</p></li><li><p><strong>Once per short rest</strong>. Once used, you cannot use this property again until you finish a short rest.</p></li><li><p><strong>Twice per long rest.</strong> You may use this property twice, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p></li></ul><h2>Weapon Progression</h2><p>Two things must occur for a weapon to progress in power. First, the condition for progression must be met. Secondly, the character must subsequently finish a long rest while in possession of the weapon.</p><p>Progressions may include an increase in the attack and damage modifiers or number of charges, increased save DCs, damage, and ranges of the weapon's properties, or the gaining of entirely new properties. In most cases, the weapon retains the properties from its previous version, but sometimes those properties are removed or replaced. Unless otherwise noted, assume the weapon retains its previous properties.</p><figure class=\"wol-img-right\"><img src=\"modules/weapons-of-lore/assets/weapons/Mist Guardian.webp\" width=\"250\" /></figure><p>As an example, the Mist Guardian begins as a common weapon with the following property:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Misty Dew</strong>. While holding this magic weapon, you can use a bonus action to cause your space to be lightly obscured by a refreshing spray of cool mist. This mist disappears after 1 minute, or when you use this property again.</p></blockquote><p>When the weapon progresses, the uncommon version adds this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ixkakaw's Virtue</strong>. Once per long rest, while holding this weapon, you can use an action to create a rainbow arch in your space. Creatures of your choice that can see the rainbow can use their reaction to regain 2d4 hit points and neutralize one poison affecting it.</p></blockquote><p>The rare version makes these further changes:</p><blockquote><p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.</p><p><strong>Rain of Renewal</strong>. Once per long rest, while holding this weapon, you can use an action to cause a pleasant-smelling rain to fall from the sky in a 10-footradi ¬us, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on you, which lightly obscures the area. The rain moves with you and falls for 1 minute, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. Creatures within the rain immediately end any of the following conditions affecting them: &amp;Reference[blinded], &amp;Reference[paralyzed], &amp;Reference[poisoned], or &amp;Reference[stunned].</p></blockquote><h3>Progression Requirements</h3><p>Though some of these weapons have more specific requirements before advancing in power, many progress as the character levels up.</p><p>Let us take a peek at the Pilum of the Lost Legion's special progression requirements.</p><blockquote><p>Pilum of the Lost Legion progresses each time its wielder uses it to kill a creature with a CR that is 3 or more higher than their level. The wielder must use the spear to deal at least one third of the damage required to kill the creature. Once the spear has progressed, it cannot do so again until the wielder's level increases.</p></blockquote><p>If you would rather, instead of using the special progression rules, you can simply have the weapon progress as the character gains levels according to the table below. Keep in mind that the special requirements are meant to help balance both the character's and the weapon's power.</p><p>Using the Rarity and Level Equivalents Table, a character receiving a Weapon of Lore at 1st level would see the weapon's power increase when the character reaches 5th level, for example.</p><p>NPCs and creatures can also wield Weapons of Lore. Reference the Creature CR column in the table below to determine what rarity the creature wields. For instance, a CR 6 NPC or creature wields the uncommon rarity of the weapon.</p><h4>Rarity and Level Equivalents Table</h4><table class=\"wol\"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Weapon Rarity</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Character Level</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Prof. Bonus</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Attune DC</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Creature CR</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Common</p></td><td><p>1st - 4th</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>0 - 5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Uncommon</p></td><td><p>5th - 8th</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>6 - 11</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rare</p></td><td><p>9th - 12th</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>12 - 17</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very Rare</p></td><td><p>13th - 16th</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>18 - 23</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Legendary</p></td><td><p>17th &amp; Higher</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>24 - 30</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Magical Buffs</h2><p>There are many items that might increase a character's proficiency bonus, ability score modifier, or other statistic whose increase is listed as a progression requirement for a Weapon of Lore. If the item that grants the increase requires attunement, then the increase satisfies the progression requirement of the Weapon of Lore for as long as the character is attuned to the modifying item. However, in the case of (most) consumables, the modification is short-lived and does not satisfy the progression requirement. For instance, both a belt of giant strength and a potion of giant strength modify a character's Strength score, but only the belt requires attunement and so only an increase granted by the belt would satisfy the progression requirement of a Weapon of Lore that progresses when the attuned character's Strength score increases. An increase granted by the potion would not.</p><p>If a character ends their attunement to the modifying item, the Weapon of Lore will regress in rarity if the progression requirement is no longer satisfied.</p><figure class=\"wol-img-left\"><img src=\"modules/weapons-of-lore/assets/weapons/Silent Strings.webp\" width=\"200\" /></figure><h2>Not All Are Created Equal</h2><p>This same rule applies if the character is affected by a spell or curse that permanently decreases or increases one or more of their abilities.</p><p>By design, the various weapons' traits are not equal in power. Not all campaigns are high magic, and we wanted to provide a wide range of choices for players and GMs.</p><h2>Encounter Ideas</h2><p>Each of the weapons in this supplement includes associated encounter ideas. We provide these as suggestions for how to introduce the weapon into your campaign, though you may come up with more fitting ways to tie these items to your world specifically.</p><h2>Multiclassing</h2><p>When a character multiclasses, the weapon's progression follows the rules of multiclassing, with the sum of the character's class levels equaling their character level. For example, a character with three levels of rogue and two levels of fighter is considered a 5th-level character.</p><h2>Creating Your Own Weapons</h2><p>Feel free to use these weapons as inspiration for creating your own Weapons of Lore. You might remove one or more properties from a listed weapon and replace them with properties of your own creation, or properties from another existing Weapon of Lore.</p><h1>Cursed Weapons</h1><p>The second section of this supplement contains cursed weapons. While these weapons may provide a boon, they also include a hindrance.</p><h2>Curse Removal</h2><p>Curses are typically removed via the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplRemoveCurs]{remove curse} spell. However, several of the following cursed weapons require the use of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGreaterRes]{greater restoration} spell, requiring positive energy to offset the dark, foreign world curse. Greater restoration is a 5th-level spell, which means the curse remains in effect longer, since remove curse is a 3rd-level spell.</p><h1>Rechargeable Weapons</h1><p>The third section of the supplement contains unique rechargeable weapons. Rather than recharging after a short or long rest, these weapons require a character perform a special task, provide a monetary sacrifice or component, or something else. Each recharge requirement is listed in the weapon's text.</p><h1>Enterprising Entrepreneurs</h1><p>These groups or individuals provide unique services. Rather than a character waiting for a special event to occur to recharge their weapon, they might visit an Enterprising Entrepreneur who can perform the special task or provide the rare material.</p><h1>Traditional Weapons</h1><p>The remainder of this book contains traditional magic weapons which do not progress in power. You might also consider using properties from these weapons when creating your own Weapons of Lore.</p>"

They are proud of the life and home they provide for close to two hundred creatures who have been displaced over the years by careless adventurers, natural disasters, and city sprawling. The creatures at Roam Free vary from common to rare, and from great to small.</p><p><strong>Free Range</strong>. Autumncrest knows the environment which they have created is the best option for creatures to thrive if rehoming is not possible. They are so confident that they will happily let folks explore Roam Free—supervised, of course. Guests are allowed to get up close and personal with the sanctuary's residents, with Autumncrest often showing off things like how the venom from their snakes is silkier and greener than those that are raised in tanks and/or outside of their natural living conditions. Harming the creatures will be met with a long term, perhaps even permanent, ban.</p><h2>Encounter Idea</h2><p><strong>Escort Mission</strong>. The captain of the town guard is hiring adventurers to protect a creature being transported to Roam Free.

As well as cleaving through monster hide, she used the sickle to harvest samples of every unique and wonderful plant she encountered. Proximity to an array of magics, combined with Alder's relaxed attitude toward weapon polishing, allowed the seeds to take root and thrive.</p><p>Once Alder realized what was happening, she poured her own magic into the blade, a trickle at a time over many years, until the Travelling Garden bloomed and she was able to reap the rewards.</p><p>When Alder walked into the forest for the last time to become one with the woods, she left the sickle with her apprentice Salviu.</p><h2>Location</h2><p>Salviu (druid), who lives quietly on a mountainside, still has the sickle. He lives off the land and is not interested in money so will not sell it, but he knows he does not fully understand the Travelling Garden's powers and will gift it to someone better able to use it if they prove themselves as defenders of nature and the land.</p><h2>Encounter Ideas</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Blight</strong>. The land Salviu protects is blighted: crops wither, trees die. The sickle is affected too. The source is a band of minor fiends (dretches) squatting in a nearby cave network. If the characters can solve the problem, Salviu gives them the sickle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nesting</strong> <strong>Material</strong>. A little-known fact about owlbears: they have nesting instincts. And, while Salviu was foraging for herbs, a local owlbear, Screechbeast, ambled through and took the sickle to line her nest. Get it back without hurting the owlbear or her cub, and the characters can have it.</p></li><li><p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Path</strong> <strong>Untravelled</strong>. If the characters are travelling to somewhere Alder never visited, Salviu asks them to take the sickle with them and cultivate new seeds on it. He does not tell them this in advance, but if they add at least six new seeds to the garden, he will gift them the sickle when they return.</p></li></ul><h2>Progression</h2><p>Alder's Travelling Garden progresses whenever the attuned creature's Wisdom modifier increases.</p><h2>Statistics</h2><p>Weapon (Sickle), Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)</p><h3><strong>Common</strong></h3><p><strong>Fertile</strong> <strong>Soil</strong>.

The blade is always within easy reach for the Phgl'noigh giving a sermon or conducting a ceremony.
