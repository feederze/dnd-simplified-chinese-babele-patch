They cleave a path through armored skeletons with a greatsword while their mount charges in the opposite direction, leaving a cloud of powdered bone in their wake.</p>\n<p>A halfling flies over a burning forest on the back of a baby green dragon. The wyrmling sniffs the air and cries out, pointing with a claw to indicate a safe path to lead fearful forest creatures through the conflagration.</p>\n<p>Sneaking upside down next to their giant spider companion, a half-elf's web-covered feet keep them securely attached to a cavern ceiling. The bandits below have no idea that their camp has been infiltrated, and that their days of attacking local settlements are at an end.</p>\n<p>A beastheart is an adventurer who forms a bond of friendship with a wild creature, and who draws power from that bond as it strengthens over time. Working as a team, a beastheart and their faithful companion can take on even the most dangerous adventures, challenging any monsters and overcoming any obstacles.</p>\n<h2>Supernatural Bond</h2>\n<p>The connection a beastheart and a companion share isn't just one of love and admiration. It's a mystical bond that allows the beastheart to harness their companion's fury, might, and instincts for survival. When their companion is enraged, a beastheart channels that ferocity into supernatural deeds of martial prowess. In return, the wild companion can harness the beastheart's focus and direction.</p>\n<p>This supernatural kinship can form over a long period of time. Some beasthearts bond with unorthodox pets or wild protectors as children, becoming ever closer as both grow up together. Other beasthearts come of age in the wilderness, raised among wild creatures—or even raised by them—as a means of learning to respect and embrace the might of nature. But the beastheart bond can also form more quickly, typically in times of great duress. A person lost and starving in the wild might become a beastheart when they connect with a creature that saves their life by providing food and shelter. Or a wild creature injured and beset by poachers can befriend a character who saves their life, with the creature's gratitude forging the beastheart bond.</p>\n<p>Not every person is cut out to become a beastheart, just as not every animal is meant to be a companion. The pair must share an innate wildness and an unwavering trust in order to form this rare fellowship.</p>\n<h2>Companions, Not Pets</h2>\n<p>Most beasthearts have no desire to fully tame their wild friends, for doing so would rob beloved companions of their personalities and fighting spirit. Instead, a beastheart views themself as a caregiver, looking after a companion whose heart is as fierce and open as their own. The companion shares a similar view, thinking of their beastheart as a member of the pack, and treating a caregiver as a sibling always ready to explore, hunt, and play.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Beastheart Inspiration</h3>\n  <p>Heroes who undertake great adventures with loyal creatures at their sides are a mainstay of stories and folk tales from countless cultures, with many of those older tales inspiring the fantasy novels and films of the modern age. Inspirations for the beastheart include <em>How to Train Your Dragon, His Dark Materials, Race the Sands, </em>and<em> Phoenix Extravagant</em> just to name a few.</p>\n  <p>In many of those stories, the heroes can not only communicate with their companion creatures, but share connections to those friends that grant them supernatural powers or incredible physical talents. It's these sorts of connections that inspire the features of the beastheart class, making a beastheart and their companion much more powerful in tandem than either would be while adventuring alone.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.ATRAlWVP8yEqNSxu]</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wild at Heart</h2>\n<p>To an outsider, a beastheart and a companion might appear to be equals. (The companion most likely feels that way!) But the beastheart is always aware that their companion is a force of nature, not a domesticated creature. As such, a beastheart accepts that their companion might not be capable of deep introspection, as most companions live for the moment, dwell not on the past, and give little thought to the future. It's thus the beastheart's responsibility to do those things for themself and their wild friend, taking responsibility for a companion as a parent might care for a child, and grieving if the wild heart they've cared for is ever stilled.</p>\n<h2>Untamed Pair</h2>\n<p>Like the companions who stalk and explore at their sides, beasthearts bear a wondrous connection to the natural world, allowing them to track prey, survive in harsh environments, and get along even with wild creatures that aren't their companions. Many beasthearts are most at home in the wilderness, sleeping under the stars and enjoying the bounty of nature. Even when beasthearts and their companions make their lives in towns or cities, the untamed wilds beyond a settlement or the subterranean depths beneath it are often on their minds, constantly calling them to adventure.</p>"

          "description": "<h2>Creating a Beastheart</h2><p>As you create your beastheart character, consider the history of your friendship with your companion. Did you find the creature as a child and grow up together? Or did you form a bond with them only recently? Is this the first companion you've had, and are you the first person to whom your companion has bonded in this way? Think about the moment you became friends and the trials you've already faced. You might have survived in the wilderness together while one of you was injured. You might have saved your companion from trophy hunters. Or your companion might have instead saved your life by fighting off a deadly enemy.</p><p>Consider your companion's personality and tastes. Are they rambunctious or lazy? Standoffish or friendly? What tricks can you perform together? What is your companion's favorite food? You should also think about how your companion and you complement each other in looks or personality. Does your appearance reflect or contrast theirs? What activities do you both enjoy? How do you communicate with your companion? And how do you encourage others to communicate with and show respect for your friend?</p><h2>Quick Build</h2><p>You can make a beastheart quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score (or Strength if you want to use a melee weapon), followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the outlander background.</p><h2>Multiclassing and the Beastheart</h2><p>If your group uses the optional rule for multiclassing, here's what you need to know if you choose beastheart as one of your classes.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong></em> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Strength or Dexterity score of 13 and a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a beastheart.</p><p><em><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong></em> If beastheart isn't your initial class, you gain no new proficiencies when you take your first level as a beastheart.</p><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\">Multiclassing Options</h3><p>Players in campaigns using the optional multiclassing rules might be tempted to take one level in the beastheart class simply to gain a companion, since the companion's hit points and ferocity actions improve as the character advances in any class (not just in the beastheart class). However, you're actually better off asking your GM for a companion creature and advancing in your current class, since a single level in the beastheart class doesn't gain you much other than the companion.</p></aside>"

Each companion has unique traits and actions that make them a great ally. But beware! These are wild creatures that can be difficult to control in the heat of battle, and which just might bite the hand that feeds.</p>\n<p>The beastheart, a new class also introduced in this supplement, is able to maintain better control over a companion than most characters, but even they can lose control of their faithful friends. Don't fret too much, though! A companion gelatinous cube or owlbear is worth the risk of an occasional wild rampage.</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.7TZWLg9rVSZ1LO22]</p>\n<h2>The Caregiver</h2>\n<p>Every companion has a player character <strong>caregiver</strong> who commands the creature. The caregiver's player controls the companion most of the time during the game, though the GM can step in to take control if the companion and caregiver are separated, or if the caregiver mistreats the companion in some way.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">One Companion per Group</h3>\n  <p>Companions are a lot of fun, but having more than one companion to manage can slow things down at the table. A companion is another member of the party, with statistics and actions to track, and additional companions can easily make combat slow to a crawl. If every player wants to get in on the companion action, it's better for the characters to take turns being one creature's caregiver, rather than running around adventuring with a menagerie.</p>\n  <p>For characters wishing to share a companion, the companion accepts a new caregiver at the end of a short or long rest. Because a companion's proficiency bonus and hit points depend on their caregiver's level, those statistics might fluctuate if the characters in a party are different levels, reflecting that a more experienced caregiver is more adept at directing a companion.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>In combat, a companion shares a turn with their caregiver, and acts during the caregiver's turn. A companion can move and use their own reaction and bonus action independently. But they can take only the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions unless their caregiver uses a bonus action to command the companion to take a different action, including any of the actions noted in the companion's stat block. A companion must be able to see or hear their caregiver to receive a command. A companion can also take other actions if their caregiver is incapacitated, or if the companion enters a rampage (as discussed below).</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Charmed Caregiver</h3>\n<p>A caregiver who is charmed can still command their companion, but can't command the companion to attack a creature that charmed them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">New Caregiver</h3>\n<p>At the GM's discretion, a companion can abandon a caregiver character and choose a different willing creature as a caregiver.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Companion Control</h3>\n  <p>If a caregiver dies or becomes separated from a companion, the GM determines who controls the companion. In some cases, such as a caregiver dying, the caregiver's player can maintain control of a companion making a heroic stand against enemies. But in cases where a caregiver and their companion are physically separated, such as when a companion is captured, the GM might wish to take control of the companion to keep the player in suspense about the creature's fate.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Ferocity</h2>\n<p>Companions are dangerous creatures. Though often more docile than their wild counterparts, they aren't fully domesticated. Each companion's @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.features.Item.LlntChuD1CI2NmMR] is a measure of their tenacity and fury, and of how those things build in battle. As a companion's ferocity increases, they gain access to powerful new features, but they also become more difficult for a caregiver to control.</p>\n<p>If a companion isn't incapacitated at the start of their and their caregiver's turn, their ferocity increases by 1d4 + the number of hostile creatures within 5 feet of the companion that they can see or hear. For the purpose of building ferocity, a group of creatures that share a single stat block (such as a <strong>swarm of rats</strong>) count as one creature. Ferocity builds round after round during combat, and there is no maximum to the level of ferocity a companion can gain.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Rampage</h3>\n<p>After rolling to increase ferocity at the start of their turn, if a companion has 10 ferocity or more and is not incapacitated, they run the risk of entering a <strong>rampage</strong>. The companion's caregiver can make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check (no action required) to try to stop the companion from entering a rampage. To make the check, the caregiver must not be incapacitated, and the companion must be able to see or hear the caregiver. The DC for the check equals 5 + the companion's ferocity. On a success, the companion acts normally on their turn. On a failure, or if the caregiver doesn't make the check, the companion enters a rampage.</p>\n<p>When a companion enters a rampage, they immediately move up to their speed toward the nearest creature and attack that creature with their signature attack (see below), dealing extra damage equal to half their ferocity if the attack hits. If at least one ally and one enemy are nearest and equidistant to the companion, the caregiver's player rolls any die. On an odd number, the companion attacks an ally. On an even number, the companion attacks an enemy. The caregiver's player determines which specific ally or enemy the companion engages (and can choose their own character if they wish).</p>\n<p>A companion who can't reach a creature to attack while in a rampage uses the Dash action to move as far as they can toward the nearest creature. If a companion can't sense any potential targets, they move as far as they can in a random direction determined by the GM, avoiding danger.</p>\n<p>When a companion who has entered a rampage resolves their action or ends their turn, their ferocity drops to 0 and they are no longer in a rampage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Reducing Ferocity</h3>\n<p>To prevent a companion from entering a dangerous rampage, a caregiver has several options at their disposal for reducing the creature's ferocity.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Ferocity Actions</h3>\n<p>Each companion has three actions in their stat block that cost ferocity to use. To use one of these ferocity actions, a companion must have a caregiver with a character level equal to the ferocity action's level, and must spend the necessary amount of ferocity before they use the action. If the companion doesn't have enough ferocity to spend, they can't use the action.</p>\n<p>Ferocity actions always use the companion's action, meaning they can't be used as part of an opportunity attack. Ferocity actions can't be used while a companion is in a rampage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">End of Combat</h3>\n<p>When a combat encounter involving a companion ends and the companion isn't dying, the companion regains hit points equal to their ferocity, and their ferocity drops to 0. The GM determines when a combat encounter ends, typically at the point when creatures stop acting in initiative order.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Bag of Rats</h3>\n  <p>We can already tell that some of you crafty players are scheming to stuff a bag full of slightly groggy rats, then open that bag up in front of your companion to build up their ferocity during a fight. However, a too-easy target doesn't rile up a companion the way being threatened by an enemy combatant in a battle for survival does. As such, the GM makes the final determination as to what constitutes a hostile creature for the purpose of building a companion's ferocity. Likewise, in the same way that a swarm of creatures is counted as a single creature for the purpose of building ferocity, the GM is free to determine that two or three extremely weak creatures might count as only one creature for that purpose.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Dying Companions</h2>\n<p>When a companion is reduced to 0 hit points, they are dying and make death saving throws just as characters do. Characters thus always have a chance to save their furry (or scaly, or slimy, or exoskeletony) friends' lives! If combat ends while a companion is dying, their ferocity drops to 0 but they don't regain hit points (see <strong>End of Combat</strong> above).</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Companion Barding</h3>\n  <p>At the GM's discretion, characters can purchase barding for a companion, as discussed in the core rules, with the following adjustments:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Barding for Small companions weighs half as much as the equivalent armor for humanoids. Barding for Medium companions weighs the same as humanoid armor, while barding for Large companions weighs four times as much.</li>\n    <li>When a companion wears barding, they don't add their caregiver's proficiency bonus to their AC.</li>\n    <li>Companions who are shapechangers (such as the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.actors.Actor.GZCffkFIeWKihjZ9]) can't use that ability while wearing barding.</li>\n    <li>Companions who have corrosive bodies or are amorphous (such as the @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.actors.Actor.a3mYhmotY7Bwy759]) can't wear nonmagical barding.</li>\n  </ul>\n</aside>\n<h2>Statistics</h2>\n<p>In addition to their ferocity actions, all companions have additional changes to their statistics. Because a companion's effectiveness and survivability depends on the training and expertise of their caregiver, a companion's proficiency bonus is equal to their caregiver's proficiency bonus. Additionally, some of a companion's statistics refer to their proficiency bonus, abbreviated as <strong>PB</strong>. Other statistics use a number of dice equal to a companion's proficiency bonus and are expressed with PB in place of the number of dice. For example, if a companion has a +2 proficiency bonus, PBd6 means 2d6.</p>\n<p>Using proficiency bonuses helps a companion's damage and defenses scale better as their caregiver gains levels. However, only the companions of beastheart characters truly keep pace with their caregivers (which is one of that class's benefits).</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Not the Norm</h3>\n<p>A companion's statistics vary from the statistics of their wild counterparts. This makes a companion easier to run and keeps their power in line with other companions, even as it helps ensure that companions never outshine the characters. As somewhat more social versions of wild creatures, companions are often more clever and versatile than their untamed counterparts.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Hit Dice</h3>\n<p>Most creatures without character classes have their Hit Die type determined by their size (d4 for Tiny creatures, d6 for Small creatures, and so forth). Companions are special. Each uses a d8 for Hit Dice regardless of size.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Signature Attack and Ferocity Actions</h3>\n<p>Each companion has an action that is designated their signature attack. A signature attack is always a melee attack, and typically the creature's best natural attack. A companion uses their signature attack when they enter a rampage, and some of the features of the beastheart class make reference to a companion's signature attack.</p>\n<p>Each companion also has special actions that they can use only by spending ferocity during their turn, with some of those actions making use of the companion's signature attack. See <strong>Ferocity Actions</strong> above for more information.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Languages</h3>\n<p>A companion shares a unique bond with their caregiver, and can understand basic commands in one language their caregiver can speak (chosen by the caregiver). The companion can't read, speak, or write that or any other language, even if similar creatures normally can.</p>\n<h2>Encounter Balance and Companions</h2>\n<p>Unless a caregiver has the beastheart class, the GM should consider a companion as akin to a powerful combat-focused magic item for the purpose of building encounters. A companion gives a party a significant power boost, not just by providing more hit points for enemies to target and helping dish out more damage, but also by creating complications that can make a fight more challenging for the party's foes. GMs can adjust encounter difficulty by one step (from easy to medium, hard to deadly, and so forth) to properly challenge a group of characters with a companion, particularly if the characters' average level is 7th or lower.</p>\n<p>Companions gained through the beastheart's class feature are treated as any other class feature. The ability to control a companion is one of a beastheart's biggest benefits, and is balanced against the features of other classes. As such, a beastheart's companion has no effect on encounter balance, and GMs shouldn't make adjustments to encounters for a beastheart's party.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">NPCs and Companions</h3>\n  <p>Companion creatures are designed to accompany player characters on adventures. If an NPC has a pet or creature servant, it is recommended that you use the creature's normal stat block. For instance, if an NPC ranger has an owlbear that they work with, that creature would use the normal @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.zY3W5MG7FjssENf6] stat block and be played by the GM as normal. But if the characters are charged with rescuing a fallen druid NPC's owlbear pet from the clutches of a villain, the GM can choose to instead make that an @UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.actors.Actor.f4L7LTQ5HMS7FFoL], allowing the creature to join their rescuers and become part of subsequent adventures.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Companions</h2>\n<p>Characters can find companions at any point while they adventure. They might turn a hostile predator into a friend, be gifted a rare or unusual creature as a reward, liberate a companion from a cruel caregiver, or any other scenario that makes sense for the campaign. The companion stat blocks in this section cover a broad range of companion creatures the characters might cross paths with.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Companion Mounts</h3>\n  <p>Many companions are large enough to ride, especially by caregivers who are Small, when outfitted with an exotic saddle similar to those worn by aquatic or flying mounts. When a caregiver rides a companion into combat, not much actually changes. The caregiver and companion still each act on the same turn, and the caregiver must use their bonus action to direct the companion to take any action other than the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Under some circumstances, a companion might allow themself to be ridden by a creature other than their caregiver, though that other creature cannot give the companion commands.</p>\n  <p>If a companion bearing a rider rampages, that rider counts as being within 5 feet of the companion for the purpose of determining which creature the companion attacks. If a companion attacks their rider, they have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.actors.Actor.5Q9PZou7SxVFOoCW]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.actors.Actor.vsVmxGsktFOi1mXh]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.actors.Actor.4zyPlxjFj4W5Hp3A]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.actors.Actor.VoH4yzXo6KmmxkBX]</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.actors.Actor.8rXsvVpHOs3MTwEC]</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Dragon Lineages</h3>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Lineage</th>\n      <th>\n        <p>Damage<br />Type</p>\n      </th>\n      <th>Area</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Black, copper</td>\n      <td>Acid</td>\n      <td>5 × 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Silver, white</td>\n      <td>Cold</td>\n      <td>15 ft. cone (Con. save)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Brass</td>\n      <td>Fire</td>\n      <td>5 × 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Gold, red</td>\n      <td>Fire</td>\n      <td>15 ft. cone (Dex. save)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Blue, bronze</td>\n      <td>Lightning</td>\n      <td>5 × 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Green</td>\n      <td>Poison</td>\n      <td>15 ft. cone (Con. save)</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Dragon Babies</h3>\n  <p>Dragons are fiercely independent creatures, and make good pets only when they are newborns.

Sporelings are typically gentle creatures, who like to sit in moist places such as caves and riverbanks, and who absorb nutrients from the terrain beneath them. But when hungry predators threaten this fungus, a sporeling turns deadly, eyes glowing orange as they cough up acidic spittle and fill the air with hallucinogenic spores released from under their cap.</p>\n  <p>Unlike other mushroom folk in the game, sporelings act in a manner akin to highly intelligent beasts rather than humanoids. They don't have complex societies, and are mainly interested in finding food and staying alive.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.actors.Actor.1HuJvYXFrcosNakT]</p>"

However, the fact that most companions lack proper hands and can't speak makes it difficult for them to wield magic rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, and items that require command words or other speech to function.</p>\n<h2>Modifying Items</h2>\n<p>According to the core rules, most magic items meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build, with such items magically changing to suit their wielders. However, since most companions don't have the anatomy of humanoid characters, additional creativity might be needed when giving a companion creature an item from the core rules. <em>Gloves of missile snaring</em> could reshape to fit the talons of a blood hawk or the claws of a dragon wyrmling. But if you want your gelatinous cube companion to wear a <em>ring of resistance</em>, the ring might need to float inside the cube's body, or turn into a resizable metal thread that fits snugly around the middle of the ooze. Likewise, an earth elemental could wear a <em>cloak of displacement</em> sized for a Large creature normally, but could also wear a smaller cloak as a sash or cravat.</p>\n<h2>New Items</h2>\n<p>The following magic items are meant to be used by caregivers and companions, and are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p>If an item's description refers to “your companion,” that means a companion for which you are the assigned caregiver.

        "Short Story": {
          "name": "Short Story",
          "text": "<h1>The First Meeting</h1>\n<p>She stood at the edge of the clearing and watched the human for almost a full turn of the moon. Female, as far as she could tell. But the difference was never obvious with humans. This one was more a mystery than most.</p>\n<p>It was floating three feet above the grass.</p>\n<p>The small clearing was an appealing mix of green grass and red blood. A lot of blood. And the corpses of the things the human had killed. And almost been killed by.</p>\n<p>When she made the clearing, following the demon's tracks, the human was almost dead. In the same position it was now, horizontal, floating over the clearing. Eyes closed, arms at its sides. Like a corpse laid out for a funeral.</p>\n<p>As Koraga watched over a third of an hour, it became clear no funeral would be necessary. The human's wounds closed, broken bones stitched together. Even from thirty feet away, she could feel heat radiating off the human. Whatever it was doing burned a lot of fuel.</p>\n<p>The human's chest heaved and its eyes opened. Its breathing was deep and regular.</p>\n<p>Apparently healthy and now awake and aware, the human sat up and swung its legs over whatever invisible structure it had been lying on. It sat there, legs dangling over the bloody grass, its arms braced on the invisible table, head hanging down.</p>\n<p>It stretched. Joints popped. It twisted its neck left and right, and made slow, deliberate motions with its arms and hands. Tracing complex patterns in the air. When it was done, fully healed and whole, it hopped off the invisible table and began looking over the remains of the battle, looking for something.</p>\n<p>The human had gone from almost dead to completely hale in one turn of the moon, no medicine, no prayer. <em>Nice trick,</em> Koraga thought with some reservations.</p>\n<p>The human found what it was looking for, and extracted a crumpled pack from the detritus of the battle. Blood dripped off the leather. It held the pack at arm's length with one hand and awkwardly fished inside it with another. It pulled out a long roll of fabric, dropped the pack, and shook the cloth out. Looked at the detailed embroidery. Sighed.</p>\n<p>It was a dress. Or something like one. Orange and gold, the threads glinted in the sun. Real gold in the threads, Koraga guessed. Watching, she realized it was a duplicate of the torn rags the human was wearing. It brought its own change of clothes.</p>\n<p><em>Vanity, </em>Koraga thought without judgement.</p>\n<p>As the human stripped off its torn and useless clothing and started contorting its arms to get into its new outfit, it saw Koraga out of the corner of its eye. To its credit, it hesitated only an instant before it continued dressing.</p>\n<p>“You've been following me for three days,” the human announced. By its voice, Koraga guessed it was female.</p>\n<p>“Four,” Koraga said. The human didn't seem perturbed by the presence of an orc in the clearing with her. This was a good sign. Koraga wasn't in the mood for a fight at the moment.</p>\n<p>“Well, you're good,” the human said. “I didn't see you. I never saw you. I saw your …” She gestured to the sky.</p>\n<p>The orc tucked her bow against her body with her right arm, put a finger from each hand into her mouth and produced a shrill whistle that cut through the air like a knife.</p>\n<p>A shadow in the sky that hadn't been there a moment before alighted on Koraga's outstretched arm. His wings were fully eight feet across. He waved them in the air as he got his balance. His rear claws grabbed the orc's shoulder, his tail wrapped around the orc's neck, foreclaws wrapped themselves around the orc's forearm and gripped tight in a manner the human was certain would pull her arm apart. But the orc beastheart, easily seven feet tall but lean in spite of it, didn't seem to find the dragon's weight or claws an issue.</p>\n<p>His burnished copper scales reflected sunlight like the scales of a fish flashing under the surface of a pool.</p>\n<p>“That's a dragon,” the human said.</p>\n<p>“Yep,” the orc replied.</p>\n<p>“That's an actual dragon.”</p>\n<p>Koraga didn't know what other kinds of dragons there were, and so said nothing.</p>\n<p>“From the air, I thought …” In retrospect, it had been much too large to be any normal bird. “I thought it was …” And its tail couldn't have been a bird's. “I don't know what I thought,” the human ended with a shrug.</p>\n<p>The orc standing there, bow unstrung, effortlessly holding a dragon—a <em>dragon</em>—on her arm, said everything the human needed to know.</p>\n<p>She finished dressing. The orc took a few paces forward. <em>Never hurts to be polite, </em>Koraga thought.</p>\n<p>“Figure we're hunting the same thing,” the human said, no fear of the orc or the dragon evident.</p>\n<p>“Figure we are,” the orc nodded. She took a black lump out of a pouch. As soon as she did, the dragon's long sinuous head snaked around, looking for an angle from which he could snatch the black lump out of the orc's hand.</p>\n<p>Absent-mindedly, Koraga moved her hand in such a way as to thwart the dragon's attempts. Then she tossed the lump, probably coal or charcoal, high into the air, and the dragon flew up after it.</p>\n<p>The dragon seemed to have no weight, only speed. No natural creature could move like that.</p>\n<p>He deftly caught the charcoal at the apex of its curve, and munched it in one bite. Koraga tossed a few more lumps up into the air, and the dragon caught them all, some in his mouth, some in his foreclaws. He twisted and turned in the sky, only using his wings occasionally. He swam through the air like water.</p>\n<p>Filled with treats, the dragon flew up and perched on the branch of a nearby tree and sat there making <em>cronch cronch</em> sounds.</p>\n<p>“You, uh …” The orc made a point to survey the battle. “You did all this?”</p>\n<p>The human took a deep breath, pulled her eyes from the dragon, and looked at the blood and corpses. The details of the recent battle still at the surface of her thoughts.</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Looks like … mmm … twelve orlaks?”</p>\n<p>The human looked around. “Is that what they are?”</p>\n<p>“Demons,” Koraga said. “Part of Ajax's Infernium.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Well, I knew they were demons or devils or whatever. Didn't know what they were called.”</p>\n<p>“You killed twelve orlaks by yourself.”</p>\n<p>The human looked at the orc. “They tried to stop me. Tried to get between me and my … quarry. Our quarry,” she added.</p>\n<p>Koraga nodded, but raised her eyebrows. “No friends. No, uh … no weapons?”</p>\n<p>The human stretched one last time. No weapons, no armor. Not a dagger or a bracer. Her eyes crackled for a moment with orange fire.</p>\n<p>“I suffice,” she said.</p>\n<p>Koraga nodded, obviously impressed.</p>\n<p>She walked over to the spot where the human had been floating on an invisible table, revealing her limp. What the human thought was an improvised greave on the right leg was a crude splint.</p>\n<p>Koraga took her bow and waved it in the air where the invisible table had been. Nothing. There was nothing in the air, invisible or not, for the human to rest on.</p>\n<p>“You're wounded,” the human said, nodding to the orc's leg.</p>\n<p>“Yep. Few days ago.”</p>\n<p>“What happened?”</p>\n<p>Koraga's lips curled in what must have been a grin. “Got close to their master.” She poked her chin in the direction of the corpses on the field. “Took my shot.”</p>\n<p>“You fought this demon lord? Alone?”</p>\n<p>“Yep.”</p>\n<p>“It's as big as a house!” The human's voice squeaked a little. “What happened?!”</p>\n<p>The orc looked down at her wounded leg. “I lost,”<br />she said.</p>\n<p>“Uh huh,” the human said, a little in awe.</p>\n<p>She approached Koraga, slowly. Politely. In the air above them came a low growl.</p>\n<p>The orc looked up into the trees. “Psht,” she said. The growling simmered down.</p>\n<p>The human, still a few feet away, reached out her right hand, palm out, and her eyes glowed orange again. Koraga noticed the human's clothes matched the light from her eyes.</p>\n<p>The orc felt her leg get warm. Very warm. The dull throbbing she'd been living with got worse, almost unbearable. She grimaced, but the heat overtook the throbbing ache and then … subsided.</p>\n<p>There was no heat. No ache. Her leg felt whole. Koraga wiggled her toes in her leather boot, took a step. Then stamped around the field a bit.</p>\n<p>“Huh,” she said. Her clan had shamans, but not like this.</p>\n<p>She ripped the improvised splint off. Inspected her leg. It was whole. No sign of any wounds.</p>\n<p>“That's a … useful talent,” the orc said.</p>\n<p>The human smiled for the first time, like she was enjoying a secret joke. “It has its uses.”</p>\n<p>“Took you a while to … fix yourself. You were in a … a trance.”</p>\n<p>“Meditation, yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty exposed when I manifest a whole-body thing like that.”</p>\n<p>“Seems like a …” Koraga paused again. It seemed to be part of her pattern of speech. Like words weren't important. Finishing a sentence was something you could do whenever you felt like it. “Disadvantage.”</p>\n<p>“It's a mixed bag,” the human agreed. “Like much of life.”</p>\n<p>Koraga smiled.</p>\n<p>Using her new leg with confidence, the orc strode toward the nearest demon corpse. She knelt down. The sound of flapping wings announced the arrival of her companion on the grass next to the corpse. The orc removed a long dagger from her belt and started carving into the demon's flesh. The dragon watched, twisting its head to try to see what his master was doing.</p>\n<p>The knife cut deep into the orlak corpse's jet-black skin, slick like a whale's. It had no eyes. No obvious mode of sensing the world.</p>\n<p>The dragon suddenly spoke. “Caro venenum est,” he objected. “Noli manducare.”</p>\n<p>“Hush,” the orc said.</p>\n<p>“It talks,” the human said.</p>\n<p>“Sure,” the orc answered, distracted.</p>\n<p>“You understand it?”</p>\n<p>The orc looked at the copper dragon, who frowned back, scowling, disapproving. “We understand each other,” she said.</p>\n<p>Having made a sufficiently large opening in the corpse, the orc stowed her knife and reached into the body, pulling it open, her arms flexing, muscles in her back bunched together under blue-grey skin. Koraga was tall and lithe, but strong.</p>\n<p>Inside the demon corpse were metal bones and black flesh. And an exposed glowing ruby gem where a heart should have been. She reached in and wrenched the stone from the demon's chest. Held in her hand, her face cast into a hellish glow from the demon's heart.</p>\n<p>She tossed the heart to the human, who snatched it from the air. Koraga got up and went to another corpse to harvest another heart.</p>\n<p>“We run into these guys again,” the orc said, “these'll be useful.”</p>\n<p>The human looked at the glowing heart in her hand, nodding as though she knew what the orc was talking about. The orc seemed confident at least. Knew a lot about demons.</p>\n<p>Now possessed of one demon heart each, the human and the orc looked at each other.</p>\n<p>“My name's Djedkare,” the human said.</p>\n<p>“Koraga,” the orc said.</p>\n<p>“My friends call me Djed,” Djedkare said.</p>\n<p>Koraga nodded. “Djed,” she repeated. The human waited. When it was obvious more was expected, Koraga reached down and scratched her dragon's head behind the ears. He pushed his head into the orc's long black fingernails, eyes closed in delight.</p>\n<p>“Xix,” the orc said, looking down at the dragon.</p>\n<p>“Hello, Xix,” Djedkare said.</p>\n<p>The dragon opened one eye and looked with some small suspicion at the human. “<em>Ave</em>,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Means … ‘Hey,'” the orc said.</p>\n<p>“I guess so,” Djed said. Introductions were over, it seemed. “Thanks for the demon heart.”</p>\n<p>The orc nodded. “Thanks for the, uh … the leg.”</p>\n<p>The human nodded. “This thing we're following …” she said.</p>\n<p>“Gorontok.”</p>\n<p>“Gorontok?”</p>\n<p>“Gorontok,” Koraga repeated. “The Skin with Many Shapes.”</p>\n<p>“You know a lot about this thing.”</p>\n<p>The orc shrugged. She knew some things. Didn't know others.</p>\n<p>When Koraga realized Djed was waiting for an explanation, she continued.</p>\n<p>“Gorontok killed a Gol demon. Gol are … allies. Mostly. We helped them fight it. Killed a lot of orcs, lot of humans. Best we could do was drive it off.”</p>\n<p>Djedkare had many questions, even though she'd only known Koraga less than a turn. She sensed there was no need to prompt the orc. She'd get there in her own time, or not at all.</p>\n<p>“It killed my brother. My sister.” Then a pause, different from the others. Koraga was remembering something she'd not thought about for years. It affected her. “This was a … long time ago. I was …” She held her hand out, down by her knee.</p>\n<p>Djed nodded.</p>\n<p>“Anyway,” the orc said. “Never had much use for a clan after that. Prefer my own company.”</p>\n<p>The dragon barked an objection. Koraga patted him. Reassured him.</p>\n<p>“You've been hunting this thing your whole life?”</p>\n<p>Koraga raised her eyebrows. “Nah,” she said. “We been mostly just …” She looked down at the dragon, who looked up at her with deep affection in his eyes. “I dunno what you call it. Wanderers. I like seeing new places. Help people sometimes.</p>\n<p>“Found a village, almost wiped out. Tried to help. Wasn't much we could do, but … I recognized the signs. The description. I knew Gorontok was back. Relg is his master now.”</p>\n<p>This was a name Djedkare knew. “Ajax's pet demon lord.”</p>\n<p>The orc nodded.</p>\n<p>“Makes sense,” Djed said.</p>\n<p>Koraga looked at the human woman's bald head. “You a … Higaran?” she asked. Humans seemed to come in a wide variety of hues and builds, but there was no tradition of going bald as a young person in Higara as far as Koraga knew.</p>\n<p>“Khemharan,” Djed said. “I serve … I served the pharaoh,” she said, choosing not to mention the pharaoh's special operations directorate.</p>\n<p>Koraga sniffed. It was obvious the human wasn't saying everything, but who did? Secrets didn't seem to matter anymore. Whatever Djed had been before, it probably didn't matter now. They were each a long way from home.</p>\n<p>“Just you?” Koraga asked.</p>\n<p>Djed nodded. “There were others, but they … they went to help the Empress. I stayed behind to…” She shrugged. “Go after Gorontok, I guess.”</p>\n<p>“You went your own way?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah.”</p>\n<p>“Not with your friends.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, no.”</p>\n<p>“Why?”</p>\n<p>Djed took a deep breath. “I think they're gonna lose,” she said. “I think Higara's gonna fall. They won't make a difference.”</p>\n<p>Koraga nodded and looked around at the brilliant emerald Higaran forest. <em>Garish</em>, she thought. Nothing like the grey-black forests of home. “You think anyone can?”</p>\n<p>Djed thought. “‘Anyone' covers a lot,” she said. “But yeah. Maybe. But we need to stop reacting to Ajax. That was the pharaoh's mistake. Gotta get out ahead of him.”</p>\n<p>“Ahead,” Koraga repeated, mulling the idea over.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Figure out what he's doing. Sort of … leapfrog ahead of him. He's collecting artifacts. No one knows why.”</p>\n<p>“Must need them,” Koraga said.</p>\n<p>“He's collecting everything with power,” Djed said.</p>\n<p>Koraga shook her head. “Not everything.” The human had missed the point. Koraga didn't blame her. She'd spent most of her life alone. The orc knew she wasn't much good with words.</p>\n<p>“I mean, he takes some things, leaves the rest. Why? 'Cause he has a plan. We figure out why … maybe we know …” She looked up at the sky. “Where he's gonna float off to next.”</p>\n<p>Djed thought about this. “Yeah. Get ahead of him. Well, this … Gorontok seems to be moving with a purpose.”</p>\n<p>“It's Ajax's dog,” Koraga agreed. “Sniffing around for something. Something Ajax thinks he needs.”</p>\n<p>“We find it, stop it, figure out what it's after … maybe we learn something about Ajax's plan.”</p>\n<p>Koraga nodded.</p>\n<p>They both stood there in the clearing. It seemed like a decision had been made, an agreement reached.</p>\n<p>“Hunting this thing,” Koraga said. “Not a race. Endurance run.”</p>\n<p>Djed nodded. Hefted her pack onto her back. “You want to go fast,” she said, “go alone.” She extended her hand</p>\n<p>“Want to go far,” Koraga said, clasping the human's much smaller arm, “go together.”</p>\n<p>They stood there for a moment, arms clasped. Committed.</p>\n<p>“Figure this thing's about three days out,” Djed said, extracting herself from the orc's grip and grabbing her pack. “Not sure it needs to rest.”</p>\n<p>“We'll find it,” Koraga said.</p>\n<p>“Gonna need help bringing it down,” Djed said.</p>\n<p>“We'll find that too.”</p>\n<p>Djed looked Koraga up and down. Smiled.</p>\n<p>“Figure we will,” she said.</p>"

In addition, the Sanguine Knight subclass contains effects that manipulate another creature's blood. Lastly, illriggers are typically evil-aligned characters—and even those who aren't still serve evil creatures with dark agendas.</p>\n  <p>We recommend using the<em> </em>MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit and Checklist and adjusting as needed to ensure everyone at your table is comfortable.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>These archdevils' elite operatives are the illriggers. Knights, assassins, mages, and terror-commandos of Hell, illriggers command the battlefield, disrupt enemy factions, and carry out their archdevil's infernal will.</p>\n<h3>The Order of Desolation</h3>\n<p>Millennia ago, the rulers of Hell did something remarkable: they cooperated. Together, they created the Order of Desolation—knights sworn to serve Hell first, their patron archdevil second.</p>\n<p>Those accepted into the Order of Desolation become comrades with every other illrigger, regardless of which archdevil they serve. Each archdevil has grand temples, underground fanes, secret societies, and sinister cults, all with leaders fanatically devoted to the archdevil who grants them their power. But the Order of Desolation stands above the petty political squabbles dividing the Seven Cities.</p>\n<p>Members of the Order of Desolation, also known as the Desolate, are expected to be intelligent,</p>\n<p>resourceful, tactical, and manipulative. The order was founded to give the archdevils capable agents who could act independently across the timescape, free from the direct control of their patron.</p>\n<p>An illrigger has many powerful abilities granted by their archdevil, but more precious is their patron's trust. Each illrigger is expected to sow discord, pain, strife, deceit, and fear without instruction or supervision. It's not unusual, therefore, for a Desolate to first rely on other order members—regardless of which archdevil they serve—before turning to an institution devoted to their own archdevil.</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.YDrkR7p7CPcKqPya]</p>"

Then look at the Illrigger table to see which features you get at each level. The descriptions of those features appear in the “Class Features” section.</p><h2>Quick Build</h2><p>You can make an illrigger quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength (if you want to focus on melee weapons), Dexterity (if you want to focus on archery or finesse weapons), or Charisma (if you plan to choose the Architect of Ruin subclass). Your second highest ability score should be Constitution. Then, choose the soldier or outlander background from the core rules, or any background that gives proficiency in skills such as Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.</p><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h2>Multiclassing and the Illrigger</h2><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the core rules, here's what you need to know if you choose illrigger as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Charisma score of 13 and a Strength or Dexterity score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an illrigger.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If illrigger isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an illrigger: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> If you multiclass and choose the Architect of Ruin subclass, you determine your available spell slots by adding half your illrigger levels (rounded down) and otherwise following the guidelines in the core rules.</p></aside>"

No oath is necessary, no mentor—a fledgling illrigger might not even be aware the Order of Desolation exists. But true acceptance as a Desolate means swearing an oath to a specific ruler of Hell. This usually requires a senior member of the order to perform an elaborate ritual, but a dedicated illrigger might attract the attention of an archdevil by doing deeds of great treachery on their own.</p>\n<p>At some point on the illrigger's journey, be it through ritual or deed, they find themself face-to-face with one of the rulers of the Seven Cities. When they do, a contract must be signed in blood—usually the knight's own. This binds the itinerant knight to the Order of Desolation and adds their name to the Lists of Hell.</p>\n<p>Though this experience can be intimidating, the rulers of Hell are usually easy masters and ask little from their chosen. The busy rulers of the Seven Cities pay little heed to the daily lives of their illriggers. Even breaches of precepts are overlooked; as long as the knight sows discord and opposes the Celestial Host, they successfully advance Hell's agenda.</p>\n<p>@embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.YyQMMoi11buXKZuW]</p>"

Except everything.</p>\n<p>Lady Dazran paced while the dark elf Larr fidgeted with a dagger and one Soranis flipped through the <em>chronos codex</em> while the other frowned and watched.</p>\n<p>“I'm going to pull the spear out,” Magnus said to ERN-F8. The memonek knight nodded and braced herself.</p>\n<p>Magnus's muscles tensed; his sinews went taut as he wrenched the sorcerous spear from Lady Fate's side. The living machine grunted and gritted her teeth.</p>\n<p>The spear came free and Magnus held it as he watched the knight press her hand into her wounded side and grimace.</p>\n<p>“I guess it hurts,” the priest said.</p>\n<p>“I am not an Inexorable,” the humanoid-knight made of glass and ceramics and embossed brass said. “I feel pain. And fear.”</p>\n<p>“Almost human.” Magnus smiled.</p>\n<p>“Are all healers in your world so insulting?”</p>\n<p>Lady Dazran threw a glance at the two copies of Soranis. “Well?” she demanded.</p>\n<p>“This book is ...” The timeless elf wizard held the tome open in one hand, pushed his long golden hair back with the other. “If I had more time ...”</p>\n<p>“Isn't that the point?” Uluoria asked, flowing upright from her perpetual crouch and standing next to the memonek. “Why did we bother dying to get that thing—” The protean hunter gestured at the codex. “—if it didn't have the answers?”</p>\n<p>“It almost certainly does have the answers, but ...” the first Soranis began.</p>\n<p>“... it's doubtful we have the right questions,” the second Soranis finished. The only difference between the original and his temporal doppelganger was the trim of his long blue robes. ERN-F8 sighed.</p>\n<p>“The codices were crafted by terran wizards. Elves need no such tomes to master lore,” the first Soranis explained.</p>\n<p>“Time. Time is the key,” The second Soranis added. “If this were a wode .... But here, cause rules effect.”</p>\n<p>“Even two of us,” the first Soranis said.</p>\n<p>“We could spend many months studying this tome and only learn a fraction of its secrets,” the second Soranis said.</p>\n<p>“Weeks surely,” the first one commented.</p>\n<p>“Oh, you flatter us.” The second one bowed.</p>\n<p>“I thought it worked, we saw it work,” Uluoria said. “That's why there's ...” She gestured to the second Soranis. “You're from the future. Don't you know what we did? Did we win or lose?!” The tension, the inaction, was going to tear the already disparate group apart.</p>\n<p>“In my future—” The second Soranis looked from Uluoria to Lady F8. “—the Time Ender slumbers still.”</p>\n<p>“Wonderful,” Nuulus-Larr said, and the dark elf fished out a piece of pickled mushroom from a pouch.</p>\n<p>“Wait.” Magnus held up a hand. He inhaled slowly, a metallic smell tinged the air. “It's starting, get ready.”</p>\n<p>“Finally.” Lady Dazran stopped pacing, but stood on alert, fidgeting with the pommel of her great sword.</p>\n<p>The first Soranis closed the <em>chronos codex</em> and Uluoria readied her bow.</p>\n<p>A flash of light, and another portal opened. It stood like a black mirror fringed with bright blue crystals. There must have been a pressure differential between the library at the top of the tower and the world inside the portal, because air constantly rushed in, blowing their hair in the sudden breeze.</p>\n<p>“They did it,” Magnus breathed out with a sigh. “The kids did it.”</p>\n<p>“They live.” Zazamanc, the fire dwarf, growled, impressed. “They live and their scheme succeeded.”</p>\n<p>“They served their purpose,” Lady Dazran said flatly. “Now it is our turn.” Ignoring the debate over the codex, Lady Dazran turned to the group. “I will lead,” she said.</p>\n<p>“You think so?” Larr said with a sneer.</p>\n<p>No one moved.</p>\n<p>“Well?” Lady Dazran, Illrigger, asked. “Why stand we here idle?”</p>\n<p>Larr threw a warning glance at ERN-F8. It did not go unnoticed or unheeded.</p>\n<p>“Maybe someone stays behind,” the dark elf said.</p>\n<p>“Keep someone in reserve,” Zazamanc agreed, but there was a darkness to his tone.</p>\n<p>“A reserve?” Lady Dazran asked. “Who?!”</p>\n<p>“One of the Soranises, maybe,” the memonek knight said. And then got round to it. Her gaze rested on the hellknight. “You.”</p>\n<p>“Me?! Don't be a fool, you wouldn't stand a ...” She stopped. She was brash, headstrong, utterly fearless. But she was not stupid. “What is this? When have I given you cause to question my skill? Or is this another crisis of conscience?”</p>\n<p>“It's not your skill we question,” Lady Fate said. “It's your loyalty.”</p>\n<p>She confronted the knight of Axiom. “Is that what you fear? My loyalty? Hah!” She surveyed the rest of the party. “Is that why we skulk in this tower, in the shadows, out of sight, because you fear a betrayal?” She sneered. “A dramatic betrayal in a crucial moment?”</p>\n<p>The second Soranis looked at his comrades. Someone had to say it. “You serve Dispater. A Lord of Hell. Who knows what you might do? I don't think ... none of us think you will betray us. We just think ...”</p>\n<p>Zazamanc finished it. “We think you could.”</p>\n<p>“Betray you! Hahaha. You insects.” She took a step back and surveyed the group. “You see loyalty as the truth, the truth of a person. That one,” she said, pointing to Magnus the prelate of Cavall, “is loyal to Cavall. That is his loyalty, so that is his character. This one—” She pointed to the dark elf. “—serves only skill. That is his loyalty and so that is his character.”</p>\n<p>“I carry the seal of Dispater and thus you feel you know my character. But I have served with you these many weeks and what I have learned is that you have learned nothing.”</p>\n<p>She put her hand on her sword. “You know nothing of loyalty or character. I will fight with you, I will risk death and worse with you. I carry Dispater's seal, but I serve Hell. Hell is my world, as real and vital to me as yours.</p>\n<p>“Beyond this portal, none of us know what we will find. I do not know what awaits. Only a creature powerful enough to collapse the entire timescape into one singular universe. What would happen to my world then? Yours? You question my loyalty when my world hangs in the balance?</p>\n<p>“I do not fear what is beyond because we are Heroes from Seven Worlds. Chosen by the gods! By fate! Yet we sit here like mice and quarrel and doubt and fear and that</p>\n<p>will be our undoing! We face a god! A god of dragons! A god of time magics!” She pointed to the portal. “And the only thing it fears ... is us.”</p>\n<p>Lady Fate considered for a moment, then weighed in.</p>\n<p>“If we do not work together, we lose.” The others appreciated this sentiment. “I don't think there's anyone here with your battlefield experience or, frankly, your zeal for battle. I have no fear. Axiom will follow Hell. What says Arcadia?”</p>\n<p>The two true elves, standing a full head taller than anyone else in the group, looked at each other, and some unspoken thought passed between them. Then they turned to face the group.</p>\n<p>“We have seen Lady Dazran's devotion to victory. Arcadia has no doubts. We will follow Hell.”</p>\n<p>“Quintessence?”</p>\n<p>The fire dwarf warrior took a step forward. “We of Alloy are no strangers to working with the Seven Cities. Quintessence will follow Hell.”</p>\n<p>Lady Fate turned to Magnus, the cleric. The only other human besides Lady Dazran.</p>\n<p>Magnus shrugged. “She got us this far,” he said. “Hell leads. Orden will follow.”</p>\n<p>“Primordius?”</p>\n<p>The shapeshifting protean hunter flowed into a new, more hideous form. “I like not this formality. I do not wish to be led like a thrazz on a leash. But I like inaction even less. Therefore ... Primordius, the Sea of Eternal Change, will follow Hell.”</p>\n<p>ERN-F8 turned to the dark elf assassin. <br />“What says the World Below?” All eyes turned to Nuulus Larr.</p>\n<p>Outnumbered, and unwilling to press her point, the dark elf outcast stood, pocketed her daggers and drew her rapier and short-sword.</p>\n<p>“I withdraw my earlier suspicion. Though I reserve the right to say ‘I told you so.'” Lady Dazran sneered. “The World Below, the Dark Under All, will follow Hell.”</p>\n<p>The group stood at attention. Lady Dazran nodded. Lady Fate had always been the group's moral center, but none of them questioned who their battlefield commander was.</p>\n<p>“Then we will win,” the hell knight said. “If you follow where I lead, we will win. If you strike where my finger points, we will triumph. Where we walk, death will follow and when the last drop of blood is shed we seven will still be standing and they will be a memory. Because I serve Hell.”</p>\n<p>She drew her sword, the massive blade forged from a steel-devil's rib.</p>\n<p>“And Hell demands victory!”</p>\n<p>She approached the portal. “Now. Ready yourselves. Put doubt behind you. As long as I am in front of you and the Time Ender before me, we are facing victory. You will not fear death, because so long as I live, you die only when I grant permission, and today I am not that forgiving. Listen for my voice. For when I call upon the Lord of War, when I unleash the devastator, then you shall all be servants of Hell. And Cthrion Uroniziir, Time Ender, the Wyrm of the World's End will find that black crystal onyx and time magics are no match for steel and spell ....”</p>\n<p>Holding the massive steel-devil blade in her right hand, she clenched her left hand into a fist and a glowing, censorious seal manifested there.</p>\n<p>“... and hellfire.”</p>\n<p><em>Lady Dazran, Illrigger, walked through the portal, and the Heroes of Seven Worlds followed.</em></p>\n<p>@embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.R18zAQaYc1yvTMBf]</p>"

          "text": "<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.kBwUdgXiQYI8NlLo]</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Hey, everybody! James Introcaso here—just kidding, it's Sadie Lowry.</p>\n<p>Many in the MCDM community know my reputation for writing celestial-themed projects. I wrote six <em>ARCADIA</em> articles! There are memes about it! You can imagine my amusement when James scheduled a Discord call with me and broke the news: He wanted me to be the project lead for the infernal, Hell-centered revised illrigger. We had a good chuckle about that.</p>\n<p>But I was thrilled to be involved in revising the illrigger! Our goals were twofold. First, we would bring the illrigger further in line with other fifth edition classes, following groundwork laid by the incredible Mario Ortegón. Second, we would expand the class, adding two new subclasses (the Hellspeaker and the Sanguine Knight), retainers, and magic items.</p>\n<p>I <em>love</em> working on extraplanar material — celestial or otherwise. When players are drawn to other planes, they're looking for something larger than life. They wander fey realms, looking for stories where fairy tales are true, promises can't be broken, and mischief and whimsy are as dangerous as violence and war. They walk the halls of the gods searching for a calling, the magic to purge evil and darkness, and a connection to a higher power.</p>\n<p>In MCDM's timescape, Hell is a place to rise to power. Illriggers navigate politics and warmongering, infiltrate or obliterate flimsy mortal hierarchies, and crush Goodness and Light under a gold-trimmed heel. Illriggers can be chaotic or logical, evil or pragmatic, warmongering or cunning, but they share a remarkable position in the power struggles of the Seven Cities. Their archdevils grant them terrible abilities and trust that few others are given.</p>\n<p>When players turn to the illrigger, they're typically trying to fulfill a fantasy about that power — to lead armies, assassinate foes, manipulate politicians, or command blood as they gain prominence and infamy. Our team let that archetype—the desire to gain and wield power—guide us during the development process. The artists vividly captured scenes and brought them to life. The playtesters helped us ensure the fantasy <em>feels</em> right. Laura Hirsbrunner worked magic on the words to communicate that fantasy. And everything is under the strong vision of Matt Colville and James Introcaso, experts both in making a world feel truly epic and fantastical.</p>\n<p>But we can only bring the story partway. The rest of an illrigger's tale happens at the table as the GM weaves nefarious plots around their party members and builds on that fantasy.</p>\n<p>I feel very lucky to be even a small part of those stories I love so much—stories where you make a promise you can never break, channel divine power through your very being, or rise as a threatening power player of Hell.</p>\n<p>I hope the stories you tell are nefarious, diabolical, and larger than life.</p>\n<p>Yours in vileness (for once),</p>\n\n<cite style=\"text-align:right\">\n  <p>Sadie Lowry</p>\n  <p>The Illrigger Revised Lead Designer</p>\n</cite>\n\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.2NjOUnMGRX57FWSn]</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p><strong>Design Director:</strong> Matthew Colville</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Designer:</strong> Sadie Lowry</p>\n<p><strong>Designers:</strong> Lars Bakke, Mario Ortegón</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> James Introcaso</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Editor:</strong> Laura Hirsbrunner</p>\n<p><strong>Editor:</strong> Joshua Yearsley</p>\n<p><strong>Fiction:</strong> Matthew Colville</p>\n<p><strong>Sensitivity Consultant:</strong> Basil Wright</p>\n<p><strong>Executive Art Director:</strong> Jason Hasenauer</p>\n<p><strong>Cover Illustration:</strong> Patrik Hell</p>\n<p><strong>Illustration and Design:</strong> Grace Cheung, Nick De Spain, Patrik Hell, Jason Hasenauer</p>\n<p><strong>Graphic Design and Layout:</strong> Gordon McAlpin</p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility Consultant:</strong> Chris Hopper</p>\n<h2>MCDM Contractors</h2>\n<p><strong>Community Coordinator:</strong> John Champion</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Bobby McBride</p>\n<p><strong>QA Senior Tester:</strong> Spencer Hibnick</p>\n<p><strong>Testers:</strong> Nathan Clark, Cassandra “Dig” Crary, Alecson de Lima Junior, James Dewar, Anna Guimarães, Alex Hencinski</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">MCDM Productions</h3>\n  <p><strong>Lars Bakke:</strong> Development &amp; Production</p>\n  <p><strong>Jerod Bennett:</strong> Technology</p>\n  <p><strong>Grace Cheung:</strong> Art</p>\n  <p><strong>Matthew Colville:</strong> Writing &amp; Design</p>\n  <p><strong>Nick De Spain:</strong> Art &amp; Outsource Management</p>\n  <p><strong>Jason Hasenauer:</strong> Art &amp; Art Direction</p>\n  <p><strong>James Introcaso:</strong> Lead Game Designer</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Playtesters</h2>\n<p><strong>Playtest Coordinators:</strong> Aaron Flavius West, AJ Metzger, Daniel Lane, David Lucas, davidqshull, EagleRuler, Ethan Dunning, Franklin H., Gina Devlin, Harley Kewish, Harper Blair Stone, Jake Sargent/ArchmageMC37, James L., Janek Dalkowski, Jarrad Tait, Jeanne Parker, Joel Russ, John Champion, John Previtera/Previterror, Liam Kearney, Madeleine Bray, Matthew Vansprang, Meg Hanna, Morgan “Adys” Fenwick, Roman Penna, Shane Parker</p>\n<p><strong>Alpha Playtesters:</strong> 0XiDi, Aaron Pangilinan, Alaina Rhodes, Alex Chapman, Alex FP, Alpacnologia, Andre Haftevani, Andrea Aloisi, Anutham Suresh, Arek O.

How many collective hours have players spent trying to convince a beleaguered Game Master that with enough treats, coaxing, and successful Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks, they should be able to adopt that bulette or hell hound or gelatinous cube? Why do we like the fantasy of adventuring with wild animals (not to mention fiends or oozes) at our side?</p>\n<p>It's probably because the idea of a hero with an untamed pal is prevalent in many of our most popular fantasy stories. Knights befriend and ride dragons. Dire wolves charge into battle alongside the Stark children. Mija risks everything to save her titular pal in <em>Okja</em>. And we want to tell similar stories at our tables! But these aren't just tales of heroic pets. Rather, these are stories of untamed creatures that choose to partner with a hero. These creatures are too wild to be truly controlled, but each loves the hero as they would a member of their own pack. Together, hero and companion charge into danger, ferocious and free.</p>\n<p><em>Beastheart and Monstrous Companions</em> codifies the fantasy of adventuring alongside a wild companion. This supplement presents rules for companions: wild creatures that any character in the game can befriend and bring along on adventures. They aren't always easy to control, but having a basilisk bud is totally worth it. The beastheart class then builds on those rules, letting a character work in maximum harmony with a companion. This new class presents a hero who is never without their faithful friend, and who shares a supernatural bond with a companion that allows both to perform incredible feats fueled by primal power.</p>\n<p>This supplement is the culmination of months of hard work from artists, designers, editors, and many, many playtesters. It even underwent a public playtest, which dramatically improved the content. I can't thank the folks enough who took the time to give feedback.</p>\n<p>Let's get wild.</p>\n\n<cite style=\"text-align:right\">\n  <p>—James Introcaso,</p>\n  <p>MCDM Lead Designer</p>\n</cite>\n\n\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.3EahVpp3kryEnzOM]</p>\n\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p>Adventure into danger with a ferocious friend at your side!</p>\n<p><strong>Design Director:</strong> Matthew Colville</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Designer:</strong> James Introcaso</p>\n<p><strong>Editor:</strong> Scott Fitzgerald Gray</p>\n<p><strong>Sensitivity Reader: </strong>Basheer Ghouse</p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility Consultant:</strong> Chris Hopper</p>\n<p><strong>Production:</strong> Anna Coulter, Lars Bakke</p>\n<p><strong>Art Direction:</strong> Jason Hasenauer</p>\n<p><strong>Graphic Design and Layout:</strong> Gordon McAlpin</p>\n<p><strong>Cover Illustration:</strong> Martin Sobr</p>\n<p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Tulio Brito (Conceptopolis, LLC), Grace Cheung, Nick De Spain, Matheus Graef (Conceptopolis, LLC), Jason Hasenauer, Martin Sobr</p>\n<p><strong>Playtest Director:</strong> Lars Bakke</p>\n<h2>MCDM Contractors</h2>\n<p><strong>Community Coordinator:</strong> John Champion</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Bobby McBride</p>\n<p><strong>QA Senior Tester:</strong> Spencer Hibnick</p>\n<p><strong>Contract Testers:</strong> Alecson de Lima Junior, James Dewar, Nathan Clark, Owen “Dig” Crary</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">MCDM Productions</h3>\n  <p><strong>Lars Bakke:</strong> Development &amp; Production</p>\n  <p><strong>Jerod Bennett:</strong> Technology</p>\n  <p><strong>Grace Cheung:</strong> Art</p>\n  <p><strong>Matt Colville:</strong> Writing &amp; Design</p>\n  <p><strong>Anna Coulter:</strong> Production &amp; Operations</p>\n  <p><strong>Nick De Spain:</strong> Art &amp; Art Outsource Management</p>\n  <p><strong>Jason Hasenauer:</strong> Art &amp; Art Direction</p>\n  <p><strong>James Introcaso:</strong> RPG Line Developer</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>Playtesters</h2>\n<p><strong>Playtest Coordinators:</strong> Aaron Flavius West, AJ Metzger, Alexander Hencinski, Bennoni Thomas, Chris Catterson, Clayton Salamon, David Lake, Essjae, Ethan Dunning, Harley Kewish, Janek Dalkowski, Jarrad Tait, John Bryant, Madeleine Bray, Nick Pierson, Reuben Hung, Shane Parker</p>\n<p><strong>Beta Playtesters:</strong> abculatter_2, Adam Horn, Alex Adkisson, Alex Payne, Alexander L.

Think of Eleven from <em>Stranger Things</em>, or Professor X or Jean Grey from the X-Men. Some of Stephen King's stories, including <em>The Dead Zone</em> and <em>Firestarter</em>, feature pyrokinetics or telekinetics. Characters with psychic powers can be found in <em>ThunderCats</em> and <em>Star Wars</em>, and in children's stories like <em>Matilda</em>. Even Galadriel in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> exhibits telepathic powers.</p>\n<p>One common blanket term for this phenomenon is <strong>psionics</strong>—and in this product, we reimagine that psionic archetype in the context of a high fantasy world. We assume (though the campaign you play in might have different assumptions) that psionics are, by definition, rare. Otherwise, why haven't we seen them in the game before?</p>\n<p>Sages in our fantasy worlds would have a technical term for these kinds of powers—metaphysics, which might more rarely be known as psionics. One issue, though, is that “psionics” can sound a bit like science fiction. We don't normally refer to the human beings in a fantasy RPG as <em>Homo sapiens</em>. So we imagine that the people in our fantasy world would use more natural phrases to describe this phenomenon, which they don't really understand. They might refer to someone who uses these powers as “having a rare talent,” or “possessed of a special talent.” Over time, they'd start calling someone who uses these powers “a talent.” And something that started as a vague and broad description of a mysterious power becomes the actual name for it.</p>\n<cite style=\"text-align:right\">\n  <p>—Matt Colville</p>\n</cite>\n\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.KWcjC4mi9udG80sK]</p>\n\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p><strong>Design Director:</strong> Matthew Colville</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Designer:</strong> James Introcaso</p>\n<p><strong>The Society Fiction:</strong> Matthew Colville</p>\n<p><strong>Editor:</strong> Scott Fitzgerald Gray</p>\n<p><strong>Sensitivity Reader:</strong> Sally Tamarkin</p>\n<p><strong>Production:</strong> Lars Bakke</p>\n<p><strong>Art Direction:</strong> Jason Hasenauer</p>\n<p><strong>Graphic Design and Layout:</strong> Gordon McAlpin</p>\n<p><strong>Cover Illustrations:</strong> Grace Cheung</p>\n<p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Grace Cheung, Nick De Spain, Matheus Graef (Conceptopolis), Gustavo Pelissari, Brian Terrero, Lucas Torquato (Conceptopolis), Perry Zombolas</p>\n<p><strong>Playtest Director:</strong> Lars Bakke</p>\n<h2>MCDM Contractors</h2>\n<p><strong>Community Coordinator:</strong> John Champion</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Bobby McBride</p>\n<p><strong>QA Senior Tester:</strong> Spencer Hibnick</p>\n<p><strong>Testers:</strong> Nathan Clark, Cassandra “Dig” Crary, Alecson de Lima Junior, James Dewar, Anna Guimarães, Alex Hencinski</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">MCDM Productions</h3>\n  <p><strong>Lars Bakke:</strong> Development &amp; Production</p>\n  <p><strong>Jerod Bennett:</strong> Technology</p>\n  <p><strong>Grace Cheung:</strong> Art</p>\n  <p><strong>Matt Colville:</strong> Writing &amp; Design</p>\n  <p><strong>Anna Coulter:</strong> Production &amp; Operations</p>\n  <p><strong>Nick De Spain:</strong> Art &amp; Art Outsource Management</p>\n  <p><strong>Jason Hasenauer:</strong> Art &amp; Art Direction</p>\n  <p><strong>James Introcaso:</strong> RPG Line Developer</p>\n</aside>\n\n<h2>Playtesters</h2>\n<p><strong>Playtest Coordiantors:</strong> Aaron Flavius West, Adam McLaughlin, AJ Metzger, Alex Adkisson, Bennoni Thomas, Casey Bell, Casey Williams, Daniel Lane, Dante Bozzini, David Lucas, davidqshull, EagleRuler, Ethan Dunning, Harley Kewish, Harper Blair Stone, Iris Gorton, ItsTheITGuy, Janek Dalkowski, Jarrad Tait, Jeanne Parker, Joel Russ, Liam Kearney, Madeleine Bray, Matthew “OneEyed” Vansprang, Morgan “Adys” Fenwick, Reuben Hung, Roman Penna, Shane Parker</p>\n<p><strong>Beta Playtesters:</strong> abculatter_2, Aidan Sherrington, Alaina Rhodes, Aldo Vicente Farias, Alex Chapman, Alpacnologia, Amanda Blakely, Amy Billingham, Andrew Macdonald, Andy Heinrich, Apollosukulele, Archer, Ashley Ferrum, Austin Bush, B.

Each companion's <strong>ferocity</strong> is a measure of their tenacity and fury, and of how those things build in battle. As a companion's ferocity increases, they gain access to powerful new features, but they also become more difficult for a caregiver to control.</p>\n<p>If a companion isn't incapacitated at the start of their and their caregiver's turn, their ferocity increases by 1d4 + the number of hostile creatures within 5 feet of the companion that they can see or hear. For the purpose of building ferocity, a group of creatures that share a single stat block (such as a <strong>swarm of rats</strong>) count as one creature. Ferocity builds round after round during combat, and there is no maximum to the level of ferocity a companion can gain.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Rampage</h3>\n<p>After rolling to increase ferocity at the start of their turn, if a companion has 10 ferocity or more and is not incapacitated, they run the risk of entering a <strong>rampage</strong>. The companion's caregiver can make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check (no action required) to try to stop the companion from entering a rampage. To make the check, the caregiver must not be incapacitated, and the companion must be able to see or hear the caregiver. The DC for the check equals 5 + the companion's ferocity. On a success, the companion acts normally on their turn. On a failure, or if the caregiver doesn't make the check, the companion enters a rampage.</p>\n<p>When a companion enters a rampage, they immediately move up to their speed toward the nearest creature and attack that creature with their signature attack (see below), dealing extra damage equal to half their ferocity if the attack hits. If at least one ally and one enemy are nearest and equidistant to the companion, the caregiver's player rolls any die. On an odd number, the companion attacks an ally. On an even number, the companion attacks an enemy. The caregiver's player determines which specific ally or enemy the companion engages (and can choose their own character if they wish).</p>\n<p>A companion who can't reach a creature to attack while in a rampage uses the Dash action to move as far as they can toward the nearest creature. If a companion can't sense any potential targets, they move as far as they can in a random direction determined by the GM, avoiding danger.</p>\n<p>When a companion who has entered a rampage resolves their action or ends their turn, their ferocity drops to 0 and they are no longer in a rampage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Reducing Ferocity</h3>\n<p>To prevent a companion from entering a dangerous rampage, a caregiver has several options at their disposal for reducing the creature's ferocity.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Ferocity Actions</h3>\n<p>Each companion has three actions in their stat block that cost ferocity to use. To use one of these ferocity actions, a companion must have a caregiver with a character level equal to the ferocity action's level, and must spend the necessary amount of ferocity before they use the action. If the companion doesn't have enough ferocity to spend, they can't use the action.</p>\n<p>Ferocity actions always use the companion's action, meaning they can't be used as part of an opportunity attack.

With a sudden rush of heat, a column of flame erupts from the ground to char flesh, feathers, and fur, causing the owlbear to flee. The dragonborn then collapses on the ground, fighting to breathe against the strain wrought by the power that saved their life.</p>\n<p>The talent is a master of psionics—a source of incredible power created through sheer force of will. A talent can move and change matter, time, gravity, the laws of physics, or another creature's mind. In rare occurrences, a creature is born with the potential to harness psionic power. But only those who experience an awakening, an event that activates a talent's abilities, can tap into the mind's full strength.</p>\n<h2>Mind Powers</h2>\n<p>Through exerting their will, talents can send telepathic messages across the land, control fire, shoot forth beams of psychic energy, and more. While psionics and magic share similarities and can sometimes achieve the same results, they have different sources of power. Spellcasters draw magic from the energies of the world around them. Psionic heroes manifest their powers from inside themselves, with a talent's abilities derived from a heightened force of will and mental fortitude. This strength allows a talent to harness their personal energy and project it into the world, letting them manipulate the environment, objects, and other creatures.</p>\n<p>Though mages have a limited reserve of spell slots they can use each day, the talent is limited only by their own energy. Powerful psionic heroes can have multiple active powers at once and change reality at will. But this limitless potential is built on a gamble. Every manifestation has a chance of harming the talent—and talents who use too many powers too quickly can die from the exertion.</p>\n<h3>Awakening</h3>\n<p>A talent's latent psionic power activates when they experience some kind of awakening. Many of these events occur when a psionic creature uses a power in the presence of the nascent talent. But a talent might also discover their power while in a heightened emotional state or a moment of need. Many talents manifest their powers for the first time to defend the ones they love, or to survive a dangerous situation.</p>\n<h3>Few Exist</h3>\n<p>Most high fantasy worlds hold far fewer talents than wizards or clerics. Most folks don't even know of talents, and those who do often laugh away the tales of mysterious mind mages as flights of fancy. Psionic potential among Humanoids is rare.</p>\n<p>In different cultures and settings, people will respond differently to the existence of psionic Humanoids. In some places, the powers and intellect of talents might make them respected advisors, leaders, spies, and tacticians. In others, the public might be wary of those who can read minds without so much as a word or flourish. And in many areas, talents might be revered by some and mistrusted by others in equal measure.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3>A Wild Talent Appears!</h3>\n  <p>Why are talents and psionic powers so rare? Because most fantasy worlds don't include them at all! By making psionics rare—or even a secret—a GM can more easily introduce the concept into an existing game.</p>\n  <p>If you're starting a new campaign and want psionics to play a big role in the world you create, don't let the lore here stop you. A world where psionics are more common than magic sounds like a fun campaign! But if you're a GM or player who wants to use the talent or psionic powers in an existing game, then the fiction is built to make your life easier. Talents have always been part of the world, but no one really knew about them. Until now…</p>\n</aside>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.VMJZD5l4EzSG9PQT]</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Talent Academies</h2>\n<p>Though not every talent makes a formal study of psionics, groups of talents dedicated to specific psionic specialties maintain academies that search the land for new students, inviting them to come study and learn to control and increase their power. Many talents continue to live, work, and train at their academies long after they master their power. The heads of these institutions send experienced members out on quests to recruit new students, seek and control psionic monsters, and recover important artifacts.</p>\n<p>Six talent academies are known—one for each psionic specialty. Because talents are rare, each academy has only a small number of members.</p>\n<h2>Maverick Talents</h2>\n<p>While most talents specialize in a particular psionic specialty, some are never driven to embrace such a focused approach to their power. These maverick talents always work outside the structure of the academies. They might learn from one or more tutors or train their powers alone, possibly unaware that different psionic disciplines even exist. Mavericks learn techniques that can enhance any power they manifest.</p>\n<h2>Variety of Powers</h2>\n<p>A talent who dedicates themself to a single specialty—chronopathy, metamorphosis, pyrokinesis, resopathy, telekinesis, or telepathy—has a chosen specialization built around that discipline. However, specialized talents also have access to powers from all other psionic specialties. A pyrokinetic talent might also read the minds of others, just as a telepath might be able to make a carriage float into the air through sheer force of will. Even talent academies, which focus on specific psionic specialties, teach their students to be well rounded in the art of psionics, learning to manifest numerous powers so as to be able to wield a helpful tool in any situation.</p>"

Heroes who wield these gifts use only their thoughts and bodily energy to hurl objects through the air, send telepathic messages, manipulate time, and reshape the world around them.</p>\n<p>This section details the rules for using powers for player characters. The GM has a lot of plates to spin, so psionic monsters and NPCs (detailed later in this supplement) follow simpler rules, while the rules for characters are more versatile, more customizable, and more complex.</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.E0DRcn7v6fZnUNlP]</p>\n<h2>Core Mechanic</h2>\n<p>The basic premise of the talent is that as long as you can stand the strain, you can keep manifesting powers. Talents don't use spell slots. Manifesting a power is as simple as rolling a die. The more effective the power, the higher you need to roll, but theoretically, your character could manifest powers all day if you're very, very lucky.</p>\n<p>As long as you keep rolling high, you can keep manifesting freely. But rolling low means that although you manifest your powers, you also accumulate strain. At first, this is little more than a nuisance, but eventually, strain can have serious ramifications. In fact, enough strain can kill a talent, so it's always up to the talent to decide how to deal with it. How desperate is the situation? How badly do you need to succeed? How much are you willing to sacrifice to save your friends—or the world?</p>\n<p>The power is in your hands.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">New Action: Manifest a Power</h3>\n  <p>Talents and other creatures manifest psionic powers and can use them to great effect in combat. To that end, this supplement introduces a new action option for creatures with access to psionic powers: Manifest a Power.</p>\n  <p>Each power has a manifestation time, which specifies whether the manifester must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to manifest the power. Manifesting a power is therefore not necessarily an action, but most powers have a manifestation time of 1 action.</p>\n  <p>Any effect that ends as the result of casting a spell, such as the <em>invisibility</em> or <em>sanctuary</em> spells, also ends if you manifest a power in the same way. If you wear armor you lack proficiency with, you can't manifest powers because the armor's bulk is a mental distraction.</p>\n  <p>Psionics are powers of the mind. As such, any effect that affects a creature's mind to prevent that creature from taking the Cast a Spell action also prevents them from taking the Manifest a Power action. This includes effects such as the barbarian's Rage feature and the <em>feeblemind</em> spell. The GM has the final say in which specific effects prevent a talent from manifesting a power.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2>What Is a Power?</h2>\n<p>A power is a specific psionic effect created by energy drawn out of the manifester's body. A power is an incredible tool that can solve problems, harm enemies, or protect and aid you and your allies, but it can also drain your life energy. The stronger the power, the more energy it can take from you. Every power has an order from 1 to 6. The higher a power's order, the more difficult it is to learn and use.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Not Magic</h3>\n<p>Powers aren't magical. Effects and spells that affect or interact with magic, including <em>antimagic field</em>, <em>counterspell</em>, <em>detect magic</em>, <em>dispel magic</em>, <em>globe of invulnerability</em>, and <em>identify</em>, have no effect on psionic powers or psionic items. Likewise, effects that affect or interact with powers don't affect spells, magic items, or other magical effects.One possible exception to this rule is allowing psionics and magic to overcome the same damage resistances. See the “Supernatural and Mundane” sidebar for details.</p>\n<h2>Manifesting Powers</h2>\n<p>Many psionic creatures have a number of times each day that they can manifest a specific power, and regain all their uses of a power when they finish a long rest. Talents can theoretically manifest an unlimited number of powers each day, but as they do, they risk gaining strain. For more information about how talents manifest powers, see “The Talent” section in this supplement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Ready a Power</h3>\n<p>To use the Ready action with a power, the power must have a manifestation time of 1 action. When the trigger for the readied power occurs, you use your reaction to manifest it and make a manifestation test for the power (see the “Class Features” section below). If you take damage while you are readying a power, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw as if you were concentrating on the power, or it fails (see “Concentration”).</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Manifestation Ability</h3>\n  <p>Every creature that can manifest one or more psionic powers has a manifestation ability. For talents, this ability is Intelligence, but other creatures might use Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>Many powers specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of the power's effects. The power specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.</p>\n<p>The DC to resist one of your psionic powers equals 8 + your manifestation ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Save-Ends Effects</h3>\n<p>On a failed saving throw, some powers impose a debilitating effect for an extended duration. But sometimes a target can retry their saving throw and potentially end the effect early. In such situations, the power specifies “save ends at end of turn.” Whenever this phrase appears, it means any creature affected by the power can repeat the saving throw on each of their turns, ending the effect on themself early on a success.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Supernatural and Mundane</h3>\n  <p>“Supernatural” is a new game term that describes an effect or item that is either magical or psionic. For instance, a creature might have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from attacks that aren't supernatural. This means that as long as an attack comes from a spell, power, magic weapon, or psionic weapon, it overcomes the creature's damage resistances. If an attack, item, or effect isn't magical or psionic, it is referred to as “mundane.”</p>\n  <p>This language was created after the core rules, <em>Strongholds &amp; Followers</em>, <em>Kingdoms &amp; Warfare</em>, and multiple issues of <em>ARCADIA</em>. Many creatures in these products are immune or resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Though psionics aren't magic, the GM can decide that the damage dealt by powers counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming these creatures' damage immunities and resistances. Similarly, the GM can rule that creatures with the Magic Resistance or Limited Magic Immunity trait have advantage on saving throws against powers and psionic effects.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Attack Rolls</h3>\n<p>Some powers require the manifester to make an attack roll to determine whether the power's effect hits the intended target. Your attack modifier with a power attack equals your manifestation ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Combining Power Effects</h3>\n<p>The effects of different powers add together while the durations of those powers overlap. The effects of the same power used multiple times on the same target don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those powers applies while their durations overlap, or the most recent effect applies if the powers are equally potent and their durations overlap.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">No Multiples of the Same Power</h3>\n<p>You can't have multiple manifestations of the same power active at once. Powers with a duration of instantaneous that have ongoing effects after being manifested are an exception, and can be manifested again while the effects of an earlier manifestation are ongoing.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Physical Displays</h3>\n<p>Some powers talk about the manifester emitting a burst of energy, a beam of light, or some other physical display of psionic power. When you manifest a power that has such a display, you can choose how you direct it from your body. For example, a beam of psionic energy might flash from your outstretched hand, spring from your forehead, or erupt from your glowing eyes, as you determine.</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.SryHINPHF6ntBXfG]</p>\n<h2>Power Details</h2>\n<p>Powers follow the same rules as spells when it comes to range, targets, and areas of effect. Unlike spells, powers don't have components and can't be manifested as rituals. They also use special rules for concentration (see below).</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Power Order</h3>\n<p>Each power has an order from 1 to 6. A power of 1st order might let you hurl little objects through the air or produce small jets of flame out of nothing, while 6th-order powers allow you to bring down buildings or create a fiery vortex!</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Increased Order</h3>\n<p>A power might let you increase its order to increase its effectiveness, allowing you to target more creatures, do more damage, extend the power's duration, and more. You choose to make this increase before you manifest the power, and can increase any power to a maximum of 6th order when you do so. Whenever the rules make reference to a power's order, that always means the order the power is manifested at, including any order increase, rather than the power's baseline order with no increases.</p>\n<p>Some powers have multiple options for increasing their order. You can use more than one increased order option for a power at the same time, to a total maximum of 6th order.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Power Specialty</h3>\n<p>Every power falls under one of the following categories, known as specialties:</p>\n<p><strong>Chronopathy</strong> powers allow you to view future and past events, and to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamorphosis</strong> powers allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others, allowing for the performance of preternatural exploits.</p>\n<p><strong>Pyrokinesis</strong> powers allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things.</p>\n<p><strong>Resopathy</strong> powers allow you to manipulate matter and space to create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Telekinesis</strong> powers allow you to physically manipulate creatures and objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Telepathy</strong> powers allow you to communicate with, read, and influence the minds of other creatures.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">1st-Order Powers</h3>\n  <p>Powers of the 1st order are simple, and most creatures that can manifest them do so at will. They are similar to cantrips in many ways, and do not require a manifestation test or impose strain like higher-order powers. However, talents can gain strain by maintaining concentration on 1st-order powers (see “Strain to Maintain” in “The Talent”).</p>\n</aside>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Duration</h3>\n<p>A power's duration is the length of time it remains active after you manifest it. When you manifest a power with a duration longer than instantaneous, it remains active for the specified duration. (Instantaneous powers work just like instantaneous spells, in that they affect the world only for an instant even if they produce an effect that lingers in the world.) You can choose to end any of your current active powers at any point on your turn without using an action. If you become incapacitated or die, all of your current active powers end immediately.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Concentration</h3>\n<p>Like spells, many powers require you to maintain concentration to keep their effects active. Unlike with spells, though, you can simultaneously maintain concentration on a number of powers equal to your proficiency bonus. However, you can't concentrate on a power and a spell or other effect at the same time.</p>\n<p>If you take damage while maintaining concentration on multiple powers, you make one Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. On a failure, all the powers you are concentrating on end, but a talent can take strain to keep these powers active (see “Strain to Maintain” in “The Talent”).</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Manifestation Time</h3>\n<p>Most manifestations require a single action to attempt to manifest, but some require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to manifest.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Bonus Action</h3>\n<p>You must use a bonus action to attempt to manifest the power, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast a spell or manifest another power during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action or a 1st-order power with a manifestation time of 1 action. Similarly, if you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 bonus action, you can't manifest a power during the same turn, except for a 1st-order power with a manifestation time of 1 action.</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Reactions</h3>\n<p>A power whose manifestation time is a reaction is manifested in response to some event. If you can attempt to manifest a power as a reaction, the power description tells you exactly when you can do so.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h3 class=\"no-toc\">Sight and Manifesting</h3>\n  <p>Many powers and talent class features rely on a creature being able to see a target. However, a strict interpretation of this rule is prohibitive to any player who wants to play a blind or visually impaired hero. This supplement uses the standard language found in the core rules regarding sight, but the GM can determine that a hero can use a different sense, even a supernatural one, in place of sight when it comes to powers, features, and traits.</p>\n</aside>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\">Longer Manifestation Times</h3>\n<p>Certain powers require minutes or even hours to attempt to manifest. When you manifest such a power, you must spend your action each turn manifesting the power until its manifestation time is complete. If you fail to do so, the power fails. If you take damage while you are readying a power, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw as if you were concentrating on the power, or it fails (see “Concentration”).</p>"

Do you read the minds of spies, hurl objects across the room with a thought, bend time and space, enhance your body for battle, or control the dancing flames of an inferno?</p><p>You should also determine the details of your awakening. What made your psionic power first activate? Was it an encounter with a psionic monster or another talent? Did a moment of danger trigger your mental strength, allowing you to defend or avenge someone you cared about? Perhaps it was an instance of embarrassment, passion, rage, or other overwhelming emotion. Were you able to control your powers from the start, or did you cause many accidents? And in the aftermath, how did your family or community react when your gift manifested?</p><p>Finally, you should determine if your character joined a talent academy for training. If you did, are you still part of that institution? Who are the friends, mentors, and rivals you made, and where are they now? Who do you still keep in touch with? If your character didn't join an academy, why not? How do you train to use your powers, if at all? And how have your powers helped or hindered you while traveling your own path?</p><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>You can make a talent quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution then Dexterity. Second, choose the sage background.</p><h3>Multiclassing and the Talent</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule for multiclassing, here's what you need to know if you choose talent as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a talent.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If talent isn't your initial class, you gain no new proficiencies when you take your first level as a talent.</p><aside class=\"sidebar\"><h3>Starting at Higher Levels</h3><p>If you're creating a new talent for a game that starts above 1st level, the GM can decide to give your character additional powers that have been learned after seeing them manifested by other talents or psionic creatures. As a guideline that your GM can adjust as desired, you gain a number of extra powers of 2nd order or higher equal to half your talent level.</p><p>This optional rule isn't necessary for your talent to maintain power parity with the rest of the characters in your party.

          "text": "<p>While talent player characters track strain to use their powers, psionic creatures, NPCs controlled by the GM, and player-controlled companions need a simpler system. Especially for a GM controlling multiple creatures at once, having a separate strain track for each is a pain! Similarly, a creature adventuring alongside a character shouldn't come with a lot of resources and status effects to worry about, given that the player controlling them is already managing a more complicated hero!</p>\n<p>Psionic creatures that aren't player characters typically make use of fewer powers than a player character talent. GM-controlled creatures have exactly what they need for an encounter to make their stat blocks easy to run, while player-controlled allies have enough to support the characters without overshadowing them or slowing down combat Instead of tracking strain, these creatures can manifest certain powers at will, and can manifest other powers one to three times per day.</p>\n<p>If a psionic creature has a power that's meant to be used in combat, it appears in their stat block as an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, with the power's order in parentheses next to its name. Unless otherwise noted, a power in a creature's stat block can be manifested only at the lowest possible order. Some creatures also have innate psionic features that aren't powers, many of which are exclusive to those creatures</p>\n<h2>Manifesting Multiple Powers</h2>\n<p>Unlike player characters, if a creature's stat block allows them to manifest a power as a bonus action, they can still manifest another power of 2nd order or higher as an action on that turn. For example, a creature who manifests the <em>jaunt</em> power as a bonus action can also make a 2nd-order power attack as an action. Similarly, many Multiattack actions let a creature make multiple power attacks on a turn, even though each attack is a power of its own.</p>\n<h2>Power Attacks as Opportunity Attacks</h2>\n<p>When an enemy's movement provokes an opportunity attack from a creature whose stat block includes a melee power attack, the creature can use their reaction to make a melee power attack against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.</p>\n<h1>Gemstone Dragons</h1>\n<p>A rare and long-forgotten branch of the <em>Draco</em> genus, the gemstone dragons of <em>Draco crystallus</em> bear a similar appearance to their more common cousins <em>Draco metallus </em>and <em>Draco chromaticus</em>, the metallic and chromatic dragons. But gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms with a symbiotic relationship between their living flesh and the gem crystals that cover their bodies.</p>\n<p><strong>Psionic Gems.</strong> When first hatched, a gemstone dragon is almost entirely organic, showing off only a few tiny gems appearing on their scaled skin. But as a dragon grows, those crystals spread—as does their psionic power. By threading through a dragon's body, these gem crystals form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store the psionic energy the dragon uses to manifest their power. That power has allowed many gemstone dragons to long ago abandon their wings or let them atrophy, relying instead on innate telekinesis to lift and propel them.</p>\n<p>However, even as a dragon's gems channel psionic power, grant enhanced speed and agility, and protect against physical attack, they make all gemstone dragons vulnerable to psychic assault, as that crystal lattice helps to conduct harmful psionic energy throughout their bodies.</p>\n<p><strong>Hunted Sages.</strong> Gemstone dragons hoard knowledge rather than treasure. As such, unlike their chromatic and metallic cousins, they can be found in almost any habitat, as long as the location is remote and contains a repository of knowledge. Forgotten ancient libraries are thus a favored site for gemstone dragon lairs. As keepers of forgotten lore, gemstone dragons rarely take sides in the battles between good and evil, law and chaos, acting instead to preserve the world and its knowledge, and to prevent dangerous knowledge from falling into the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>Despite their rarity and reclusiveness, gemstone dragons are sometimes sought by bold and foolish hunters hoping to claim their psionic gemstones. As a result, many dragons enter into long periods of slumber in their remote lairs, avoiding notice and awaking only during times of catastrophic need.</p>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.WP7bjTEpgFjV1iRn inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.MRuOoJzV7QNNWdGC inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.xabPeOLMpoCFH2lu inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.CH4VFeUaIVlRyhWD inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.CZ61c55tkczOW9cu inline]</p>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.bbMzByvvYs3svSdF inline]</p>\n<h1>NPC Talents</h1>\n<p>This section contains stat blocks for humanoid NPC talents of each specialization—chronopath, metamorph, pyrokinetic, resopath, telekinetic, and telepath—plus maverick talents.

          "text": "<h1>The Society</h1>\n<p>Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the glow brightening in the gem set into her ring. She raised her right hand and made a theatrical flourish to punctuate her lecture while she snuck a glance at her left hand to confirm that her Society ring was glowing. Classic misdirection.</p>\n<p>The gemstone was indeed glowing a deep orange. It was time again. She felt a quickening in her pulse and a slickness on her skin, but of course the students couldn't see this. She turned her ring around her finger so that when she closed her fist the crystal pressed into her palm to hide the light.</p>\n<p>“Finally,” she said, “I know you're all looking forward to your weekend but there is a performance tomorrow night of Xenophia's <em>Each in Their Turn</em> at the Petal in King's Cross. A classic Notionalist play that is actually very funny, and I'm sure most of the people in the audience will completely miss the themes of ignorance versus knowledge and the difference between what is true and what is correct. But you won't!” She smiled and pointed at the young faces before her. Most of them smiled back.</p>\n<p>“Or at least you better not or I'll consider it a personal failing. Attendance is not required, but we're going to examine the play all next week and some of the next, so I spoke to the bursar and the university has <em>kindly</em> agreed to donate fifteen pairs of tickets which should cover you all. No you may NOT bring your friends or current infatuations. These are for students, so come see me if you wish to attend.”</p>\n<p>She clasped her left hand with her right, obscuring her Society ring for a moment. “Otherwise I will see you on Auradi. I fear I must cancel my office hours today, I have <em>many </em>papers to review.”</p>\n<p>The students were already filing out of the auditorium. She was pleased to see a goodly number gather around her desk asking for tickets to the play.</p>\n<p>“If you're lucky,” she said, handing a pair to two students from the Commonwealth, “you'll get a real sword fight in act 3.”</p>\n<p>Marcado, the son of a high-placed guild member, gave her a knowing look. “Did the University buy these tickets or did <em>you</em>, Miss Antonini?”</p>\n<p>Miss Antonini smiled and winked. “No comment,” she answered.</p>\n<p>“Uh-huh,” Marcado said, taking two tickets. “The bursar always seems more generous in Classical Philosophy.”</p>\n<p>“Well your other professors are less persuasive.”</p>\n<p>She enjoyed small talk with the students, but she could tell they were trying to keep her here and wring more attention from her in lieu of her office hours. But the Society could not wait.</p>\n<p>Tickets dispersed, she retreated to her office, drew the curtains, and picked up a stack of books from the middle of the floor she couldn't remember what she intended to do with and moved them to another place they didn't belong. She emptied her pockets and put the contents in her desk drawer. Locked it. Put the key under her ink blotter. <em>I suffice,</em> she thought automatically.</p>\n<p>She stood in the center of the darkened room, looked at the door, and made sure it wasn't locked. If someone came in while she was gone, they'd assume they just missed her. Locked doors created mysteries, and no one suspected anything mysterious about Miss Antonini.</p>\n<p>A deep breath, eyes closed, and the voice in her head projected itself a little more than normal. A broadcast. She put her hand to her head, middle finger pressed against the temple. She knew this was frowned upon but old habits died hard.</p>\n<p>&lt;I'm ready,&gt; she voiced in her mind.</p>\n<p>A moment later her assistant entered, looked around, said, “Huh,” and shrugged. He crossed the room, opened the drapes, and left.</p>\n<p>A brilliant point of prismatic light floating seven feet off the floor announced the next arrival. The Mirror and the Pillar stopped talking and turned their attention to the light, which quickly extended down to the floor in a line. The line abruptly spread apart, forming a rectangle of scintillating rainbow energy which, once door-sized, began to move backward revealing the presence of …</p>\n<p>“A child!” the Pillar said. A young man stood on the crystal floor. He looked like a street urchin, his linen shirt and linen breeches were stained and ill fit him.</p>\n<p>“Cyrvis's thorny prick!” the kid said, looking around the Fold in awe.</p>\n<p>“A <em>Vaslorian </em>child, if I'm not mistaken,” the Mirror said to the Pillar with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The young man, not older than sixteen, saw who was speaking. A normal-seeming woman with long brown hair and a metal … helmet on that looked like it protected her eyes? Thin bands of metal wrapped around her temples and a third strip of metal went over the top of her head. They met in the front and the silver metal fitted snugly into her eye sockets. Was she born without eyes?</p>\n<p>But the strange metal mask helmet was by no means the strangest thing in the giant, spherical room he found himself in.</p>\n<p>There were no obvious ways in or out of the hollow globe, but the whole interior was made out of purple and red and pink crystals. Huge crystals. They seemed to grow naturally, though the floor was made of glass or some other crystal that allowed the boy to clearly see the other hemisphere of crystals below.</p>\n<p>There was a large dias apparently made out of natural crystal as well as what looked like a diamond throne.</p>\n<p>But standing on the clear glass floor next to the masked woman was what appeared to be a giant.</p>\n<p>“A barrow-woman!” the young man said.</p>\n<p>The Mirror glanced at the Pillar and saw her puzzled expression. “In western Vasloria,” the Mirror explained, “the Hakaan live in the Barrow Hills and so are known to the locals as Barrow-men.”</p>\n<p>She approached the young man and extended her hand. “This is the Pillar. Her people call themselves the Hakaan. Welcome to the Society young man. I am the Mirror.”</p>\n<p>The kid shook the tall, lithe woman's hand, but he was staring at her helmet. “You can see me?”</p>\n<p>It was the Hakaan woman's turn to talk. Her voice was deep and sonorous. “The Mirror finds her second sight reveals more than her mundane vision, and prefers to rely on it.”</p>\n<p>“Your eyes can deceive you,” the Mirror said, raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>“What … what else do you see?”</p>\n<p>“Lots of things,” she smiled.</p>\n<p>The kid didn't like evasion and the awe abruptly left his voice. “Like what?” he challenged.</p>\n<p>“Intent?” the Mirror said, with a tilt of her head.</p>\n<p>This shut the young man up.</p>\n<p>A bright pinpoint of light and another prismatic doorway appeared and retreated, revealing a red-skinned devil-man with horns spiraling from his bald head. He was handsome and walked forward with easy grace. He glanced at the young man but he was obviously more interested in the woman with the metal mask on her eyes.</p>\n<p>She extended her arms to the tiefling and they embraced. He pulled back and said “Sorry I'm late I—”</p>\n<p>She placed her hands on the sides of his face and pulled him in for a passionate kiss. He moved his hands from her waist and braced her head with his hand and returned the kiss.</p>\n<p>The giant, tattooed Hakaan smiled and turned her head, holding up a hand to block her view of the proceedings.</p>\n<p>“Gross,” the young man said loudly, looking up at the ceiling. The couple decoupled.</p>\n<p>“Missed you too, babe,” the tiefling said smiling and gave her a knowing look. The Mirror managed to turn away before blushing.</p>\n<p>The red-skinned man turned to look at the kid. He wore a brass girdle around his waist and brass bracers on his calves and forearms, like a shirtless centurion from Phaedros. He looked the kid up and down and smiled. “Hey,” he said. “Nice to see some new blood in the Society. I'm the Sun.”</p>\n<p>“The son?” the kid asked, frowning.</p>\n<p>“The Sun,” the tiefling said and held his hand out, palm up, fingers splayed. Suddenly a sphere of plasma appeared hovering over his hand. It turned slowly and small gouts of flame erupted from its surface before looping up and over and crashing back into the surface.</p>\n<p>The young man stared fascinated but the heat was so intense he had to take a step back. The pyrokinetic closed his hand with a snap of his fingers and the image of the sun evaporated.</p>\n<p>“I'm …” the young man started. “I mean, my name is …”</p>\n<p>The tiefling held up a hand, interrupting him. “Let's wait for the rest of the team.”</p>\n<p>“Where are we?” the young boy asked, looking around the Fold in wonder.</p>\n<p>The tiefling shrugged. “We don't know. Not knowing protects this place.”</p>\n<p>“But what <em>is </em>it?” the kid asked, walking up to the curved interior of the huge room.</p>\n<p>“It is a geode,” the Hakaan woman with gray skin covered in ochre tattoos said. She gestured to the whole interior. “We are inside a giant geode. These crystals … they protect us from … most things.”</p>\n<p>“Being seen,” the Mirror said. “Being known.”</p>\n<p>“We think we're somewhere on Ix,” the Sun said. “You tend to get formations like this there. But who knows?”</p>\n<p>“Could we …” the kid reached out and touched a large red crystal. It reacted to his fingers, like tiny burning sparks running under his fingertip inside the crystal. “Could we take one of these crystals and—”</p>\n<p>Suddenly a large gray hand wrapped itself around his forearm and gently pulled his hand from the crystal. “Speculation is permitted,” the Pillar said. “Experimentation … is not.”</p>\n<p>“Sorry,” the young man said, extracting his arm from her hand. She towered over him. She was the tallest person he'd ever seen.</p>\n<p>“Where you from, kid?” the Sun asked.</p>\n<p>“Blackbottom,” he said absently. He was staring at the Pillar's ochre tattoos. They were alien but fascinating. The Hakaan woman gave off an aura of strength that had nothing to do with her size.</p>\n<p>A brilliant light shone and played off the Pillar and the crystals of the wall, signaling another arrival.</p>\n<p>The young man turned to see a lean, older woman standing behind him. She wasn't as tall as the Mirror, only a little taller than the kid. She had short, jet-black hair and hard lines on her face. She wore a faded green vest that looked embroidered, like the Mirror's outfit.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is this?” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Calm down, Witch. This is the new kid,” the tiefling said.</p>\n<p>“Witch?!” the kid said with some amusement. The old woman ignored him.</p>\n<p>She looked down at the young man. Her eyes were dead. “So this is it? We just … we just <em>replace …</em>” Emotion welled up in her, and she choked it off. Anger and despair twisted her face.</p>\n<p>The kid decided to stand up for himself.</p>\n<p>“You got a problem, lady? I piss on your cat or something?”</p>\n<p>The tiefling put a hand on his shoulder. The kid jerked it away.</p>\n<p>The woman called Witch looked at the Mirror and did not conceal her disgust. “He's too young. Get him out of here.”</p>\n<p>“She's too <em>old</em>,” the kid said with a smirk. The Mirror and the tiefling exchanged worried glances. “Hey, maybe we got a broomstick around here you could ride out of ….”</p>\n<p>The woman snarled and lunged a step forward, a blast of telekinetic energy distorted the air between them. It slammed into the tiefling and knocked him backwards onto the floor, but the kid had vanished with a <em>blip</em> sound and was now standing behind the older woman.</p>\n<p>“See what I mean?” the kid said to the assembled talents. He was smirking. The tiefling scrambled to get up. The kid didn't know the danger he was in. The Pillar was also obviously worried, but the Mirror held up a hand and they did not act.</p>\n<p>“Maybe you were something once, lady,” the kid said to the Witch's back. “But at your age your reflexes are just—<em>urk</em>!” The kid's hands flew to his neck. His mouth twisted, and he grimaced as he tried to get air in. His eyes were wide with fear.</p>\n<p>“I gave my<em> life</em> to the Society,” the Witch said, her back to the kid. She turned around and gestured with her right hand. The kid smashed into the ground, sprawled flat. It looked like an invisible giant was standing on his back.</p>\n<p>She walked forward, looked down at the young man. “And I'll be here long after you're <em>dead</em>.” Her lean face was twisted into a feral grimace. “So go back to your parents.”</p>\n<p>The muscles in his neck and back straining, the kid twisted his head around and locked eyes with the Witch. “And tell them,” she said, “we need <em>soldiers</em> not—” She stopped talking. Her eyes went wide. She was looking at the young man on the floor but seeing something else.</p>\n<p>Her face became a map of despair. She sobbed loudly once, and her telekinetic grip on the kid—the field she had created around him—vanished. He started gasping, heaving air back into his lungs, while the older woman started crying. Huge wracking sobs came from her, and she bent over and began throwing up.</p>\n<p>The kid stood up, wide-eyed. He hadn't seen a reaction this extreme to his talent. He'd already dropped whatever effect he'd created in her mind</p>\n<p>The Mirror and the Pillar went to the Witch and comforted her. The older woman tried to pull away, but the Mirror threw her arms around the other woman and hugged her close. The Witch hugged the younger woman back and cried even louder. She was repeating something. A name. The young man couldn't make it out.</p>\n<p>The Sun walked up to the kid and casually pointed to the pool of sick on the glass floor. A small white-hot beam of flame shot from his finger to the floor, incinerating the bile instantly.</p>\n<p>The kid was obviously shaken by the confrontation—by whatever he'd done to the Witch. He was watching the old woman. He was worried. Concerned. The Sun took this as a good sign.</p>\n<p>“What did you do?” he asked the young man.</p>\n<p>“I dunno I … I made her see …”</p>\n<p>“What? What did you make her see?”</p>\n<p>The kid whispered. He wasn't sure. He never knew exactly what his targets saw. But in this case he had an intuition. “Whoever I replaced, I guess.”</p>\n<p>The Sun nodded. “A resopath,” he said mostly to himself. “That figures.”</p>\n<p>The kid pushed himself to his feet. “It's only supposed to … I mean usually you just see an old friend or maybe your mom or something.”</p>\n<p>The Sun nodded. “<em>Reminiscence</em>,” he said. He looked at the Witch and imagined what she'd seen. “Yeah, you're a resopath alright.” He turned back to the young man. “I see why the bug picked you. You had maybe the most powerful telekinetic alive bearing down on you, and your instinct was to try to calm everyone down. Good instincts. Better than good.”</p>\n<p>He jerked a thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the three women. “Maybe tell her you're sorry.”</p>\n<p>“What?! Why?” the kid's cocksure confidence was back. “She started it!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah she did, and she might start it again. There's a lot of history here, and you don't get over it that easy but you took it too far.”</p>\n<p>“I didn't—”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know,” the red-skinned man nodded sympathetically. “But that's the thing, you <em>didn't</em> mean</p>\n<p>to make her see…” he glanced at the Witch who was recovering and nodding to whatever the Mirror was saying. “That. You were desperate, so you acted on instinct. She wouldn't've killed you, but you didn't know that. So yeah, it's not your fault. But you took it too far, and <em>she's </em>not gonna apologize so you got to. Trust me, it'll help.”</p>\n<p>The young man looked up at the tiefling and thought for a moment. Nodded. He took a step toward the three women but before he could voice his apology, the old woman pulled away from the Mirror.</p>\n<p>“Okay I'm sorry, alright.” She threw her hands up in the air, turned to the kid. “I apologize, okay? I'm sorry. But I ain't gonna shake hands,” she glowered. “We ain't <em>friends</em>.” She turned her back on the kid and hugged herself. “You gotta earn that shit,” she said in a quieter voice.</p>\n<p>The kid raised his eyebrows and retreated. Went back and stood next to the tiefling. “Well she's a barrel of laughs,” the kid said.</p>\n<p>The tension now mostly diffused and remembering many other such confrontations in the past, the handsome, roguish tiefling smirked. “You get used to her. Just give her space, respect. She'll come around.”</p>\n<p>The kid rolled his eyes. “Yeah I know how it sounds,” the Sun said. “But let me tell you something kid. I mean she just met you, right? Even after that little … jousting match, she knows you're one of us. And if something happened to you? She'd claw her way through a legion of archdevils to save you. I mean it. She's a little older than the rest of us, but I think that just makes her more <em>mean</em>. Pound for pound, she's the best pure warrior in the Society.”</p>\n<p>The Mirror approached the young man. Her tightly woven outfit looked like an expensive, indigo tapestry. “What did Memory tell you about us?”</p>\n<p>The kid shrugged. “I dunno, she just said … She came to see me in the jail. She talked to the guards, paid them off or something and told me … She told me it wasn't my fault.” There was a note of relief in his voice as he remembered the experience. “Told me there were other folks like me. Like you, I guess. Said they helped people. Asked if I wanted help understanding my … understanding what I can do.” He fingered his Society ring then held up his hand and showed it off. “Then she gave me this and told me to get ready. Or, I guess she said … like, ‘Prepare yourself,' or something. ‘The summons can come at any moment.' I guess this is what she meant!” The kid said, looking around the Fold.</p>\n<p>The Mirror threw a masked look at the Sun. The tiefling shrugged. “I was trained in the field,” he said. “I turned out okay.” This caused the Mirror to smile.</p>\n<p>The young man saw a bright light reflecting off the people looking at him, and he realized someone was translating into the Fold behind him.</p>\n<p>“Greetings little brother,” a female voice said. “Welcome.”</p>\n<p>The young man turned around and was confronted by a nightmare.</p>\n<p>“Aaaaa!” He screamed and backed away, holding his hands up in front of him. There was a humanoid woman with deep blue mottled skin that shifted and pulsed in different patterns.</p>\n<p>Where her head should be, there was a giant purple octopus with curling twisting arms and two large black eyes.</p>\n<p>The tentacled woman's forehead furrowed into a frown, her eyes betrayed obvious hurt, shame, and she ducked her head.</p>\n<p>“Hey!” the tiefling said, walking up behind the young man. “Come on, kid. You can't be like that.”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is <em>that</em>?!” the kid pointed at the newly arrived octopus-woman.</p>\n<p>“That's the Line. Come on, kid. You gotta apologize for real now.”</p>\n<p>“I mean what <em>is</em> it?”</p>\n<p>“Listen, kid,” the tiefling walked around and stood in front of the kid, blocking his view of the Line. “Hey, look at me.”</p>\n<p>The young man shook his head as though trying to dislodge the image from his mind, and then looked wide-eyed at the Sun. The tiefling stepped forward and crouched down, he spoke softly to the young man.</p>\n<p>“You know how it works, right? Out there in the world, you got to be careful, right?”</p>\n<p>The young man nodded, clearly afraid but more that he'd done something wrong, crossed another line.</p>\n<p>“Well in here, you don't gotta be. We can relax here. Be ourselves. These crystals protect us.”</p>\n<p>“So that's … I mean what … what <em>is</em>—”</p>\n<p>“Out there in the world,” the tiefling glanced over his shoulder. The Line was talking to the other three. The Witch put a hand on the octopus-womans' thin shoulder. “She has to pretend—all the time.” The Sun looked back at the kid. “Her talent is always on. She can't ever relax. She can't have … close friends. You understand?”</p>\n<p>“So, so out there she just looks like ….”</p>\n<p>“Just a normal woman. She's a teacher, normally.” The Sun smiled. “I think she's the kind the students bring apples to.”</p>\n<p>Everyone else was treating the alien being like it was perfectly normal that she should be here. The young man swallowed and nodded to himself. “Is she …” it was clearly too much for the kid to accept all at once.</p>\n<p>“No one knows what she is,” the Sun shrugged and stood up from his crouch. “Someone found her and … well, it's lucky we got to her eventually. The head of our order raised her—trained her. There are things in this world—or the World Below—that like to experiment. We think she's one of their … Anyway, doesn't matter. She's one of us. You understand?”</p>\n<p>The kid nodded. The Line turned and crossed the distance halfway to the Sun and the young man from Blackbottom.</p>\n<p>“I will raise my guise for the—” the Line said.</p>\n<p>“No!” The Witch said and walked up to stand behind the Line. “No you don't have to do a damned thing in here. This is our place!”</p>\n<p>“I do not mind,” the Line said, looking over her shoulder at her friend. She turned back to look at the kid. “It will help the young man see better,” she said, her voice calm.</p>\n<p>The Line turned her ring back around, and her form boiled away—evaporated. There was now a young Riojan woman in a sky blue dress who, admittedly, looked like a university professor standing before him.</p>\n<p>The kid took a deep breath and relaxed. He felt a little ashamed now that he could see the woman's human face, her eyes, and her expression. Even though he knew it wasn't <em>real</em>, he still felt a connection now to this person and regretted his earlier behavior for the second time in this place.</p>\n<p>“We must wait for Memory to arrive and bestow your cipher upon you. But in the meantime, you can call me the Line.”</p>\n<p>The kid shook his head. “Who comes up with these names?”</p>\n<p>“No names kid,” the tiefling said. “The less we know about each other, the better. That's the idea anyway.”</p>\n<p>“It is safer this way,” the Hakaan woman said.</p>\n<p>“Tons of wizards across Orden would love to get a look at the inside of this place. Capture one of us. No names makes it hard for them.”</p>\n<p>“So we use ciphers,” the Mirror said.</p>\n<p>“And to answer your question, young master. <em>I</em> assign the ciphers,” intoned a deep voice from the dias.</p>\n<p>“Black gods!” the kid shouted. The figure standing before the throne was a bipedal insect creature holding a thin crystal staff. They were humanoid in shape but possessed two short antennae, large dragonfly wings, and wide multifaceted eyes.</p>\n<p>“Remember,” the Sun whispered from right behind him. “In this place we don't have to pretend.”</p>\n<p>The kid swallowed and nodded. Then he bowed, causing the insect creature's million-faceted eyes to grow wide with surprise. “Memory,” he said. “I was … glad to receive your summons.”</p>\n<p>The insect creature looked to each of her disciples in turn and smiled.</p>\n<p>“Well done, young man. This place is called the Fold, as it is little more than a fold in the timescape. And the Line is not the full cipher I assigned your teammate. She is the Line between Regret and Hope.”</p>\n<p>The young man went and stood next to the woman who was an octopus a moment ago. He looked up at her face. “Can I call you Hope?” he asked.</p>\n<p>A bright smile beamed from the Riojan-seeming woman. She nodded and her brown eyes crinkled when she smiled. “That would be nice,” she said. “I would like that.” The kid smiled back.</p>\n<p>He felt the Witch watching him. He looked at her and saw a pained, confused look on her face. When she caught the boy looking at him, she cast her gaze to the floor.</p>\n<p>“The bug likes weird names,” the tiefling said. “You get used to it.”</p>\n<p>“Uh-huh,” the kid said. “So what's my … I mean … Do I get a name?”</p>\n<p>“All things in their time …” the insect woman said as she walked down the steps from the dias.</p>\n<p>“What about you, you never told me your full … cipher?”</p>\n<p>“I am the Memory of a Sunset at Dawn.”</p>\n<p>The kid peered at their insectoid leader, trying to decipher the cryptic name. Was it random, or did it hold some hidden meaning?</p>\n<p>“I like it,” he said. “Sounds Elvish.”</p>\n<p>“It's pretty Elvish,” the tiefling nodded. “We just call her Memory. When we're in a good mood.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” the Witch said, not without humor. “Any names you hear us call her when we're blitzed, maybe don't repeat ‘em in here.”</p>\n<p>“Your garb,” Memory said as she approached the young man and stood before him. “Most inappropriate.”</p>\n<p>Looking at his teammates' outfits, the kid noticed their color scheme. He looked down at his worn clothes, and concentrated. Closed his eyes. When he opened them, he was wearing a tailored outfit embroidered with gold threads that glittered and caught the light. He smiled at his inventiveness. He wished he could see himself.</p>\n<p>“Well done,” Memory said. “Much better. Have you been training?”</p>\n<p>The kid nodded. “Practicing.”</p>\n<p>“Show me.”</p>\n<p>“What do you want to see?”</p>\n<p>“You've met the Pillar?” Memory asked.</p>\n<p>The kid looked at the Hakaan who winked back at him. He smiled. “Yeah I met her.”</p>\n<p>“Lift her.”</p>\n<p>“Classic,” the Sun said.</p>\n<p>“Sure, I get it,” the kid said. “Okay, gimme some space.”</p>\n<p>The Society started to spread out, but the insect creature who led them barked an order.</p>\n<p>“No! Space is an illusion. Turn your back on the Pillar.”</p>\n<p>The kid held up his hands in defense, but he did as he was told.</p>\n<p>“Feel her there. And lift her, if you can.”</p>\n<p>The teeanger flexed his arms and splayed his fingers. Tension began rippling through them, and his arms and fingers twisted slowly, trying to feel the power. Shape it. Control—</p>\n<p>“No!” Memory said, and rapped the young man's hand with her crystal staff. He yelped.</p>\n<p>“These vulgar displays are pure theatrics. Concentrate. Take every motion you yearn to make, channel them all into a single point—and lift.”</p>\n<p>The kid nodded and took a deep breath. Though he could not see it, behind him the Pillar smiled and looked at the others. Nodded to them. Then she braced her arms and her skin rippled, darkened, and hardened. In a moment, she was made of solid iron.</p>\n<p>The kid stood on the glass floor, motionless. Eyes closed.</p>\n<p>“He has me,” the Pillar said quietly.</p>\n<p>“Good,” Memory said. “Continue.”</p>\n<p>The kid's brow furrowed. He gritted his teeth. The Pillar, who must have weighed several tons in her iron form, wobbled slightly.</p>\n<p>The kid started to shake. Though he wasn't moving, his muscles were all taught, tendons stood out on his neck. She wasn't just iron, she was <em>resisting</em>. She was using her talent to resist his telekinesis. Was anyone else helping her? How many talents was he fighting?</p>\n<p>He grunted. The crystal floor cracked. His nose started to bleed. And the rest of the Society gasped.</p>\n<p>The Pillar hovered an inch off the ground. Her eyes wide.</p>\n<p>“Okay. Okay! Stop! Stop! Stop!” the Sun said, breaking the tension. The Pillar dropped back to the glass floor. The kid's eyes flew open, and he started breathing again. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, you've been practicing all right. Good job, kid. Welcome to the Society.”</p>\n<p>The other members of the team gathered around him and clapped him on the shoulders. Even the Witch seemed to have swallowed her previous judgment, but she didn't join the congratulations.</p>\n<p>“Is it just us?” the kid asked.</p>\n<p>“Nah,” the Sun said. “But we're the strike team.”</p>\n<p>“Should you return from this mission,” Memory said. “You will see the school, but first…”</p>\n<p>Memory began manifesting her talent, and the other members of the Society approached her.</p>\n<p>“You can call me Zjin,” the tiefling said to the kid as they walked over. “We don't gotta be that formal all the time. The bug don't really mind.”</p>\n<p>“She didn't look like a bug when I met her,” the kid said, exhaling meaningfully. Obviously the experience still awed him.</p>\n<p>Zjin reached out and fingered the gold-embroidered outfit the kid conjured for himself. “Can't judge people by appearances, kid. Lesson one. Get that straight, or you might as well leave now.”</p>\n<p>The kid nodded. Memory was conjuring something—an image of a sphere. Detail slowly emerged.</p>\n<p>“You don't, ah, you don't gotta tell me <em>your </em>name, if you don't want to,” the tiefling said in a quiet voice while they all watched the globe resolve.</p>\n<p>“Is this another test?”</p>\n<p>“Hah! Good question kid. Everything's a test in this place, I guess.”</p>\n<p>“I thought it was going to be … other kids my age.”</p>\n<p>“Me and…” the Sun hesitated a moment, and the kid realized he was trying to remember the masked woman's code name. Because he normally just uses her real name. The kid understood a little bit more about how this place worked. “The Mirror. When we joined, we were all kids—except the Witch.”</p>\n<p>They were looking at a representation of Orden made of light. “Our world,” Memory said. The kid was fascinated. He had never seen any representation of Orden, even a map. Not even a map of Vasloria. He'd never seen <em>any </em>map.</p>\n<p>Memory concentrated, and the globe spun. Parts of it resolved away until they were looking at a closeup of what the kid thought was Vasloria. He thought he recognized Blackbottom and the bay. The ground sped away as the map moved. Eventually they were looking at a section of Vasloria the kid guessed was western Corwell—the other side of the mountains.</p>\n<p>“This conflagration occurred less than an hour ago.”</p>\n<p>A bright flash erupted from the map that floated in front of them. The others were surprised. The kid didn't know what to expect or what to think about what he saw.</p>\n<p>“That's significant,” the Line said, a little awe in her voice.</p>\n<p>“Major,” the Witch said.</p>\n<p>“Yes, but such a display would normally be cause for observation, not intervention. However, allow me to let the moment repeat.”</p>\n<p>The map grew. The conflagration scaled up. They could make out more detail now—a road, towns, a forest. The view expanded until the forest filled it. At this scale, the psionic conflagration looked like a solar flare erupting from the wood. It repeated over and over. The kid thought he noticed something. The conflagration</p>\n<p>ignited then began to fade, but before it could fade away, it was extinguished, like a candle quickly blown out.</p>\n<p>The Mirror took a step forward and peered at the map with her steel-masked eyes. “Something absorbed the psionic energy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Memory said. “I didn't notice it at first, but upon repeat it became obvious. The talent flared bright and was then extinguished.”</p>\n<p>The Sun looked at the Mirror. “Not a lot of things can do that.” The Mirror crossed her arms and sighed, thinking.</p>\n<p>“A null,” the Witch said with a dour, eager grin. “How long ago? Less than an hour? We should leave now, whatever this is,” she pointed to the repeating eruption of psionic energy, “the fight might not be over.”</p>\n<p>“You realize the danger here,” the Sun said.</p>\n<p>“Well, I don't,” the kid said. “Someone explain it to me.”</p>\n<p>“The nulls hunt us,” the Pillar said. “They are immune to our talent. We believe they can sense psionic energy. We do not know the limit of their range. It may be functionally unlimited.”</p>\n<p>“It's indexed against total psychographic energy,” the Line said. “Output if we're lucky. Potential if we're not.”</p>\n<p>“What's that in normal people talk?”</p>\n<p>“It means if someone manifests a power of sufficient magnitude, maybe every null in Orden could sense it,” the Sun said.</p>\n<p>“What was that ‘if we're lucky' part?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah. That's if we're lucky. If we're not, then the nulls can sense you based on what you're <em>capable </em>of. Doesn't matter if your talent is active or not.”</p>\n<p>“The Master of Vipers,” the Pillar said in a low tone.</p>\n<p>All the air went out of the room. No one spoke. The map silently flared with iridescent rainbow energy every few seconds. The Witch was starting to breathe fast.</p>\n<p>“What?” the kid asked. “The master of what?”</p>\n<p>“Vipers,” the Sun said eventually. He shook off the reverie. “He's a null. Part of an order of … it's hard to explain.”</p>\n<p>“He killed the man you are replacing,” the Mirror said finally. Glances from the others indicated that revealing this information was controversial.</p>\n<p>“Come on. Don't scare the new kid,” the Sun said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, too late for that,” the kid said.</p>\n<p>“He caught the Sky unawares,” the Pillar said. “It could not have happened were he not alone.”</p>\n<p>“This guy? Which guy?”</p>\n<p>“He was the Bolt That Cracks the Sky,” Memory said. “He was a loyal soldier and brave.”</p>\n<p>“He's dead,” the Witch said. “And this isn't the Master of Vipers. I'd know.”</p>\n<p>“But it could be a null,” the Sun said.</p>\n<p>The Witch nodded.</p>\n<p>“Wonderful,” the new member of the Society said.</p>\n<p>“Don't worry kid. We can handle a null.”</p>\n<p>“He is correct,” the Pillar said. “What we cannot handle … what we've never <em>had</em> to handle … is a team of nulls.”</p>\n<p>“Six of the Gray Order? Mind versus body?” the Witch said, looking at the repeating conflagration. She seemed hungry. “One hell of a fight.”</p>\n<p>“So what do we do?” the kid asked.</p>\n<p>The Sun looked at the rest of the Society then down at the kid. “What do you think?”</p>\n<p>“Well,” the kid gestured at the floating map made of light, “if that's … I mean, what if that's someone like me? Someone who doesn't know how to … I mean, I ended up in <em>jail</em>.”</p>\n<p>“What do you suggest?” Memory asked. The kid's imagination was already running away with him. He didn't notice the new test.</p>\n<p>“Well we gotta help her!” the kid said, pointing at the map.</p>\n<p>“Her?” the Pillar asked, smiling.</p>\n<p>“I mean, whoever. I don't care, but we can't just stay here! We gotta do something!”</p>\n<p>The Sun looked at the Witch, who was watching the kid. She looked at the tiefling and nodded. The kid was all right.</p>\n<p>“Mirror,” the Witch asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes?”</p>\n<p>“Have you <em>seen</em> this?” the older woman pointed at the map.</p>\n<p>“No.” The Mirror lifted her steel gaze to the roof. She was seeing something else. For the first time she looked blind. “We just passed the boundary of a nexus. Probably as soon as we saw the summons. Within the nexus, all futures are equally possible. Equally impossible. All is fog.”</p>\n<p>No one spoke for a moment. Silence in the Fold. Then the Witch looked at Memory.</p>\n<p>“We go,” she said.</p>\n<p>“And if this isn't a cry for help?” the Pillar asked. “If it's an attempt by the Gray Order to lure us out into the open? An ambush?”</p>\n<p>The Witch grinned a feral grin. “Then we <em>assault</em> the ambush.”</p>\n<p>Memory made a gesture, and the map made of light dissolved and faded away.</p>\n<p>“The Mirror of Yesterday and Tomorrow must<br />decide.”</p>\n<p>The Mirror looked at her teammates one after the other. Nothing was said. She could tell how they each felt.</p>\n<p>“<em>She's</em> in charge?” the kid asked the tiefling.</p>\n<p>The Sun nodded. “Out in the field, yeah. Otherwise it's the bug. Trust me, kid. Having a leader who can see the future has its advantages.”</p>\n<p>The Mirror turned back to the head of the order. “We go,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Then the Society will undertake this mission,” Memory announced. “The Pillar of Ten Thousand Years. The Mirror of Yesterday and Tomorrow. The Witch Who Cries Blood. The Sun Reflected in Death's Eyes.”</p>\n<p>“Whoah,” the kid said looking up at the tiefling standing next to him. The tiefling looked down at him and winked.</p>\n<p>Memory looked at the newest member of the Society. “And the Arrow of Truth.”</p>\n<p>“The Arrow! Cooool!”</p>\n<p>“Pretty cool,” the tiefling nodded.</p>\n<p>“Prepare yourselves,” Memory said.</p>\n<p>The Mirror and the Witch conferred to discuss strategies. The insect woman called Memory approached the young man and the tiefling.</p>\n<p>“Perhaps I should go with you,” Memory said. The tiefling's eyes widened.</p>\n<p>“If you come with us, and something happens …”</p>\n<p>“To me, you mean.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah. If you're killed then we're all stranded a thousand miles from home. Farther, for some of us. No, Memory. You stay here, and get us out in case things are—”</p>\n<p>“Complicated?”</p>\n<p>“I was going to say, ‘Not what they seem.'”</p>\n<p>“You suspect subterfuge?”</p>\n<p>The tiefling shook his head. “I don't have to. That's the Mirror's job.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The trees lay on the ground, snapped near their bases and toppled over as though a massive hurricane flattened everything so fast that the trees didn't even have time to pull up their roots.</p>\n<p>“Black gods,” the kid—the Arrow—said.</p>\n<p>The trees were crystal—had been <em>turned</em> to crystal. Iridescent rainbow crystal in a wide cone reaching deep into the wood except for a single line of trees that were still standing—still green and brown, bark and leaf. Some of the trees in the line were half living, half crystal.</p>\n<p>The line extended straight out from a man who stood above a young girl—collapsed on the forest floor—and ended at exactly the spot he stood on. He wore simple peasant clothes. He looked Khemharan. His head was shaved bald.</p>\n<p>The girl was half sitting, half laying on the ground, propped up by one arm. The cone of crystal seemed to point directly at her.</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.4MArxbaCqwp6qOxd]</p>\n<p>“I knew it,” the kid whispered as he looked at the young girl with flaxen hair. She seemed about his age.</p>\n<p>“The talent works that way sometimes,” the Sun said. “You get used to it.”</p>\n<p>In and among the crystal forest were many glass statues, very lifelike. Hobgoblins, the devil-kin, each of them in a battle pose, frozen in place. Many of the demogoblin statues were shattered. Trunks and legs stood alone. There were at least two dozen of them.</p>\n<p>“Society, remain calm,” the Mirror said. “But ready,” was implied.</p>\n<p>The Khemharan man turned from the girl to look at the Society. He showed no surprise or alarm, but he took a step back toward the girl.</p>\n<p>“It worked,” he said, a little awe in his voice. The young girl looked up at him. She seemed afraid.</p>\n<p>The Society spread out. “<em>What</em> worked?” the Witch said.</p>\n<p>The Arrow held out his hand in what he thought was a discrete gesture, fingers splayed, and concentrated on the Khemharan.</p>\n<p>“Don't bother, kid,” the Sun said. “It's like trying to catch fog.”</p>\n<p>“The Sky believed the nulls were too <em>real</em> for psionics or sorcery to work on them,” the Line said. She was still in her Riojan University Professor guise.</p>\n<p>“Yeah well, he was never very forthcoming on what that meant,” the Sun said.</p>\n<p>“You summoned us,” the Pillar said.</p>\n<p>The Khemharan man shook his head once, rapidly. “I hoped. Her need is great,” he said, pointing to the young woman. “But there were other reasons for …” he turned and looked at the girl, then to the crystal demogoblin statues.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, we can see the other reasons,” the Witch said.</p>\n<p>The Arrow approached the girl. “Hi,” he said, trying to get into her eye line. She ducked her head away from him.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a discreet distance, he walked around until she was looking at him out of the corner of her eye. “My name's Alex,” he said. “What's yours?”</p>\n<p>Without getting up, the girl scrambled to put the Khemharan between them. The kid's brow furrowed as he tried to work out the relationship. The air between them crackled with fear. Fear of … each other? Of themselves? The Arrow couldn't tell. But the girl reminded him of something.</p>\n<p>She reminded him of himself when his talent first manifested. His eyes went wide as he looked at the crystallized forest and realized what happened.</p>\n<p>The Mirror took a step forward and regarded the Khemharan from behind her gleaming silver mask.</p>\n<p>“You're a null,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” the Khemharan said, his voice tight.</p>\n<p>“You train your whole life to hunt and kill people like her.”</p>\n<p>“Like <em>us</em>,” the Witch said.</p>\n<p>“No. No. Not kill. Stop. You people need to be observed. Contained.” A dark cloud passed over the null's face.</p>\n<p>“Jailed,” the Line said.</p>\n<p>“Tortured,” the Witch spat.</p>\n<p><em>“Regulated</em>,” the null defended himself. “Your power is <em>unnatural.”</em></p>\n<p>“‘Unnatural?'” the kid said. “You saying we're <em>freaks</em>?” Something about seeing the young girl—his age, terrified of herself, of her power—angered him. &lt;You're not a freak,&gt; the kid projected toward the girl.</p>\n<p>Her eyes went wide. Her expression something between hope and hunger. &lt;You can hear me?&gt;</p>\n<p>The kid nodded. &lt;Yeah,&gt; he said. &lt;You're safe now,&gt; he thought, hoping it was true. They both looked at the Null. “Of course,” the kid thought. “He can't hear her mindspeech. It'd be like talking to a rock.”</p>\n<p>“Your abilities require no discipline!” the null insisted. “No study! And therefore there is no cost to you.” He looked at each member of the Society in turn, registering them. “Power without discipline is the beginning of every evil thing.”</p>\n<p>“No study, maybe,” the Sun looked at the kid and the girl. “I grant you that. But discipline?” He looked back at the null. “That's all we have.”</p>\n<p>“What use is discipline to one who was <em>born</em> knowing their powers!”</p>\n<p>“The discipline comes,” the Mirror said, “in <em>not </em>using the talent.”</p>\n<p>“<em>Ars est celare artem</em>,” the Line said.</p>\n<p>The null looked at the Mirror. He thought about what she said. “Perhaps,” he admitted.</p>\n<p>“What did you do?” the Pillar asked.</p>\n<p>“I helped her,” the Null said.</p>\n<p>“He saved me,” the young girl spoke for the first time.</p>\n<p>“I meant, how did you summon <em>us</em>?” the Hakaan asked. She was solid iron—had been as soon as they arrived. The kid wondered, “The null is immune to the talent. Is he immune to solid living iron?”</p>\n<p>The null looked down at the young girl. His face was impassive, but she looked afraid—ashamed—like she'd done something wrong.</p>\n<p>“You provoked her,” the Line realized.</p>\n<p>He said nothing. She looked away.</p>\n<p>“She didn't know you were a null!” the Arrow realized.</p>\n<p>“You provoked her into using her power,” the Mirror said.</p>\n<p>The Sun walked up to the girl. She didn't flinch or try to get away or avoid his gaze.</p>\n<p>“He knew he was immune,” the tiefling said. “That's what a null is. So he provoked you, scared you, made you angry probably, and you lashed out. Killed the hobgoblins and …” he gestured to the glass trees. “And all this. But your friend here was untouched.”</p>\n<p>The girl looked up at the null. “You did that? You knew?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” the Khemharan nodded once. “You need help. Guidance. They can help you,” he gestured behind him to the Society. “They <em>want</em> to help you, but I can't. I can't teach you what you need to know.”</p>\n<p>“And you hoped provoking her into unleashing her talent would draw our attention,” the Mirror said.</p>\n<p>The null turned to her. “Yes.”</p>\n<p>“If that's true,” the Arrow said. “If you <em>summoned</em> us to help this girl, what was all that talk about discipline for?”</p>\n<p>The Witch cocked her head, regarded the null, trying to figure him out. “Why would you accuse us of the opposite of what you're asking us to do?”</p>\n<p>“This one,” he said, pointing behind him to the girl, “is a power unlike any I've seen. She's alone, desperate.”</p>\n<p>“All the more reason for you to…” the Pillar softened what she was going to say. “To <em>stop</em> her.”</p>\n<p>The null looked down, shook his head. “I cannot. I cannot … do <em>that</em>. So I called you.”</p>\n<p>The Mirror, the Witch, and the Sun convened an impromptu meeting. The Arrow decided to join them.</p>\n<p>“I don't trust him,” the Sun said.</p>\n<p>“Why not?” the Arrow asked, a little confused.</p>\n<p>“I dunno there's something about him. I know <em>he </em>didn't kill the Sky but … something I can't put my finger on.” He shook his head, looked at the ground. “Maybe I just don't like the look of him.”</p>\n<p>“What was that you said about <em>not</em> judging people on their looks?” the Arrow asked.</p>\n<p>The Sun's head jerked up. He looked at the kid. A smirk spread across his red lips. “Touché kid.”</p>\n<p>“Well we definitely bring the girl,” the Witch said, crossing her arms.</p>\n<p>“What if she doesn't want to come?” the Sun asked.</p>\n<p>“It must be her choice,” the Mirror said. “And she needs to <em>understand </em>the choice she's making.”</p>\n<p>The Arrow noticed something. He took a step toward the null.</p>\n<p>“Hey. Hey what's he doing?” the kid asked. All of them turned to face the null.</p>\n<p>He was shaking—his hands balled into fists, his eyes squeezed shut. Every muscle on his body was rigid.</p>\n<p>The Line peered at him. “Is he … trying to <em>manifest </em>…” She couldn't finish the thought. Couldn't fit what she was seeing into what she knew.</p>\n<p>“What's he <em>doing</em>?” the Arrow looked up at the Sun.</p>\n<p>“I don't know! What do you mean?”</p>\n<p>“I don't know what I mean! Look at him! He's … he's straining. Against <em>something!”</em></p>\n<p>The Mirror's head snapped to the east. “Society!” she called out. “Prepare yourselves!”</p>\n<p>“He's trying to…” the Line reached a hand out, like she could feel heat radiating off the null. “Trying to <em>suppress </em>something!” She looked at the Sun.</p>\n<p>“Something big,” the Witch agreed, and snapped her hands into fists; they flared with prismatic energy. “Get ready,” she was eager.</p>\n<p>The null's eyes snapped open. “Ungh!” he shouted as some force inside him broke and he was hurled backward, slamming into the stump of a crystal tree.</p>\n<p>A bright pinpoint of ultraviolet light appeared a few yards away. The girl scrambled to get up and ran toward the null.</p>\n<p>The Sun stood next to the Mirror. “There was a third option,” he said.</p>\n<p>She nodded. “It was a cry for help,” she looked at her lover, <em>“and</em> an ambush.”</p>\n<p>The ultraviolet pinpoint became a line then expanded into a wide door. Wide enough for several people to step through.</p>\n<p>“The Gray Order?” the Arrow asked, his voice hushed.</p>\n<p>“I am a Gray,” the null said. He had recovered and was standing, bracing himself on the young girl who was helping him stand. “We study perfection of body. We strive for perfect order.” He looked with burning eyes at the glowing violet door. “We have rules,” he said darkly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” the Sun said. “These guys have no rules.”</p>\n<p>“But they got real strong opinions about who should be running things,” the Witch said ruefully.</p>\n<p>The violet doorway retreated, revealing six humanoid figures. They were as varied in ancestry and demeanor as the Society. These newcomers even wore similarly tailored outfits, but whereas each member of the Society had their own garb with their own hue, the intruders wore all black.</p>\n<p>“The Academy,” the Mirror announced.</p>\n<p>“Well, well,” an older man with long flowing black hair intoned. The leader, the Arrow intuited. “What interesting <em>fish</em> our net has caught.”</p>\n<p>“The girl comes with us,” the null said, one arm around the young lady.</p>\n<p>“She makes her own choice,” the Mirror said, cocking her head at the leader of the Academy.</p>\n<p>The old man with pale skin and long black hair ignored what they said and looked with amusement at the Witch.</p>\n<p>“Hello Christine,” he said. “Long time no see.” The Arrow gasped at the revelation. But the older woman just sneered.</p>\n<p>“Let's quit fucking around,” the Witch said, and suddenly she was gone, vanished with a quiet <em>blip</em>.</p>\n<p>The Academy looked around, their powers flared to life, as the Witch appeared behind and <em>above</em> the apparent leader—the one she had history with.</p>\n<p>She was wreathed in prismatic energy, her only intent—to kill.</p>\n<p>@Embed[inline Compendium.mcdm-class-bundle.books.JournalEntry.mcdmcbreferences.JournalEntryPage.0NUIAI7DLHnLn0hI]</p>"
