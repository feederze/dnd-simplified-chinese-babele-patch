Which team will be the first to cross the deadly Straits of Shargon, cut through the jungles of the Skyfall Peninsula, and discover the great crab’s secrets?</p></section><h3 style=\"clear:both;padding-top:10px\">Encounters</h3><p>The characters and their rivals (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaMorgraveConfl]{Morgrave Expeditions Conflicts}” in this chapter) are competing to reach and explore an ancient ruin in the forest of @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaDangerousDest.JournalEntryPage.XendrikbcA9LjhOd]{Xen’drik}. The adventure involves a journey to Stormreach, the trek to the Crab Temple, exploration of the site, and then the return trip.</p><p><em><strong>Journey to Stormreach.</strong></em> The university charters a @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.actors.Actor.phbmobSailingShi]{Sailing Ship} and a crew to carry the characters to the city of Stormreach and back. You can gloss over this long trip, narrating key details as a sort of travel montage, or you can use the guidance in “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaDangerousDest.JournalEntryPage.XendrikbcA9LjhOd#journeys-to-xendrik]{Journeys to Xen’drik}” in this chapter to structure challenges and encounters during the voyage. For example, the characters might be challenged by sahuagin (one <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaSahuaginPries]{Sahuagin Priest}</strong> and four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaSahuaginWarri]{Sahuagin Warriors}</strong>) as they pass through Shargon’s Teeth.</p><p><em><strong>Trek to the Temple.</strong></em> To reach the temple, the party first needs to trek through the jungle to the village of Last Chance (see sidebar), a journey of 250 miles through the coastal terrain around the bay. About halfway there, while the party rests for the night, a group of Hostile Undead—five <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaSkeleton00000]{Skeletons}</strong> and five <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaZombie0000000]{Zombies}</strong>—approaches. The Order of the Emerald Claw (see “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaMorgraveConfl]{Morgrave Expeditions Conflicts}” in this chapter) sent them to interfere with the characters’ mission. The Undead are soaking wet, having waded ashore from the small ship that brought them and their commander from Stormreach. The ship is long gone by the time the Undead reach the shore and attack the party. The quality of the skeletons’ weapons strongly suggests but doesn’t prove their link to the Emerald Claw.</p><section class=\"notable\"><h3>Last Chance</h3><p>The tiny village of Last Chance is a self-sustaining farming community built around a large inn—a joint venture of House Ghallanda and House Jorasco. True to the village’s name, the inn provides a last night of comfort and a final opportunity for healing for explorers venturing into the wilds. A halfling named Alask d’Jorasco (Neutral Good, Small <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmPriest00000000]{Priest}</strong>) provides healing to visitors and also maintains a small supply of <em>Potions of Healing</em>.</p></section><p>The characters can rest and resupply in Last Chance, then head southeast for another 150 miles through forest terrain to the vicinity of the Crab Temple. At the start of each day of this journey, have the party choose a character to make a [[/check sur dc=12 tool=navg format=long]]. On a failed check, the party gets off course, makes no progress that day, and encounters a group of Hostile drow; roll on the Jungle Mishaps table to determine the encounter (Vulkoori drow appear earlier in this chapter).</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.tables.RollTable.efaJungleMishaps rollable inline resultLabel=\"Jungle Mishaps: Encounter\"]</p><p>Once the party has traveled 144 miles from Last Chance (6 days of successful checks at a Normal pace, or 8 days at a Slow pace), instead have each character make a daily [[/check prc dc=16 format=long]] to find signs of the Crab Temple’s location. On any day where no character succeeds on this check, they have another encounter from the Jungle Mishaps table. (Reroll a repeated result of 8 on the table.) After 3 days where at least one character succeeded on this check, the party at last discovers the Crab Temple.</p><p><em><strong>Racing Rivals.</strong></em> The party’s rivals more or less keep pace with them through most of the journey. You might give the characters a chance to interact with their rivals in Stormreach, in Last Chance, or in the jungle (particularly if you roll an 8 on the Jungle Mishaps table). Depending on how these interactions go, you can decide whether the rivals reach the temple before or after the characters, or perhaps fail in their mission entirely. Or you can assume that the rivals find the temple 11 days after leaving Last Chance, and compare that to the time the party spends to determine who wins the race.</p><p><em><strong>Crab Temple.</strong></em> The temple is a partially flooded ruin crafted by drow shortly after the fall of the empire of giants. Its name comes from a statue of a humanoid figure outside the ruins; someone removed the statue’s head at one point, and a large crab’s shell became lodged on its shoulders. Use the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.scenes.Scene.efaDragonsLair00]{Dragon’s Lair} map in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> to represent the temple. (The statue on a dais in the northeast corner of the ruins gives the temple its name.) The temple rises slightly out of a lake, so everything below level 1 is submerged, including the stairs leading down to level 2.</p><p><em><strong>Ruin Denizens.</strong></em> A band of kuo-toa (one <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoaMonitor]{Kuo-toa Monitor}</strong>, two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoaWhip000]{Kuo-toa Whips}</strong>, and five <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoa0000000]{Kuo-toa}</strong>) inhabits level 2 of the ruin. They swim quickly to level 1 and initiate combat if anything disturbs the water at the top of the stairs.</p><p><em><strong>Plundering the Ruins.</strong></em> By diving into the lower levels of the temple, the characters can find abundant ancient relics to make their expedition a success:</p><ul><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">[[/award 10PP 100GP]]</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaIridescentCon]{Iridescent conch shell}, carved with Giant runes, that echoes with the sounds of a maelstrom (worth 250 GP)</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaGiantsGoldRin]{Giant-size gold ring} set with turquoise (worth 250 GP)</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Waterproof case holding a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaPeriaptOfWoun]{Periapt of Wound Closure}</em>, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaPotOfAwakenin]{Pot of Awakening}</em>, and a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaSpellScrollTa]{Spell Scroll of Tasha’s Hideous Laughter}</em></li></ul><p><em><strong>Optional: Temple Depths.</strong></em> You can add this encounter in level 3 of the ruins if the characters can cooperate with their rivals to overcome it. In this case, the rivals come prepared with <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPotionOfWater]{Potions of Water Breathing}</em> for themselves and have enough extra to share with the party (for a price). On the bottom level of the ruin, the combined parties encounter a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoaArchpri]{Kuo-toa Archpriest}</strong>, two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoa0000000]{Kuo-toa}</strong>, and four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaGiantCrab0000]{Giant Crabs}</strong>. For this option, provide an additional treasure on this level: a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaMaceOfTerror0]{Mace of Terror}</em> or another relic from ancient Xen’drik that might serve as a bone of contention between the characters and their rivals (or the Order of the Emerald Claw) in a later adventure. It could also presage the involvement of the Lords of Dust later in the campaign.</p>"

Or will they continue to ignore the crime running rampant in our lower wards? Or, as too often seems to happen these days, will some disreputable inquisitives, working for a private agency, accomplish more than the Watch does in a month, raising the question once again of why our tax money is being spent on such an ineffectual organization?</p></section><p style=\"clear:both;padding-top:10px\"><strong>Hook:</strong> The Gold Dragon Inn might be a favored hangout of the inquisitive characters, if you want to begin the adventure with the action of the fire. Alternatively, you can start with the halfling innkeeper, Irida d’Ghallanda (Small, Lawful Evil <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaSpy0000000000]{Spy}</strong>) hiring the characters to investigate the situation.</p><h4>Encounters</h4><p>The adventure consists of these encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Fire Inside.</strong></em> Daask acquired two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaHellHound0000]{Hell Hounds}</strong> and got them inside the inn to start the fire and terrorize the folks inside. If the characters concentrate on fighting the monsters, the other people inside the inn can extinguish the flames.</p><p><em><strong>Panic Outside.</strong></em> Outside the burning inn, eight <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaDaaskRaider00]{Daask Raiders}</strong> (gnolls whose stat blocks appear in this chapter) are attacking terrified people fleeing from the fire as well as those trying to help put it out. Each gnoll tries to flee when Bloodied.</p><p><em><strong>No Great Mystery.</strong></em> Identifying the gnolls as agents of Daask isn’t difficult—it’s the conclusion most people jump to when they see gnolls involved in violence, and a number of clues back up that assumption:</p><p><strong>Interrogating the Gnolls.</strong> If any of the gnolls are captured alive (or questioned via <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplSpeakwithD]{Speak with Dead}</em>), they freely admit their involvement with Daask and growl slogans about throwing off the yoke of “the manged”—a term they use to describe furless Humanoids.</p><p><strong>Boromar Witness.</strong> A halfling named Gressie Gorben (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaBoromarSmuggl]{Boromar Smuggler}</strong>)—was attacked by a gnoll that called her a “filthy Boromar.” Gressie denies any ties to the Boromar Clan, but she admits to knowing that Daask and the Boromar Clan are involved in a long-running feud.</p><p><strong>Freight Inquiries.</strong> Inquiring with freight companies in Lower Tavick’s Landing reveals that a pair of gnolls brought a massive iron crate, large enough to hold the hell hounds, into the city from Graywall in Droaam the day before the incident. The gnolls’ papers gave their residence as a tenement in Malleon’s Gate, a district where Daask is very active.</p><p><em><strong>Boromar Connection.</strong></em> In addition to Gressie Gorben’s testimony, several clues point to a connection between the Gold Dragon Inn and the Boromar Clan:</p><p><strong>Irida d’Ghallanda.</strong> The innkeeper, who hired the characters to investigate the attack, denies any involvement with the Boromar Clan. However, widespread rumors claim that she is a frequent guest of Bestan ir’Tonn, Upper Tavick Landing’s representative on the Sharn Council—who is a known ally of the Boromar Clan.</p><p><strong>Business Records.</strong> Prying deeper into the inn’s business reveals that it receives many deliveries from a warehouse in the nearby district of Cogsgate—a warehouse owned by the Boromar Clan.</p><p><strong>Contraband.</strong> A careful search of the inn (without Irida’s knowledge) reveals that it offers contraband items to its guests, including Aundairian wine and discreet deliveries of the dreamlily drug.</p><p><em><strong>Watch Involvement.</strong></em> The Sharn Watch seems unusually eager to cooperate with the inquisitives, as long as the characters’ attention is focused on Daask and not on any connection between the inn and the Boromar Clan. If they ask about Boromar ties, their Watch contacts urge them to focus on Daask.</p><p><em><strong>Daask Hideout.</strong></em> The characters’ inquiries about Daask lead them to a hideout where some gang members await their next instructions. They include an <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaOgre000000000]{Ogre}</strong>, two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaHarpy00000000]{Harpies}</strong>, and four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaDaaskRaider00]{Daask Raiders}</strong> (they include any survivors from the inn incident). Use the eastern half of the surface level portion of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.scenes.Scene.efaDungeonHideou]{Dungeon Hideout} map in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> for this hideout.</p><p><em><strong>Reward.</strong></em> If the characters bring these Daask members to justice for their crimes, Irida d’Ghallanda pays them [[/award 500GP]] (total) and politely requests that they end their investigation.</p>"
