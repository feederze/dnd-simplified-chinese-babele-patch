The haunch never rots, and a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) or Intelligence (Arcana) check will reveal that it is undead. Eating the meat down to the bone will provide a full day's nourishment and grant you advantage on Constitution saving throws for 8 hours. The meat will regrow, fully cooked and seasoned, over the course of [[/r 1d4 + 1]] days.</p><p><strong>Curse. </strong>For 8 hours after you eat from the haunch you have disadvantage on saves against spells or effects from undead creatures.</p></div>"
