You get a free number of uses of web equal to your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier ([[@prof+@abilities.cha.mod]]). This total is renewed after a long rest. Alternatively, you may reset this number by expending a spider point as a bonus action. Each use of web produces a line of up to 20 feet. To get a web of 60 feet length, you'd need to expend 3 uses of web, for example. You can spend a maximum of twice your proficiency bonus uses of web per turn (See <strong>Maximum Web Uses per Turn/Maximum Web Length</strong> column in the @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.classes-urc.PcyxgSI7HuNCMC6A]{Master of the Web Advancement} table - [[2*@prof]]). Webs you generate are only sticky in places you want them to be sticky—this is determined upon using the feature and cannot retroactively be determined. You could, for example, not suddenly declare that a non-sticky section of an already deployed web becomes sticky. Webs cannot stick to surfaces that cause any form of damage, nor can they stick to particularly wet, oily or exceedingly hot surfaces.</p><p>You can also use your web to try to restrain enemies. You are considered to be proficient with your webs and you treat your webs as monk weapons for the purposes of proficiencies and ability interaction. You can take an Attack action and expend a use of web to try to restrain a single Medium creature. You may try to restrain creatures as a ranged attack as well, but you expend additional uses of web—a creature 30 feet away would, for example, require 3 uses of web (1 base + 2 for range). Creatures with larger sizes can be restrained as well, but you require more web. To try to restrain a Large creature, you need to expend 2 uses of web. You cannot try to restrain creatures that are larger than Large, but you can try to restrain up to two adjacent Small creatures with one use of web or up to 4 Tiny creatures. A target hit must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is restrained by your web until either it or another creature tears it free. A restrained creature may attempt another Strength saving throw on each of its subsequent turns.</p><p>Alternatively, you can target a specific body part or piece of equipment with your web attack roll. You have disadvantage on the Attack action you make, but if you hit, you may attempt to trip, hamper or blind your opponent. If you attempt to trip your opponent, he must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (your choice) or fall prone. If you attempt to blind your opponent, he must make a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw or be blinded. If you attempt to hamper the enemy by targeting a limb, shield or weapon, the enemy must succeed a Strength or Dexterity saving throw or suffer disadvantage when attacking with the webbed limb or weapon. In the case of shields, the creature loses the AC bonus the shield conveys for as long as it is webbed. As above, you can use this feature as a ranged attack, but consume more uses of web when you do so.</p><p>Your webs are vulnerable to slashing and fire damage and attacks made with weapons and effects that deal either have advantage against your webs. Your web's break DC and AC is equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier ([[10+@prof+@abilities.cha.mod]]). Your webs are considered to have 2 HP per inch of thickness.</p><hr /><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img class=\"round\" src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h4>Adjust the Item Uses portion of the Activities tab to select your Arachnid Powers.</h4></article></div><hr /><p>See also: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.JC2dZxZKjGpDIyf4]{Arachnid Powers}</p>",

While fused to your hand, you can't hold objects or manipulate objects with the hand that is fused with your crossbow. It is possible to fuse one crossbow to each of your hands, but when you do, you obviously can't use your hands. You may use your bonus action on your turn to separate one of your hands from one crossbow fused to you.</p><p>When thus fused to your body, crossbows lose the two-handed property and expend no ammunition, as your body has a small reservoir of crystalline bolts and reloads the crossbow with crystalline bolts specifically generated for the respective weapon. Your crystalline crossbows have a Capacity of 2 (see crystalline crossbow rules below) while fused to your hands. These crystalline bolts change the damage type inflicted by the crossbow to the type you inflict with your @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.J3gxBiFTP5UvRro0]{Claws of Crystal} class feature. You can generate an infinite amount of these crystalline bolts, but they melt away to a sludge after 1 minute, so they can neither be sold, nor scavenged from the battlefield.</p><p>Starting at 5th level, your crystalline ammunition receives +1 to attack and damage rolls and is treated as ammunition+1 for all intents and purposes. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.</p><p>After completing a long rest, you may spend 5 minutes in meditation to modify one of your hand's capacity to hold bolts for your crystalline crossbows. Whenever you do, you may expend a number of crystal points of up to your Constitution modifier. For each crystal point spent, you increase the Capacity of one of your crystal crossbows by 1 until you next complete a long rest. (So if you want to enhance the capacity of 2 crystal crossbows, you have to pay the costs separately.) This way of spending crystal points reduces your maximum of crystal points by the amount of crystal points spent until you complete a long rest.</p><h3><strong>Crystalline Crossbow Rules</strong></h3><p><em><strong>Capacity</strong></em>. Each crystalline crossbow has a Capacity to hold a number of bolts before requiring a reload. This is denoted by the firearm's Capacity rating.</p><p><em><strong>Reload</strong></em>. Each crystalline crossbow holds a different amount of ammunition, as denoted by the Capacity value of the crossbow. Reloading a crystalline crossbow once its Capacity is emptied requires focused concentration and takes an action during combat.</p><h3><strong>Rates of Fire</strong></h3><p><em><strong>Spread (6th Level Required).</strong></em> Crystalline crossbows with the spread property allow the wielder to affect more than one creature or object per shot, but only at normal range. When firing the crossbow, any creatures adjacent to the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + wielder's proficiency bonus + wielder's choice of either Intelligence or Dexterity modifier) or take damage equal to one die step lower than the base damage die of the firearm used. A crossbow with a base damage of 1d6 would for example deal 1d4 piercing damage to targets affected by such shrapnel, while a crossbow with a base damage of 1d10 would deal 1d8 piercing damage from spread fire. (see @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.v4NcmyxPh0xmIMNU]{Crystalline Shrapnel})</p><p><em><strong>Burst (11th Level Required)</strong></em>. The crystalline crossbow can fire short bursts, improving its damage. A burst consumes at least 3 bolts, but allows you to increase the damage inflicted on a successful attack by an additional damage die. A hand crossbow would deal +1d6 damage, for example, while a light crossbow would deal + 1d8 damage. (see @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.class-features-urc.qUwUX0YqJ9IUydLU]{Lethal Crystal Bursts})</p><p><em><strong>Automatic Fire (17th Level Required)</strong></em>. Instead of shooting at a single target, crossbows with this rate of fire property can target a 10-foot cubical area within long range with bullets. Every creature in that area must succeed a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + wielder's proficiency bonus + wielder's choice of either Intelligence or Dexterity modifier) or suffer the damage of the attack. Creatures take no damage on a successful save. Targets have advantage on their saving throw if the distance is equal to or greater than the weapon's normal range. An attack with an automatic fire crystalline crossbow consumes at least 10 bolts.

To cast one of these gemcaster spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <em>burning hands</em> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <em>burning hands</em> using either slot.</p>\n<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>\n<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the gemcaster spell list. The Spells Known column shows when you learn more gemcaster spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gemcaster spells you know and replace it with another spell from the gemcaster spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your gemcaster spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will and focus it into your gems. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a gemcaster spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your gemcaster spells.</p>\n<h3>Gemcaster Spells</h3>\n<p>Gemcasters select their spells from the Gemcaster spell list.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>See also: @UUID[Compendium.underworld-races-and-classes.classes-urc.AyzGZsf9I1e45xf7]{Gemcaster}</p>"
