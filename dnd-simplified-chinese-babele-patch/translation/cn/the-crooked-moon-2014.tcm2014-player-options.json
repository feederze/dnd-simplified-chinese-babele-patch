The character miraculously survived and emerged somewhere in the mortal realms with a strange, broken compass in their possession. Time has since passed, but one night, the compass glows with ghastly energy, its needle pointing toward wherever the adventure begins.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Associated Background.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.yXDj2J5izzGu6Xtm]{Ghostlight Passenger}<span class=\"s1\">*</span></p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-uRUEr2b6XnERBRs7\"><h2><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Narrative Touchpoints</strong></span></h2><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Incitement.</strong> While in the Passenger Car of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> (area G1) after the attack of the Phantom Trainhopper, the wisps of the Shroud cause the compass to whirr to life.

Retrieving it causes the compass to pulse with soulfire and point toward Maidenmist Cemetery.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Confrontation.</strong> While in the Shadestone Sanctuary of Maidenmist Cemetery (area Y9), the compass points toward a statue of a hooded figure with a lantern, exactly like the one who attacked the character. The second piece of the artifact is held in its stone grasp. When the character takes the piece, their name suddenly etches itself in the base of the statue, and the compass spins wildly.</p><p><strong>Climax.</strong> If the characters are victorious over the Crooked Queen in the Wytchwood, the compass vibrates and points into the barrow. Within, entangled in roots, is the final piece of the character’s artifact. When all three pieces are assembled, a fog rolls in and the hooded figure emerges, revealing themselves as the relative who left them the artifact. They have become a Stranger (see chapter 1) and offer the character the same opportunity.</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character accepts the offer, they become a ferryman of dead souls, and the artifact becomes the primary instrument of calling their vehicle or warding against the Shroud. They leave into the mist with their family member to continue their duty. If they do not accept, the character can use their artifact to help lost souls outside of Wickermoor Hollow.</p></section>"

Behind them lies a field of butchered corpses. The doppelganger states that, as a being born of sin, they can consume sin itself to grow stronger, and Druskenvald is filled with it. They claim murder alone is insufficient; sin must also include vices and base pleasures. The reflection then returns to normal.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Connection.</strong> Near Wickermoor Schoolhouse (area V8), Finneas Trout approaches the character, noting their resemblance to a stranger who passed through weeks before a string of grisly murders, after which they headed northeast.

The process of reigniting the Balefire Beacons grants the character a sufficient understanding of soul magic to defy their copy and rejoin the souls.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Climax.</strong> After destroying the Horned King and burning the Crooked Tree, the duplicate emerges from the tree line, visible to all for the first time, with a maw of crooked sharp teeth.

While the character retains control, they are never the same. If the character rejects the use of soul magic, the doppelganger laughs and dissipates. In twenty years, a new Horned King will return to Druskenvald. Until then, the character can bring their virtue and positive traits to help the lands beyond Wickermoor Hollow.</p></section>"

Does the character wish to become a lord of the heavens, the hells, the Fey lands, or the deathly realms? Did they seek this type of ascension before encountering their fool or was it instigated by the spirit? Why does the character pursue such a transformational rebirth?</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Call to Adventure.</strong> The character is present during or even accidentally causes the beheading of a fool, whose bodiless spirit haunts them. They soon realize there is truth and prescience woven through the specter’s often incoherent ramblings, and a single strange rhyme of fools, monarchs, rebirth, and ascension points to a particular gloomy time and place where the adventure begins.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Associated Background.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.nhHq0RtlwSi7KbIP]{Reveler}<span class=\"s1\">*</span></p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-PVXQnnpdNraUwYvf\"><h2><span class=\"s2\"><strong>Narrative Touchpoints</strong></span></h2><p class=\"p4\">Incitement. In the Circus Car of the <em>Ghostlight Express</em> (area G7), a large poster showcasing the Festival of Fools draws the character’s attention. Their spectral fool looks at it wildly and babbles: “In paradise, the angels hang upside down and the fire shoots right side up, but the bells still ring in silver!”</p><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Connection.</strong> While in the Green Queen Inn (area V1), Innkeeper Alda Farnum can sense the haunting fool and is drawn to the character. She herself seeks to ascend to a great green Fey queen to ensure immense wealth and power for eternity. Throughout the adventure, she can point out sources of interplanar meddling, hoping to hear secrets she can use.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Discovery.</strong> While in the Watchful Belfry of the Crimson Monastery (area M14), the character’s spectral fool’s head dives into a hellfire brazier and gains a ghostly body before proclaiming: “In paradise, the fools are lords and the lords are fools, but all must die for a dream of kings and queens!”</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Confrontation.</strong> After the death of Chuckles during the Festival of Fools, the character’s fool claims the remnants of the wooden puppet and is reborn into a new otherworldly body. Its new form takes on the visage of the same type of entity that the character seeks to ascend to. It bows before them and exclaims: “In paradise, a herald needs some good shoulders under their head to usher in the monarch, but there can only be one, and goats are for supper!”</p><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Climax.</strong> Following the death of the Horned King and the burning of the Crooked Tree, the character’s fool appears and presents a crown-like jester’s cap made of ash and horn. The fool bellows: “In paradise, a fool for a day is a monarch for all time, but who shall wear the bells and leave their friends behind?” The character must choose to ascend to transcendent power or remain mortal and crown the fool instead.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character is crowned, they undergo a transformation into a powerful, otherworldly monarch exactly how they envisioned. As the character ascends to their desired “paradise,” they leave behind their former companions and the fool. If they reject the crown, the fool undergoes this ascension instead, and the character can bring the wisdom from their strange journey to lands beyond Wickermoor Hollow.</p></section>"

By reciting the full incantation from the tome, their curse is broken, and unlocked cosmic power allows them the chance to seek more knowledge beyond this reality. They have a moment to decide if they will leave this dimension behind.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character decides to travel beyond the stars, they blink away in a burst of stardust and spend millennia navigating strange new cosmic worlds, gaining knowledge unthinkable to mortal minds.
