Either way, the shadow transforms into a person. Now freed, they reveal that they were cursed to spy on the character after a deal with the same entity.</p></section>"

Suddenly, they shriek and are dragged off into the darkness.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Climax.</strong> After the Crooked Queen is vanquished, the character’s family member screams from the barrow below, trapped where Kehlenn’s bones once were.

Aided by an enigmatic, alchemical being in a flask, they seek the truth, and with each new discovery of strange alchemy, they come closer to perfecting a grand elixir and unlocking the secrets of immortality, eternal youth, and invulnerability.</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Goal.</strong> The character must master the alchemical arts of life essence, discover the recipe for a grand remedy of immense power, concoct a cure for their magical malady, and unlock the secrets of immortality.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Personalization.</strong> Determine the nature of the incurable disease. What are its symptoms and how was it caused? Does the character have the affliction themselves or does one of their loved ones? Does the researched remedy take the form of a potion, a stone, or something else entirely? What is the appearance and personality of the oddity in the flask?</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Call to Adventure.</strong> The effects of the magical disease that the character contends with continue to worsen, and all attempts at remedying it have failed. Their study of alchemical practices leads them to the ruins of an ancient city said to have once conquered death. There, they uncover a strange entity in a flask that claims to know the truth of immortality. The being is not openly forthcoming with many details but speaks of the time and place where the adventure begins.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Associated Background.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2014.tcm2014-player-options.Item.Y4TYLJllVMRrAYOX]{Crimson Aspirant}<span class=\"s2\">*</span></p><section id=\"secret-DsgpztoryRkt7OLk\" class=\"secret\"><h2><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Narrative Touchpoints</strong></span></h2><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Incitement.</strong> In the Cauldron Room of the Crooked House (area H17), the character is drawn to symbols etched by Vessla that the entity in the flask recognizes as soul magic. The thing guides the character to etch the glyphs on the entity's vessel to prepare it for the grand remedy's alchemical purpose, whispering that the next step is infusing it with blood magic.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Connection.</strong> While visiting the Smithy (area V16), the thing in the flask is drawn to Jean Myriel, who reveals that, during his time in Dawn’s Gate, he had witnessed acts of blood magic from the faithful of the Crimson Monastery. There, he learned techniques to infuse his metallurgy with blood before he fled, cautioning much worse uses are conducted within the monastery.</p><p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Discovery.</strong> In Jaeger’s Cabin at the Crimson Monastery (area M3), the character is drawn to a plethora of notes on blood magic rituals. The oddity in the flask finds hidden discoveries and secrets, guiding the character to infuse the vessel with the power of blood, anima, and vitality, stating the next step is the implementation of extremely rare alchemical reagents.</span></p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Confrontation.</strong> While at the Highborn Crypts in Maidenmist Cemetery (area Y4), the thing in the flask reveals that it was once a mortal alchemist millennia prior. It guides the character to a crypt that holds its former apprentice, who had prepared for the creation of the grand remedy by being buried alongside pure gold, celestial water, quicksilver, rare herbs, and other reagents to be infused into it. The final step requires a massive transmutation circle at a place of power.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Climax.</strong> Once the Crooked Queen is defeated, the oddity emerges from the flask and creates a transmutation circle where Kehlenn’s primal magic ring had been. The entity then bursts into a swarm of souls, stating that it has sacrificed thousands of lives for this purpose. It urges the character to use the circle to finish the remedy and achieve true immortality. Otherwise, it will only serve as a single-use cure for the disease the character sought to alleviate.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character sacrifices the thousands of souls, including the thing in the flask, the grand remedy is completed, which grants immortality, eternal youth, and invulnerability. If they reject such a weighty sacrifice, the souls destroy the entity before flying off to find peace. The character has a cure for the disease and knows they can use the alchemy they’ve learned to help people beyond Wickermoor Hollow.</p></section>"

How did they first favor the natural world over civilization? What relationship do they have with the trees and the green places? Do they serve the cycle individually or as part of a group? Which season do they favor and uphold as their ultimate charge?</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Call to Adventure.</strong> While walking through the woods during their favored season, the character stumbles upon an ancient hollow, and the trees of the deepest wood communicate with them. They learn of a landscape corrupted, rotten, and crooked in a realm devoid of the cycle of the seasons, pleading for the salvation of these wilds.

The Wytchwood communes with them, showing a vision of a burning forest, and from it, the source of a brilliant new age of rejuvenation for Druskenvald—perhaps one day returning the cycle of the seasons.

Through communion with the green world and following the wisdom of the trees, they seek to purge the land of rot and corruption to usher in a new age of flourishing.</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Goal.</strong> The character must find the areas of the natural world that are suffering, discover the extent of the corruption that afflicts the land, learn how to bring about the necessary healing, and fully purge the corruption to initiate a great regrowth.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Personalization.</strong> Determine the nature of the character’s guardianship of the wilds. How did they first favor the natural world over civilization? What relationship do they have with the trees and the green places? Do they serve the cycle individually or as part of a group? Which season do they favor and uphold as their ultimate charge?</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Call to Adventure.</strong> While walking through the woods during their favored season, the character stumbles upon an ancient hollow, and the trees of the deepest wood communicate with them. They learn of a landscape corrupted, rotten, and crooked in a realm devoid of the cycle of the seasons, pleading for the salvation of these wilds. After the character accepts the mantle of warden, they hear the wisdom of the trees and are guided to where the adventure begins.</p><p class=\"p2\"><strong>Associated Background.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.the-crooked-moon-2024.tcm2024-player-options.Item.4qbJWw5LaS2jeTmO]{Wicker Weaver}<span class=\"s2\">*</span></p><section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-MiQofK83wy7b4tXY\"><h2><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Narrative Touchpoints</strong></span></h2><p class=\"p4\"><strong>Incitement.</strong> In the Conservatory of the Crooked House (area H8), the bergamot tree communes with the character, giving a vision of its own rotten core before showing the corrupted landscapes and the perversion of nature throughout Wickermoor Hollow. It ends with a vision of a diseased hilltop crawling with thousands of centipedes.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Connection.</strong> Sister Rain approaches the character, sensing they share the same gift of “Tree Seeing,” which allows the land to communicate with people through the trees. She feels nature’s pain but rejects supernatural means to cleanse corruption, refusing to “fight fire with fire.” Throughout the adventure, she can sense where corrupted landscapes are in the valley.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Discovery.</strong> After the death of Stonoga Blackstinger in Skitterdeep Mine, notes found in Stonoga’s Laboratory (area S7) tell that her corruptive magic was created after studying a virulent disease known as Hartsblight. When the character leaves the mine, a nearby tree now cleansed of Skitter Plague sends a vision of a fungus-choked forest, and within it lies the rotting corpse of a deer.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Confrontation.</strong> When exiting the Den of the Blighted One (area F11) after the destruction of Gorthos, the character is communed with by countless trees that have been cleansed of Hartsblight. A vision of the beautiful Green Queen twists into a crooked tree that serves as the heart of corruption throughout Wickermoor Hollow and must be purged.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Climax.</strong> After the burning of the Crooked Tree, the character’s full connection to the green magic of Druskenvald is achieved. The Wytchwood communes with them, showing a vision of a burning forest, and from it, the source of a brilliant new age of rejuvenation for Druskenvald—perhaps one day returning the cycle of the seasons. They must simply spread the embers to ignite a single tree.</p><p class=\"p5\"><strong>Catharsis.</strong> If the character spreads the embers of the Crooked Tree, the wildfire spreads throughout the Wytchwood, quickly burning the forest to ash. From it, new life will grow how the character decides and spreads throughout the valley, showing signs of the character’s favored season.

These people are infused with the necrotic and draconic essence of the powerful Drakkonite metal found throughout the province, which has given them a strange taste for spoiled flesh of any variety.</p><p class=\"p2\">Appearing as the corpses of twisted Humanoids, graveborn have powerful snouts and jaws with elongated teeth and tongues that assist in the devouring of flesh and bone. Their physiology is sturdy, as if magically designed to be perfected for war. If not killed in war, as befalls many of their kind, they can live up to 300 years before decaying away.</p><p class=\"p2\">As a graveborn, you have these special traits.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> You are an Undead.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> You are Medium (about 4–6 feet tall).</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.</p><p class=\"p2\"><em><strong>Devour Corpse.</strong></em> You can eat spoiled and rotten food as if it were fresh.
