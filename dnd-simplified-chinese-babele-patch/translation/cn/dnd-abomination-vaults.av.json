      "description": "<p>Enter the megadungeon! Evil stirs in the depths of the Abomination Vaults, a sprawling dungeon where the evil sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex attempted to raise an army of monsters hundreds of years ago. Brave heroes must venture into a dungeon full of beasts and traps to prevent a spiteful villain from rising again. The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path is a three-part, monthly series of connected adventures that comprise a complete Pathfinder campaign.</p><p><strong>Content Warning:</strong> While Abomination Vaults contains typical Pathfinder action and adventure, it also presents themes of suicide, ableism, body horror, and human experimentation. Before you begin, understand that player consent (including that of the Game Master) is vital to a safe and fun play experience for everyone. You should talk with your players before beginning the adventure and modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate.</p>",

Eventually, the flickerwisps grow too hungry and are compelled to flit closer, confuse their prey, and glut on the raw emotions.

Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs’ wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares.

They grip said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving them four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with gore.</p><p>Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs’ wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p><p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn’t apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p><p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size.

He’s as kind and generous as he can afford to be toward an opposing party, making them feel like they’re holding all the cards. In a world of snarling fiends and vicious hell-spawn, Urevian seeks to stand out by simply using manners. Devils have a bad reputation for taking advantage of their marks; playing against that is one of Urevian’s strengths, and he uses it to great advantage.</p><p>Urevian wants the soul of Carman Rajani. With Belcorra’s return, he can finally escape his agreement with her, but he needs a Rajani soul to do so. Only one such soul remains: the blacksmith and scoundrel who is Vol’s sole remaining descendant. Ideally, Urevian convinces the party to fetch it for him. The contract devil is true to his word, and he departs quickly once he has his prize. The characters might refuse—and, perhaps, should refuse—despite Urevian’s honeyed words. If they fight and defeat him, he isn’t destroyed. Instead, his soul is cast into the court of the powerful entity to whom he pledged the Rajani soul, where he must hastily explain his failure to avoid obliteration.</p><p>Urevian spends his time in the room he’s claimed as his personal domain (area <strong>G10</strong>).</p>",

You lose Attunement to the lens, and the target becomes attuned to the lens instead, except the target can’t use the lens’s Grim Resistance or Infuse Nhimbaloth’s Tenacity properties.

Since this is a form of possession, the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbEvilAndGoodPr]{Protection from Evil and Good} spell protects the target and causes Nhimbaloth’s essence to remain in the lens.

As a young shuln matures, its unique metabolism produces adamantine that becomes infused throughout its skeletal system. In addition to making their claws and fangs nearly unbreakable, this unique physiological trait makes shulns unparalleled burrowers and highly sought by monster hunters who hope to harvest the precious material from their corpses. Shulns have a ravenous appetite and eat nearly anything they can catch, but their preferred diet consists almost entirely of large invertebrates, especially cave worms.</p>",

Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of runes arranged in a particular pattern.</p><p>When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You might learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.</p><p>You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for 365 days.</p>",

Caliddo kept his silent vigil here for centuries.</p><p>When Belcorra returned, she put Caliddo to work fetching several books she needed, and which she wanted out of the hands of others who might use them against her. For the first time in centuries, Caliddo left the vault. He ascended to the display room more recently taken over by the Cult of the Canker (area @UUID[JournalEntry.KeWKr2yd8dbppeS5.JournalEntryPage.wAoRY1yKOiu1ocVU]{C34}) and recovered the texts Belcorra mentioned. He didn’t gather all of the important texts from the Library level, however; the characters might have recovered Belcorra’s journals and <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> from the hidden study next to the display room. Upon Caliddo’s return here, he locked the books he acquired in area @UUID[JournalEntry.1vlzl3NJsftNB9Dc.JournalEntryPage.ydFyUm2uTgteYviW]{I58} and returned to his vigil.</p><p>Caliddo remains at his post and is quick to assault anyone who enters. The characters likely face him as they confront the shield guardian in area @UUID[JournalEntry.1vlzl3NJsftNB9Dc.JournalEntryPage.vV1UI5ww3NEtLe0o]{I53}, but he’s otherwise encountered here. Caliddo fights until destroyed, but he doesn’t leave his post in the vault unless Belcorra expressly orders him to.</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong>: Caliddo’s armor is <em>Plate Armor of Cold Resistance</em>, but it also carries his Graveknight’s Curse. As normal for a cursed item, the characters can’t discover the curse via an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplIdentify00]{Identify}</em> spell or other methods of identifying magic items. Only an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplLegendLore]{Legend Lore}</em> spell or a successful [[/check skill=religion dc=20]] check to remember the connection graveknights have to their armor reveals its cursed nature.</p><h3>Caliddo’s Return</h3><p>Destroying Caliddo for good is difficult because his armor rebuilds him over time. If he rejuvenates after the characters have plundered the vault and left, he pursues them in an attempt to recover and return the items to this vault. He doesn’t have any special connection to the treasures, though, so he might have to search around to find them. He might find the characters while they’re resting somewhere in the Abomination Vaults, or even when they’re in a fight with other denizens of the dungeon.</p><p>Caliddo is most interested in reclaiming his keys and returning the books to the vault (as those were the last things Belcorra expressed particular interest in and, he assumes, are the most valuable to her). Characters who turn over the keys and books to Caliddo might avert the graveknight’s implacable retribution.</p></article></section>"

The dust in this room has been recently disturbed.</p><p>This is Belcorra’s most protected vault, holding her treasures and secrets of her past. The books that have been most recently shelved here—as evidenced by the trails in the dust—are research journals Belcorra penned when she was alive. They are centuries old, but careful magical preservation has kept them from falling apart. These journals describe four <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.azMqL6C2NvazTcRE]{Fulcrum Lenses}</em> (in crimson, ebon, emerald, and ochre) that focus Nhimbaloth’s soul-extinguishing gaze across space and time.</p><p>Belcorra’s personal journals detail how she built <em>Gauntlight</em> and created a special framework called the <em>Fulcrum Lattice</em> to fit the four lenses and harness their power. A diagram of the <em>Fulcrum Lattice</em> makes it clear that the device is the very one sitting here. Belcorra expresses some trepidation at using the <em>Fulcrum Lenses</em>; they each contain a sliver of Nhimbaloth’s essence, and bringing them in close proximity can be dangerous. More specifically, the lenses impart Nhimbaloth’s essence into those who use or are touched by them. Having all four essences imbued at once is sure to bring Nhimbaloth’s dreadful scrutiny. Belcorra had her talented apprentice, Volluk Azrinae, fashion mundane lenses that would allow Gauntlight to function at a diminished capacity until the <em>Fulcrum Lattice</em> and the <em>Fulcrum Lenses</em> could be installed, on the eve of Belcorra’s assault on Absalom. The <em>Fulcrum Lattice</em> allows all four of the large, heavy lenses to be carried with ease.</p><p>Belcorra’s journals explain that she used only the <em>Ebon Fulcrum Lens</em> in the Empty Vault at <em>Gauntlight</em>’s base, deeming the essence within one fulcrum lens a minimal risk. She gave the other lenses to trusted groups in the lower Abomination Vaults: the emerald lens to the urdefhans, the ochre lens to the drow, and the crimson lens hidden where her undead gnome minions could protect it. She trusts that the groups won’t work together, much less learn that bringing the lenses together to imbue a single creature with all four splinters of Nhimbaloth’s essence would impart complete annihilation.</p><figure class=\"right\"><img src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/items/fulcrum-lattice.webp\" width=\"90\" /><figcaption>@UUID[JournalEntry.jy8D1VcANmdjWuci.JournalEntryPage.7YxJpSUob5bGyOcE]{Fulcrum Lattice}</figcaption></figure><p><strong>XP Award</strong>: Award the characters [[/award 1800xp]] for uncovering the lore of the Fulcrum Lenses and learning how to destroy Belcorra.</p><h3>Other Books</h3><p>The rest of the books are all aging tomes full of occult knowledge; they’ve been in the Haruvex family for generations.

At first, she fought against the fierce denizens and tried to close off the passages to deeper places, but the task was futile. She dubbed the place the Hunting Grounds and left it mostly alone, save for building alliances with the communities there. Belcorra established only a few strongholds in the area, including a lodge, a vault, and the entrance to the Gate of Nhimbaloth, the subterranean temple holding the Empty Vault.</p><aside class=\" left av-float-block\"><h3>Environmental Cues:</h3><p>Creeping mold, echoing roars, patches of slick slime, rough stone walls, strange tracks</p></aside><h2>Features</h2><p>The interconnecting caverns in the Hunting Grounds are mostly dark, but patches of glowing fungus illuminate enough areas to give anyone a sense of the caverns’ great size.

As brutal killers obsessed with ending life and existence itself, the urdefhans who regularly emerged from their caves to raid the caverns and lake of the Hunting Grounds were precisely the kind of soldiers Belcorra needed for her campaign. She made a calculated, overwhelming attack to awe the urdefhans, and when the sorcerer called for a parley, the urdefhan war champion listened. Belcorra swore the urdefhans would be the vanguard of her eventual assault on the surface and gave the <em>Emerald Fulcrum Lens</em> to the war champion as a token of her favor until then. Generations passed, and the war champions passed down the Fulcrum Lens as their symbol of leadership.</p><h2>Drow Allegiance</h2><p>With the deep gnomes cowed and the urdefhans awed by her power, Belcorra next turned to the drow of Hunting Grounds. From their secure stronghold of Yldaris, the drow ranged through the caverns like deadly apparitions, retreating in the face of significant danger. Belcorra knew that she must trap the drow into an alliance, so she captured more and more of their hunters until Yldaris’s leader agreed to meet with her. She traded the captives for a promise that the drow would keep the <em>Ochre Fulcrum Lens</em> safe and provide aid in her attack on the surface. The granddaughter of that leader is in command of Yldaris today.</p><h2>Belcorra’s Return</h2><p>When Belcorra arose as a ghost, she first visited the Hunting Grounds. She checked on her treasure vault to ensure its most important contents remained secure, then sent the vault’s graveknight guardian to retrieve the valuable books she’d left on an upper level when she died. She next visited the urdefhans, who still told vague legends of the quasi-mythical sorcerer. Their new war champion, Khurfel, carried the <em>Emerald Fulcrum Lens</em> and agreed to follow their Ghost Queen to raze the surface world. The urdefhans have since stepped up their summoning of daemon allies, preparing for the assault on the surface.</p><p>Belcorra’s visit to the drow of Yldaris went less well.

              "text": "<p>If the characters have dealt peacefully with the drow and earned an audience with Quara, wary drow escort them here and ask them to wait for Quara to arrive. Various residents bring in chairs from the common area (area @UUID[.sOpC75joa7ldQh6s]{I15}) and food and fungus wine from the kitchen (area @UUID[.o1v9itp6Cep45ZOE]{I16}). The drow escorts are curious and talkative, as they have little experience with surface-dwellers, but they diplomatically avoid conversation that would color their questions as an interrogation—that’s Quara’s prerogative. If the heroes are reticent or rude, the drow simply watch over them in silence.</p><p>Before long, Quara arrives to great the characters, radiating calm command and curiosity. She’s joined by the stern-looking Salaisa Malthulas, commander of the outpost’s wardens, and the strange twin cavern seers, Bhazrade and Klathor. Quara does the talking.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative-block\">“You have the look of surface dwellers. I’ve never met any of your kind, but I’ve seen artwork. Strange, you are not nearly as ugly as our art makes you out to be. I am Quara Orshendiel, leader of this outpost. Let’s figure out whether or not we can help each another.”</p><p>If the characters rescued Falxi, Quara adds her thanks for rescuing her cousin from “one of the scrapes he keeps getting himself into.”</p><p>Quara is sincere in her words and her goals. The seers had already foretold that surface dwellers would come as potential allies, and Quara wants to believe it.</p><p>Quara invites the characters to tell their story. She sympathizes with hardships, laughs at humorous parts, and asks questions when she doesn’t understand something. If the characters mention the Fulcrum Lenses, or show her one of them, she takes an obvious interest. Quara overlooks petty slights or rudeness, but she chastises any overt aggression calmly—once. Her patience is not infinite, and insistently rude characters are asked to leave Yldaris and not return.</p><p>At the end of the conversation, Quara says, “You’ve given me some things to think about. Thank you.” She then invites the characters to stay in the overflow lodging (area I13) until she makes up her mind about them. Quara spends a few hours thinking, then gambles on an alliance.</p><p>She calls the characters back into this room, either a few hours later or the next time they return to Yldaris. Bhazrade and Klathor are, as before, lurking at the edges of the room. Quara explains the following.</p><p class=\" box-text narrative-block\">“I believe you’ve been truthful with me, so I’m going to be truthful with you. Yldaris only exists at Belcorra’s pleasure. It was here when she first created her vast dungeons; at the time, my grandfather was its leader. Belcorra made allies of several groups, including ourselves, the urdefhans to the west, and a group of deep gnomes above, who have embraced undeath. To each, she gave a magical lens of strange powers. For safekeeping, I believe. Ours was the Ochre Fulcrum Lens, and it could manipulate emotions.<br />“But there was more to the lens. My grandfather told my father, Larathols, who became Yldaris’s leader after him. But my father never told me.” Quara sighs. “I was never meant to lead. My older sister was to succeed our father. They both embarked on a secret expedition a few years ago. On an island in the great lake, the urdefhan warlord Khurfel caught and killed them. Their expedition had something to do with the lens, I believe, and I suspect my father had it with him. Perhaps he hid it someplace; perhaps Khurfel took it. I don’t know.<br />“Belcorra came to me as a ghost shortly afterward. She insisted I swear Yldaris’s support and aid in a surface invasion that drives her even in death. For the good of Yldaris, I renewed the vows my grandfather made. But I’ve never felt bound my mere words. I won’t help her. I’ll help you. You are welcome in Yldaris as long as you’d like.”</p><p>The characters can ask Quara more questions if they’d like, but she knows little more than she’s already told them. Before the conversation winds down, however, Bhazrade and Klathor speak.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative-block\">“There is more…” One of the twins starts. They move their mouths in unison, making it hard to tell which is speaking.<br />“…you should know.” The other drow continues.<br />This plainly piques Quara’s interest, and she motions for the brothers to go on.<br />“The ochre lens lies in a dark and wet place. Khurfel did not claim it. Larathols dropped it in the water to deny it to his enemy. He died attempting to learn more of its purpose, more than the partial truth we know.<br />“We have seen in a vision that the stones both empower the Ghost Queen and hold the key to her demise. They are slivers of something ancient, alien, evil, and hungry.”<br />In unison, they cry, “We saw eyes of Empty Death!”<br />They continue. “She separated the lenses because, together, they draw the baleful attention of the Empty Death. Even the Ghost Queen cannot withstand the Empty Death. The secrets to the lenses are in the old treasure vault, which overlooks the lake.<br />“Find the lenses and the answers Larathols sought.”</p><p>The twins fall silent again, and Quara looks back to the characters. She explains, “I would say you get used to Bhazrade and Klathor, but one never does. Let me assure you that when they do speak, it’s important. This is all news to me, but when the cavern seers speak, it’s to the benefit of Yldaris. Perhaps to yours as well.”</p><p><strong>XP Award</strong>: Award the characters [[/award 9000xp]] for allying with Quara and the Yldaris drow rather than fighting them.</p><section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Consulting <em>The Whispering Reeds</em></h3><p>The characters might have recovered a book of Nhimbaloth’s lore called <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> from higher in the Abomination Vaults. A character who consults this tome finds references to the <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.jy8D1VcANmdjWuci.JournalEntryPage.7YxJpSUob5bGyOcE]{Fulcrum Lenses}</em> automatically and without suffering from the book’s curse. <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> speaks of slivers of Nhimbaloth’s essence existing in the <em>Fulcrum Lenses</em>, perhaps as a means to contact the Outer God. The <em>Fulcrum Lenses</em> have different and powerful (but, in the text, unspecified) abilities. Yet the <em>Fulcrum Lenses</em> are dangerous in close proximity, and even Nhimbaloth’s worshippers fear to have more than two or three together at one time. Using their powers draws Nhimbaloth’s scrutiny and, ultimately, invites utter annihilation.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Side Quest</h3><p>Finding the <em>Fulcrum Lenses </em>and using them against Belcorra is the primary task of this adventure. But Quara has a side task that’s personally important to her: she’d like Khurfel killed and his rhoka sword brought to her as a trophy. As pragmatic as Quara is, vengeance is a common drow vice. She emphasizes to the characters that Khurfel would never part with his lens while he draws breath, so defeating him is necessary in any case.</p><p><strong>XP Award</strong>: Award the characters [[/award 1800xp]] if they bring Khurfel’s sword to Quara.</p></article></section>"

These whispers can be maddening or enlightening, but are usually wholly unintelligible.</p><p>The northwestern end of this cavern is a rock wall 10 feet high that leads to a natural bridge 30 feet above the lake. Urthagul used to leave the cavern this way to hunt in the lake every week or two, but hadn’t bothered to do that while the Cult of Urthagul were bringing him offerings.</p><h3>Distracting Whispers</h3><p>All creatures are immune to the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbAppendixCRule.JournalEntryPage.vLAsIUa0FhZNsyLk]{Charmed} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbAppendixCRule.JournalEntryPage.93uaingTESo8N1qL]{Frightened} conditions while in the cavern, but spending time amid the whispers affects the minds of non-Aberrations. Every minute a creature other than an Aberration spends in the cavern, it must make a [[/save ability=wisdom dc=16]]. On a failed save, the creature’s Wisdom score is reduced by 1d4, to a minimum of 3. The reduction lasts until the creature finishes a Long Rest. The room echoes with a different truth each time a creature’s Wisdom score is reduced by the whispers, as follows:</p><p>• <strong>First Reduction</strong>: “The lenses. She knows the secrets of the lenses. Three are within reach, one very close. Another was lost by Yldaris. The third is held by the blood eaters.”</p><p>• <strong>Second Reduction</strong>: “She keeps them apart while she works her petty vengeance, but the essences shall become one.”</p><p>• <strong>Third Reduction</strong>: “Find the lenses and place their essences together within a host.”</p><p>• <strong>Fourth Reduction</strong>: “Join the essences within Haruvex, and she can fall again. This is a promise of the Empty Death, a promise of empty death.”</p><p>The cavern affects Aberrations differently. Instead of suffering a reduction to its Wisdom score, an Aberration that fails its saving throw against the whispers makes Wisdom (Perception) checks with Disadvantage until it finishes a Long Rest. If such creatures stay too long in the cave, they begin involuntarily babbling strange truths that echo in the whispers, which is how Urthagul obtained his reputation as a mystic among the calignis.</p><section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/encounter/skull-glow.webp\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Encounter</h2><p>@UUID[Actor.0jvmec4yJH1ASfRy]{Urthagal}</p></header><article><figure class=\"right\"><img src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/items/crimson-fulcrum-lens.webp\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption>@UUID[JournalEntry.jy8D1VcANmdjWuci.JournalEntryPage.zsRCDb88wiih1BMd]{Crimson Fulcrum Lens}</figcaption></figure><p>On the northernmost island, amid a nest of glowing toadstools, lurks Urthagul the Gug.

The primary denizens, other than feral monsters, are listless undead gnomes and addled caligni cultists, both of whom can provide some clues about Belcorra’s return. The characters will likely face Belcorra in person for the first time—but certainly not the last!</p><h3>The Fulcrum Lenses</h3><p>The final three levels are where the story of the Abomination Vaults comes to its head. It’s critical that the heroes discover the three fulcrum lenses in the lower levels and learn how they work—specifically, how they can permanently destroy Belcorra. Yet Belcorra has more freedom to harry the heroes throughout these lower levels, and by the time the heroes face her in the Empty Vault, they’ve earned her ire. With luck, the heroes can defeat Belcorra and topple Gauntlight.</p></article></section><p><em>@UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.efRUYLBH9Kf3CLkX]{Gauntlight}</em> is active, but its true power is yet to be realized.

Within the Empty Vault, Belcorra empowered four Fulcrum Lenses that, when installed in the lighthouse high above, focus Nhimbaloth’s attention and unleash the artifact’s full power. However, the Fulcrum Lenses are dangerous; they invite Nhimbaloth’s uncaring gaze, and even Belcorra can’t withstand the close scrutiny of the Outer God. Thus, while they hold great power, the Fulcrum Lenses are also Belcorra’s greatest weakness.</p><h3>Yldaris Drow</h3><p>The drow outpost of Yldaris lies on the next level of the Abomination Vaults, but their silent, skilled hunters have established a watch post in an abandoned Children of Belcorra outpost. The characters might ally with the drow here, which makes a peaceful meeting with Yldaris more likely in @UUID[JournalEntry.1vlzl3NJsftNB9Dc.JournalEntryPage.LYgvrg4SI95a4KqP]{Chapter 9}.</p><h1>The Farm</h1><p>Belcorra repurposed the massive natural caverns above the Empty Vault for her needs. The eighth level made a lush cavern of fungus growths and freshwater lakes that teemed with subterranean fish, while the ninth level was a wilderness where predators and prey alike could thrive. The characters must descend through these levels to reach the Empty Vault.</p><h2>Features</h2><aside class=\"av-float-block\"><h3>Environmental Cues:</h3><p>Glowing moss, creeping tendrils of mold, decaying wood, distant splashing, foul mists, muddy footprints, smells of earthy rot, towering fungi.</p></aside><p>The vast caverns of this level and the many structures and rooms within it are normally dark, although bioluminescent fungus is common in overgrown areas. The caverns reach 50 feet high, but the ceilings in rooms carved out of the stone are much lower. Ceilings in the areas claimed by the Cult of Urthagul (areas H2 to H10) are only 10 feet high. Ceilings in other interior areas are sized for the gnomish Children of Belcorra and are only eight feet high. Sturdy planks of fungal wood form the doors.

However, as the years passed, more and more feral monsters made their way into the level and made their mission in the farm increasingly difficult. Believing that Belcorra (or, perhaps, some other Haruvex) would return, the Children chose to become undead to combat their dwindling numbers and increasing age. They immured each other in the muddy shore to rise again as bog mummies or undertook difficult transformations into other, more powerful, undead.</p><p>Eventually, their timeless lives and lack of direction took their toll. Many Children fell into a torpor or retreated into obsession or isolation.

Belcorra gave the Children a new mandate: to round up the various dangerous creatures of the farm level to serve her in her assault on the surface. She placed the Children under the command of a new supervisor, a spirit naga named Vethris, but chose poorly; the naga is corrupt, lazy, and more interested in her creature comforts than guiding the deep gnome undead in their tasks.

From there, the calignis explored upward, reaching an abandoned shrine of Nhimbaloth and eventually discovering a gug mystic named Urthagul. Urthagul laired in a cave resonating with strange psychic whispers that awed the calignis. Some of the calignis, led by Dulac, revered the gug and its eerie visions; others remained skeptical of Urthagul’s powers.

Dulac and her second-in-command, Padli, have both gained occult powers from meditating on the whispers in Urthagul’s cave, which they use to keep the cult in line.</p><p>When Belcorra awakened, she visited the shrine to Nhimbaloth and was surprised to find the calignis there. She visited with Urthagul and found that the gug’s strange behavior was not only due to the psychic emanations of the cave, but also because the gug had found the Crimson Fulcrum Lens and communed with the splinter of Nhimbaloth’s essence inside it. Belcorra realized the lens was probably safe in the gug’s claws, but she didn’t want it to end up in the hands of some interloper cult she didn’t have the time or desire to deal with. She tasked her wisp minions to keep the calignis contained within their shrine.</p><p>It frustrates the cult members to be apart from the object of their veneration. Dulac is desperate for a solution, so the characters might find the calignis eager to talk.</p><section class=\"npc\"><article><figure><img class=\"flipx\" src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/bestiary-portraits/ch-08/dulac.webp\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption>@UUID[Actor.h0Ztbh36be4rpJCz]{Dulac}</figcaption></figure></article><article><figure><img class=\"flipx\" src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/bestiary-portraits/ch-08/urthagal.webp\" height=\"420\" /><figcaption>@UUID[Actor.0jvmec4yJH1ASfRy]{Urthagul}</figcaption></figure></article><article><figure><img class=\"flipx\" src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/bestiary-portraits/ch-08/padli.webp\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption>@UUID[Actor.qw2pk1zjvgxbeGBO]{Padli}</figcaption></figure></article></section>"

By the time anyone discovered the theft, Carman was already making his way to a local cave called @UUID[JournalEntry.JT0zCcIwsSpKnbB5.JournalEntryPage.DzqE7ZmPnygrbe34]{Smuggler’s Refuge}. It didn’t take long for the town guard to realize the missing Carman Rajani was the prime suspect. Not only had he been pestering the mayor about the sword for years, but a few witnesses saw someone matching his description fleeing from the library, clutching his cloak over some long object.</p><h3>Vandy's Request</h3><p>Vandy Banderdash, head priestess of the Dawnflower Library, meets with the characters when they come to ask about the sword. She can barely contain her rage, although she seems angrier about the theft than the fire. She asks them to find Carman and bring him in alive to face trial and appropriate punishment.</p><h2>Finding Carman</h2><p>Finding Carman shouldn’t be too hard, as he acted hastily and didn’t have time to cover his tracks or prepare a good cover story.</p><h3>Otari Guard</h3><p>The @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.St1SBR4xOInfNoPj]{Otari Garrison} can’t provide much help; Captain Longsaddle points out that since Carman isn’t in town or along the roads, the guards don’t have jurisdiction to pursue him. He harrumphs and adds, “Good riddance to that troublemaker. He’ll keep running if he knows what’s good for him.” He doesn’t provide any aid to capture Carman but happily takes him into custody if the characters bring the smith into town.</p><h3>Blades for Glades</h3><p>The party finds Carman’s blacksmith shop, @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.5yYs7JNliPnSYLhp]{Blades for Glades}, closed; they won’t find any clues here. If the characters already had the support of Blades for Glades, they recall that Carman had mentioned Smuggler’s Refuge in the past, so it’s a likely hideout.</p><h3>Combing the Town</h3><p>If the party asks about Carman’s location in Otari, nearly everyone suggests they go ask around at the @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.sdNti6BHkPTeO5fC]{Crook’s Nook}. On a successful [[/check skill=persuasion dc=15]] check to research the missing blacksmith by canvassing the town, a character finds that several townspeople mention Smuggler’s Refuge and recall that Carman used to head up there in his youth (as did many people in Otari).</p><h3>Crook's Nook</h3><p>Asking around at the Crook’s Nook brings the owner, Yinyasmera, over to talk. She brazenly asks for a 10 GP “special fee” for food and drinks; characters who pay up or succeed on a [[/check skill=persuasion dc=15]] check get her to open up about Carman. Any character who speaks Thieves’ Cant automatically knows she means to sell them the information. The blacksmith has been a little too bold to remain in her good graces, and this theft is the last straw. She mentions that Carman is likely hiding out at Smuggler’s Refuge outside of town. If Yinyasmera has a favorable opinion of the characters from their previous actions, she gives them this information for free.</p>"

Carman goes with them for this excursion since he doesn’t want to let the sword out of his sight, but he doesn’t fight in the Abomination Vaults if the characters get into trouble. After the barrier goes down, Carman retreats to the cave to think about what to do and likely stays there for a few days.</p><h3>Turn Him In</h3><p>If the party turns him in to the Otari Garrison, Captain Longsaddle tosses him in a cell and jokes about throwing away the key. Longsaddle lets the mayor know that the characters have the Cooperative Blade, but the mayor is fine with the characters borrowing it for as long as they’d like, just so long as it ends up back with the town. Longsaddle takes Carman’s money as a pool to repay any costs from his crimes but lets the characters keep Carman’s other equipment.</p><h3>Kill Him</h3><p>If the characters kill Carman in combat, people in town understand that’s a risk when apprehending a criminal.

              "text": "<p>While the upper levels of Belcorra’s massive dungeon were primarily for her personal use, she designed the middle levels for work. Belcorra trawled the Darklands for dangerous predators and bloodthirsty aberrations, but their feral power wasn’t enough for her. She needed to mold them into an army to assault the metropolis of Absalom. In the middle levels, she had these forces forged for battle, in body and in mind. The fifth level thus included a massive arena and training grounds where gladiators would fight for the right to lead her monstrous troops.</p><p>In the Darklands, Belcorra encountered wormlike aberrations called seugathis, who had a curious eagerness to serve her. She then repurposed the sixth level—formerly support rooms for her monsters and their trainers as well as a “preserve” where she kept large beasts—as laboratories. There, the seugathis sought to perfect fleshwarping to create flawless monsters under the guidance of their leader, @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.qrb0F1AQ3iIR7Xni]{Jafaki}.</p><p>Belcorra constructed the smaller seventh level as a prison. She didn’t intend to keep many captives since creatures who displeased her could serve as raw flesh for Jafaki’s experiments or as food for her monsters. However, one of Belcorra’s chief administrators, the contract devil @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.t9SSGAP5pW2NpkWh]{Urevian}, insisted on building the prison. Before long, the level became a warped mirror of Hell.</p><h3>Belcorra's Death</h3><p>A decade into building her dungeon and honing her preparations, Belcorra died at the hands of the Roseguard, who had no idea about these subterranean machinations. The Abomination Vaults fell into disarray almost immediately. Urevian attempted to assert control, but Jafaki’s aberrant creations fought the devil’s forces to a standstill. A sort of stalemate settled over the middle levels, and the borders of control have shifted only slightly back and forth over the centuries. Jafaki merely wanted peace to continue their experiments; Urevian idly prepared for the surface invasion as his contract required him, even though he knew it was almost impossible to complete his contract because Belcorra had died.</p><p>Word of the seugathis’ skilled fleshwarping spread. Before long, arrogant or desperate creatures came to the Abomination Vaults seeking remarkable transformations, though few ultimately considered their changes to be improvements. Fleshwarped creatures continue to commonly appear throughout the middle levels.</p><h3>Belcorra's Return</h3><p>When Belcorra returned as a ghost only a few years ago, the Abomination Vaults hummed with the power of her return. The significance of this event was lost on the research-focused Jafaki, but not on Urevian; the devil realized he could now finally fulfill his contract with the sorcerer. Yet Urevian had already spent centuries contemplating a well-drafted loophole that would allow him to simply return to Hell without providing her any aid at all. To do so, Urevian needs a specific mortal soul: that of Vol Rajani, one of the Roseguard. Vol is long dead, of course, but the clause can still apply if Urevian receives the soul of Vol’s last descendant, @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.hv8jCTjoKEFVFV4Q]{Carman Rajani}. Urevian couldn’t collect the soul while Belcorra was merely dead, but now that she has returned, Urevian is willing to abandon his extensive preparations if someone can get Carman’s soul for him—and he selects the dungeon delvers from Otari to handle this matter on his behalf.</p>"

The most significant of these occurrences centers around @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.7WZr8QhFOSrHPTgU]{Mayor Menhemes}’s eldest daughter, the teenaged Dorianna Menhemes. Dorianna is on the cusp of developing psychic powers. While no one on the surface is aware of this, a denizen of Leng named @UUID[Actor.8AVy2qIK6vh13sSj]{Ysondkhelir} (area @UUID[JournalEntry.OyNcqrpRClyhr8BJ.JournalEntryPage.RiUE936phCZx8Hqe]{G18}) has become aware of her power. With the barrier to the lower levels down, he can twist her dreams into nightmares and take on the role of her savior. He intensifies this long plan over weeks of nighttime adventures with her in the Dimension of Dreams. Ysondkhelir intends to eventually thrust Dorianna physically into the Dimension of Dreams to augment other denizens’ sinister plots.</p><h2>The First Dreams</h2><p>Two nights after the party opens the seal to the Abomination Vaults’ lower levels, Dorianna Menhemes begins having horrifying nightmares. She awakens several times each night, screaming and clutching a stuffed griffon she hasn’t touched in years. She doesn’t recall the specifics of these nightmares beyond the fear and the appearance of a man shrouded in mismatched fabric who comforts her.</p><p>If the characters have earned the support of @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.WirKAYn5ZGirmgjb]{Menhemes Manor}, they’ve met Dorianna and hear about her nightmares from the other children. Otherwise, the mayor seeks out whichever character is best known as a healer or as an authority on occultism. He mentions his daughter’s nightmares and the “motley man” who acts as a protector and savior within them. He asks them to discreetly look into the matter and help his daughter.</p><h3>Asking Wrin</h3><p>Mayor Menhemes views @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.raJDQ95RBqeXxV14]{Wrin Sivinxi} of Wrin’s Wonders as an unreliable eccentric, so he doesn’t think to involve her in his family’s troubles. She is, however, an expert at the occult, and she gladly accompanies the characters to help Dorianna if they ask, so long as she doesn’t need to meet with the beleaguered girl indoors. If the party lacks someone proficient in Arcana to get to the bottom of these mysteries, Wrin’s involvement is a possible solution.</p><h2>Examining Dorianna</h2><p>Even the first time the characters examine Dorianna, she already appears gaunt and pale as if she’d caught a severe malady. A character who makes a successful [[/skill med 10]] check verifies that she’s nevertheless in good physical health. The characters initially find no evidence of any magic or curse upon her. A search of Dorianna’s room reveals that several of her childhood toys have been brought back out for her to play with. Dorianna states vaguely that she just missed them and wanted to play with them again. Dorianna’s nightmares are tenacious; any magic the characters might employ to help Dorianna get a good night’s sleep fail unless the caster succeeds at a DC 22 spellcasting ability check.</p><p><strong>XP Award</strong>: Award the characters [[/award 500xp]] for taking the care and time to help Dorianna, even if they can’t figure out what’s wrong just yet.</p><h2>Dorianna’s Decline</h2><p>Dorianna’s condition worsens over time. Her nightmares lessen in intensity, but she feels exhausted and anxious during the day. She begins to talk with the Motley Man as an imaginary friend even when awake, eschewing activities with anyone else. Her disposition becomes erratic and childish, and she often scratches absently at her right hand. Her siblings don’t want anything to do with her, and even her parents find her hard to put up with. She has been afflicted by Ysondkhelir’s <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-abomination-vaults.av-items-5e.Item.JHbChH3j8d8A8OD7]{Outcast’s Curse}</em> spell, which the party might detect or remove normally. If they do, Ysondkhelir casts it on her again the following night. With a successful [[/skill persuasion dc=18]] check, the characters gain Dorianna’s trust and get her to open up to them. If they have the support of Menhemes Manor, they have Advantage on this check. Only one character can attempt this check each day. If the check fails by 5 or more, they must wait [[/r 1d4]] days to attempt the check again. On a success, Dorianna insists that the Motley Man is real and discusses one of the following two subjects with them. On a second success, or if the initial check succeeds by 5 or more, she reveals both.</p><p><strong>Gifts</strong>: The Motley Man gives her gifts in the form of her old childhood toys, and the best of them is the stuffed griffon. Even a cursory examination reveals that something hard is sewn inside the stuffed toy; characters who open it up find a @UUID[Item.uoPAVVoQc95sdxTN]{ruby} worth [[/award 500gp]]. Even if the party takes this ruby, the next time Dorianna dreams, it reappears inside another childhood toy from wherever it is. It’s keyed to Dorianna and doesn’t leave her for long.</p><p><strong>Wrist Writing</strong>: Dorianna absently points out several bruises on her right wrist that she can’t remember getting. A character proficient in Arcana who views the bruises can attempt a [[/check skill=arcana dc=18]] check to understand its significance. A character who speaks Aklo makes this check with Advantage. On a success, the character notes that the bruises form words related to some dream-traveling rituals, including the word “Leng.”</p><p>Either of these clues points to the involvement of a malevolent extraplanar creature called a denizen of Leng. Leng is a terrifying extraplanar location just past the Dimension of Dreams, where cruel and sinister people called denizens of Leng live. A character who succeeds on a [[/check skill=arcana dc=21]] check realizes the nature of the creature plaguing Dorianna; if the characters obtained both clues, then any character proficient in Arcana realizes the creature’s nature without a check. Though the heroes might identify the source of Dorianna’s trouble, there’s not much they can do for her yet because Ysondkhelir doesn’t ever physically get anywhere near her.</p><p><strong>XP Award</strong>: Award the characters [[/award 1200xp]] if they discover that a denizen of Leng is involved in Dorianna’s mysterious malady.</p>"

              "text": "<p>About the time the characters finish their exploration of the laboratories level and begin to investigate the prison level, Dorianna’s condition gets suddenly worse. She sleepwalks most of the time and is unaware of events around her, as though seeing the world in a hazy dream. Her right hand withers for no discernible reason. Mayor Menhemes takes his daughter to Vandy Banderdash at the Dawnflower Library, but the clerics there can’t aid her.</p><p>The characters hear about all of this on their next return to Otari. Everyone else in the Menhemes family is beside themselves with grief. If the characters haven’t previously gained Dorianna’s trust, they can attempt to do so now by making a [[/skill persuasion dc=20]] check. The characters gain no benefit for having the support of Menhemes Manor—Dorianna is beyond caring about her former friends.</p><h2>The Motley Man</h2><p>If the characters have Dorianna’s trust, she describes great adventures with the Motley Man in a fantastical land of forests, palaces, and snowfields. The Motley Man told her they would soon be together on their adventures forever, but he wanted her right hand as a token. Dorianna didn’t hesitate to offer it to him, and when she awoke, her hand was withered. She doesn’t consider it a particularly serious loss since her best friend wanted it so much. Dorianna doesn’t know how long it will be until she and the Motley Man are together forever, and this timetable is intentionally left vague so the GM can prompt the players to action without punishing them if they fail to reach Ysondkhelir quickly. They should have, at a minimum, a week before Dorianna vanishes.</p><h2>Locating Ysondkhelir</h2><p>Dorianna’s connection to Ysondkhelir is now so strong that the party can discover him through this link. A character proficient in Arcana realizes they can learn more by examining Dorianna’s psychic patterns while she’s dreaming. Doing so takes 8 hours and requires a character proficient in Arcana to make a [[/skill arc 15]] check. With a successful check, the character learns one of the following facts they don’t already know. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, they learn two facts. The character can repeat the check by spending another 8 hours studying Dorianna’s dreams, but if a check fails by 5 or more, the character imagines a false conclusion that encourages the party to explore deeper into the dungeon.</p><dl><ul><li><p>• There’s a strong link between Dorianna’s mind and the Dimension of Dreams. A denizen of Leng is strengthening this conduit; unless that creature is destroyed, Dorianna will eventually be drawn wholly into that dimension and lost to the world.</p></li><li><p>• The character gains images of the denizen’s surroundings: a stone chamber with a very old map of the Inner Sea region painted on it across from a map consisting of several tattered pieces of paper that, together, constitute a detailed map of Otari.</p></li><li><p>• The character knows that the denizen of Leng’s name is Ysondkhelir and gains an accurate mental image of him.</p></li><li><p>• The character can use the ruby in Dorianna’s possession to track Ysondkhelir. Doing so allows the character to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplLocateCrea]{Locate Creature}</em> as a ritual. When cast in this way, the spell can be used to track Ysondkhelir even if Ysondkhelir is beyond 1,000 feet of the caster. The ruby can’t be used to target another creature. Even though Dorianna doesn’t care if they take it, the ruby is still linked to her and returns to her each night. The characters must thus return to Otari to recover it each day.</p></li></ul></dl><section class=\"box-text treasure\"><header><img src=\"icons/commodities/gems/gem-faceted-rough-red.webp\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Rewards</h2><p>@UUID[Item.oPK9sP2JrdxZM00M]{Ruby of Alertness}</p></header><article><p>After the party defeats Ysondkhelir, the ruby no longer returns to Dorianna and becomes a standard (if unusually shaped) <em>Rod of Alertness</em>.

Whichever character scores the highest result wins. Record whether each character wins the contest. The second phase is the group phase. Shadow Malice performs a high-energy musical number, then passes over their instruments for the characters to use (if the characters don’t have any of their own). Unlike the individual contests, this last phase must be a Charisma check using Performance or a musical instrument, not any other skill. If the characters balk, Ryta just grins and says, “This stage is for performers, friend.” One character must attempt a [[/check skill=performance dc=15]] check. One other character proficient in Performance or with any musical instrument can Help with this check as a back-up performer. In addition, the character attempting the Charisma check gets a cumulative +1 bonus for each character who succeeded in the individual phase.</p><p>If the characters succeed on this final Charisma check, Ryta acknowledges them as Shadow Malice’s superior on the stage and resolves to leave them alone. Word gets back to Vischari about the characters’ success, and the tavern manager treats them with a modicum of respect. If the characters’ Charisma check succeeds by 5 or more, Ryta gives them the group’s instruments, insisting that the instruments belong in the hands of such talented performers. The other members of Shadow Malice grumble at this decision but sullenly comply.</p><p>If the characters fail this final Charisma check, Shadow Malice sees them as being out of their depth and resolves to take advantage by attacking the characters right on the stage. Anyone remaining in the tavern simply watches the fight, considering it a bloody part of the show; if the characters’ Charisma check failed by 5 or more, the patrons join the fight after the first round. In this case, the characters should make a hasty retreat before getting overwhelmed.</p><p><strong>XP Award</strong>: If the characters participate in the challenge against Shadow Malice, award them [[/award 1200xp]].

The two activities weren’t all that separate since the most powerful of the monsters created in the laboratories fought in the arena, where the survivors joined Belcorra’s growing ranks of monsters to assault Absalom. Conversely, failures in the arena became fodder for experiments in the laboratories.</p><p>When Belcorra died, the overbearing control of a bone devil named Tarkannah initially kept infighting on this level at a minimum, but some creatures chafed at Tarkannah’s control. The seugathi fleshwarper@UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.qrb0F1AQ3iIR7Xni]{ Jafaki} organized a coup and murdered the bone devil, taking control of the entire floor. Since this rebellion, Jafaki has maintained the level as the seugathis’ domain, believing their resources are better spent on the relentless refining of experimentations rather than expanding territory.</p><p>Due to Jafaki’s relatively relaxed disposition toward administration, creatures on this level tend to look after themselves. Many are more recent arrivals who have come seeking the seugathis’ skills and are willing to risk experimentation for the chance of becoming stronger. Creatures who haven’t been slated for fleshwarping yet spend most of their time drinking and relaxing in a large chamber that has long served as a tavern called the @UUID[JournalEntry.KI33EAGPVHP4zyFZ.JournalEntryPage.ad2vkPdR6V7Jxymf]{Warped Brew}.

This is the voidglutton’s lair, allowing it to create certain magical effects while in the area (see sidebar). Unlike many of Belcorra’s minions, the voidglutton came to serve her of its own free will, drawn from across dimensions by echoes of Nhimbaloth’s presence. It volunteered to aid Belcorra as a guardian of the upper shrine (area @UUID[JournalEntry.Os5bHdzCDiXgJBQ6.JournalEntryPage.CGaM81kBLtYIxmqu]{D13}), but once she relocated her personal effects to deeper in the Abomination Vault, it took over these rooms. It basks in the latent fears and pains of the dungeon’s haunts and ghosts.</p><p>When Belcorra rose as a ghost, the voidglutton took note and visited her, learning of her plans to reactivate Gauntlight and realizing that it would take time to awaken the dormant artifact. The voidglutton helped Belcorra refine the plans for test-firing Gauntlight and has recently done so with Volluk’s aid (as the characters experienced during the @UUID[JournalEntry.uMZ0RiCcPSqsx1Nm.JournalEntryPage.YJt9K0fOixekSCa6]{Deadtide} event at the beginning of Chapter 2). Since then, the voidglutton has lurked here, understanding that it’s just a matter of time before Belcorra contacts it again to enact the next stage of her plan.</p><p>The voidglutton moves from room to room in this area, as it finds the echoes of Belcorra’s spirit soothing. It therefore has an equal chance of being in area D20a, D20b, D20c, or D20d when the characters arrive. It notes the characters’ intrusion immediately, however, and swiftly moves to confront them. The creature has no interest in negotiation; it attacks at once and fights to the death, but it doesn’t pursue characters who flee its lair. If the voidglutton clearly has the upper hand over a group of intruders, it might offer to let most of them flee if they leave it a single survivor for it to torment to death over a few months.</p><h3>The Voidglutton's Lair</h3><p>On Initiative count 20 (losing all Initiative ties), the voidglutton can harness the ambient magic in area @UUID[JournalEntry.Os5bHdzCDiXgJBQ6.JournalEntryPage.QCU2xefly79ZVBxj]{D12}, @UUID[JournalEntry.Os5bHdzCDiXgJBQ6.JournalEntryPage.CGaM81kBLtYIxmqu]{D13}, @UUID[JournalEntry.Os5bHdzCDiXgJBQ6.JournalEntryPage.elYnvao8KPxWdGdp]{D19}, or @UUID[JournalEntry.Os5bHdzCDiXgJBQ6.JournalEntryPage.nGQeeoAEGLcgnwNz]{D20} to cause one of the following effects. It can’t do so while it has the Incapacitated condition or if it is otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t create any effect until after its first turn in combat. It can’t create the same effect two rounds in a row.</p><p>• An illusory memory of Belcorra’s victory over adventurers in the past plays out in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point the voidglutton can see within 60 feet of it. A creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a [[/save ability=wisdom dc=15]] saving throw or has the Frightened condition until it leaves the area. The illusion is short, but it repeats over and over.

Other creatures must reassemble all five fragments and touch the pendant to the door to open it.

Lit braziers cast strange shadows on the walls and bathe the room in a sinister light. Bookshelves and a sturdy desk, accompanied by neatly rolled-up scrolls and stacks of parchment, fill an alcove to the north.</p><p>Urevian has made this room his home, sealed off from the rest of the dungeon so he can work in peace. He fashioned the door for himself, but he had to manufacture a magical pendant for Belcorra so she could bypass it. Shortly before Belcorra’s death, Urevian had the imp Szek steal the pendant back. Urevian broke it into five pieces, giving one to each of his lieutenants. His trusted devils might come and go as they please, but even they know not to bother Urevian unless it’s on official business.</p><p>The desks contain reports, inventories, and maps of the surface world, of Gauntlight, and of the surrounding Darklands. Of particular note to the characters are complete maps of the fifth, sixth, and seventh levels of the Abomination Vaults, including all secret doors on those levels. The characters can also find copies of several infernal contracts, the originals of which are safely stored in Hell’s vaults. A character investigating the desk who succeeds on a [[/check skill=history or dc 17 intelligence (investigation) dc=15]] check realizes that Urevian has been keeping tabs on Vol Rajani’s line for generations and that Carman Rajani indeed appears to be Vol’s only surviving descendant.</p><p>The contract devil Urevian spends most of his time revising attack plans based on numerous contingencies. He always keeps two Bearded Devil bodyguards nearby to intercept reports from his lieutenants and to keep him from being disturbed. When the characters open the doors, the bearded devils spring forward in defense, but Urevian stops them and greets the party warmly. Read or paraphrase the following.</p><p class=\" box-text narrative-block\">A ruggedly handsome devil steps forward, the long rolls of parchment hanging from his horns curling up, then unrolling again. “Friends, friends! Weapons away. Truly, I am happy to see you.” The devil turns to the two bearded devil bodyguards with their glaives raised. “Stand down, you two. I doubt they’re arrogant enough to fight us.<br />“I am Urevian, phistophilus and contracted agent of Belcorra, but I assure you I am no enemy of yours. You seek to vanquish her? Put an end to her murderous spirit, the threat she poses to mortal life, et cetera, et cetera? Then perhaps we can broker a deal—one that greatly benefits both of us with a minimal amount of precious lives lost.”</p><p>If the characters have already encountered Szek and made an agreement with her—which Urevian doesn’t really mind—he adds, “You already struck a deal with Szek, so I know it’s not a matter of if, but of what price. Trust me when I say, I’m giving you a deal.” For this conversation, refer to @UUID[JournalEntry.OyNcqrpRClyhr8BJ.JournalEntryPage.dVEJIxBXK6Mr30Cn]{Negotiating with Urevian} for a list of likely questions and Urevian’s responses.</p><p><strong>If the characters take Urevian’s offer</strong>, he summons a contract for them to sign in blood. Urevian drafts an honest offer: upon his receipt of Carman Rajani (or his soul) from the party, he’ll leave the Material Plane along with all his devils remaining in the Abomination Vaults. His departure immediately removes the barrier in area @UUID[JournalEntry.OyNcqrpRClyhr8BJ.JournalEntryPage.JLM4Hwqvk9V8qvbp]{G3}. Before leaving, if the characters wish, he’ll order his surviving fleshwarps to clear the staircase leading down from area @UUID[JournalEntry.OyNcqrpRClyhr8BJ.JournalEntryPage.2aDFWQZkq3nA7KPT]{G1} to ease passage that way. His departure otherwise doesn’t affect the fleshwarps or other creatures in the prison, leaving the party to deal with those threats. Characters who sign are compelled to work toward delivering Carman to Urevian, as if affected by a level 9 <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGeas000000]{Geas}</em> spell.</p><p><strong>If the characters ultimately decline Urevian’s offer</strong>, he sighs in disappointment before saying, “What more should I have expected from mortals?” He then orders his bodyguards to attack.

Cynemi made her way here and agreed to retrieve Carman Rajani in exchange for Urevian’s power and influence. However, Carman proved too cunning, hustling Cynemi out of her equipment and leaving her stranded on a leaky boat in the Inner Sea. By the time Cynemi swam back to shore, the time she’d negotiated with Urevian had run out, so Barcumbuk dragged her back. She has been here ever since, fed only irregularly and often hung by her feet. She suspects she has spent months or even years imprisoned. Her manacles open easily, but Cynemi can’t reach them.</p></article><figure><img src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/bestiary-portraits/ch-07/cynemi.webp\" width=\"220\" /></figure></section><section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Side Quest</h3><p>Cynemi requires urgent care, as she’s on the verge of death from dehydration.

A catwalk ten feet above the ground circles around the room’s edge without handrails or banisters; at the western side, each end stops at a staircase leading down.</p><p>Belcorra kept dangerous creatures in this room prior to teleporting them via <em>Gauntlight</em>’s beam. Each cell is 10 feet square, 20 feet tall, and made of transparent stone. Each creature stands motionless in its own column, held in a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creatures haven’t aged and can’t be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream as long as they stay imprisoned. However, the pillars themselves, which are made of transparent, magically enhanced stone, can be destroyed (AC 21, 75 Hit Points, damage threshold 20).</p><h3>Occupied Chambers</h3><p>Ten pillars are occupied. They contain a @UUID[Actor.aD76W2uEQhFFUrom]{Chuul}, a @UUID[Actor.B7eLG2k7qUo8HU6O]{Drider}, three @UUID[Actor.IXen98RbUlbxDWBD]{Gogiteths}, a @UUID[Actor.dEAneTvoPuQXZoLR]{Gibbering Mouther}, a @UUID[Actor.T6vOuhM1KV5Fr75F]{Gibtanius}, and two @UUID[Actor.zq18QX6CBJNeUIgG]{Gugs}. One contains a ghonhatine (a hulking reptilian beast faintly resembling the humanoid lizard it once was) that’s dead because of a flaw in its chamber’s magic. If a character breaks through the stone around one of the creatures, the creature within must make a successful [[/save ability=constitution dc=21]] saving throw or the collapsing stasis effect messily kills it. On a success, the creature returns to normal time and attacks anything in sight until it’s destroyed. (High-challenge rating monsters, such as the gogiteths, pose a serious danger even for level 7 characters!)</p><h3>Empty Chambers</h3><p>Of the five empty stasis chambers, two are noteworthy. The northwest chamber is badly blackened, as though from soot from a fire raging inside. After the error with the ghonhatine, Belcorra appointed a hag to oversee this room, knowing that her magical expertise would be invaluable in maintaining the stasis chambers, but she didn’t intend for the hag to perform this job in life. Belcorra imprisoned the hag in this pillar, burned her to death, and bound her spirit as an undead creature called a witchfire. A creature entering a space within 5 feet of this pillar receives a brief telepathic flash of Belcorra burning the hag alive and gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against the witchfire’s spells and magical effects for 1 minute. A creature adjacent to the blackened pillar can also just make out the objects inside it (see “Treasure,” below). The pillar must be smashed open to retrieve them.</p><p>The second unusual stasis chamber, in the southwest, looks like the other empty chambers. However, its top and floor are both illusions. An open area below the chamber’s “floor” leads to a 5-foot- wide crawl space to the open trapdoor in Sacuishu’s room (area @UUID[JournalEntry.OyNcqrpRClyhr8BJ.JournalEntryPage.lNmEdSB5CToA5aKq]{G21}).</p><section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/encounter/skull-glow.webp\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Encounter</h2><p>@UUID[Actor.aIDLQY5mBPyxTjZ2]{Witchfire}</p></header><article><p>The Witchfire that Belcorra created long ago still guards this room.

The contract devil knows that the creatures in stasis are valuable to his invasion plans, so he has postponed his invasion until he figures out how to reliably free them himself, without the witchfire’s assistance.</p><p>The vengeful witchfire can’t be reasoned with and, once she engages the characters, fights until destroyed.

They use many cells for storage or in preparation for invading the surface. The ceilings are 20 feet high throughout, and most of the level is illuminated with a dim, red light from flickering flames or glowing diabolic symbols. The doors are all stone bound in iron, and many are locked. As a side effect of pervasive, diabolic influence, all doors flicker briefly with fire around their edges when opened or closed, making sneaking around in the prison level difficult. A character proficient in Religion can utter a brief incantation (which requires no action) when using a door to prevent this effect.</p><p>Urevian’s devils have had little contact with the Abomination Vaults’ lower levels, even in less troubled times. He received food from the farm level below to feed his mortal soldiers but cares little for the denizens there or their machinations. Since Belcorra’s return, Urevian has seen an increase in urdefhans, drow, and other creatures parading through the prison level, and he has had enough. He recently blocked the stairs leading down to the lower level with rubble (area @UUID[JournalEntry.OyNcqrpRClyhr8BJ.JournalEntryPage.2aDFWQZkq3nA7KPT]{G1}) and erected a magical barrier across the large elevator opening (area @UUID[JournalEntry.OyNcqrpRClyhr8BJ.JournalEntryPage.JLM4Hwqvk9V8qvbp]{G3}).

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and its Hit Point maximum isn’t reduced.</p><p>Once the characters know there’s a haunting, they also realize that the magical blood is its focus and can be wiped away with effort. The bloodstain can be attacked (AC 15, 30 Hit Points, Immunity to Poison damage, Resistance to Bludgeoning and Piercing damage, Vulnerability to 34 Radiant damage), or a character can scrape it away with a successful [[/check thief 18]] (or other appropriate tools).

Along the southern side, waters surrounding the ruins are relatively shallow, but on other sides, the depth ranges from 10 to 15 feet, requiring a boat or swimming to navigate.</p><figure><img src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/gauntlight-ruins-2.webp\" width=\"700\" /></figure><h2>Features</h2><aside class=\"av-float-block\"><h3>Environmental Cues:</h3><p>Crude graffiti, evidence of prior squatters, mounds of rubble, overgrowth of mold and creeping plants, puddles of standing water, scuttling vermin, splashing water, swampy odors.</p></aside><p>With the exception of Gauntlight's cupola, @UUID[JournalEntry.kDJSn9wbVvjnqYEj.JournalEntryPage.6wFkYYY7f8SqcRy8]{A25}, the upper levels of Gauntlight Keep collapsed long ago, even falling to the ground floor in places.

The GM can ask them to choose from a list of common checks and activities, or ask each player to describe what their character does and decide if their description should allow them to notice things in the areas they pass through. Certain effects are listed in the rooms based on where a character focuses their attention. This might mean investigating for clues that reveal information (typically using the Investigation skill or an Intelligence check), checking the walls for unusual details via Wisdom (Perception) checks, or more specialized tasks like maintaining Concentration on a spell. A single character should generally only be doing one of these things at a time.</p></article></section>"

Stealth and ranged tactics could thin the opposition before the undead can close to melee, and with their foes being scattered, the characters won’t need to deal with large numbers all at once if they’re quick and efficient.</p><p>The four nearby town Guards are frightened by the undead and are unlikely to be of much help—they flee if attacked. At the GM’s discretion, and particularly if a character makes a successful [[/check skill=intimidation/persuasion dc=12]] check to jar the guards out of their fear, some of them might fight. Guards can also drag a fallen character to safety. If any guards engage in combat, each begins the encounter with the Frightened condition. Each guard makes a [[/save wisdom dc=12]] saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the Frightened condition on themselves on a success.</p></article></section><h2>Abomination's Arrival</h2><p>Belcorra watches with amusement from afar as the characters deal with the undead. As soon as that fight ends, though, she decides it’s time to test <em>Gauntlight’</em>s primary function: teleporting monsters in among her enemies. Belcorra orders her apprentice Volluk to bring one of the scalathraxes from area @UUID[JournalEntry.Os5bHdzCDiXgJBQ6.JournalEntryPage.df69jJ0DznVnWMAb]{D10} into area @UUID[JournalEntry.Os5bHdzCDiXgJBQ6.JournalEntryPage.RmFsEEQSD9Ulugwm]{D9}. This delay grants the characters a few minutes to recover from the previous fight. Belcorra then focuses Gauntlight’s beam upon the characters’ location. The baleful light’s illumination raises gooseflesh on those it touches and scatters any remaining guards in a panic.</p><section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/icon-monster.webp\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Encounter</h2><p>@UUID[Actor.Nkz8Z5TrEqRePGlk]{Scalathrax}</p></header><article><p>An instant after <em>Gauntlight</em>’s beam shines upon the characters, a Scalathrax manifests in their midst—and just as quickly, I goes dark. Each character can attempt a [[/check skill=arcana dc=14]] check to recognize the impending teleportation and avoid being surprised by the scalathrax’s sudden arrival. Once it appears, the scaly, spiderlike aberration attacks, fighting to the death.</p><p><strong>Treasure</strong>: The scalathrax’s body contains a reservoir of oil, which is of great use to alchemists but is difficult to harvest and preserve. A character proficient with Alchemist’s Supplies or who makes a successful [[/check skill=arcana dc=12]] check recognizes this usefulness upon seeing the dead scalathrax’s body. By spending 10 minutes and succeeding on a [[/check ability=intelligence dc=15]] check using Alchemist’s Supplies, a character can extract 5 pounds of scalathrax oil worth [[/award 100gp]] from a recently killed scalathrax. If scalathrax oil is used as at least half the raw materials cost to craft Alchemist’s Fire or similar items, the crafter can finish the item in 1 day, the saving throw DC of the item increases by 2, and any damage the item deals is doubled the first time it deals damage. Scalathrax oil can be used as Oil but is often considered too valuable for such a mundane purpose.</p></article></section><h2>Dying Light</h2><p>Once <em>Gauntlight</em> has delivered the scalathrax and gone dark, it will be at least a month before the artifact can return to a point where Belcorra can activate it again. She might do so to animate more undead or teleport another monster into town, either to attack the characters directly or to simply spread panic.</p><p>Of course, the townsfolk have no idea about this schedule, and the fear that <em>Gauntlight</em> could shine again at any moment has the citizens terrified. People fear to go outside after dark, and rumors about Belcorra’s return run rampant. Assuming the characters played a key and visible role in defeating the undead and the scalathrax, they’re soon contacted by Mayor Oseph Menhemes, who asks them to do what they can to find out what caused this event and, if possible, prevent it from occurring again. Feel free to have other town notables be present at this time—give the characters a chance to rise to the occasion. In any event, Oseph promises a reward of [[/award 50gp]] per character from the town treasury if they can see to it that <em>Gauntlight</em> never shines on Otari again. (He’ll grant this reward as soon as the characters learn of Belcorra’s plans from the ghost of Otari Ilvashti in area @UUID[JournalEntry.Os5bHdzCDiXgJBQ6.JournalEntryPage.J8ggyg2kxws3Sa1h]{D18}, locate the Gauntlight papers in area @UUID[JournalEntry.KeWKr2yd8dbppeS5.JournalEntryPage.8X4xF40k06MW0X7q]{C35}, or free Lasda Venkervale in area @UUID[JournalEntry.Os5bHdzCDiXgJBQ6.JournalEntryPage.RmFsEEQSD9Ulugwm]{D9}, but he asks them to continue their efforts against Belcorra thereafter.)</p>"

Drawing the reclusive and inhuman Nhimbaloth’s attention isn’t easy, but Belcorra laid the groundwork for this by relying so heavily upon the <em>Ebon Fulcrum Lens</em>. Nhimbaloth is already inclined to turn her spirit-consuming attention to Belcorra because Belcorra has made so much use of the glimmers of Nhimbaloth’s essence within the item.

The room’s four wings each contain a massive pool of bubbling swamp water. Flickering motes of light and darkness play underneath the surface of the pools. The chamber’s center is partially blocked by a circle of black standing stones, which reach to the ceiling and crackle with eerie energy that shoots up into a shaft in the ceiling. Seven narrow channels, as though dug into the stone by a seven-fingered hand, run from each pool and three of the walls to a moat in the center of the room. From there, the water flows under the wall to the east, between a pair of black stone double doors. An island in the moat holds a smooth altar topped with a black lens the size of a fist.</p><p>The Empty Vault has always been a generation pit for the wisps who serve Nhimbaloth. A funnel of swamp, despair, and ghostly energies, it is mystically connected to the various swamp plant basins throughout the lower Abomination Vaults. Any follower of Nhimbaloth here can telepathically communicate with wisps adjacent to the basins.</p><p>The Empty Vault drew Belcorra’s soul after the Roseguard killed her, and her ghost reappeared here 500 years after the most traumatic event in her life— not her death, but her family’s exile from Absalom. Belcorra can’t leave this chamber for long, so she uses her wisp proxies and bound agents to enact her will throughout the Abomination Vaults. She keeps the Ebon Fulcrum Lens on the altar to restore its energies; while here, it can regain its glimmers of Nhimbaloth’s essence, but this takes time.</p><p>The seven swamp water rivulets are both dangerous and noxious, as they mark where Nhimbaloth once touched the world. It’s a simple matter to merely step over them, but they pull unpleasantly at life energy of non-Undead that cross them. At the end of any turn in which a character crosses a rivulet (whether by walking, flying, or any other means), the character must make a successful [[/save constitution dc=13]] saving throw or gain 1 level of &amp;Reference[Exhaustion]. This DC increases by 1 for each additional unique rivulet crossed during that turn (for example, a character who crosses over three rivulets on their turn makes a single [[/save constitution dc=16]] saving throw, rather than three separate saving throws). Crossing the pools doesn’t have this effect, so the characters might learn that there are safer ways to move about the room than simply walking in a direct line.

They’ll need to be in top form to tackle Belcorra; if they haven’t collected all three @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.azMqL6C2NvazTcRE]{Fulcrum Lenses} by now, they may need to retreat, recover them, and face Belcorra again.</p></article></section><h1>The Temple</h1><p>Perhaps a few of the vaults’ inhabitants know the true story of Nhimbaloth’s ancient temple—notably Lady’s Whisper and maybe a dread wisp or two—but none will tell the tale. Was it the hub of a cult cast deep into the earth by an ancient enemy, or the headquarters of a Darklands coterie? No matter its original purpose, the initiation trials are the last challenges that the characters must face to confront Belcorra. The first is the Challenge of Souls, where unworthy initiates were poisoned, tormented, and had their souls extracted. The second is the Challenge of Despair, where initiates faced their greatest fears. The last test is the Challenge of the Swamp, where initiates demonstrated mastery over swampland dangers. The characters are likely to face these tests in order only if guided by Lady’s Whisper; otherwise, they’re free to tackle them in whatever order they’d like. Beyond lies the Empty Vault, Belcorra’s domain and the source of Gauntlight’s powers.</p><aside class=\"av-float-block\"><h3>Environmental Cues:</h3><p>Black stone, carvings of bones or mist, clammy, eerie lights, fog, swamp plants.</p></aside><h2>Features</h2><p>The temple is wholly dark, except where otherwise noted.

As a result, everyone who grows up in Otari has a healthy mix of fear, respect, and curiosity for the old ruins out in Fogfen and the strange lighthouse that stands at the swamp's heart. As they grow older, townsfolk learn what's more often accepted as truth: that the heroic founders of Otari had slain the wicked sorcerer Belcorra many years ago. For a time, thrill-seekers explored the ruins around the lighthouse called <em>Gauntlight</em>, but today, common knowledge holds that the place has become a haven for pests—no longer a source of active danger or significant treasure after being completely picked over. Nearly 500 years has passed since Belcorra's defeat after all, and in that time, she has only posed a menace to Otari through sinister rhymes.</p><p>Or so the citizens of Otari believe.</p><p>While many old legends about Belcorra are true (she did practice cannibalism, for example, but didn't limit her diet to foolish children), the belief that she's no longer a danger is false. Two years ago, on the 500th anniversary of the most significant event of her life- her family's exile from Absalom for abhorrent rites- Belcorra's spiteful ghost awoke deep beneath Gauntlight Keep. The lighthouse and surrounding ruins presented only the highest level of a vast complex Belcorra had stocked with malicious and malignant creatures: her Abomination Vaults. Belcorra's spite has festered in the intervening centuries, and she hungers for revenge, not only against Absalom for destroying her family, but also the town of Otari and its founders- the heroes who killed her. Belcorra bides her time while she rebuilds, reenergizing the dread Gauntlight and reasserting her dominance over the feral and forgotten monsters of the Abomination Vaults!</p><h2>Belcorra's History</h2><p>The ghost sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex is the primary villain of the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. The story behind her spiteful rage is one of exile and loss.</p><p>The Haruvex family tree both sprawls and surges with sorcery. The family's strongest bloodlines have an aberrant strain, which provides family prestige as well as sorcerous power. Generations of Haruvexes married within the family to strengthen this lineage, and the most powerful Haruvexes lived in Absalom 500 years ago. These Absalom Haruvexes made secret obeisance to the Outer Gods for great wealth and greater power. But none in the family approached the power of their youngest scion, Belcorra Haruvex. Belcorra had been told, every day for as long as she could remember, that she was the harbinger of Nhimbaloth, the Empty Death, and that she was her family's greatest hope for power and prosperity.</p><p>The Haruvexes enacted abhorrent rites in their worship, including bloody sacrifices, and the authorities eventually caught wind of their crimes. The Haruvexes were finally driven from the Isle of Kortos in 4219 ar, forced to leave their estates and luxuries behind. Belcorra was only 6 years old at the time, but as she grew, her rage at losing her home solidified into an overwhelming hatred of Absalom and everyone in it.</p><p>Most of the exiled Haruvexes died in poverty, but Belcorra grew strong and proud. At 17, she interpreted visions from Nhimbaloth that led her back to the Isle of Kortos to plan her revenge. Far above a subterranean shrine to Nhimbaloth called the Empty Vault, in a lonely stretch of wooded coast a few dozen miles from Absalom, Belcorra erected a magical lighthouse and called it @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.efRUYLBH9Kf3CLkX]{Gauntlight}. She dug deep beneath it to reach the shrine she had seen in her visions, and while she worked, she began to plan her revenge. She would draw subterranean monsters and violent beasts into her secret dungeons- which she called the Abomination Vaults- and use <em>Gauntlight</em>'s magic to send them into Absalom to wreak havoc. She enacted the first part of her plan, expanding the Abomination Vaults and raising a defensible keep around the lighthouse. She leveraged family acquaintances to acquire powerful retainers and champions to lead her monstrous forces.</p><p>Belcorra was still stocking her Abomination Vaults with aberrations when rumors of her villainy reached Absalom. The @UUID[.Gx2mnbeUctXU7XUN]{Roseguard}, a group of heroes headquartered in Absalom, set out from the city to confront and vanquish her. The Roseguard faced Belcorra within Gauntlight Keep and killed her there. One of the four members of the Roseguard, a rogue named Otari Ilvashti, died in this fight. Grieving their lost friend, the Roseguard left, sealed up the keep, founded what would become the town of Otari, and retired there. They never knew of the keep’s lower levels or the many creatures still remaining within them.</p><h2>BELCORRA’S RISE</h2><p>Belcorra’s spirit didn’t rest peacefully. Consumed by rage and empowered by Nhimbaloth, she arose as a powerful ghost 500 years after her family’s exile from Absalom, the event that so dramatically altered her life. Belcorra now lurks in the deepest levels of the Abomination Vaults, plotting her revenge against Absalom and the heroes who vanquished her. The Roseguard are long dead, but the town they founded remains, and the icons representing their adventuring careers now have the power to penetrate Belcorra’s protections.</p><p>At first, no one in Otari realizes the danger Belcorra poses. Her machinations and her monsters are well out of sight. But before she moves against Absalom, she intends to use her <em>Gauntlight</em> against Otari—the town built by the adventurers who killed her five centuries before. Only Otari’s newest heroes can prevent Belcorra’s vengeance and put her spirit to rest.</p>"

It was theirs, or so his parents insisted.</p><p>As Carman grew older, he first worked at Otari's blacksmith's shop, @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.5yYs7JNliPnSYLhp]{Blades for Glades}, and later won the shop in a lucky wager against the prior owner, yet he couldn't forget his family's sword. Officially, the Menhemes family claimed ownership over Vol's ancient blade but \"allowed\" it to stay in the library in an act of purported generosity that Carman found offensive.</p><p>The summer his parents were waylaid and slain by bandits on the road from Absalom, Carman became a broken man. His work at the smithy became erratic, and he stopped relaxing with his friends and helping his community. With no other direction, Carman squandered his inheritance, spending the money on entertainment, fine clothes, and rare whiskey. He started spending more time gambling and drinking at the Crook’s Nook than he did at his smithy. Eventually, the inheritance money ran out, and Carman was faced with a sizable debt. Several owed favors later, he started grifting travelers or hustling them at the knife-throwing board at the @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.sdNti6BHkPTeO5fC]{Crook’s Nook}, but his vices still outpaced his earnings from petty cons, and soon he took to outright thievery under Yinyasmera’s tutelage. The “Ace of Blades” is the moniker given to the best knife thrower in the Crook’s Nook, and Carman Rajani has held that title for so long that it has become his nickname among fellow members of the Osprey Club.</p><h3>Mayoral Candidacy</h3><p>Within a few years, Carman had settled into his new life, working as a smith during the day, carousing at the Crook’s Nook at night, and occasionally engaging in some petty larceny when his coin purse started to get light. When he heard rumors that people thought he was wasting his life, though, it stung his pride. He resolved to run for mayor against Oseph to show the whole town that his family was the equal of the Menhemes family.</p><p>Everyone thought Carman’s candidacy was a joke. The second time he ran, his platform became nothing more than sharp personal attacks against the Menhemes family; the townspeople felt the joke had gone sour and considered it a waste of their time. He met their jibes with violence, getting into brawls to prove he was the better man. The third time he ran for office, he actually put in effort to help the community; though he lost by a much smaller margin, he took the loss as proof that kindness can’t get you any further than your fists can. The fourth time, he tried to force a successful campaign with open bribes and blackmail.</p><p>Oseph won by a landslide, showing up on Election Day wearing the <em>Cooperative Blade</em> as part of his celebratory regalia. Carman finally decided that the magic sword must be the key to his success. Everyone in town knew it brought Otari good luck, so whoever held the sword had the town in their pocket. As Vol’s heir, he deserved the sword. He begged Oseph to sell the weapon, but Oseph suspected it was some new scheme— or worse, connected to one of Carman’s rumored crimes or debts—and countered with delays, excuses, and price increases.</p><p>Finally, Carman decided he’d had enough.

Once Jafaki realizes the heroes are powerful enough to face them directly, the seugathi understands that they would make excellent candidates for experimentation. Unfortunately for Jafaki, this realization probably comes too late.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Belcorra first spotted Jafaki and several other seugathis slithering through the Darklands while she was building the Abomination Vaults. They expressed an eagerness to serve her and advance their own experiments. Belcorra knew the seugathis could improve her forces, as well as expand them. She tasked the seugathis with building her a perfect soldier, then making armies of them to conquer Absalom. Knowing that perfection was a high price to ask, Belcorra funneled all the resources she could to the seugathis. They pursued not one research path, but many, including fleshwarping, monster breeding, and even dabbling in magical constructs. Belcorra didn’t mind this broad experimentation, as nearly all of it provided her with useful monsters for her growing army. She passed along the seugathis’ innovations to other alchemists and mages who could duplicate the work.</p><h3>After Belcorra</h3><p>When the Roseguard defeated Belcorra, the seugathis nevertheless continued pursuing their objective. Their initial obstacle was a bone devil named Tarkannah. Tarkannah deemed that ongoing duty to Belcorra—to whom the bone devil remained loyal even after her death—meant taking a firmer hand in overseeing the seugathis. Tarkannah tried to constrain and direct the seugathis’ sprawling research. Rather than comply with these unwelcome demands, the seugathis rebelled; Jafaki killed Tarkannah and seized control of the laboratories.</p><p>This assault started a brief war between the devils and the seugathis. For months, the two sides fought, but Urevian soon discovered the seugathis weren’t interested in expanding their holdings, and the two sides settled in an uneasy truce on their respective levels of the vaults. These front lines aren’t absolute; Urevian is happy to permit potential “raw materials” to pass through the prison, as the seugathis’ cast-off creatures often find their way into the devil’s gradually increasing forces.</p><figure class=\"left\"><img src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/items/fleshforged-soldier.webp\" width=\"210\" /></figure><p>Jafaki has little concern for the army growing on the level below. The seugathis don’t bother with the imp and zebub spies that pass through the laboratories, but Jafaki and their colleagues can make marching through with a large army costly or even impossible. Jafaki plans to allow passage only in exchange for additional concessions to bolster their ongoing experiments, even though Urevian is certain to balk at the cost.</p><h3>Jafaki's Obsession</h3><p>Jafaki’s research has drifted over the years through various abhorrent sciences: fleshwarping, reanimation of the dead, selective breeding, or even golem creation. Yet, they remain as focused on their goal of creating the perfect soldier as they were when they spoke to Belcorra all those years ago.</p><p>That word has driven Jafaki for centuries. Good soldiers? They’ve created those, and all have died by the dozens or hundreds in the arena. Great soldiers? Some of Jafaki’s finest works have been nearly unstoppable, but “nearly” isn’t “perfect.” Jafaki will pursue perfection for as long as it takes.</p>"

If the characters clear out the Abomination Vaults by slaughtering their way through Jafaki and the seugathis, then all the better for the devil. Urevian has ordered his devils to keep an eye out for the characters, to kill all but one or two, and then bring him the survivors for negotiations. He plans to convince the remaining characters to deliver Carman Rajani to him. Otherwise, he’ll march his army up through the dungeon and destroy Otari.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Five centuries ago, Belcorra summoned the contract devil Urevian to administer her Abomination Vaults. Always looking to sweeten a deal, Urevian further offered to train Belcorra’s armies and lead her invasion of Absalom—for a price. Urevian knew that Vol Rajani, legendary Roseguard swordswoman and exiled royalty from Nidal, lived in Absalom. The Rajani family has, for reasons even Urevian doesn’t know, special value to certain parties in Hell. In exchange for Urevian’s aid, Belcorra guaranteed him Rajani’s soul.</p><p>When the Roseguard attacked <em>Gauntlight</em>, bringing the soul right to Belcorra’s doorstep, Urevian was in Hell, committing Rajani’s soul to a much more powerful entity—even though he didn’t yet have it. By the time he returned, the Roseguard had prevailed and Belcorra had been slain. The sorcerer couldn’t fulfill her end of the bargain, trapping Urevian in the interminable process of preparing a surface invasion that would gain him nothing. Worse, he couldn’t return to Hell without Rajani’s soul, and his agreement forbade him from capturing the soul directly or through his infernal proxies. Urevian was trapped.</p><p>Now that Belcorra has returned, Urevian’s agreement with her can be fulfilled. He plans to train her armies and invade the surface, starting with Otari; his spying has informed him that Carman Rajani, whose soul can also fulfill his contract, lives there.</p><p>Urevian has fully mobilized his devils to train the fleshwarps who have come into his realm. Belcorra placed several horrible monsters in stasis, though Urevian doesn’t yet know how to reliably free them and has made that discovery his next priority.</p><h3>Uneasy Allies</h3><p>Although the devils can use <em>Dimension Door</em> multiple times to reach the surface quickly, Urevian’s other troops need physical access, which required him to approach the seugathi Jafaki about allowing them through the laboratories. Jafaki feared another diabolic ruse—a reasonable assumption, given the seugathis’ past relations with Urevian—and agreed on one condition: Urevian must allow the seugathis to “personally inspect” all infernal forces and make “upgrades and improvements.” Urevian knew this ploy was for Jafaki to get their tentacles on endless research subjects, and that the fleshwarper would never sign off on any troops. Urevian is ready to wash his hands of this entire arrangement, but alas, he has a contract.</p>"

Despite the loss of her hometown, Wrin feels no sadness or despair about the event, for none perished in Glitterbough’s fall. In the days before the demon army’s attack, Wrin had a vision of the disaster. She warned her parents and neighbors, and their trust in her visions gave the town the time it needed to relocate everyone in the village to safety. When the demons came, they found Glitterbough deserted, and when they burned it in frustration, they suffered greatly from the magical traps the elves had left behind to greet them.</p><p>When she came of age a few years later, Wrin left her parents and friends, eager to find her own place in the world. As she traveled, she trusted in her visions and her unusual faith in a pantheon of deities associated with space and time she refers to as the Cosmic Caravan, looking to the nightly stars to make decisions for tomorrow. Her knack for finding lost things and gathering strange treasures made establishing her own curio shop an obvious choice, and it wasn’t by chance that she decided to set up that shop in Otari—it was simply the port she’d arrived at when her capacity to carry her collection finally outweighed its portability.</p><p>She opened her shop, @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.jlb4fsKQC57ZjNQ7]{Wrin’s Wonders}, four years ago. In that time, she has become part of the community, even if many of its citizens regard her as a good-natured eccentric. Sales of the strange and bizarre aren’t brisk in the small town, but that’s no matter to Wrin—she’s patient and has enjoyed her time in Otari so far. One day, she hopes to make enough money to fund a trip west, for she has heard tell of an abandoned observatory in the small town of Crookcove on Ravounel’s southwestern coast that she hopes to purchase and transform into a temple devoted to the Cosmic Caravan. But for the time being, she’s content to stay in Otari and sleep under the stars.</p><p>Wrin’s tiefling ancestry is impossible to miss, and it’s something she long ago decided to embrace. Eyes devoid of pupils, small ram horns curling around her elven ears, a thin tail, and fingertips that sparkle with motes of glittering lights leave no doubt that she’s touched by supernatural forces. Yet, her quick smile and welcoming attitude have always helped her to secure friendships during her travels.</p><h2>Campaign Role</h2><p>Wrin’s primary purpose is to motivate the heroes’ initial explorations and to give them a focal point to gather around. The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path assumes that Wrin is a contact the heroes share in common, so when she notices a strange buildup of eerie light atop distant <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.efRUYLBH9Kf3CLkX]{Gauntlight}</em>, it’s natural for her to confide her fears in the party.</p><p>Wrin can help the characters in other ways, such as by performing astrology readings to aid them in their explorations. While she won’t give her store’s wares away for free, her establishment is the best place to buy and sell the odd magical treasures characters tend to find and crave. Despite her claustrophobia, if the characters find themselves in over their head in the Abomination Vaults, the GM can have Wrin face her fears to brave the dungeon and mount a rescue.

His time as a child growing up in Absalom and his adventures with the other members of the Roseguard have dwindled to distant but pleasant memories. His fear of the devastation Belcorra plans to unleash upon Absalom is what keeps him shackled to this world as a ghost.</p><p>When the Roseguard fought Belcorra in Gauntlight Keep, she unleashed a powerful magical explosion that collapsed the room where the fight took place. Belcorra and three heroes avoided the collapse and fought on— to Belcorra’s ultimate defeat—but the rogue Otari was caught beneath the collapse. His companions assumed he was pulverized, but Otari had fallen into a level beneath Gauntlight Keep that none of the Roseguard knew existed. Otari desperately wanted to escape to the surface and share his discovery, but Belcorra’s minions forced him to flee ever deeper into the vaults, until finally he was cornered in a dead-end cave by an immense otyugh that left him trapped and suffering from filth fever. Otari died in that deep cave, but his ghost lingers on.</p>"

His fated confrontation with the heroes is necessary because he holds the Emerald Fulcrum Lens and refuses to give it up as long as he lives, as it symbolizes the leadership of his cult. Khurfel’s vision of falling at the heroes’ hands doesn’t inspire fear—it inspires fury, and he fights against his prophesized enemies as long as breath remains in his body.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Khurfel saw his first blood vision as a child, after his first taste of an enemy’s blood. Not every urdefhan has blood visions; those who do tend to keep them quiet, for those who experience them are seen as irrational or untrustworthy. Such visions always relay great apocalypses, perhaps connected to daemons and urdefhans’ lust for great death, but they’re nonsensical and rarely come true. Yet, like all urdefhans subjected to blood visions, Khurfel was absolutely convinced of his vision’s veracity, its outcome terrifying him. He saw the end of his cult, the urdefhans in the Abomination Vaults once sworn to Belcorra but who had mostly forgotten their oaths. He saw that this end would come while he ruled and that he was powerless to stop it. He would be the last war champion.</p><p>Of course, Khurfel kept his visions secret. If the rest of his cult knew of them, his life would be forfeit— but that wasn’t the real reason he denied them. His blood boiled at the revelation. He was the chosen of Abaddon. He would indeed rise to war champion, but he would fight these fevered nightmares. They were another enemy to be vanquished.</p><p>Khurfel’s rise was swift. He was large, strong, and fearsome. When he led his first war band, he achieved victory and slaughter, and when he partook in his enemies’ blood, the haunting visions waned. Within a few years, Khurfel became the youngest war champion in his cult’s history. He swore to defend their symbol of leadership, the Emerald Fulcrum Lens carried by generations of war champions. That’s when Khurfel’s troubles began.</p><p>It’s one thing to lead comrades into battle. Everything not urdefhan is prey. Fighting was simple and visceral. It focused Khurfel’s mind, and it exhilarated him. But being a leader, he learned, was far more nuanced. He had to juggle the jealousies, ambitions, and problems of everyone in his cult, an aspect of his position that he found tiring and dull. Worse still, his blood visions resumed. The Ghost Queen Belcorra returned to tell his cult to be ready, for they would soon have worlds of slaughter when she finished with her plans. His fellow urdefhans cheered at this promise, but Khurfel’s visions dampened his joy.</p><p>His visions showed him that hunting the drow leader, Larathols, would be the first step toward his cult’s demise. However, Larathols provoked Khurfel with his cautious explorations of the great lake the urdefhans claimed as their own. Larathols sought secrets in the forbidden vault—the one the urdefhans had been told long ago that no one should enter. Hungry for another fight and believing he could overcome his visions, Khurfel swam to an island on the lake and there killed Larathols and his daughter. He drank of the drow’s blood and threw the body into the lake so monsters could rip it apart. He had vanquished his foes. The victory was glorious, and his people screamed his name in triumph. Larathols’s blood was invigorating. What urdefhan doesn’t want these things? It’s every urdefhan’s right to bring death and destruction into the world.</p><p>But Khurfel’s blood visions now manifest more frequently, showing strangers who threaten him and drow working against him. He has called upon his cult’s tormentors and blood mages to summon more daemons and strengthen their defenses, but the visions persist. Khurfel is uneasy, and his doubt feels like weakness. The only way to solve a problem is to destroy it utterly—what his people have always done. Still the visions come, and Khurfel is powerless to stop them.</p>"

Her father, a wise and prudent man named Larathols, had ruled the settlement for many centuries. She loved her father, not only because he was a decent man, but because he granted Quara the freedom to forge her own path. She loved the swagger and fearlessness of Yldaris’s shootists and grew up fascinated by their tall tales and the way they reveled in their exploits.</p><p>Larathols saw no reason not to indulge his youngest daughter’s aspirations. He was already preparing Quara’s older sister, Galuna, to lead Yldaris when the time came, which Quara always imagined as many centuries in the future. In the meantime, she honed her skills with the shootists. It didn’t take long for her to start inspiring stories herself and to collect the scars that go with them—the most severe of which came from a run-in with a gug, against which she ultimately prevailed. She wore the creature’s pelt for years until it grew too tattered to be practical.</p><p>Quara’s carefree life changed after her father’s and sister’s deaths. At the time, she was carousing in Lozardyn and delighting in its residents’ larger-than-life rumors about her. Larathols decided to raid one of Belcorra’s secret storehouses to gain more information about the magical lens the sorcerer had entrusted to Larathols’s father many years ago. Galuna had gone with him, and Khurfel, war champion of the nearby urdefhans, ambushed and killed the pair. Quara was immediately called back to Yldaris. As the most senior of the shootists and Larathols’s daughter, she was expected to assume leadership of the outpost.</p><p>Quara never knew much about Belcorra or about the secret mission that cost her father and sister their lives. Belcorra had visited Yldaris years before Quara’s birth and made a deal with her grandfather, the vague details of which Quara heard only through rumors. She knew her grandfather played a dangerous game with Belcorra, promising forces that he couldn’t deliver and keeping the arrangement secret from Lozardyn’s rulers.</p><p>When the sorcerer suddenly disappeared—killed at the hands of surface dwellers, rumor said—the problem seemed to have sorted itself out.</p><h3>Visit from a Forgotten Friend</h3><p>Belcorra arrived in Yldaris shortly after Quara came home, imperiously demanding that Quara swear fealty just as her grandfather had. Never one to be much bound by promises anyway, Quara glibly swore to support the ghost because it seemed like the safest course of action.</p><p>Quara immediately consulted with Yldaris’s enigmatic cavern seers and her father’s closest allies to find out what had happened to him. She learned a little bit about her father’s last days, where he had gone and why, and that he’d taken something called the Ochre Fulcrum Lens that Belcorra had entrusted to Quara’s grandfather five centuries earlier. Belcorra hadn’t mentioned the lens when she appeared before Quara—perhaps assuming it was languishing in some Yldaris treasure vault—but Quara deduced the lens’s critical importance.</p><p>The responsibility of administering Yldaris has changed Quara. Her wild days have ended; she rarely drinks and never to excess. However, her freewheeling time as a shootist taught her the dangers of their outpost. She boasts less and has become more circumspect, having learned the lessons of true leadership. Her people love her for it. Quara would be shocked to hear it, but she’s just as well-regarded a leader as Larathols ever was.</p>"

Once she finished its physical construction, the sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex used this spot as a source of power to infuse the structure extending above it, imbuing the walls, floors, and ceilings of each of <em>Gauntlight</em>’s levels with eldritch power. In time, the lens at the apex of the lighthouse would have been able to focus this lingering eldritch energy into a powerful beam of light, but Belcorra’s plans were cut short before she could replace the mundane lenses with dangerous magical ones.</p><p class=\"property\"><strong>Extradimensional Interference.</strong> Gauntlight’s walls block teleportation and planar travel into or out of an area within the structure, as well as any attempt to summon a creature into the area. This effect doesn’t stop a summoned creature from departing when the summoning ends. A creature whose spell or ability would be blocked can bypass this restriction by succeeding on a [[/save charisma dc=19]] saving throw. Each attempt requires as separate saving throw.</p><h3>Activations</h3><p>Activating Gauntlight’s other functions require you to be attuned to Gauntlight and in the Empty Vault in the lighthouse’s foundation. The range and effects as presented below apply to Gauntlight’s current state of diminished functionality. If Belcorra can fully restore Gauntlight, its powers recharge much faster and have vastly increased range (with the beam arching over the curvature of the planet to shine upon its target as needed).</p><p class=\"property\"><strong>Far Sight.</strong> As a Bonus Action, you can utter one of Nhimbaloth’s epithets to see as if you were in any area within 1 mile, or within 100 miles if Gauntlight is fully restored. While observing an area in this way, an extremely faint blue light gleams from Gauntlight’s lens. The light is visible at the target area only to creatures using Detect Magic or similar magic or who are otherwise highly sensitive to the presence of magic.</p><p class=\"property\"><strong>Disturb the Dead.</strong> You can use a Magic action to cause a pale blue beam to shine from Gauntlight’s lens and illuminate a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you can see within 1 mile. The light fills the area with Dim Light and causes any humanoid corpses in the area (including corpses buried up to 10 feet below the surface of the illuminated area) to animate as Skeletons, Zombies, or other appropriate Undead of Challenge Rating 1/4 or less. Once animated, the undead remain active until slain. Until then, they are uncontrolled and driven only by the desire to slaughter the living. Gauntlight can’t Disturb the Dead again until the next full moon. If Gauntlight is fully restored, the undead instead animate as any appropriate Undead of up to Challenge Rating 10 that you choose, the maximum range is 100 miles, and this property can be used again after 1 minute.</p><p class=\"property\"><strong>Bridge of Light.</strong> You can use a Magic action to cause a pale blue beam to shine from Gauntlight’s lens and illuminate a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you can see within 1 mile. One creature of your choice that is level or Challenge Rating 2 or less and physically located within Gauntlight is teleported to an unoccupied space you choose within this illumination radius. Once you use this property, Gauntlight can’t teleport a creature again until the next full moon. If Gauntlight is fully restored, you can teleport any number of creatures within Gauntlight of level or Challenge Rating 10 or lower, the maximum range is 100 miles, and this property can be used again after 1 minute.</p><p class=\"property\"><strong>Destroying Gauntlight.</strong> As an artifact, <em>Gauntlight</em> cannot be damaged by normal means. Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any attempt to breach them, including spells that allow temporary passage such as Passwall. If Belcorra’s ghost is permanently destroyed, Gauntlight loses all of its magical properties and collapses in on itself all the way down to its base, leaving an incredibly deep pit in the Fogfen.</p></section>"

Yet, as with most rivers, predators lurk along these perilous banks. Night hags, astradaemons, devourers, and worse stalk the River, eager to pluck souls free and feed on them. Dread Nhimbaloth, the Empty Death, doesn’t deign to hunt the shores of the River of Souls alongside these predators—she instead feeds upon the predators themselves, reveling in consuming souls already being digested in the gullets of those who would deem themselves the apex hunters of the dead.</p><p>Nhimbaloth uses the shores of the River of Souls to manifest upon the universe’s countless worlds, but she can’t just do so whenever she wills it. Before the Empty Death can manifest within a world, it must first endure a cataclysm so vast that the outflow of the dead into the River of Souls weakens the boundaries between life and death. When such massive casualties sufficiently thin these borders, she can drift in through the cracks and stain what she finds. The resulting blurring between the River of Souls and its shore is metaphysically akin to the muddied boundary of a swamp. It’s no coincidence that when Nhimbaloth emerges into a world, she chooses to dwell in its remote swamplands. Nhimbaloth isn’t a glutton—she’s endlessly patient and can linger on a world for centuries before being noticed.</p><p>More often, her presence in an isolated swampland simply festers, turning a region of natural beauty into a dangerous fen that draws all manner of monsters to its fetid heart. Such lands call to will-o’-wisps; for these feeders of fears, the ruin wrought by the Empty Death is like a fine wine of unparalleled vintage. In time, many of these wisps realize the truth of the influence in their chosen haunts, and in most cases, these ravenous aberrations become Empty Death’s most fervent worshippers.</p><figure class=\"right\"><img src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/nhimbaloth.webp\" width=\"300\" /></figure><h1>Personification and Realm</h1><p>While Dread Nhimbaloth has no physical body of her own, she has been known to manifest a perceivable shape under the perfect conditions, growing visible after consuming a huge quantity of souls the way an empty glass’s contours becomes more defined once filled with liquid. In this form, Nhimbaloth appears as a twisting, melted mass of glistening blue fluid with eyes the shape of yellow four-pointed stars and a tangle of translucent tentacles extending in every direction. The tentacles’ tips split into seven smaller tendrils, and where these “hands” touch the world, they leave her mark behind—a ring of seven strange divots where vegetation refuses to grow, stone becomes chalky, and flesh festers as if it had forgotten how to heal. The position of the stars in the sky, the number of dead trapped within the swamp, and the time of year all seem to play a part in determining when this shadow of what might have once been Nhimbaloth’s body can appear, as does the presence of her cultists, but the manifestation rarely persists for long. Always, the manifestation ends in a sudden consumption from within when the Empty Death retreats to her domain, leaving behind a dead swampland of toxic waters and mindless undeath.</p><p>This form often appears in illustrations that depict the Empty Death, though Nhimbaloth is also portrayed as a ghostly human woman with a single yellow eye in the shape of a four-pointed star filling her otherwise blank face, and a long, writhing mane of ghostly, seven-fingered tentacles wraps around her nearly skeletal body in a smoky shroud. This version of her is surely the product of an artist’s nightmare, yet cults have adopted it as their own.</p><p>Nhimbaloth’s realm is a twofold domain. She uses the banks of the River of Souls as a hunting ground and a highway to travel from world to world, but supposedly dwells on a distant, dead planet. The name of this domain has been lost to time; the faithful of Nhimbaloth refer to it in whispers only as Voidbracken. Here, an ancient battle between Nhimbaloth and another power took place (most myths suggest her foe was Pharasma) that resulted in the destruction of the Empty Death’s body. This conflict didn’t result in her death, however, and her cult fondly views the event as an evolution—for without a body, she could now come and go as she pleased along the shores of the River of Souls. Voidbracken spins still in the Dark Tapestry, wandering aimlessly through the universe but driven always by Nhimbaloth’s will, and when it draws near an inhabited system, the souls of the living are drawn from their mortal shells in a cataclysm referred to in rare surviving accounts as the Deadtide. According to certain passages scribed in ancient texts like the Necronomicon, many of the Great Old Ones and Outer Gods must wait for the stars to align just right to manifest. This is quite literally true in Nhimbaloth’s case. Eventually, her Deadtides will claim enough lives so that Nhimbaloth’s death will die; the accumulated spiritual energy she has digested will ultimately undo her ancient defeat, allowing her to once more exist as a physical being.</p><p>She will rise from death hungrier than ever.</p><h1>Dogma and Worshippers</h1><p>Nhimbaloth’s creed and worship are entirely the product of her cultists, as the Empty Death has little interest in providing her worshippers with direct inspiration or direction. This tradition echoes the pattern established with all other cults centered on entities of the Elder Mythos who similarly care not for their worshippers. Because of this lack of divine direction, while their worshippers strive to accomplish specific goals, they aren’t limited by anathemas.</p><p>In Nhimbaloth’s case, her worshippers seek to create undead—particularly ghosts and other incorporeal creatures—to provide sustenance for their eldritch icon. They also feast upon carnivores at their ceremonies, aping Nhimbaloth’s predation upon soul-eating monsters. Her faith is all but unknown in urban areas, but in isolated swamp villages, worship of the Empty Death can suffuse entire settlements. In such instances, the cult typically builds the shell of a mainstream church to serve as a front and satisfy any curious outsiders passing through, while worshipping their goddess at a hidden location in the heart of the night.</p><p>Lower-level clerics of Nhimbaloth dress in whatever corpse’s attire is commonly used in their society’s burial rites, choosing to wear a “final suit” or “last gown” during their rituals in hopes that sweet oblivion might answer their prayers. Cult leaders, however, often eschew this tradition, instead wearing dark green or gray hooded robes adorned with tangled sheets of clinging moss and skull-shaped masks adorned with veils of additional moss. The cultists favor flails in combat; these weapons often have heads shaped into four-pointed stars with the flail’s chain attached to the center of the star and handles wrapped in moss and tanned flesh stripped from the dead.</p><p>Humanoids are far from the Empty Death’s only worshippers. As mentioned, will-o’-wisps and their kin find much to admire in the sinister aura Nhimbaloth’s presence brings to desolate swamplands, and it doesn’t take long for them to take up faith in the Empty Death, almost as if feeding on fear spurred by her influence infects the wisps with devotion to her faith. Marsh giants have also been known to venerate Nhimbaloth under names like “Bogmother,” “The Rushlight Woman,” “Swampfire Queen,” or the like, although they pray to her more as a patron of swampland than anything else. Vampiric mists commonly appear in her swamplands as well, and many scholars have nervously wondered about the implied connection between Nhimbaloth’s mark and the clusters of seven perfectly spaced punctures vampiric mists leave in the bodies of those they’ve fed upon through their misty tendrils.</p><h1>Temples and Shrines</h1><p>Often, the members of a cult of the Empty Death consist of the truly desperate, those with little money and less hope. They conduct their worship in their homes, or what passes as a home—partially collapsed shacks, abandoned barns, or even slumped survivalists’ shelters all suffice for the worship of Nhimbaloth. The rarer cults led by deviants of means construct larger structures to honor Nhimbaloth and often build these structures as mockeries of other churches by including stained glass windows, mosaics, and other works of art that honor the Outer Goddess. In such cases, the structure often serves a secondary purpose, such as a castle, a manor house, or the like. Curiously, these larger structures often share a particular feature: a tower that serves as a beacon or lighthouse as a way to honor will-o’-wisps, which the cult adore. To her followers, will-o’-wisps are Nhimbaloth’s eyes, and her gaze looks out upon the world through the lambent glow of these supernatural predators. A beacon or lighthouse in a temple thus symbolizes a will-o’-wisp, but also, they believe it gives Nhimbaloth a lens through which to gaze upon the world.</p><p>Nhimbaloth’s symbol is a skull with moss stuffed into its jaws, although her cultists often create variants of it as crude dolls or effigies of moss-caked bones and fragments of skulls. Temples that can afford to be open about their affiliation with the goddess often adorn their structures with skulls that have moss carefully grown into soggy, vermin-infested beards or with moss draperies that hang down over archways to form moist curtains in place of proper doors.</p><h1>A Priest's Role</h1><p>As with most cults of the Elder Mythos, the majority of Nhimbaloth’s devout don’t worship out of respect or adoration so much as fear. For them, the concept of death isn’t what evokes nightmare, but the fear of what judgment might await in the afterlife is what drives most to her faith. Those who have sinned, who have committed heresy against a prior faith, or who simply live in constant terror of what Pharasma might say to them when they reach her throne instead seek the oblivion offered by Nhimbaloth. They seek not to escape death or life, but to escape what they fear will be an even worse afterlife.</p><p>Yet this is not the only motive that draws worshippers to her fold. Some, rather than being driven by a fear of the afterlife, are enticed by the opportunity to bask in the misery and despair of others. These members are some of the most awful in the sect, for they use the promise of oblivion that Nhimbaloth offers to those who worship her as a lure to draw in the desperate to aid their own nefarious plots. Some seek to use these eager-for-oblivion zealots as disposable armies for acts of vengeance or rage; others draw upon these worshippers as sacrifices to fuel abhorrent rituals or to craft horrific magic items.</p><p>Even these predators of the desperate pale in comparison to the worst of Nhimbaloth’s worshippers—nihilists who fully understand the Empty Death and see in her the ultimate tool to destroy a world they’ve grown to loathe. For these cultists, nothing less than using the Voidbracken to bring a Deadtide upon their world will suffice. They might have a hidden plan to escape the world the moment all life is ended; they might even seek their own oblivion or believe that Nhimbaloth herself might reward them with dominion over a dead world. Regardless of their intent, these doomsday shepherds are the most dangerous of the Empty Death’s worshippers.</p><h1>Holidays</h1><p>Cults of Nhimbaloth that exist in small communities under the guise of a different religion take pains to observe that faith’s holidays if visitors or (more rarely) townsfolk don’t know their gathering’s true faith, but apart from that, worshippers of the Empty Death don’t observe regular holidays or religious festivals—with one unusual exception. The exact date on which Nhimbaloth’s body was taken from her and Voidbracken was denuded of life is unknown, so each cult chooses one day of import to observe this anniversary. The fact that no one knows the length of Voidbracken’s year makes this ritual even more arbitrary; regardless, her faithful believe that on one of these so-called Void Dawns, the sun won’t rise upon the world and all life will be snuffed in a Deadtide. Cultists celebrate the night leading to a Void Dawn with a gluttonous feast consisting of all manner of carnivores and monsters—meals they often make during the proceedings while the “food” still lives. When the sun inevitably rises, the cultists choose one of their own as the final feast in atonement for failing to bring the Deadtide to their world.</p><h1>Aphorisms</h1><p>Worshippers of Nhimbaloth fondly quote and recite their favorite tales from The Whispering Reeds, each of which has a number of memorable and haunting lines. However, a variant of an infamous quote from the Necronomicon particularly resonates with all of her worshippers.</p><p><em><strong>\"Long Dream the Dead, Yet Even Death Can Die\"</strong></em></p><p>To many, the notion of death is akin to an eternal slumber, a dawnless rest in which the soul experiences an afterlife in the way a sleeping person could dream several different lives in the span of a single night. Whether a dreamer wakes with the dawn or dies in their sleep, all dreams eventually come to an end. Just as when the Empty Death comes to call, even death knows oblivion—and even death may die.</p><h1>Holy Text</h1><p>Mentions of Nhimbaloth are rare, even for the esoteric topic of the Outer Gods. The dread Necronomicon mentions her, and certain translations of that book purportedly contain descriptions of her true form, which might be the only place where Nhimbaloth’s true form is set down in print. This information isn’t even present in the text most often associated with her worship: a rare tome called <em>The Whispering Reeds</em>.</p><p>The genesis of <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> lies not in those who worship the Empty Death, but in those who sought to oppose her. The book consists of stories, myths, parables, and encounters with Nhimbaloth gathered from hundreds of regions in dozens of worlds. The compiler’s name has been long forgotten, as they neglected to name themself in the text. This matters not to those who worship Nhimbaloth, nor does the fact that the author originally penned the book for the purpose of cataloging the ways in which Nhimbaloth’s influence could be opposed. The very act of collecting these old stories of the Empty Death brushing against the world had the opposite effect, and now, those who seek to draw their goddess’s attention to their world uses <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> to spread stories of her previous visits.</p><h1>Relations with Other Religions</h1><p>Nhimbaloth doesn’t consort with other gods, although often her visitations upon the wilderness force confrontations with other faiths. In particular, Gozreh and Desna oppose her influence—the former because of the proliferation of unnatural elements that taint swamplands, and the latter out of a mixture of anger and fear that her flock might stumble into Nhimbaloth’s clutches accidentally while exploring the wilds. The Eldest of the First World also oppose Nhimbaloth, whose parasitic tendrils can occasionally drift into that plane through fey gates and portals. Even after driving out the Empty Death, small cults of fey who have fallen under her sway inevitably remain.</p><p>Pharasma opposes Nhimbaloth for multiple reasons. Those who perish in lands haunted by the latter’s presence tend to rise as ghosts. Moreover, the Empty Death’s habit of consuming those ghosts has rightly angered Pharasma, for rather than being released to the Boneyard, the consumed souls simply disappear. One might assume that such an affront to the cycle of life and death would compel Pharasma into a direct confrontation with Nhimbaloth, and indeed, certain ancient texts tell of such a clash between the two goddesses at the very dawn of mortal civilization. The titanic battle left neither goddess the victor. Nhimbaloth learned to hide her predations upon the world so that even Pharasma can’t readily find her, and one particularly blasphemous tale in The Whispering Reeds speaks of a hidden scar that Pharasma bears to this day as a reminder of her failed attempt to decisively defeat the Empty Death—a scar, supposedly, in the pattern of seven divots of flesh where Nhimbaloth fed upon the essence of the Goddess of Death.</p><p>Whether or not this myth has any basis in fact, the faithful of Pharasma view Nhimbaloth and her cult with a combination of hatred and fearful respect. Only the most devout and powerful of Pharasma’s worshippers receive leave to hunt Nhimbaloth’s faithful, and they work hard to prevent lay worshippers from learning much of the Empty Death. Their justification—that Nhimbaloth feeds only on ghosts, and that by defeating or preventing the formation of theses undead, they strike blows against the Empty Death—reads to some as an excuse.</p><section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Nhimbaloth's Inspiration</h3><p>H. P. Lovecraft encouraged others to add to the mythos of eldritch beings he created to populate his weird fiction, and it was in this tradition that I first created Nhimbaloth as an antagonist for my own stories and roleplaying campaigns. Largely inspired by the mysterious horror lurking behind nature’s veil in Algernon Blackwood’s classic short story “The Willows,” and with some valuable advice on Outer God naming conventions from the fine folks at Chaosium, Nhimbaloth has become one of my proudest additions to the ever-expanding Lovecraft Mythos.</p><p><em><strong>- James Jacobs</strong></em></p></article></section>"

While many monsters beneath the citadel died, others have prospered, and now several communities of morlocks, urdefhans, ghouls, and stranger creatures call the dungeons home. Only the longest-lived remember any life other than the dungeons. Belcorra had bound several devils to serve her as overseers and administrators, and many of these still maintain order. Apart from the regions maintained by these devils and a drow outpost in one of the lowest levels, the Abomination Vaults are lawless and dangerous.</p><h2>Wandering Monsters</h2><p>While this book doesn’t present wandering monster tables for Abomination Vaults, the dungeon’s denizens still occasionally leave their homes! You can make the dungeon feel more dynamic by familiarizing yourself with each level’s denizens and then having them react to the party’s progression and presence. For example, if the heroes noisily explore an area, creatures in nearby rooms could come to investigate or perhaps set up an ambush. If the heroes decide to camp out in the dungeon rather than return to the safety of town, nearby creatures might visit or even attack their campsite while they rest. If the heroes clear out the denizens of a level and then return weeks later, they might find that new monsters have moved in. By keeping the inhabitants of the Abomination Vaults active, you can make the location feel all the more dangerous and unpredictable to your players.</p><h2>Gauntlight Lore</h2><p>The characters aren’t privy to information about Belcorra’s goals when the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path begins. Common knowledge about Gauntlight Keep can provide some clues, but in large part, the characters must explore the location to learn more. If the characters decide to take a bit of time in Otari—either before this campaign begins or during a visit to town to rest and recover—they can attempt to gather information about the site with a [[/check ability=charisma dc=12]] check, revealing one of the rumors listed below on a success. The GM can pick one that suits their interests or roll randomly, or even add new rumors of their own design. Succeeding by 5 or more reveals two rumors, and failing by 5 or more uncovers a false rumor of the GM’s invention (perhaps based on the common nursery rhyme @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.snj2fGhhuxfAInom]{here}). The point of these rumors is to spur interest in Gauntlight, and even a false rumor should drive the characters to investigate.</p><table><tbody><tr><th><p>[[/r 1d6]]</p></th><th><p>Rumor</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>“Kobolds live in the ruins—always have, always will.

The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path focuses almost entirely on the dungeon itself, and you can gloss over the details of trips between the dungeon and town as you see fit. If your players express interest in mixing things up, you can use some of the encounters or short adventures in the standalone Pathfinder Adventure: Troubles in Otari. That adventure presents additional content in the Otari hinterlands suitable for 2nd- to 4th-level characters and provides great ways to prepare heroes who need a bit of extra XP before they delve into the deeper, more dangerous levels of the Abomination Vaults.</p>"

Otari’s beginning is relatively recent and involved a few false starts along the way. When @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.snj2fGhhuxfAInom]{Belcorra Haruvex} arrived in the region in 4230 AR, drawn by a series of sinister visions, the coastal region was practically uninhabited. Here, she built @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.efRUYLBH9Kf3CLkX]{Gauntlight}, the keep surrounding the area, and the sprawling dungeons below the structure—without attracting notice. A group of adventurers known as the @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.Gx2mnbeUctXU7XUN]{Roseguard} eventually learned of Belcorra’s villainy and slew her, but at the cost of one of their own: a rogue named Otari Ilvashti.</p><h3>Early Otari (4244-4294 AR)</h3><p>Having lost both their friend and their taste for adventuring, the three surviving members of the Roseguard decided to retire. They spent much of their savings constructing several buildings and a sizable pier in a sheltered cove south of the site of their final battle. Since their lost friend’s fondest dream had been to settle down in a small seaside village, they named this new village after him.</p><p>For some decades, Otari prospered as a fishing village, though its population never grew beyond a hundred or so. The three surviving Roseguard adventurers lived to a ripe old age, ultimately passing away from natural causes—an accomplishment many adventurers never achieve.</p><h3>Decline (4290-4294 AR)</h3><p>With the passing of the last Roseguard, Aesephna Menhemes, in 4290 AR, Otari's fortunes began to dwindle. Within the span of a few years, its citizens had all drifted elsewhere, and by 4294 AR the town was entirely empty.</p><figure><img class=\"light-writer\" src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/dawnflower-night.webp\" width=\"700\" /></figure><h3>Stonescale Kobolds (4300-4310 AR)</h3><p>Otari lay abandoned for decades, before a group of kobolds called the Stonescales moved in. When the kobolds started luring in passing ships during bad weather to ambush their crews and steal their cargo, it didn't take long for new adventurers to arrive and vanquish them.</p><h3>Otari Rebuilt (4310-4721 AR)</h3><p>While the adventurers moved on soon thereafter, their backer, Maklanni Menhemes, remained behind. Maklanni, Aesephna's granddaughter, conceived a plan to revitalize Otari as a lumber town. It already contained dozens of buildings that only needed to be restored, after all, and the Osprey River remained ideal for a mill and lumberyard. However, one setback complicated Maklanni's plan- the steep slopes and cliffs surrounding Otari made transporting timber to the ocean difficult.</p><p>Maklanni's solution was ingenious- she constructed a wooden flume that allowed for the easy transport of lumber from the woods to her mill and, from there, down an astounding loading ramp that extended from the top of the 200-foot-tall cliff to the harbor below. The mill and flume made Maklanni wealthy and revitalized Otari, although it made her an enemy of the Kortos Consortium, which had a stranglehold on the island's lumber industry. Two other small lumber companies broke from the Kortos Consortium and settled in Otari as well, each paying for use of Maklanni's invention.</p><h3>Otari Today</h3><p>Today, Otari is a thriving settlement- the largest on the coast between Absalom and Diobel. Maklanni is long dead, but her descendant Oseph Menhemes carries on the family trade and also serves as the town's mayor. Unsavory representatives of the Kortos Consortium have secretly infiltrated Otari and seek to undermine the town's security. However, a far greater threat looms over the city: Belcorra has returned and is preparing to light the baleful fires of <em>Gauntlight</em> once again!</p><figure><img class=\"light-writer\" src=\"modules/dnd-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/otari-docks.webp\" width=\"700\" /></figure>"

Unlabeled buildings are wooden homes whose inhabitants work for nearby businesses or for one of the town's three lumber concerns.</p><h2>Location Statistics</h2><p>Many significant locations include a stat block that summarizes the site’s name, general function, and the DC of any ability checks the characters are likely to attempt there. The stat block also notes the shop’s address, wares and services for sale there (such as spellcasting services), and information about the most significant NPC who lives or works at the establishment. The NPC’s initial attitude toward the characters is also listed, along with skills most likely to be useful when interacting with the NPC.</p><aside class=\"av-float-block\"><h3>Side Quests</h3><p>Some of the locations in the Abomination Vaults list side quests the heroes can pick up, usually after interacting with an NPC or discovering a clue. If the heroes complete a side quest, they earn an XP award for a moderate accomplishment ([[/award 30xp]]) in addition to any rewards the side quest grants, such as treasure or useful information.</p></aside><h3>Earning Support</h3><p>If a character earns the support of an NPC, thereafter that NPC’s location supports the party in certain activities in between their other adventures. Earning an NPC’s support generally requires a PC to succeed on a [[/check skill=persuasion dc=15]] check to Influence them, and might also require completion of a listed task. The specific benefits are based on the location’s traits and are listed below. This support generally lasts throughout the campaign, although the GM might decide certain actions the characters take might cause them to lose a location’s support. The characters can be supported by multiple locations in town, so long as they make enough friends!</p><h3>Location Traits</h3><p>Some of these locations include traits which can be a useful shorthand for the kind of benefits that the heroes might get for earning the trust and support of the business owners.

To the west, the cliffside rises to meet a well-cared-for graveyard. To the east, a fantastic feat of engineering draws the eye—the trestle supporting a wooden loading chute extends down from the clifftop to a loading platform built into the harbor.

They are part of a larger set of lenses created to manipulate or even bind the Empty Death; most of the other lenses are long lost and likely destroyed. The Haruvex family came into possession of four lenses, and they knew that bringing them together focused Nhimbaloth’s attention in unprecedented and dangerous ways. Belcorra brought all four lenses to the Abomination Vaults with her, intending to install them in <em>Gauntlight</em> for her ultimate revenge upon Absalom. She also created a special receptacle called the <em>Fulcrum Lattice</em> to hold the lenses so their power could be focused together. Yet she realized the danger of keeping the Fulcrum Lenses too close together until the time was right; she spread them out among loyal groups in the Abomination Vaults’ lowest levels for safekeeping.</p><p>If the characters bring the other three lenses to bear against Belcorra, they can draw Nhimbaloth’s dread glare to the sorcerer. Loyal though Belcorra is, she cannot hope to keep her spirit intact when Nhimbaloth gazes directly upon it. The Fulcrum Lenses are more than mere receptacles of Nhimbaloth’s essence.

The last set of journals, then, are the actual adventure itself. These journals are organized by chapter, and you can find them in the Journals tab of the right-hand sidebar. The headers in the @UUID[JournalEntry.huN2s6RInuTublnV.JournalEntryPage.8aIgvvxLjsYxB1LS]{Chapter Synopses} page also each link to their corresponding journal.</p><p>Each chapter's journal entry contains all essential story and plot events for that chapter, arranged in the same order as they appear in the book. Typically, they start with an overview of that chapter's key plot elements, then go on to include room-by-room descriptions that detail every creature, event, or item that the players might find within.</p><h2>Beginning the Adventure</h2><p>The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path focuses primarily on the sprawling dungeon complex, and this campaign begins as the heroes approach the aboveground @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.efRUYLBH9Kf3CLkX]{Gauntlight Ruins} for the first time. Their mutual friend, @UUID[Actor.ZDYMKYZVyR8Fqakp]{Wrin Sivinxi}, has already briefed them about her sighting of a strange glow atop the ruin’s towering lighthouse. From Otari, no one other than Wrin can make out this glow, but if the heroes look up at night from the immediate environs, they can confirm what Wrin’s supernaturally acute eyes<span style=\"font-family:var(--main-font)\"> picked out from town—the top of the lighthouse does indeed glow a faint, eerie blue after dark.</span></p><p>Of course, you don’t have to start this campaign on the literal front porch of the dungeon—if you wish, you can ease the heroes by roleplaying their initial encounter with Wrin (perhaps as she gives them an astrology reading), or after the heroes spend time in town involving some last-minute shopping or a trip to a tavern. In this case, consult the @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.7WZr8QhFOSrHPTgU]{Otari Gazetteer} or @UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.raJDQ95RBqeXxV14]{Wrin's biography}, but the fun doesn't truly begin until the heroes head up the Gaunt Trail to the foreboding ruins in Fogfen!</p><p></p><section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Content Warning:</h3><p>While Abomination Vaults contains typical Pathfinder action and adventure, it also presents themes of suicide, ableism, body horror, and human experimentation. Before you begin, understand that player consent (including that of the Game Master) is vital to a safe and fun play experience for everyone. You should talk with your players before beginning and modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate.</p></article></section>"

              "text": "<h2>Using Experience Points</h2><p>While each level of the Abomination Vaults is built with the assumption of a group of characters at a particular character level (in each case, the expected character level is the same as the dungeon level), each level holds more than enough encounters for a party to level up. The characters don’t need to explore everything for the campaign to stay on track. Indeed, part of the joy of a large dungeon crawl is the exploration of every nook and cranny, and a party who faces every encounter might gain enough experience points to reach higher levels well before the end of this Adventure Path—and that’s fine! Some later encounters challenge a high-level party well enough, even if the characters have to retreat, rest, and recover less often.</p><p>The dungeon provides lots of freedom to explore, particularly in the middle levels, where a massive spiral stair provides easy access. Let the players gauge whether their characters are in over their heads and retreat (or flee!) if the situation demands it.</p><p>Some gaming groups prefer to have their advancement happen at natural story breaks, rather than tracking XP for every encounter they overcome. This type of story- based progression can be tricky for a giant dungeon crawl, however, since the characters can move between levels through multiple routes. If as the GM you prefer story-based progression, don’t just allow the characters to automatically level up simply because they quickly reached a lower dungeon level. Consider requiring them to complete specific milestones to level up, as detailed in @UUID[JournalEntry.huN2s6RInuTublnV.JournalEntryPage.8aIgvvxLjsYxB1LS]{Chapter Synopses}.</p><p>The final three levels are where the story of the Abomination Vaults comes to its head. It’s critical that the characters discover the three <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.67686KaEPc6XAlKJ.JournalEntryPage.azMqL6C2NvazTcRE]{Fulcrum Lenses}</em> in the lower levels and learn how they work—specifically, how they can permanently destroy Belcorra. Yet Belcorra has more freedom to harry the characters throughout these lower levels, and by the time they face her in the Empty Vault, they’ve earned her ire. With luck, the characters can defeat Belcorra and topple <em>Gauntlight</em>!</p>"

These can be identified with reasonable ease by matching the name to the journal entry for an area. While these entries are not named to match exactly, it should be clear which is which.</p><p>Most scenes have several key musical themes tied with ambience tracks, each balanced carefully and set to play simultaneously in order to build the soundscape for that area.</p><p>If you find the music or a soundscape is becoming repetitive, the playlist folder \"All Floors\" contains music and ambiences you can use to bring a different feeling to an area.</p><h3>Recurring Themes</h3><p>The playlists provided include, and reuse, a number of recurring themes to let you build auditory reminders for your players. For example, whenever a scene involves Belcorra Haruvex, one of her golems, or a particularly potent remnant of her past, a playlist will begin with \"Belcorra Warning\". In places where the essence of Nhimbaloth has had an effect, the audio track \"What Do We Say to the Empty Death\" has likely been left as an ambient sound source on the scene - albeit quiet enough that only the most attentive player should notice it. Throughout the first four floors, Volluk's theme: The Worms March (or Waltz of the Worms) has been woven into the playlists to represent his involvement in that particular sideplot. Making liberal (but subtle) use of tracks like these will help elicit a response in your players when they reach an inevitable combat where the theme is used as they face their foe.</p><section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Ambient Sound Sources</h2><p><a class=\"entity-link\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/ambient-sound/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em class=\"fas fa-book\"> </em>Knowledge Base: Ambient Sounds</a></p></header><article><p>Throughout the adventure, each scene has at least two pre-placed ambient sound sources.

Ambient sound sources give your players audio clues in proximity to their tokens, and it is important as a GM to know when they will be experiencing those sounds. Before your sessions start, take a moment and familiarize yourself with the sounds your players may experience by checking the Ambient Sound Controls.</p><p>You can stop an ambient sound source from emanating its sound by right clicking it from the sound layer at any time.</p></article></section><h2>Using Combat Music</h2><p>While only a few combat audio tracks have been provided for normal combat encounters, there is also a list of 'major encounter' music tracks which can be leveraged in more serious fights. While a number of these have been chosen for specific encounters, we encourage you to create your own combat soundscapes with the tools available. However, use some caution---due to the use of recurring themes as mentioned above, overexposure to particular tracks may have a negative effect on the sound experience for the adventure. Always know what your players are going to hear (and how loudly) before you play it.</p><h2>Using Ambient Silence</h2><p>A few key places use playlists that do not come coupled with music, by design. These are meant to give a GM opportunity to use the silence as a cue of danger in and of itself. To maximize impact, you are encouraged to use the pause button on a playlist to bring your players warning of an imminent danger, or a feeling of being watched. </p><p>In the depths of the Abomination Vaults, there are dangers around every corner and sometimes a well placed silence can be enough to make your players consider turning back.</p>"

              "text": "<p>Throughout this adventure, the heroes might come across keys they can use to open doors and other locks throughout the dungeon. You can keep track of which keys they have discovered with the items which are linked in the room description journals. However, the key's description won't tell you which doors it opens- only the room it was found in. This is because you may not want to reveal to your players which doors the key opens as soon as they find the key.</p><p>Instead, we have collected all of that information into one place on this page. If you'd like, you could also use this handout to keep track of which keys the heroes have and have not yet found.</p><table><thead><tr><th><p>Key</p></th><th><p>Found in Area</p></th><th><p>Opens lock in Area</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><figure><img src=\"icons/sundries/misc/key-ring-gold.webp\" width=\"48\" /><figcaption>@Item[jDszN0s4ucrnNhc9]{Rusted Ring of Keys}</figcaption></figure></td><td><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.kDJSn9wbVvjnqYEj.JournalEntryPage.l1967pkknJ7ifjTc]{A13.
