        "Customizing Your Origin": {
          "name": "Customizing Your Origin",
          "text": "<p>At 1st level, you choose various aspects of your character, including ability scores, race, class, and background. Together these elements help paint a picture of your character’s origin and give you the ability to create many different types of characters. Despite that versatility, a D&amp;D race that has the Ability Score Increase trait includes little or no choice—a lack that can make it difficult to realize certain character concepts. The following subsections address that lack by adding choice to your character’s race, allowing you to customize your ability scores, languages, and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have in mind for your character.</p><h2>Ability Score Increases</h2><p>The Ability Score Increase trait in a race reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in the adventurers of this kind in D&amp;D’s past. For example, if you’re a dwarf, your Constitution increases by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&amp;D are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn’t apply to every dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it’s unhelpful if your character doesn’t conform to the archetype.</p><p>If you’d like your character to follow their own path, you may alter your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here’s how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can’t apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can’t increase a score above 20.</p><p>For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.</p><h2>Languages</h2><p>If your character’s race has the Languages trait, that trait includes languages that your character is assumed to know, usually Common and the language of your ancestors. For example, a halfling adventurer is assumed to know Common and Halfling. Here’s the thing: D&amp;D adventurers are extraordinary, and your character might have grown up speaking languages different from the ones in your Languages trait.</p><p>To customize the languages you know, you may replace each language in your Languages trait with a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.</p><p>Your DM may add or remove languages from that list, depending on what languages are appropriate for your campaign.</p><h2>Proficiencies</h2><p>Some races that include the Ability Score Increase trait also grant proficiencies. These proficiencies are usually cultural, and your character might not have any connection with the culture in question or might have pursued different training. You can replace each of those proficiencies with a different one of your choice, following the restrictions on the Proficiency Swaps table.</p><div><table><caption><h3 class=\"compendium-hr heading-anchor\" id=\"ProficiencySwaps\" data-content-chunk-id=\"66ad9696-49d5-48ff-9a6f-b496804158bf\">Proficiency Swaps</h3></caption><thead><tr><th>Proficiency</th><th>Replacement Proficiency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Skill</td><td>Skill</td></tr><tr><td>Armor</td><td>Simple/martial weapon or tool</td></tr><tr><td>Simple weapon</td><td>Simple weapon or tool</td></tr><tr><td>Martial weapon</td><td>Simple/martial weapon or tool</td></tr><tr><td>Tool</td><td>Tool or simple weapon</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>For example, high elf adventurers have proficiency with longswords, which are martial weapons. Consulting the Proficiency Swaps table, we see that your high elf can swap that proficiency for proficiency with another weapon or a tool. Your elf might be a musician, who chooses proficiency with a musical instrument—a type of tool—instead of with longswords. Similarly, elves start with proficiency in the &amp;Reference[Perception] skill. Your elf might not have the keen senses associated with your kin and could take proficiency in a different skill, such as &amp;Reference[Performance].</p><p>The “Equipment” chapter of the Player's Handbook includes weapons and tools suitable for these swaps, and your DM might allow additional options.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>The description of a race might suggest various things about the behavior and personality of that people’s archetypal adventurers. You may ignore those suggestions, whether they’re about alignment, moods, interests, or any other personality trait. Your character’s personality and behavior are entirely yours to determine.</p><aside class=\"notable\"><h3>Custom Lineage</h3><p>Instead of choosing one of the game’s races for your character at 1st level, you can use the following traits to represent your character’s lineage, giving you full control over how your character’s origin shaped them:</p><p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a humanoid. You determine your appearance and whether you resemble any of your kin.</p><p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Small or Medium (your choice).</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> One ability score of your choice increases by 2.</p><p><strong>Feat.</strong> You gain one feat of your choice for which you qualify.</p><p><strong>Variable Trait.</strong> You gain one of the following options of your choice: (a) &amp;Reference[darkvision] with a range of 60 feet or (b) proficiency in one skill of your choice.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.</p><p>Your race is considered to be a Custom Lineage for any game feature that requires a certain race, such as elf or dwarf.</p></aside>"

          "name": "Changing a Skill",
          "text": "<p>Sometimes you pick a skill proficiency that ends up not being very useful in the campaign or that no longer fits your character’s story. In those cases, talk to your DM about replacing that skill proficiency with another skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level. A convenient time for such a change is when you reach a level that grants you the Ability Score Increase feature, representing that your character has spent a level or two studying the new skill and letting the old one atrophy.</p>"

        "Changing Your Subclass": {
          "name": "Changing Your Subclass",
          "text": "<p>Each character class involves the choice of a subclass at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass represents an area of specialization and offers different class features as you level up. With your DM’s approval, you can change your subclass when you would normally gain a new subclass feature. If you decide to make this change, choose another subclass that belongs to your class and replace all your old subclass features with the features of the new subclass that are for your new level and lower.</p><h2>Training Time</h2><p>To change your subclass, your DM might require you to spend time devoted to the transition, as you study the ways of the new specialization. This transition requires a number of days equal to twice your new level in the class; a higher level represents more to learn.</p><p>The DM might also require an expenditure of money to pay for training, magical reagents, or other goods needed for the transition. The cost is typically 100 gp times your new level. This cost might be accompanied by a quest of some sort. For example, a sorcerer who wants to adopt a Draconic Bloodline could be required to receive blood, a blessing, or both from an ancient dragon.</p><p>If you return to a subclass that you previously held, you forgo the gold cost, and the time required for the transition is halved.</p><h2>Sudden Change</h2><p>Sometimes a character undergoes a dramatic transformation in their beliefs and abilities. When a character experiences a profound self-realization or faces an entity or a place of overwhelming power, beauty, or terror, the DM might allow an immediate subclass change. Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li>An Oath of Devotion paladin failed to stop a demonic horde from ravaging her homeland. After spending a night in sorrowful prayer, she rises the next morning with the features of the Oath of Vengeance, ready to hunt down the horde.</li><li>A wizard lies down for a nap beneath an oak tree whose roots reach into the Feywild. In his dreams, he faces visions of multiple possible futures. When he awakens, his subclass features have been replaced by those of the School of Divination.</li><li>A cleric of the War Domain has spent years in conflict with the enemies of her temple. But one day, she wanders into a sun-dappled glade, where her god once shed a tear of mercy over the world’s suffering. Drinking from the glade’s brook, the cleric is filled with such compassion for all people that she now bears the powers of the Life Domain, ready to heal rather than make war.</li></ul>"

          "text": "<p>The following sections present several group patron options. The description of each patron provides an overview of the types of organizations the group patron represents, perks of membership, and quests the patron encourages adventurers to undertake.</p><p>With the input of your DM, you can customize these patrons to reflect specific establishments in your campaign world or to serve as a launchpad tailored for organizations of your design. For example, the guild group patron could represent the Harpers or the Zhentarim of the Forgotten Realms, the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild in Eberron, or a homebrew league of caravan guards. Or perhaps a criminal syndicate, military force, or other category of patron better fits the party’s goals. Choose and customize the group patron that works best for your party and the types of adventures you want to explore.</p><h2>Group Assistance</h2><p>Having a group patron gives an adventuring group a common purpose, which inspires better coordination in the form of guidance and encouragement. As a result of this unity, each member of the party can grant advantage to an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw of another member of the party. To grant advantage in this way, a character and the chosen target must be able to see or hear each other, and neither can be incapacitated. Once a party member grants this advantage, that individual can’t do so again until they finish a long rest.</p><h2>Perks</h2><p>A group patron offers your party a number of perks for your service. These range from standard business arrangements, such as a steady wage and access to staff facilities, to extraordinary boons, such as audiences with powerful figures or exceptions from certain laws. Specific perks are presented in the description of each group patron.</p><p>The DM should not feel limited to providing only the perks noted in each group patron’s description. Patrons give a party access to solutions and support they wouldn’t have otherwise, and a patron can use their varied resources to guide their agents or prepare them for greater adventures.</p><h2>Assignments</h2><p>A more hands-off patron can still significantly motivate your group. Maybe you seek adventures based on what pleases your patron, possibly earning status and rewards within your organization. An academy, for example, might not organize particular missions, so you hunt down ancient artifacts knowing that your patron will reward you for bringing them back. You have the freedom to chart your own destiny, while letting the patron shape the nature of your group and the adventures you undertake.</p>"

Founding your own organization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though potentially at the cost of support and reliable work.</p><p>When you’re the boss, the perks of belonging to an organization become expenses you have to worry about; when you run your own mercenary company, for example, you need to stock your own armory, rather than drawing on an existing organization’s stockpile. The organization brings in income, but you’ll have to spend it to keep the organization running.</p><p>When you run your own organization, use the Running a Business downtime activity (described in the Dungeon Master's Guide) to reflect your organization’s ongoing activities. More than one character can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling to determine the business’s performance, add the total days spent by the characters to the roll to determine the business’s success (still observing the maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, multiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who took part in this downtime activity.</p><p>Don’t discount the value of adopting an NPC to serve as your contact within your own organization.

Others root out heretics, real or imagined, to demonstrate the primacy of their deity.</p><p>The Religious Order Quests table presents a few examples of how you can honor and serve your deity.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-tables.RollTable.tcoeReligiousQue]</p>"

They want to extract information, secure aid, win someone’s trust, escape punishment, avoid combat, negotiate a treaty, or achieve whatever other objective led to the interaction in the first place. The creatures they interact with also have agendas.</p><p>Some DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a free-form roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come into play. Other DMs prefer to resolve the outcome of an interaction by having characters make Charisma checks. Either approach works, and most games fall somewhere in between, balancing player skill (roleplaying and persuading) with character skill (reflected by ability checks).</p><h2>Resolving Interactions</h2><p>The Player’s Handbook provides guidelines for balancing roleplaying and ability checks in a social interaction (see chapter 8, \"Adventuring\"). This section adds to that material by providing a structured way to resolve a social interaction. Much of this structure will be invisible to your players in play and isn’t meant to be a substitute for roleplaying.</p><h3>1. Starting Attitude</h3><p>Choose the starting attitude of a creature the adventurers are interacting with: friendly, indifferent, or hostile.</p>"

A creature’s indifference doesn’t necessarily make it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent creatures might be polite and genial, surly and irritable, or anything in between. A successful Charisma check is necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an indifferent creature to do something.</p>"

For example, a condescending noble might wish to see a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep them from becoming rivals for the king’s attention, thwarting them with slander and scheming rather than direct threats and violence. The adventurers need to succeed on one or more challenging Charisma checks to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their behalf. That said, a hostile creature might be so ill-disposed toward the party that no Charisma check can improve its attitude, in which case any attempt to sway it through diplomacy fails automatically.</p>"

Likewise, a gaffe, insult, or harmful deed might make a friendly creature temporarily indifferent or turn an indifferent creature hostile.</p><p>Whether the adventurers can shift a creature’s attitude is up to you. You decide whether the adventurers have successfully couched their statements in terms that matter to the creature. Typically, a creature’s attitude can’t shift more than one step during a single interaction, whether temporarily or permanently.</p>"

If they want to shift a creature’s attitude by playing on these characteristics, they first need to determine what the creature cares about. They can guess, but doing so runs the risk of shifting the creature’s attitude in the wrong direction if they guess badly.</p><p>After interacting with a creature long enough to get a sense of its personality traits and characteristics through conversation, an adventurer can attempt a [[/check skill=ins]] check to uncover one of the creature’s characteristics. You set the DC. A check that fails by 10 or more might misidentify a characteristic, so you should provide a false characteristic or invert one of the creature’s existing characteristics. For example, if an old sage’s flaw is that he is prejudiced against the uneducated, an adventurer who badly fails the check might be told that the sage enjoys personally seeing to the education of the downtrodden.</p><p>Given time, adventurers can also learn about a creature’s characteristics from other sources, including its friends and allies, personal letters, and publicly told stories. Acquiring such information might be the basis of an entirely different set of social interactions.</p>"

Any character who has actively participated in the conversation can make the check. Depending on how the adventurers handled the conversation, the [[/check skill=per]], [[/check skill=dec]], or [[/check skill=itm]] skill might apply to the check.

If a helping character says or does something that would influence the interaction in a positive way, the character making the Charisma check can do so with advantage. If the other character inadvertently says something counterproductive or offensive, the character making the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check.</p><h4>Multiple Checks</h4><p>Certain situations might call for more than one check, particularly if the adventurers come into the interaction with multiple goals.</p>"

Use your best judgment. For example, if the party’s rogue says something that pushes a noble’s attitude toward the party from indifferent to hostile, another character might be able to diffuse the noble’s hostility with clever roleplaying and a successful [[/check per]] check.</p>"

You can also request that the sovereign grant you access to perks of their position, like access to diplomatic receptions or use of the royal guards.</p><p><em><strong>Expenses.</strong></em> Your patron reimburses you for extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. You are required to account for your expenses and must explain any extraordinary expenditures, but routine travel, ordinary equipment, and basic services don’t draw a second glance.</p><p><em><strong>Immunity.</strong></em> As long as you remain in the sovereign’s good graces, you are nearly immune to prosecution under the laws within their sphere of influence. When you are carrying out your orders, you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to go about that, and the law isn’t an obstacle.

What use is magic if you can’t harness it to amuse your mom?</p><p><cite>Tasha</cite></p></blockquote><p>Just as every performer lends their art a personal flair and every warrior asserts their fighting styles through the lens of their own training, so too can a spellcaster use magic to express their individuality. Regardless of what type of spellcaster you’re playing, you can customize the cosmetic effects of your character’s spells. Perhaps you wish the effects of your caster’s spells to appear in their favorite color, to suggest the training they received from a celestial mentor, or to exhibit their connection to a season of the year. The possibilities for how you might cosmetically customize your character’s spells are endless. However, such alterations can’t change the effects of a spell. They also can’t make one spell seem like another—you can’t, for example, make a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{magic missile} look like a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{fireball}.</p><p>When customizing your spellcaster’s magic, consider developing a theme—often, the broader and more versatile the better. You may describe your caster’s magic whenever you wish, particularly when it makes an interesting addition to a story. You may also use it to reinforce other choices you’ve made for your character, like making a bard’s spells tied more closely to their favored art form or a cleric’s spells themed around their deity.</p><p>For example, the fireball of a wizard with a fondness for storms might erupt to look like burning clouds or a burst of red lightning (without affecting the spell’s damage type), while the same wizard’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Szvk5FEVQW3uhJi5]{haste} spell might limn the target in faint thunderheads.</p><p>Alternatively, a cleric who serves a moon god might radiate faint moonlight around their hands when they cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{cure wounds}, or their @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jZ6JNykRtdQ90MOo]{shield of faith} might surround the target with glimmering crescent moons.</p><p>Further still, a druid could choose a cherry blossom theme for their magic, causing delicate branches and pink leaves to grow when they cast @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.gMrWeG8fMDPRFiVe]{entangle} or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.VzgFzcmocr1X1cp4]{shillelagh}, and their @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.nqBDWkVOfcGZt4YU]{faerie fire} spell could appear more like wind-tossed petals than flames.</p><p>The Magic Themes table offers just a few suggestions that might inspire you while personalizing your character’s spells.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-tables.RollTable.tcoeMagicThemes0 caption=false]</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-tashas-cauldron.tcoe-content.JournalEntry.tcoeCh3ArtHandou.JournalEntryPage.s5TfYGjX3eDqVYOu]</p>"

That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn’t explicitly say otherwise.</p></div></div><p>The game also includes elements—class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee weapon attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.</p><h2>3. Advantage and Disadvantage</h2><p>Even if more than one factor gives you advantage or disadvantage on a roll, you have it only once, and if you have advantage and disadvantage on the same roll, they cancel each other.</p><h2>4. Reaction Timing</h2><p>Certain game features let you take a special action, called a reaction, in response to an event. Making opportunity attacks and casting the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.z1mx84ONwkXKUZd7]{shield} spell are two typical uses of reactions. If you’re unsure when a reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here’s the rule: the reaction happens after its trigger, unless the description of the reaction explicitly says otherwise. Once you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>5. Proficiency Bonus</h2><p>If your proficiency bonus applies to a roll, you can add the bonus only once to the roll, even if multiple things in the game say your bonus applies. Moreover, if more than one thing tells you to double or halve your bonus, you double it only once or halve it only once before applying it. Whether multiplied, divided, or left at its normal value, the bonus can be used only once per roll.</p><h2>6. Bonus Action Spells</h2><p>If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 bonus action, remember that you can’t cast any other spells before or after it on the same turn, except for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action.</p><h2>7. Concentration</h2><p>As soon as you start casting a spell or using a special ability that requires concentration, your concentration on another effect ends instantly.</p><h2>8. Temporary Hit Points</h2><p>Temporary hit points aren’t cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don’t add them together, unless a game feature says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep.</p><h2>9. Round Down</h2><p>Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p><h2>10. Have Fun</h2><p>You don’t need to know every rule to enjoy D&amp;D, and each group has its own style—different ways it likes to tell stories and to use the rules. Embrace what your group enjoys most. In short, follow your bliss!</p><blockquote class=\"tasha\"><p>My dear, sweet, lucky reader,</p><p>You know me. You’ve heard of my exploits. You’ve spread my titles: Natasha the Dark, Hura of Ket, Baba Yaga’s daughter, witch par excellence, and, if you’re not trying to impress, just plain Tasha.</p><p>For longer than I care to confess, I’ve sought out mysteries and wonders that beggar description. (Well, wonders that beggar the descriptions of those not raised in an immortal’s dancing hut, as I was.) Within this tome, you’ll find a sampling of the curiosities I’ve documented during my travels, including my exploits with the infamous Company of Seven; my studies with the original Mad Archmage, Zagig Yragerne; and my correspondences with world-hopping (and sanctimonious) luminaries like Mordenkainen. Unfortunately, at Mordenkainen’s request, a panel of experts from the Greyhawk Guild of Wizardry—which I’m assured is an esteemed center of learning and not at all an elaborate scam to swindle highborn rubes—has been granted editorial oversight of this work. As a result, I understand that some of my “less traditional” findings have been saddled with various rules, for the supposed “safe continuance of the mystical arts and, indeed, all life in the multiverse.”</p><p>No matter. Through a combination of irrefutable arguments and spells, I’ve convinced the editorial board to furnish me with this advance copy of their work.</p><p>In reviewing it, I’ve added a variety of helpful marginalia. I expect that—with the inclusion of my insights, guidance, threats, and critiques—clever minds will have all they need to advance their accounting of the multiverse’s infinite audacities. And even if not, read on and maybe you’ll learn something my archmage semi-peers are terrified of you learning.</p><p>I’m drawing back the curtain of reality for you, reader dearest. Summon your courage, and take a peek.</p><p><cite>Tasha</cite></p></blockquote>"
