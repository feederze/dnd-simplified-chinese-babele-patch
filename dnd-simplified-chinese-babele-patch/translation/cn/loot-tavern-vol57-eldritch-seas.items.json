      "description": "<div>\n\n\nProsthetic, uncommon</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/damage 1d6]] bludgeoning  - Hookshot (20 ft.), Launch ([[/damage 1d6]] B, 20 ft.)\n\n\n<hr />\n<p>9 out of 10 captains agree that hooks are so last century. This practical prosthesis for the modern pirate will get you pillaging and plundering at twice the usual rate—hook, line, and anchor!</p><p><i><b>Prosthesis Properties.</b></i> This prosthesis can replace or enhance an arm. It has the Hookshot (<b>20 feet</b>) and Launch (<b>[[/damage 1d6]]</b> bludgeoning, <b>20 feet</b>) properties, and the Trip Superior Strike.</p><p><i><b>Improved Hookshot.</b></i> As an action while the hook is attached to a target, you can reel yourself in. When you do, you move a number of feet up to the item's Hookshot range in a straight line towards the hook. In addition, the DC of the ability check required to forcefully detach the hook is <b>13</b>.</p><p><i><b>Hoist the Sail.</b></i> When you reel yourself towards a creature using the Improved Hookshot property, you can choose to hoist the sail on the prosthesis, reeling even faster and creating an opportunity for you to strike. At the end of your movement, you can make one melee weapon attack as part of the action used to reel yourself in. Once this property of the item has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><i><b>Anchor-Clanker.</b></i> While the prosthesis' hook is attached to a creature, that creature's speed is reduced by <b>10 feet</b>.</p><p><i><b>Hookshot (X ft.).</b></i> This enhancement consists of a metallic hook or similar tool attached to a spool of chain, rope, or wire. The number in parentheses is the range of the hookshot. If the prosthesis isn’t being used to hold an item, you can shoot the hook at a fixed surface within range as a bonus action, or as a reaction when falling. The hook then attaches to that surface until you use a bonus action to detach the hook and reel the rope back in, or until the rope is destroyed. The rope is an object with AC 10 and 10 hit points.</p><p>Alternatively, you can fire the hook at another creature at least two sizes larger than you, making an attack roll with the prosthesis. You’re considered proficient with the attack, which uses your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack roll. On a hit, it deals no damage, but the hook attaches to the target. A creature within 5 feet of the hook can use an action to forcefully detach the hook with a successful DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check.</p><p>While the hook is attached, you have advantage on ability checks made to move along the rope, such as to climb a vertical surface, swim against a current, or walk against a strong wind, and you can’t move or be moved more than the hookshot’s range away from the point to which the hook is attached. If you’re falling, you stop falling further than the range at which you shot the hookshot and become suspended from the surface the hook is attached to. In addition, until the hook is reeled back in, the prosthesis can’t hold anything or be used to make attacks, and you can’t use or benefit from objects integrated into the prosthesis (such as attacking with a weapon or benefiting from a shield’s bonus to AC).</p><p><i><b>Launch (XdX, X ft.).</b></i> A portion of this prosthesis is attached to the limb by a length of chain, rope, or wire, and can be launched at an enemy. If the prosthesis has the Hookshot property, the hook is the same piece that gets launched as a weapon. The prosthesis is a ranged weapon that uses your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. If you’re proficient with a weapon that has the thrown property, you’re considered proficient with this weapon. The portion of the prosthetic used to attack is automatically reeled in immediately after. The information in parentheses notes the attack’s damage dice, damage type, and range, respectively.</p>"

When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If your attunement to the tattoo ends, it vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.</p><p><i><b>Inky Tendril.</b></i> As an action while the tattoo is on your skin, you can speak the tattoo's command word, causing the ink of the tattoo to protrude as a jet-black tentacle or to retract back onto your skin. The tentacle has a reach of <b>15 feet</b>, and you can use it, as a bonus action, to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial.
