      "description": "<p>Greetings, hunter! What you have here is a monster hunt from <em>Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting</em>. Heliana's hunts require your players to find the monster, picking up clues along the way, and then defeat it in an epic multi-wave boss battle. Be<strong> really obvious</strong> with the clues; make sure to give out the associated handouts. After the clues have been collected, but before the boss fight begins, the players should always have a chance to long rest and use what they've learned to prepare for the fight ahead.</p><p></p><p>This hunt makes full use of the Tracking, Harvesting, Crafting, and Cooking rules from Heliana's—be sure to read up on those! Using the Cooking rules to prepare magical meals is a great way the players can monopolise on the clues! Each of these Foundry Adventures comes with:</p><ul><li><p>PDF of the hunt.</p></li><li><p>Three clue handouts to be given to the players before they meet the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Handouts of the fantastical things the players might see along the way.</p></li><li><p>Walled and lit scenes, with each wave's monsters separated by level.</p></li><li><p>Actors with original tokens.</p></li><li><p>Lair actions given their own actor (be sure to put it at initiative count 20!).</p></li><li><p>Magic items that can be found during the hunt, as well as those that can be crafted from the boss monster.</p></li><li><p>Spells that the monsters and magic items use.</p><p></p></li></ul><p>This hunt, <em>The Veiled Lady</em>, is intended for 3 to 7 characters and is optimised for a party of 4 with an average party level (APL) of <strong>4</strong>, <strong>10</strong>, or <strong>15</strong>. Characters who complete this hunt should earn enough experience to progress one-quarter of the way to 5th level, one-third of the way to 10th level, or one-half of the way to 15th level. The adventurers must investigate a strange rot that has infested a town, ruining the crops, killing the livestock, but leaving the townsfolk strangely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>After gathering information about this rot, the adventurers must delve into a cave system connected to the town’s sewers. Here, the fungal colony has its lair, which forms the setting of a two-wave boss battle. This battle is <strong>deadly</strong> and uses the party’s entire daily XP budget. Equipment for an extended fight, spells and effects that deal radiant damage, and proficiency in the Nature skill will aid the party in this endeavour.</p>",

Some of these individuals may remember the spells they knew in life, but, for the most part, this connection with the Weave is co-opted to provide the colony access to charm-based magics. Sporeslingers use these beguiling enchantments to capture stray creatures and deliver them to the fungal heart where they too can be hyphanated. Without these specimens, a hive mind would have to rely on serendipity to gather new biomass. With them, it can take a more proactive approach.</p><p><em><strong>Self-preservation.</strong></em> A hyphan hive mind is far from stupid. It understands the fragility and value of a sporeslinger. A sporeslinger possesses the ability to produce clouds of obscuring spores (from which to make its escape) and is rarely found alone. On diplomatic missions they may be accompanied by brutes, for their intimidating size. When laying a trap, a sporeslinger may stand alone in a field of barely-visible puffball toadstools, several duskcaps lying in wait in the shadows.</p>",

The first rot caused a plague, killing scores of townsfolk. The second targeted cellulose, decimating the local woodland and laying waste to many of the townsfolk’s houses. This third rot targets beasts and crops: half of the town’s livestock and harvest have been ruined in the fortnight since it was first detected.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Squeeze_104-\">During each rot, the town’s mayor has contacted Heliana, who has dutifully sent an adventuring party in response. These parties tracked the rot to the sewers but were infested by the Veiled Lady. The Lady read the adventurers’ minds and learned of the potential conflict the colony’s actions would bring about if it continued destroying the town above. In an effort to ensure its preservation, the colony changed its physiology and tactics to target different food sources. In a further act of subterfuge, the Veiled Lady returned one fungus-infested adventurer from each party to Heliana, where they explained that “there was nothing out of the ordinary.”</span></p>"
