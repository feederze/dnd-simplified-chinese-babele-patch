    "School of Gastronomy": {
      "name": "School of Gastronomy",
      "description": "<p>Gastronomy, the oft-satirized subschool of food-related magic, is rarely taught to wizardly apprentices, for even masters of transmutation can be terrible at cuisine. However, gastronomy is a truly nourishing magic which spans all cultures and is more akin to an art than an arcane tradition. Stereotypical gastronomists are thought of as monstrously fat and held aloft by magic, like great balloons in robes, but this is mostly a myth; wizards of this school are usually healthier than their contemporaries, owing to a healthy and balanced magical diet.</p><h3>Sous Chef</h3><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with cook’s utensils and have advantage on any ability check you make to cook or prepare ingredients. Additionally, you can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.PhALFfoYznZ4WjWb]{create food and water}</em> once without using a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you cast the spell using this feature, the resulting food is a mouthwatering meal of your choosing.</p><h3>Monster Dish</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, when you finish a short or long rest, you can prepare a meal using monsters that you and your allies have slain. The meal uses the entire corpse of a creature as an ingredient, which must have died within the last 24 hours or been preserved by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.n4JDcFKe5ikzYmAc]{gentle repose}</em> spell. You can’t use this ability with the corpses of Celestials, Humanoids, or Undead creatures. The meal contains enough food for a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier; this food spoils if not eaten in 24 hours. When a creature partakes of this meal at the end of a short or long rest, it rolls a number of d6s equal to the ingredient creature’s challenge rating (1d6 for creatures of CR 1/2 and lower) and gains temporary hit points equal to the total rolled. Additionally, if the ingredient creature had immunity to a damage type other than bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can choose for the meal to bestow resistance to one such damage type for 8 hours to any creature that partakes of it.</p><p>You can only prepare one meal using this ability, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Flavor Blast</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can make other creatures smell delicious! Once per turn, when a creature fails a saving throw against a spell that you cast of 1st level or higher, you can cause the target to smell and taste like delectable food for up to 1 minute or until you use this ability again. This odor carries out to 15 feet and can resemble any food of your choosing, from freshly baked bread to grilling meat. While the target smells this way, attacks made to bite the creature or attack it with teeth have advantage, and the target has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws it makes to maintain concentration.</p><p>Additionally, creatures of Intelligence 3 or lower can’t distinguish the target from the smell and react accordingly. Most creatures can distinguish the target from the odor after dealing damage to it.</p><h3>Bottomless Feast</h3><p>At 10th level, you can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.cyemnlYnWG8JXCKG]{heroes’ feast}</em> once, creating enough food for one creature, without using a spell slot or material components. At 11th level, you can create enough food for 5 creatures.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Ravenous Magic Mouth</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to summon a Large-sized disembodied mouth of magical force filled with sharp teeth in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet. On each of your turns, you can command the mouth to float up to 30 feet (no action required), and you can use your bonus action to command it to bite a creature within 5 feet of it. The mouth uses your spell attack modifier for its melee attack roll, and on a hit, deals 4d10 force damage and grapples its target (escape DC equals your spell save DC) on a hit. The mouth can grapple only one target at a time, and can only attack the creature it is grappling.</p><p>If the mouth is grappling a target of Medium size or smaller at the start of your turn, you can use your bonus action to command it to swallow its target, depositing the creature in an extradimensional space filled with acid. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, taking 4d6 acid damage at the beginning of each of its turns. The creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC to escape. On a success, it magically reappears and falls prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mouth. The creature automatically escapes when the mouth vanishes.</p><p>The mouth disappears after 1 minute, or if you dismiss it early on your turn (no action required). Once you summon the mouth, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",

At 6th level, you gain an amazing sense of smell. You have advantage on all Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks dealing with smell, and you can automatically track a single living creature whose scent you are familiar with as long as the trail is less than a week old.

This technique, combined with a suite of mystical powers drawn from the yawning sky, makes the lancers decisive warriors in the arena of vertical combat. Though Celestial Lancers may be hampered in claustrophobic dungeons, they excel underneath the open sky, where they can leap high and come crashing down for devastating impacts.</p><h3>Lance Specialty</h3><p>Beginning when you select this archetype at 3rd level, when you wield a lance, you do not suffer disadvantage when attacking creatures within 5 feet of you.

When you use your Meteor Jump ability, you can choose to hover until the start of your next turn instead of falling immediately. When you do so, you can’t use your Meteor Jump on your next turn.</p><h3>Earthshaker</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, at the end of a fall of 20 feet or higher, you can use a bonus action to strike the earth like a meteor. Each creature in contact with the ground within 10 feet of where you land must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Celestial Aura</h3><p>By 15th level, you can draw mystical power from your connection to the open sky. When you use your Second Wind feature, you and each friendly creature you choose within 10 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your fighter level.</p><h3>Comet Strike</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you plummet wreathed in flames like a devastating meteor. When you use your Earthshaker ability, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 4d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success.

      "description": "<p>Blades sweeping around in dramatic arcs, propelled by ghostly, disembodied hands—the Mage Hand Magi are truly a force to be reckoned with. While wizards are content to use <em>mage hand</em> to retrieve their wands and open doors from across the room, the cantrip’s potential has always been clear for warriors: a deft <em>mage hand</em> can afford dozens of feet between a soldier and their foe, letting them deal a killing blow without raising a fingertip. Mage Hand Magi have mastered this cantrip through practice and discipline, elaborating a trick pioneered by warmages into a deadly fighting style of twin hovering blades. The most skilled can even manifest a warhand, a grand fist of magical wrath with which to crush their enemies.</p><h3>Mage Hand Master</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, when you choose this archetype, you learn the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.tWHBbTMTh34bhbOh]{mage hand}</em> cantrip if you did not know it before. You can cast it with the following improvements:</p><ul><li>You can cast and control <em>mage hand</em> as a bonus action.</li><li>You summon two separate hands when you cast it, and you can control one or both of them when you use the spell.</li><li>The spell’s duration is indefinite, ending only when you are knocked unconscious or you choose to end it.</li><li>Your <em>mage hands</em> are stronger than normal, capable of lifting a combined weight in pounds equal to 5 × your fighter level, and they are dexterous enough to perform any ability check you could normally perform with your hands.</li></ul><h3>Combat Hands</h3><p>At 3rd level, you have learned to use your mage hands in combat. While you are holding nothing in your hands, your <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.tWHBbTMTh34bhbOh]{mage hands} </em>can wield weapons: each can wield a single one-handed weapon, or together they can wield a two-handed weapon.</p><p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one or more of your attacks through your <em>mage hands</em> against targets you can see within their reach. You can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls. A <em>mage hand</em> not wielding a weapon can be used to punch a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 1d6 force damage on a hit.</p><h3>Handy Maneuvers</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.tWHBbTMTh34bhbOh]{mage hands}</em> to perform a number of combat maneuvers or tricks. While they aren’t wielding weapons, you can use both of your hands together to grapple or shove a creature. When you do so, you add your Intelligence modifier to the Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack with one of your hands when a creature leaves its reach.</p><h3>Warhand</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, when you cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.tWHBbTMTh34bhbOh]{mage hand}</em>, you can form one of them into a much more powerful construct called a warhand. Your warhand is identical to the hand summoned by the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.C5iopsWkiaHU05IL]{arcane hand}</em>, except that you must use its abilities as an action instead of a bonus action. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell. When you use any of the warhand’s abilities, you can use a bonus action to make a single attack with your other <em>mage hand</em>.</p><h3>Handglide</h3><p>By 15th level, while two summoned <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.tWHBbTMTh34bhbOh]{mage hands}</em> or a @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.C5iopsWkiaHU05IL]{warhand} are within 5 feet of you, the hands can hold you aloft and carry you to your destination. You have a flight speed equal to your walking speed while the hands carry you.</p><h3>Heavy Handed</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can summon two @UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.C5iopsWkiaHU05IL]{warhands} instead of <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.tWHBbTMTh34bhbOh]{mage hands}</em> when you cast the <em>mage hand</em> spell. You can use the abilities of both warhands as part of the same action on your turn.</p>",

Mastering this ability is a feat of endurance and creativity, resulting in a fighter whose most powerful weapon is not sheathed at their side, but sheathed within their flesh.</p><p>Many fighters believe the osteoth ritual is a mere myth, a flight of fancy traded around campfires.

You can retract these weapons as you would sheathe a weapon.</p><p>Starting at 7th level, your blades are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Additionally, once per turn when you hit a creature with a bone weapon, you can expend a Hit Die to extend the bone into the target. Add the Hit Die and your Constitution modifier to the weapon’s damage roll.</p><h3>Hardy Constitution</h3><p>By 7th level, your bones and their marrow have grown more robust, granting you a formidable healing factor. You regain all of your expended Hit Dice, rather than half of them, when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Restructure</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can shift your skeletal structure as an action to transform your appearance. When you do so, you determine the specifics of the changes, including adjusting your height and weight, the shape of your face, the presence or absence of your teeth, your posture, and so on. You can even change your size from Medium to Small or vice versa. The extent of these changes only extends to your bone structure: you can’t change your skin color, hair length, or clothing using this ability.</p><h3>Improved Ivory</h3><p>By 15th level, your bones are as hard as steel and as pliant as copper. When you expend a Hit Die to use your Adamant Ivory feature to reduce damage or use your Bone Blades feature to deal additional damage, you can expend two Hit Dice at once. You subtract the total from the bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage you take, or add the total and your Constitution modifier to the weapon’s damage roll, respectively.</p><h3>Master Osteoth</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, when you roll initiative and have fewer than half your Hit Dice, you regain 1d6 Hit Dice.

However, a small subschool of wizards known as the “familiar masters” or “evolutionists” believe that within the humble spell lies manifold hidden powers. Indeed, their studies have unlocked the spell’s hidden potential: the ability to evolve a familiar and fluidly shift its form.</p><h3>Improved Familiar</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you always have the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.JKed6EPyQSuFN8sD]{find familiar}</em> spell prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you prepare. Additionally, you can cast the spell as an action, without expending material components. When you choose your familiar’s creature type, you can choose Aberration, Construct, Elemental, or Undead, in addition to the normal options for the spell.</p><h3>Arcane Evolution</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, you can use an action and expend a spell slot to transform your familiar. When you do, choose a Beast with a challenge rating equal to or lower than half the level of the spell slot expended, and your familiar takes on that Beast’s appearance and statistics (except that it keeps its creature type). During this time, your familiar can attack on its turn. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes, after which time you can choose which animal form it takes from those made available by the spell.</p><h3>Servitor's Gift</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, while you have a familiar, you gain a benefit based on its current form. You continue to gain this benefit when your familiar is transformed by your Arcane Evolution feature.</p><p><em><strong>Bat.</strong></em> You can use a bonus action on your turn to gain blindsight out to a distance of 15 feet while you are not deafened.</p><p><em><strong>Cat.</strong></em> When you land after jumping or falling, you can use your reaction to reduce falling damage to 0.</p><p><em><strong>Crab.</strong></em> While you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier.</p><p><em><strong>Frog.</strong></em> Your jump distances are tripled.</p><p><em><strong>Hawk.</strong></em> You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p><p><em><strong>Lizard.</strong></em> You have resistance to poison damage.</p><p><em><strong>Octopus.</strong></em> While you are grappled, you can use a bonus action to attempt to escape.

Such a stone can generally grant three-quarters cover from ranged attacks for a Medium creature. You can only create a henge in a location which can support the stones’ weight.</p><p>When you begin your turn in your henge, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your druid level (rounded down). Additionally, you can choose any number of allies to also be affected by the henge. A creature you choose gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier when it begins its turn within the henge. Temporary hit points granted by the henge last only while the creature is within the henge.</p><p>Your henge maintains its magical properties for 8 hours. After this duration, you can expend another use of your Wild Shape ability to render the stones permanent, though they no longer grant temporary hit points; otherwise, they vanish.</p><p>As you gain higher levels in this class, you can raise larger henges. At 10th-level, you can create a 15-foot-radius henge consisting of 10 stones, and at 14th-level, you can create a 20-foot-radius henge consisting of 20 stones. You choose the henge’s radius when you create it.</p><h3>Warding Stones</h3><p>At 6th level, your henges can hold great threats at bay. While within a henge, you can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.y8A4HfTwd93ypdEz]{magic circle}</em> spell as an action, without expending a spell slot or material components. The spell is centered on the henge and its radius and height matches that of the henge. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Ley Passage</h3><p>By 10th level, you can use your henges to travel through the leylines that connect the world. By spending 1 minute concentrating as if on a spell while within a henge, you can create a magical link between that henge and another henge on the same plane of existence, as per the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.8aWtP5hcrmcEesBW]{teleportation circle}</em>. You must have seen or touched the destination henge at least once before. For the next minute, any creature can use an action to step into the target henge and exit from the destination henge.</p><h3>Great Henge</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, when you cast a druid spell that requires concentration while you are within a henge, you can transfer the spell to the henge, which manifests as a series of burning runes on the stones. You can only use this ability on a spell of 5th level or lower whose effect is entirely contained within the henge. If the spell’s area of effect would be larger than the area of the henge, you can limit the spell’s area to the henge’s boundary. The henge maintains concentration on the spell instead of you for the spell’s duration, allowing you to maintain two spells which require concentration at once. The spell ends early if any part of its effect leaves the area of the henge or if you use this feature to transfer another spell to a henge.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The Way of the Flagellant teaches an extreme, sometimes heretical, view of asceticism: peace comes through suffering, purity through pain. Its practitioners shun all indulgences and embrace pain to harness their ki, isolating themselves further from the material world. As such, these monks often carry their eponymous flails and whips to use on both themselves and their foes. Their pain is a mortal penitence and an act of focusing, letting them block out all else and manipulate their ki with expert intent.</p><h3>Ascetic Implements</h3><p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn the techniques of the Way of the Flagellant, including their signature weapons. You gain proficiency with flails and whips, which count as monk weapons for you.</p><p>Additionally, you can choose to deal slashing instead of bludgeoning damage with your unarmed strikes.</p><h3>Penitent Lash</h3><p>At 3rd level, when you start your turn, you can sharpen your focus by spending 1 ki point and striking yourself with a ritualistic flail. You can choose to take one or more d4s of slashing damage. For each d4 of slashing damage you choose to take, you gain advantage on one attack you make before the end of your turn. Each attack must use a monk weapon or unarmed strike. This ability has no effect if you reduce or avoid taking the slashing damage.</p><h3>Art of Punishment</h3><p>By 6th level, your expertise in the purifying discipline of pain has granted you new ways to share agony. You gain the following abilities:</p><p><em><strong>Branding Palm.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action to brand the creature. The next attack that hits a branded creature within the next minute deals an extra 2d8 fire damage. At 11th level, this damage increases to 3d8, and at 17th level, this damage increases to 4d8.</p><p><em><strong>Electroshock Strike.</strong></em> Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.2ORSRpdBMbkk8VFm]{shocking grasp}</em> cantrip as a bonus action. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p><p><em><strong>Scissorhand Technique.</strong></em> If you deal slashing damage to a creature with a monk weapon or unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to give the target a bleeding wound. Constructs, Oozes, and Undead can’t get bleeding wounds. A creature loses 1d6 hit points at the start of each of its turns for each of its bleeding wounds unless it uses an action to staunch the bleeding of all of its wounds. While a target is bleeding, it can’t regain lost hit points. A creature can have a number of bleeding wounds up to your proficiency bonus.</p><h3>Purity Through Pain</h3><p>Beginning at 11th level, you enter a rapturous frenzy when wounded. Whenever you take damage in excess of your character level, you can use your reaction to regain 1d4 ki points. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Exsanguinate</h3><p>Beginning at 17th level, when you use your Penitent Lash feature and take 6d4 or more slashing damage, your unarmed strikes deal an extra 1d4 slashing damage on a hit until the end of your turn.</p>",

Only one creature can be warded using this ability at a time. When an attacker within 5 feet of the warded creature hits it with an attack, the creature can use its reaction to deal radiant damage equal to half your bard level to the attacker.</li></ul><h3>Song of the Divines</h3><div><p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your Healing Hymn ability without expending uses of your Bardic Inspiration.</p></div>",

Your concord with Father Winter himself is proof of that.</p><p><em><strong>Winter’s Wind.</strong></em> With the coming of winter frosts are harsh dangers and frigid creatures not found in the summer. It is your duty to protect the innocent from this peril.</p><p><em><strong>Winter’s Throne.</strong></em> Seeking to unseat Father Winter from his throne of ice is to break your vow. No matter the evils of his reign, never break your concord.

The area of this aura is difficult terrain.

A nonmagical instrument weapon is completely destroyed, whereas a magical instrument weapon loses its musical components and no longer counts as an instrument weapon.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",

This ability doesn’t apply to additional sources of damage, such as from a rogue’s @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.DPN2Gfk8yi1Z5wp7]{Sneak Attack} or the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.0xmXiPiuYws1OGcX]{hunter’s mark}</em> spell.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Trophy</h3><p>At 3rd level, you can draw strength from your defeated enemies. Whenever you slay a Large or larger Beast, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, or Undead, you can take a body part as a trophy. You needn’t have dealt the killing blow, but you must have dealt damage to the creature during the combat that killed it. Harvesting a body part in this way is a process that takes 1 minute. Over the course of a long rest, you can apply a mixture of herbs and preservatives worth 50 gp to the body part, after which it becomes a trophy.</p><p>You can wear one trophy at a time, and when you take a short or long rest, you can change which trophy you are wearing. While wearing a trophy, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Creatures of the same type as the trophy are treated as your favored enemy.</li><li>You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls you make against creatures of the trophy’s type.</li><li>You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class and saving throws against the attacks and effects of creatures of the trophy’s type.</li></ul><p>Starting at 7th level, you can make a trophy from an Aberration, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, or Fiend you have slain.</p><h3>Clever Wrestler</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, your experience escaping from gnashing teeth, writhing tentacles, and slashing claws has made you hard to pin down. Whenever you are grappled, you can use a bonus action to end the grapple without making an ability check and move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.</p><h3>Fell The Leviathan</h3><p>At 11th level, you are a master of capitalizing on the weaknesses of larger foes. When you take the Attack action on your turn targeting a Large or larger creature, you can make an additional attack.</p><h3>Masterful Sidestep</h3><p>At 15th level, you are a blur across the field of battle, avoiding attacks that would slay others. When you are hit by an attack, you can use a reaction to immediately move half your movement without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>",

Naturally, heretics end their crusades in one of two ways: canonized for revolutionizing the faith, or burned at the stake for their transgressions.</p><p>Heretics might embrace any fundamental truth that goes unrecognized. Many believe the gods are fundamentally false—a trick wrought by celestials or high priests—while others simply profess the nonnecessity of deities to gain entry to an afterlife. Others attack fundamental pillars of faith that are erected on prejudicial beliefs, such as priestly orders that disallow people of different races or genders to their own.

Each Celestial that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. Each Humanoid within range that can cast 1st-level spells or higher using Wisdom as their spellcasting ability score must also make a Wisdom saving throw. If a creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p><p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p><h3>Godless Aura</h3><p>Beginning at 7th level, your aura divorces the area around you from divine powers. When a creature other than yourself within 10 feet of you regains hit points, you can choose for that healing to fail and have no effect. Furthermore, you can use your reaction to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}</em>, without using a spell slot or spell components, to interrupt any spellcaster using Wisdom as their spellcasting ability score to cast a spell of 1st level or higher within 10 feet of you.</p><p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p><h3>Implacable Will</h3><p>By 15th level, you can reroll with advantage a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><h3>Apostate</h3><p>At 20th level, fully divorced from the will of the gods, you can use your action to assume a form empowered by the influence of your blasphemy, an anti-apotheosis.

Moreover, an adept freerunner can convert the momentum from their gymnastics into deadly force, crushing their enemies with exceptional impact from unexpected directions.</p><p>A freerunner is most at home in a city or in the treetops of a great forest, for their unique movement requires a place that is steeped with complex geometry which reaches high into the sky.

As a missile magician, however, your fondness for the spell borders on obsession. Your studies focus entirely on this spell, exploring every rune in the spell’s composition and analyzing every aspect of its casting, resulting in new augmentations and greater power than ever before.</p><h3>Force Missile</h3><p>Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, you learn the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.BJ1hU9rnx0F3fhLe]{magic missile}</em>, if you do not know it already. Whenever you cast this spell, it is improved in the following ways:</p><ul><li>You fire 1 additional dart whenever you cast this spell. The additional number of missiles increases by 1 at 6th level (2 additional missiles), 10th level (3 additional missiles), and 14th level (4 additional missiles).</li><li>Your missiles bypass any effect, such as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.z1mx84ONwkXKUZd7]{shield}</em> spell, that specifically blocks or reflects the <em>magic missile</em> spell.</li><li>You can cast this spell at its lowest level without using a spell slot.

Beginning at 14th level, you can use this ability an unlimited number of times.</li></ul><h3>Shield of Missiles</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.BJ1hU9rnx0F3fhLe]{magic missile}</em> in a tight orbit around you, creating a deadly aegis from your foes which lasts for up to 10 minutes. You gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of missiles orbiting you, which begins as the number of missiles fired, up to a maximum bonus of +6. When a hostile creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, a single missile strikes it, dealing damage as normal and decreasing the number of missiles orbiting you. Additionally, when you cast <em>magic missile</em>, you can add some or all of the missiles orbiting you to the spell, decreasing the missiles orbiting you by the number used.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Counter-Missile</h3><p>By 10th level, you’ve learned how to use <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.BJ1hU9rnx0F3fhLe]{magic missile}</em> to overcome your most powerful fellow wizards.

The creature must make a single Constitution saving throw as a result of the total damage dealt to maintain concentration while casting the spell, even if the spell wouldn’t normally require concentration. The spell fails and has no effect if the creature loses concentration.</p><h3>Inescapable Missile</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, your missiles seek out targets that would otherwise somehow escape them. This grants you the following benefits:</p><ul><li>The range of the spell increases to 500 feet.</li><li>You can target creatures you can’t see within range, as long as you can hear the creatures and there is a path within range from you to the target.</li><li>You can’t be counterspelled when you cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{magic missile}</em>.</li><li>Your missiles penetrate constructs of magical force, such as those created by the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.o9ZCvuD2B1OTcubb]{wall of force}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.NXWWWgHtWb7Nv21F]{tiny hut}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.1ADstb0Xec6HHRcU]{resilient sphere}</em>.</li></ul>",

      "description": "<p>Druids of the Circle of Vermin, sometimes known as Vermin Lords, find their source of power in the lowliest of creatures: insects, rats, spiders, and other pests. Unmistakably, your coming is signaled by the scrambling of little claws and the cawing of the crows. You hold legions of these creatures at your command, ready to swarm, bite, and claw, and you can become one of them, to walk among your innumerable children.</p><h3>Lord of the Low</h3><p>Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature as an action to magically summon a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.8ihbbjkaOFTPbI73]{swarm of rats} in your space. The swarm vanishes after a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down), if it drops to 0 hit points, or if you use this ability to summon a new swarm.</p><p>The summoned swarm is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned swarm, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.</p><p>While the swarm is in your space, you have a +2 bonus to AC and, when you take damage, you can choose for the swarm to take damage instead of you.</p><p>Starting at 6th level, you can summon a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.PcZ0QjIG6bHpffp9]{swarm of bats}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.S0zDrv6lbnwWaz9E]{swarm of insects}, or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.g40zN6xMye6bSS94]{swarm of ravens}, and starting at 14th level, you can summon a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.XfQMBoTh892XSnCX]{swarm of poisonous snakes}.</p><h3>Infested</h3><p>At 2nd level, insects and rodents inhabit every nook and cranny of your clothes and gear. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, these vermin retaliate, dealing 1d4 piercing damage to the attacker. Additionally, the creature subtracts the piercing damage dealt from the next attack roll it makes before the end of its turn.</p><h3>Tremorsense</h3><p>By 6th level, vibrations in the ground echo through its ants and earthworms, and by extension, you can sense them. You gain @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ.JournalEntryPage.8AIlZ95v54mL531X]{tremorsense}, the ability to detect and pinpoint vibrations, with a range of 10 feet. To use this sense, you and the source of the vibrations must be in contact with the same ground or substance. This sense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.</p><h3>Plague Carrier</h3><p>Beginning at 10th level, your constant close proximity to disease-carrying creatures has not only inoculated you to their diseases, but also allowed you to act as a vector of plague. You are immune to diseases and the poisoned condition. Whenever you would normally make a Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting a disease or the poisoned condition, you can instead become a carrier of that disease or poison. You can only be a carrier of one disease or poison at a time, and you can only carry it for up to seven days.</p><p>As a reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, you can transfer a disease or poison you are carrying to that creature, which must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature contracts the disease or poison, and you are no longer a carrier of it.</p><h3>Swarm Master</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, whenever you use your Lord of the Low feature to summon a swarm, you can summon two swarms instead of one.</p>",

You can use this ability again and expend more uses of Bardic Inspiration to expand this mural further, increasing the bonus by 1 each time, up to a maximum of +3.</p><h3>Signature Mark</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can paint a target on a creature’s back. As a bonus action, you attempt to magically spray a signature mark directly onto a creature you can see within 5 feet of you. Make a melee spell attack roll against that creature. On a hit, the creature is marked. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature you have marked with a melee weapon attack, you can add 1d8 to the damage roll. Additionally, when a friendly creature makes an attack against a creature you have marked, you can use your reaction to grant advantage on the attack roll.</p><p>As an action, a creature can wash itself with soap or remove its armor or outermost clothing to remove its tag.</p><h3>Kaleidoscopic Spray</h3><p>Beginning at 14th level, as an action, you can let loose a flurry of magical paint, coating every surface. Each creature you choose in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

Although their obsession with <em>sleep</em> is occasionally useful, such as when someone needs to be hypnotized or must have their dreams interpreted, it is more often a source of humor—much to the chagrin of so-called “pajama mages”!</p><h3>Somnambulist</h3><p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, your mastery over sleep magic has rendered you a persistent sleep-walker. While you are asleep, you can move around freely; you don’t fully perceive your environment while asleep, so you must navigate from memory. Additionally, you can copy spells to your spellbook while asleep.</p><h3>Deep Sleep</h3><p>Also at 2nd level, you add the <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.vh8vDicVZGJkF2bH]{sleep}</em> spell to your spellbook if it is not there already.

Other spells and effects that charm the creature or influence its mind have no effect while the creature is hypnotized. If you choose, you can cause a creature to repeat its saving throw against these effects, ending an effect on itself on a success.</p><p>The creature has the ability to perfectly recall its memories while hypnotized, including memories that have been magically altered or suppressed. While hypnotized, the creature will truthfully answer any question you pose to it.</p><p>Lastly, you can specify a single command word to be embedded in the creature’s subconscious for up to 24 hours. The first time the creature hears the command word while it isn’t hypnotized, it immediately performs the single action or repeats a certain phrase that you specified while the creature was hypnotized. The creature performs this action or speaks this phrase even if the effects of a spell would compel them to act otherwise.</p><p>The creature remains hypnotized by you for up to 1 hour, or until it takes damage or you end it early by snapping your fingers.</p></div><div><div><h3>Dreamspeaker</h3><p>At 10th level, you add the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.KBqnSh6MgVgfGrfy]{dream} </em>to your spellbook if it is not there already.

You’re a good wizard, the best one, even! And only a fool would say otherwise.</p><h3>Unarguable Wizardry</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, your unquestionable legitimacy (and immense pectoral muscles) gives you advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to convince others that you are, in fact, a wizard.</p><p>Additionally, if someone questions your legitimate magical prowess, you can instantly fly into a rage for 1 round.

      "name": "Circle of the City",
      "description": "<p>The city lives; it has a pulse. Its skin is of walls and towering stone structures, its breath of chimneys and rivers. While the city exists, it lives in harmony with its people, a delicate balance mediated by the urban druids. These urban druids belong to the Circle of the City and are a direct antithesis to the conventional idea of a druid; whereas a normal druid lives among majestic forests or breathtaking mountains and dresses in the greenery of the forest, an urban druid wears unassuming clothes and wanders the back alleys of a well-trodden city. But their powers are not to be underestimated. Druids of this circle can channel their natural powers to twist the streets into knots, uproot towers, and animate the cobblestones. Their charge might be unorthodox, but their authority over the cityscape matches any other druid’s power over the forest.</p><h3>Urban Arcana</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this circle at 2nd level, your druid spells lose the aesthetic trappings of nature and instead appear inspired by the jungles of buildings, columns, and cobblestones. For example, <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.gMrWeG8fMDPRFiVe]{entangle}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9gYGkrL6qFTsE6fw]{spike growth}</em> might cause growths of metal wires and twisting pipes. <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JPwIEfgUPVebr5AH]{Barkskin}</em> might grant you the appearance of pitted iron or brick.</p><p>Additionally, you can wear armor and wield shields made of metal.</p><h3>Streettalk</h3><p>At 2nd level, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to gather rumors or find a creature or location within an urban environment.</p><p>Additionally, you learn @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ohwfuwnvuoBWlSQr]{thieves’ cant}, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p><h3>City Shape</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to warp the city around you. Choose one of the following effects:</p><p><em><strong>Cobbleshift.</strong></em> You magically manipulate the components of a constructed floor—bricks, cobblestones, planks, and similar objects—within 60 feet. Each component can move up to 1 foot and doesn’t cause instabilities in their structures. When you use this effect, you can cause any sections of floor that you choose within the area to become difficult terrain, and can cause any creature standing in one of those sections to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone. You are unaffected by this difficult terrain.</p><p>Additionally, you can use your action on each of your turns to raise up to three low walls from the floor, each 2 and 1/2 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 1 foot deep. Such a wall can generally provide half cover for a Medium creature. These walls provide no instability in surrounding structures.</p><p>This ability lasts for 1 minute. After this time, all components and walls magically revert to their original positions.</p><p><em><strong>Passwall.</strong></em> You cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.d9MwcXi7Il3HROXd]{passwall}</em> without expending a spell slot or material components.</p><p><em><strong>Wall Warp.</strong></em> A wall that you can see within 30 feet magically shifts, grows, shrinks, or rotates. This wall must be a contiguous surface without corners, at most 1 foot thick, and must be either made out of wood, plaster, or stone, or not be naturally occurring. The wall must remain vertical, but you can move it into any position you choose within a 60-foot radius of its previous position. Its new position can’t include spaces occupied by creatures or objects. If you cause the wall to grow or shrink, you can only change its dimensions vertically. These changes to the wall create no instability in their structures. After 1 minute, the wall reverts to its original size and position.</p><h3>Whispers of Walls</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, the walls speak to you in a quiet tremor. You can use your action to touch a constructed part of a building, such as a wall, pillar, ceiling, or floor. You learn how many Humanoid creatures are within that building and how many are within each room. If there are more than fifty Humanoids in a building, you only detect the closest fifty.</p><h3>Breath of Smog</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, you can exhale a 10-foot-radius sphere of toxic smoke, centered on yourself, as a reaction whenever you take damage. This area is heavily obscured. If a creature other than you is completely within the smog at the start of its turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned until the start of its next turn, as it coughs uncontrollably.</p><p>This smog dissipates after 1 minute. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you use your City Shape feature or you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Twisting Architecture</h3><p>By 14th level, you command total mastery of the city’s architecture, warping it to any shape you might imagine. You can expend two uses of your Wild Shape feature to activate any and all effects of your City Shape ability at one time.</p><p>Additionally, when you use your City Shape feature, you can warp the gravity along any surfaces you choose within a 60-foot radius. For the next minute, creatures and objects within 15 feet of one of these surfaces fall toward it as if it were the ground. A creature can walk on this surface as if it were level ground, even if the surface is perpendicular to the ground or upside down. At the end of this duration, all creatures and objects fall from the affected surfaces.</p>",

You learn the creature’s emotional state and, at the GM’s discretion, one of the creature’s Bonds.</p><h3>Mood Swing</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, you can channel great swings of emotional energy at a whim.

Otherwise, you fall.</p><h3>Shift Temperament</h3><p>At 14th level, you can use your action to bend the emotions of a creature you can see within 60 feet, which must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails its saving throw, you can use one of the following abilities on it:</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.h8j0Mo2sRpovj5Gm]{Charmed.}</strong></em> You spend 1 sorcery point, and the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute.

This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed.</p><h3>Vibrant Soul</h3><p>By 18th level, you have mastery over your mercurial feelings. You know all of the spells on your Emotional Spells list at all times. Additionally, you learn the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.GJ2WYm3SQFR0winH]{antipathy/sympathy}</em>, which counts as a sorcerer spell for you and doesn’t count against your number of spells known.

The archetypal dungeon delver is a veteran of such suicidal dungeon delves, and has become intimately familiar with the hazards therein. In the course of their adventures, such a dungeoneer will have adopted countless best practices, along with a litany of unproven superstitions which they believe keeps them alive. Principles from “always be the first one to hit the monster” to “never be the first one to touch a treasure chest” line a dungeoneer’s journal. However, it’s probably better to be paranoid and superstitious than lying at the bottom of a pit trap, incinerated by a <em>fireball</em>, or digested by a mimic.</p><h3>Danger Sense</h3><p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p><h3>Kick in the Door</h3><p>Also at 3rd level, you know how to charge through each chamber of a dungeon and come out alive. You have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, when you are not surprised and you initiate combat by kicking down a door, diving in from overhead, crashing through a window, or any other suitably reckless tactic (as adjudicated by the GM), you have advantage on attacks against creatures you can see during the first round of combat.</p><h3>Dungeoneer's Intuition</h3><p>By 7th level, you have a sixth sense for the unique hazards present in a dungeon. You have advantage on ability checks you make to detect shapechangers, traps, and unseen magical effects, and can make a check to detect such hazards even if you would not normally make such a check.</p><h3>Monster Kill</h3><p>Starting at 10th level, when you hit an Aberration, Fey, Fiend, Monstrosity, Ooze, or Undead with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra die of damage to the target. You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p><h3>Lethality Prevention</h3><p>By 15th level, you are a foremost expert in avoiding death. Whenever you would take more than 50 damage in a single turn, but the damage wouldn’t kill you outright, you instead take only 50 damage.</p><h3>Avoidance</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>",

      "description": "<p>One of your ancestors came from beyond the looking glass; a strange world where everything is a twisted reflection of the true reality. As such, you have inherited amazing powers of mimicry and illusion that allow you to copy other people’s abilities. To fight against you is almost akin to fighting one’s own mirror image, something few warriors would relish.</p><h3>Mirror Magic</h3><p>When you choose this origin at 1st level, you can duplicate the magic that affects you. When a spell is cast targeting you or you are in the area of a spell’s effect, you can use your reaction to learn that spell. You can’t use this ability to learn a spell that had no effect on you, even if it forced you to make a saving throw against it.</p><p>You can only learn a spell if it is of a level for which you have spell slots. You can learn two 1st-level spells using this ability, which don’t count against the total number of sorcerer spells you know. When you gain 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th-level spells, you can learn 2 spells for each of those levels, for a total of 10 additional spells known. The spells learned need not be from the sorcerer spell list, but count as sorcerer spells for you. You can use your action to forget a spell you have learned using this ability.</p><h3>Mimic Trait</h3><p>Also at 1st level, you gain an uncanny ability to mimic other people. As an action, you can choose a Humanoid you can see within 60 feet and gain one trait of your choice that they possess from the following list (even if they only possess it temporarily):</p><ul><li>One special sense, such as darkvision or tremorsense.</li><li>One movement speed, such as a swim or climb speed.</li><li>One skill, tool, or instrument proficiency.</li><li>One damage resistance.</li><li>Their accent, verbal tics, and mannerisms.</li></ul><p>You can keep this trait as long as you are within 60 feet of the target, or until the target dies or loses this trait or you use this ability again.</p><h3>Reflect Magic</h3><p>At 6th level, you can turn your skin into a shimmering mirror that reflects magic. When a creature casts a spell that calls for a saving throw to resist its effects and targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can attempt to reflect the spell’s energy back against its caster. Spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level (1 sorcery point for cantrips). If you succeed on your saving throw against the spell, the caster must also make a saving throw against the spell, using their own spell save DC. On a failed save, the caster suffers the effects of the spell as if you had cast it and they had been the original target or been within the area of the spell.</p><h3>Copycat</h3><p>By 14th level, you have developed your mimicry to the point where you can mirror the unique and powerful abilities of those around you. As an action on your turn, you can perform any action that has been performed within the last minute by a Humanoid (other than yourself) that you can see within 60 feet. Any prerequisites that would normally be required for the action (such as brandishing of holy symbols, spending of ki points, or consumption of items) are waived when you use this feature, unless it is a spell or required the use of a spell slot, in which case you must still expend the relevant spell slot and any required expensive material components. If the ability forces targets to make a saving throw, you can use your sorcerer spell save DC.</p><p>Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.</p><h3>Perfect Duplicate</h3><p>At 18th level, you can duplicate yourself and others with ease. You learn the spells <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.HFkcFvqQKOmWVejV]{disguise self} </em>and <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.4Nh3bIZL15NkFmh9]{mirror image}</em> if you do not know them already, and you can cast them at will without expending a spell slot.</p>",

However, storm knights, as they are often called, have a long memory for vengeance and deep penchants for superstition. Always listen to the wisdom of a storm knight, lest the winds turn foul and the ocean tempestuous.</p><h3>Tenets of the Storm</h3><p>Storm knights swear their oaths on sailing superstitions and unspoken laws of the sea, often containing the following principles:</p><p><em><strong>Safe Harbor.</strong></em> Protect sailors and wise captains that respect the laws of the ocean. No gale should break their masts while you are aboard.</p><p><em><strong>Howling Gales.</strong></em> The winds should steer your journey, wherever they might take you. Furthermore, it is proper that the winds should often guide you into storms.</p><p><em><strong>Thunderous Castigation.</strong></em> The fury of the storm demands equal reprisal for all slights, major and minor. Doing otherwise is bad luck.</p><h3>Oath of Storms Spells</h3><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Paladin Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.IBJmWjzbQGu7M4UX]{fog cloud}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WTbOQBsarsL1LuXJ]{thunderwave}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{gust of wind}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3Lo9boi7P2ro6QV4]{hold person}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ehvmg9U9fcMEhE4z]{call lightning}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ew6GA8dJy2spQmFW]{wind wall}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.7fFHlBk3UNX8gPKL]{control water}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.WN2LWEljYU6QqnRH]{ice storm}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.dp6xny4v8PDoIGjh]{commune with nature}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.l9Ju5KE7bbn3WpTm]{hold monster}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.wSNyShTBaKMMZEdU]{Thunderous Revenge.}</strong></em> You can use your @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} to strike back with the fury of a storm. Immediately after a creature you can see within 30 feet of you deals damage to you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes lightning damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.3t0CFjlWXDGlY53m]{Walk on Waves.}</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can use your @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} to befriend the sea. For the next hour, you gain the benefits of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.YBda6nLKjxdT1LbS]{water walk}</em> spell, and your speed doubles while you are walking on water.</p><h3>Vortex Aura</h3><p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your bonus action to summon a strong wind to whirl around you in a 10-foot radius until you dismiss it on your turn (no action required). While your vortex is active, its area counts as difficult terrain for creatures that you choose. The wind extinguishes unprotected flames, such as candles and torches, and disperses gases and vapors within its area.</p><p>At 18th level, the radius of this aura extends to 30 feet.</p><h3>Storm Soul</h3><p>Starting at 15th level, you have resistance to lightning damage.</p><p>Additionally, whenever a creature you can see within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, it takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Thunder God</h3><p>At 20th level, as an action, you can mantle yourself in the powers of a tempest deity. For 1 minute, your body crackles with thunder and lightning and your eyes glow blue, revealing a raging storm within. You gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You are immune to lightning and thunder damage.</li><li>You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.</li><li>You can cast the spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ehvmg9U9fcMEhE4z]{call lightning}</em> as a bonus action on your turn as a 5th-level spell without using a spell slot or spell components, and can use your bonus action to call down lightning using the spell on subsequent turns.</li></ul><p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",

The GM may be no more powerful than a commoner in its own world, but to our world, its will is absolute.

You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks that you make to interact with friendly Humanoids. However, you only gain this benefit when doing so would advance the plot in a way that the GM feels is appropriate.</p><h3>Fudge The Roll</h3><p>By 6th level, your player has gotten a taste of success and wants to look as impressive as possible while achieving it. Consequently, they might occasionally fudge a cosmic die roll in your favor. When you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can nudge the d20 slightly, changing the number to one of the three sides adjacent to the topmost side.

However, you can push your luck and attempt to use it additional times between rests; doing so might evoke the GM’s wrath, however, and cause unpredictable negative side effects, decided by the GM.</p><h3>Plot Armor</h3><p>By 10th level, you’ve learned that the universe follows an overarching plot, and your role in the plot is critical. As such, the GM conspires to keep you and your allies alive. When you finish a short or long rest, you and each of your allies that rested with you gains temporary hit points equal to your warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>OP Class Feature</h3><p>At 14th level, you have stored up enough cache with the GM to use abilities other player characters would be punished for employing. You can use your bonus action to break the balance of the game. For the next minute, you roll advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

Authorities bristle at their arrival, but the youth cheer, for a Party Paladin is always accompanied by a good time.</p><h3>Tenets of Revelry</h3><p>Many paladins who swear the Oath of Revelry choose to abide by the Codicus Brodicus, a doctrine of moral judgments, both foul and fair, about the way one should conduct life and party. In general, paladins who take this oath abide by the following principles:</p><p><em><strong>The Party Don’t Stop.</strong></em> Every occasion deserves celebration, and everyone should be invited.</p><p><em><strong>Work Hard, Party Hard.</strong></em> Without planning and effort, a good bacchanal has no momentousness. Bring your “A” game to events.</p><p><em><strong>Fight for Your Right to Party.</strong></em> Those who would stand in your way need to be reminded what it’s like to have a good time, or failing that, be circumvented.</p><h3>Oath of Revelry Spells</h3><p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td>Paladin Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.eS7XnnApoxRxYXPs]{charm person}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BQk5Row4NymMnUQl]{hideous laughter}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.3MYDjS6k9IYL0aTj]{calm emotions}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.9eOZDBImVKxbeOyZ]{enhance ability}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.BV0mpbHh29IbbIj5]{create food and water}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.6g3WLOZ2u0EbaLAd]{hypnotic pattern}</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.P6f1PPKPd9BCb742]{compulsion}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{freedom of movement}</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.JQyigMNPiDnGI18b]{geas}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.uAwtVZkiSTyP6ORB]{telepathic bond}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p><p><em><strong>Conjure Drink.</strong></em> When you finish a long rest, you can use your Channel Divinity to summon to your flask a frothy ale from the heavens itself.

When you take a short rest, any remaining ale becomes nonmagical.</p><p><em><strong>Song and Dance.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity as an action to dance a catchy jig. Each creature you choose within 15 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw or join in. Creatures continue to dance as long as you do.</p><p>Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the following, which don’t count against your number of spells known: <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.IjsUVc0MZC3WX9U2]{arc blade}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.wRGjzBvCCmnC6Ruw]{burning blade}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.pSdWjjTzBmq6ewn6]{caustic blade}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.zfwEl9lWgU2SGM8q]{force weapon}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.j5PyPwkO5TdTIrAw]{frigid blade}</em>.</p><p>You also learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Heroic Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.</p><p>Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.QvPDSUsAiEn3hD8s.JournalEntryPage.PVgly1xB2S2I8GLQ]{sorcerer}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.QvPDSUsAiEn3hD8s.JournalEntryPage.mx4TsSbBIAaAkhQ7]{warlock}, or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.QvPDSUsAiEn3hD8s.JournalEntryPage.k7Rs5EyXeA0SFTXD]{wizard} spell list.</p><p></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Heroic Spells</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">New spells are marked with an asterisk.</td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ge3Saet9zPTDyaoL]{heroism}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.z1mx84ONwkXKUZd7]{shield}</em></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.UDUnlfPsOAbq2RSE]{blur}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Sgjrf8qqv97CCWM4]{magic weapon}</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.wpOT8FFsn9xMFqcL]{after image},* @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Szvk5FEVQW3uhJi5]{haste}</em></td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.VtCXMdyM6mAdIJZb]{death ward}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.ReMbjfeOKoSj3O79]{stoneskin}</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.items-and-spells.Item.9FUDndISAUSBPXwC]{evasiveness},* @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.W4Qx5z0id6da0vqg]{legend lore}</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h3>Heroic Soul</h3><p>At 1st level, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier whenever you make a melee weapon attack against a hostile creature within 5 feet of you.</p><h3>Armored Sorcery</h3><p>Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, shields, and four martial weapons of your choice.</p><h3>Mystical Maneuvers</h3><p>Beginning at 6th level, your instincts from your previous life kick in and enable you to perform a handful of special combat maneuvers. Once on each of your turns, you can spend 1 sorcery point as a bonus action to use one of the following maneuvers:</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.oVCB02WzNdoAPiUh]{Aegis Stance.}</strong></em> Make one melee weapon attack against a creature you can see.

After the attack, the weapon teleports back to your hand.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.mage-hand-press-valdas-spire-of-secrets.valdas-subclasses.Item.q1LVrBzFA5aRkCXv]{Parting Flourish.}</strong></em> Make one melee weapon attack against a creature you can see. You don’t provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.</p><h3>Sorcerous Kindling</h3><p>Starting at 14th level, the ebb and flow of battle hones your sorcery and fuels your magic. Once per turn, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack against a hostile creature or reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a weapon attack, you regain 2 sorcery points.</p><h3>Heroic Legacy</h3><p>Starting at 18th level, you can shrug off death in ways few of your previous lives could equal. Whenever you take more than 20 damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage taken to 20. When you do so, you have advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>",

If this ability reduces you to 0 hit points, you are knocked unconscious, even if you have temporary hit points.</p><p>Because of the soul-draining nature of the Dead Mists, you can’t regain hit points from any spell you cast.</p><h3>Feed The Soul</h3><p>Starting at 6th level, your body begins to merge with the Dead Mists, allowing you to heal your mortal form by burning eldritch energy. As an action on your turn, you can consume one of your available Pact Magic spell slots to regain [[/r 1d8]] hit points for each level of the spell slot consumed. This amount of healing can’t be increased or maximized.</p><h3>Fog Form</h3><p>At 10th level, you learn to fully immerse yourself in the Dead Mists, transforming into a hazy, misty reflection of your true self.
