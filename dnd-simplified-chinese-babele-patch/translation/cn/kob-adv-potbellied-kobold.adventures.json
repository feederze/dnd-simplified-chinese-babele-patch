By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p>\n        <p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly Components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>\n        <p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following Effects of your choice:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n        <li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all Effects on them described in the Greater Restoration spell.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n        <li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.</li>\n        <li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n        <p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend Resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>"

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

When triggered, a skullpopper makes a melee weapon attack against the first target in its path: [[/attack +5]] to hit, reach 15 ft., one target; [[/damage 2d10 average bludgeoning piercing slashing]]. The type of damage depends on how the skullpopper is built: a stone or heavy log does bludgeoning damage, a spiked log does piercing damage, a scything blade does slashing damage, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slingsnare.</strong> A concealed loop of rope or wire is affixed to a counterweight.

              "text": "<div class=\"title\"><p class=\"chap-title\">Introduction</p><p class=\"author-name\">By Jeff Stevens</p></div><p>Welcome to Adventures from the Potbellied Kobold – a book of short adventures for the fifth edition of the world’s greatest roleplaying game.</p><p>The adventures within are designed for the Game Master who needs a quick encounter, short adventure, starting point for a larger campaign, or even a short campaign. Though the adventures are designed to be run individually, the Potbellied Kobold gives you a way to link them together.</p><h2>Kobold Press Creatures</h2><p>Not only do we use creatures from the fifth edition basic rules, we’ve also incorporated creatures found in Kobold Press’s Tome of Beasts and Creature Codex. If you don’t have those assets, that’s okay. You’ll find the stat blocks for most of these creatures in appendix: Kobold Press Creatures.</p><h3>Average Character Level</h3><p>The adventures in this book are designed for a party of four to five characters of a specific Average Character Level. To calculate the Average Character Level (ACL) add each character’s level together and divide the sum by the number of characters. For instance, your party contains a 1st-level fighter, a 3rd-level cleric, and a 2nd-level wizard. 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. 6 divided by 3 (the number of characters) = 2. Therefore, the average character level of the party is 2. If the party is weaker or stronger than the stated character level, or there are fewer or more than four or five characters, considering adjusting the adventure based on the Scaling Suggestions sidebars.</p><h2>Using this Supplement</h2><p class=\"desc\">Text in these boxes is to be read to players.</p><div class=\"scaling\"><div class=\"content\"><p>Text in these light purple boxes are important notes for the GM.</p></div></div><h3>Monsters</h3><p>Monsters used in the adventures come from three different sources and are called out in the text in the following ways:</p><ul><li><p>Monsters from the Basic Rules (SRD) are noted in <span class=\"srd-npc\"><strong>black bold</strong></span> lettering.</p></li><li><p>Monsters from either Tome of Beasts or Creature Codex are noted in <span class=\"tob-npc\"><strong>purple bold</strong></span> lettering and can be found in the back of this book.</p></li><li><p>Monsters that are unique creations for the adventure are noted in <span class=\"pk-npc\"><strong>green bold</strong></span> lettering and can be found at the end of the adventure where they appear.</p></li></ul><p>Unless otherwise noted, use commoner for all NPCs.</p><h2>Maps</h2><p>Unless otherwise noted, for all maps 1 square = 5 feet.</p><h2>Being a Good Game Master</h2><p>You don’t have to run these adventures as written. Part of the job of the Game Master is to facilitate the story and make sure the players are enjoying themselves. Below are a few things I think help make a good Game Master:</p><ul><li><p>Change things up as you see fit.</p></li><li><p>Watch the players. If they seem bored, try something else.</p></li><li><p>Allow the players to make decisions that may not follow the story in the adventure.</p></li><li><p>Be prepared to be unprepared.</p></li><li><p>Don’t let the adventure get out of hand. Even though we want the players to have a great time, we still need to maintain a little order.</p></li><li><p>Be sure to engage each player and their character during game sessions. It’s not always fun to sit through a game when all the focus is on one player and their character.</p></li></ul><h2>Using the Adventures in this Book</h2><figure class=\"aftpk w250px left\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Introduction/Potbellied-Kobold.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic black\" style=\"left:50px\">The Potbellied Kobold</figcaption></figure><p>This book provides you with 15 short adventures that you can use however you wish. You can add these adventures to your ongoing campaign, use them to start a new campaign, or use them as one-shot adventures. You don’t even have to mention Potbellied Kobold or Krisalee Tingletoe!</p><p>If you do want to link the adventures together, you can use Potbellied Kobold as a source of adventures and information, adding your own flair to her backstory. Change her as you see fit. She isn’t a cursed gnome? That’s okay with me!</p><p>Want to use these adventures to create a short and quick campaign? We have you covered! The Curing the Curse section of the introduction describes a way to link them together, with characters leveling up after each completed adventure.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>Krisalee Tingletoe is an experienced gnome mage cursed to live her life as a potbellied kobold while sequestered within 30 feet of her covered wagon. Using her arcane ingenuity, she created a pocket dimension within her small, covered wagon prison, allowing her ample space to rest, relax, research a cure for her curse, and continue tinkering as gnomes are wont to do. She lives a comfortable life as the Potbellied Kobold, the name merchants and travelers have given her.</p><p>The Potbellied Kobold isn’t often allowed access to residential areas, so she hires passersby and adventurers to run errands and go on the occasional adventure for her. Being the kind kobold that she is, most are often happy to lend a hand. It doesn’t hurt that she pays well, too.</p><p>Recently, the Potbellied Kobold acquired a magical book that allows her a glimpse into the future, into upcoming events in surrounding areas if things are not changed. The book also shows her the location of items which may help her remove her curse.</p><h2>The Potbellied Kobold</h2><p>Though a powerful mage, the Potbellied Kobold is kind and gentle. Her rival, the elven wizard Belisana Bane (CE elf archmage), cursed her during their last confrontation. Belisana is a power-hungry woman seeking the darkest of magical knowledge. From the safety of her lair, she rules a nearby land.</p><p>The Potbellied Kobold speaks with a deep, raspy voice and her movement is twitchy, not flowing. She knows she is Krisalee Tingletoe but doesn’t mind being called “the Potbellied Kobold” since visitors, merchants, and townsfolk seem to like that name. She realizes some may not find her appearance to be friendly, so she’d rather have a well-known name that people can quickly identify to her.</p><h2>Krisalee Tingletoe</h2><p>If all the required items are collected, Belisana’s curse is removed and the Potbellied Kobold reverts to Krisalee’s true, gnome form (see page 138). Krisalee’s prismatic finch named Joy, who was suppressed during the curse, also manifests. Joy has bonded with Krisalee and only leaves her side if Krisalee perishes. In addition, Krisalee is no longer forced to stay within range of her covered wagon.</p><p>After being cured, Krisalee is not certain what she wants to do. She enjoys helping others and working with adventurers, but she knows Belisana is up to no good. She may attempt to thwart the evil mage, either by confronting her in her lair or by surprising the mage while she travels.</p><h2>Belisana Bane</h2><p>Though a confrontation with Belisana Bane does not occur in this book, we do include her statistics and minion information if the adventurers want to confront her, or if Krisalee decides to battle Belisana.</p><h2>The Covered Wagon</h2><p>Though the exterior of Krisalee’s covered wagon seems simple enough with its mud-covered wheels and dirty bonnet, the interior is a small, magical pocket dimension which she created to make her imprisonment more comfortable.</p><p>Krisalee loves color, which is obvious to anyone who is invited into the wagon. The soiled canvas bonnet of the exterior is replaced with a solid roof with round, stained-glass windows. Inviting large, cushioned chairs and couches decorated with bright, colorful throw pillows fill the large interior while long, pretty banners hang from the ceiling, flapping gently in a magical, cool breeze.</p><p>Books fill the shelves of a central pillar while Tort and Kiss (use clockwork hounds), the Potbellied Kobold’s constructs and friends, clean and maintain the interior. The two constructs are friendly and inquisitive, often invading one’s personal space to smell them or even brush off a bit of dust. If Krisalee, Tort, or Kiss are attacked, the two constructs can merge their bodies, transforming into one creature (use shield guardian, with a stored magic missile cast at 3rd level, or clockwork abomination).</p><figure class=\"aftpk w100p\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Introduction/Wagon-Interior.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic\">The covered wagon interior</figcaption></figure><h1>Using the Potbellied Kobold</h1><p>The Potbellied Kobold can be used several ways:</p><ul><li><p>As a merchant with magical items and services for sale.</p></li><li><p>As a place of refuge, allowing the adventures to rest inside her wagon while they heal.</p></li><li><p>As a source of information about the surrounding area.</p></li><li><p>As a quest giver with short adventures for the characters.</p></li><li><p>As a campaign, using the suggested Curing the Curse campaign arc in this book.</p></li></ul><h2>Curing the Curse</h2><p>The Potbellied Kobold needs help! Using her magical book, she senses distress in neighboring villages, which she mentions to the adventuring party. Also, she senses things in these villages that may help her cure her curse.</p><p><em><strong>Plot Hooks:</strong></em> The list below includes plot hooks that you can use when the Potbellied Kobold speaks with the adventurers. Her knowledge of the adventures is limited, as her magical book only provides her with a sense of distress or danger, or a brief glimpse of the situation.</p><p><em><strong>Rewards:</strong></em> You may change the rewards the Potbellied Kobold offers the adventurers. Your characters may not find some of the listed rewards useful. In addition to the rewards listed, the Potbellied Kobold tells them they can keep whatever they find, if she doesn’t require it to cure her curse.</p><p><em><strong>What She Needs:</strong></em> Many of these items are easily found during the adventure, while some may require additional roleplay or changing the treasure listed in the adventure.</p><p>Each adventure has this symbol with its associated number inside.</p><div style=\"position:relative;height:15px\"><p class=\"adv-nb-intro\">1</p></div><p>Please refer to the Scaling Suggestions within each adventure, adjusting up or down based on the party’s level and relative strength.</p><h3>Adventure 1 - Tinker Tailor Goblin</h3><p><em><strong>Plot Hook:</strong></em> “I sense someone needs help in a small goblin hamlet.

Rapidly rising through the ranks, she was gifted her huntsman’s gauntlets after the successful rescue of a foppish prince who was held for ransom by a band of hobgoblins. During her fourth year</p><p>of loyal service, a sinister betrayal toppled her queen’s regime, forcing Je’Sona into exile. Now, Je’Sona travels the lands, picking up work where her skills are needed while doing what good she can for others.</p><p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> Confident, strong willed, bright, and compassionate, Je’Sona is slow to trust, but once trust is earned, she is loyal to a fault. Intolerant of bullies, Je’Sona has found herself in more than one scrap defending those who could not defend themselves. Thoroughly competitive, she never backs down from a challenge, embracing both the satisfaction of success and the lessons of failure.</p><p><em><strong>Desires.</strong></em> Je’Sona takes great pride in her talents, especially when they are put to use helping those in need. A wanderer by nature, she has little desire for material goods, and is known to donate payments to local causes, though she is sure to keep enough to enjoy a hearty meal and lodging when the opportunity presents. She hopes, someday, to topple the regime that overthrew her queen. Until then, she’ll do what good she can where she can.</p><h4>Huntsman’s Gauntlets</h4><p><em>Wondrous item (gauntlets), rare (requires attunement)</em></p><p>While wearing these gauntlets, you may use a bonus</p><p>action to magically create either a shortbow, longbow, light crossbow, or heavy crossbow which manifests as</p><p>if it were made of brilliant blue light.

Without her, the decorations that bring Leavesfall to life will never be completed on time.</p><p>Maryn was kidnapped while on a hike in the Hindwoods, an activity she undertook alone to survey trees for felling. She was taken by the injured cloud giant Cirraal, whose arm was recently bitten off by a dragon. Cirraal took Maryn to his palatial abode atop the clouds and is keeping her captive while she creates an enormous carved arm for him. Cirraal is capable of permanently animating objects, and will use the new arm like the one he lost.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Ivyford, the priests are desperately canvassing adventurers for their assistance in locating the lost carpenter. They know she was last spotted heading for the Hindwoods, and send the characters in that direction.</p><h1>Plot Hooks</h1><p>The plot hooks below allow you to introduce adventurers into the plot at different points, depending on available play time and preference.</p><p>• Father Isafar, a priest in need of assistance, approaches the characters. He tells them that he is from the nearby village of Ivyford, and that during the preparations for their famous Leavesfall festival, their lead carpenter has gone missing. The priest does anything he can to help the characters in their search and offers to reward them with free food, lodging, and healing. Isafar explains that Maryn was last seen heading toward the Hindwoods.</p><p>• While the characters are travelling through the Hindwoods, they hear a startled cry from nearby, and the rending of trees. Following the noise, they discover a freshly made clearing and see a one-armed cloud giant with a woman grasped in his hand flying toward the clouds. Dropped onto the forest floor are plans of decorations for the festival of Leavesfall at Ivyford.</p><p>• Similar to the first hook, except Father Isafar knows that Maryn was taken by a cloud giant, gives them the <em>@UUID[Item.SunU7KKy8yXNTf9B]{leafwing tokens}</em>, and asks them to pursue the giant immediately!</p><h1>Finding Maryn</h1><h2>The Hindwoods</h2><p>After speaking with Father Isafar and establishing that Maryn disappeared from the nearby Hindwoods yesterday, the priest asks the characters to head into the forest to investigate. When they arrive, read or paraphrase the following:</p><p class=\"desc\">The Hindwoods is dominated by towering pines, whose red bark flakes away in hand-sized plates. Brambles and ferns grow around the base of the mighty stands, though three well-walked paths snake through the undergrowth, paved by chunks of fallen bark. The sound of clashing steel and squealing animals rings through the forest.</p><p>Characters with a [[/skill prc 14 passive]] determine the sound is coming from 30 feet into the forest. If no character in the party can locate the sound, the characters must succeed on a [[/skill prc sur 14]] check to locate the ambush.</p><h2>Ambush!</h2><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This scene use the @UUID[Scene.lVxMdU8wEMDJjo20] scene.</p></article></div><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Into-the-Clouds/Ambush-grid.webp\" class=\"w75p center\" /><p>When characters find the cause of the noise, read or paraphrase the following:</p><p class=\"desc\">You follow a path around a rocky outcropping revealing a wagon, atop which two halflings stand, firing arrows into a mob of frenzied satyrs surrounding them. The pony pulling the cart rears up in fear. The pathway is surrounded by ruined walls, and off to one side is an ivy-covered podium that pulses with magical light.</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Late Arrival.</strong></em> If the characters couldn’t locate the source of the sound immediately (see above), @UUID[JournalEntry.W96XSsKg5zkLZ1sM.JournalEntryPage.cLXg4X6TC73zFb4R#rutterun]{Rutterun} has already cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WTbOQBsarsL1LuXJ]{thunderwave}</em> to knock the wagon over, knocking the halflings onto the ground where they can be attacked.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Wagon.</strong></em> The wagon belongs to the two halfling alchemists, @UUID[Actor.avNEBQ52RNYID8iY]{Eran} and @UUID[Actor.YQ2OKnb1bIs5X3GP]{Tawna Greenbottle} (NG female halflings armed with shortbows [[/attack +0]] to hit, range 80/320 ft., dealing [[/damage 1d6 piercing average]] damage on a hit). They cannot be hit by the satyrs while atop the wagon. Their pony, @UUID[Actor.FtcUQ9DJfjcYjhki]{Flurry}, is too distressed to escape, leaving the wagon stranded.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Creatures.</strong></em> There are four <span class=\"srd-npc\">@UUID[Actor.vHGIe9iGunS2Oy4Y]{satyrs}</span> surrounding the wagon led by <span class=\"pk-npc\">@UUID[Actor.wrMil9FgTkXIui0A]{Rutterun}</span>. The influence of the podium (see below) has driven them into a frenzy, causing them to attack on sight. Characters can determine this with a successful [[/skill ins 12]] check. During the first round of combat, Rutterun uses thunderwave to knock over the wagon, so the other satyrs can attack the halflings.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Podium of Mania.</strong></em> Whenever a creature takes damage within 30 feet of the @UUID[Actor.loSBExf6PoaV5zKo]{podium}, the creature must succeed on a [[/save wis 4]] saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, a creature must use its action each round to attack the closest creature to it, moving to attack the next closest creature after if the target is reduced to 0 hit points. If it has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li></ul><p>The podium can be destroyed by casting <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}</em> on it, succeeding on three [[/skill arc 15]] checks, or by attacking it (AC 17, 30 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, resistant to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, vulnerable to bludgeoning damage). Destroying the podium causes the satyrs to stop attacking.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>If the characters manage to save the halflings, they are extremely grateful and offer the characters two <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{potions of healing}</em> as thanks. If Flurry is still alive, they offer to escort the characters anywhere they like within ten miles. The Greenbottles mention that their journey through the Hindwoods has been bizarre: a whole clearing appeared overnight, their second wagon was stolen in their sleep, and now the satyr attack. The clearing they mention is where Maryn was kidnapped, and they can take the characters there.</p><p>If the satyrs are calmed by destroying the podium, they apologize whole-heartedly and do anything they can to help repair the wagon and look after the Greenbottles. Rutterun can use <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.aL1F8fvYLtNzUbKu]{speak with animals}</em> to help the characters discover the clearing from which Maryn was kidnapped, and learn that she was taken by a one-armed cloud giant.</p><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Scaling Suggestions</p><div class=\"content\"><p><strong>Weaker: </strong>Each satyr has 25 hit points.</p><p><strong>Stronger: </strong>Each satyr has 56 hit points.</p></div></div><aside class=\"tob\"><div class=\"aside-border\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/SidebarBorder2a.webp\" /></div><div class=\"aside-text-content\"><p class=\"title\">Using Tome of Beasts</p><div class=\"content\"><p>Replace all references to satyrs with @UUID[Actor.t2czj3chZNEWVu4n]{ravenfolk scouts}.</p><p>Remove Rutterun’s Ram attack.</p></div></div></aside><h2>The Clearing</h2><p>If the characters do not find the clearing with help from Rutterun or the Greenbottles, they can discover it on their own with a successful [[/skill sur 16]] check. Failure on this check means they arrive many hours later, during which time they are attacked by a pack of [[/r 2d4]] wolves.</p><p>When the characters reach the clearing, read or paraphrase the following:</p><p class=\"desc\">Before you is a freshly made clearing. The tall pines are snapped like twigs on the ground, and the entire area is covered with red bark shavings intermingled with scattered pieces of parchment. Clearly, something enormous crushed the trees here.</p><p>Clues. There are numerous clues the characters can find in the clearing that point them in the direction of a cloud giant kidnapping.</p><p>• <em><strong>Broken Trees.</strong></em> Characters who succeed on a [[/skill nat 13]] check can tell the trees have been snapped by downward pressure. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, they know it must be a giant.</p><p>• <em><strong>Sketches.</strong></em> Characters who search the clearing find sketches of Leavesfall decorations that belonged to Maryn scattered around.</p><p>• <em><strong>Footprints.</strong></em> Characters who succeed on a [[/skill sur 10]] check realize the clearing is made of several enormous footprints, which could only have been made by a Huge-sized creature.</p><p>• <em><strong>Clouds.</strong></em> Characters who enter the clearing notice a strange cloud formation above it. If they succeed on a [[/check prc 15]]DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, they spot the blurred outline of buildings atop the cloud.</p><p>Development</p><p>Without a way to get to the cloud, the characters should return to Ivyford and Father Isafar. If they don’t come to this conclusion on their own, prompt them using the Greenbottles, Rutterun, or by describing night closing in and the requirement of shelter.</p><h1>Reaching Maryn</h1><p>When the characters return to tell Father Isafar of Maryn’s abduction, he immediately knows that he can help. He gives each character a leafwing token (see magic items). These items allow the characters to reach the palace of Cirraal the cloud giant.</p><h1>Cirraal’s Palace</h1><p>@embed[JournalEntry.q3tgyce2uPhYi6pq.JournalEntryPage.tg3Vi0dmC3efpTgJ caption=false cite=false]{Ciraal's Palace}</p><p>@embed[JournalEntry.q3tgyce2uPhYi6pq.JournalEntryPage.5vDJwiSWcFa08ZCl captio=false cite=false classes=\"w75p center\"]{Ciraal's Palace Map}</p><h2>Area C1.

She’s taken notice of the exploits of the adventurers, and fears their growing power and influence might soon steer them into the path of her countless devious criminal enterprises. A gnome of great cunning and foresight, she’s decided to eliminate the characters before they become a problem.</p><p>After having her network delve into the pasts of the characters to help understanding their motives and goals, Shyllylli sets up a trap. She hopes to lure them on an adventure that finds them in a conflagration, ending their adventuring careers—and maybe even their lives.</p><h1>Plot Hook</h1><p>How you choose to introduce the events of this short adventure depends on the actions of the characters up until this point in your campaign. The premise of the adventure is that the characters have drawn the attention of a powerful criminal mastermind, so that mastermind tries to manipulate and draw the characters into her web and then eliminate them… with extreme prejudice.</p><p>Use the following example as a guide to a possible plot hook. You can replace the NPCs mentioned in the example with NPCs from your campaign that the characters are already be familiar with.</p><p>The characters are approached just before sundown by Lady Henreeda Haversdown, a powerful and influential landowner, merchant, and noble in the city. As she approaches them on the street, a pair of elvish bodyguards (use <strong>veteran</strong> stat block) flanks her, keeping their hands near their swords and their eyes darting around, ever vigilant for trouble. A successful [[/check prc 18]] check also reveals two halflings (use <strong>spy</strong> stat block) loitering nearby but keeping an eye on the situation—this pair also guards Lady Haversdown.</p><p>Lady Haversdown insists that the characters pledge not to speak publicly of what she is about to tell them before she continues, and she promises generous payment if they decide to assist her in the problem she is about to describe.</p><p>Use the bullet points below to guide the conversation:</p><ul><li><p>“I’ve heard that you are skilled at what you do, and more importantly that I can count on you to be discreet. I have an important and sensitive task that I would like you to undertake on my behalf.”</p></li><li><p>“As a leader in this community, eyes are always on me and on those around me. My daughter, I fear, may have gotten herself mixed up with some unsavory characters. I have not seen her in several days, and I need her to be brought back to me by dawn tomorrow for an important family ceremony.”</p></li><li><p>“My daughter, Hesstella, grew up alongside a commoner lass called Saava. Saava is the daughter of my stableboss Grangella. The two were inseparable as youngsters, and I saw no harm in their friendship. It’s preferable to have your staff love you, and they should think that you are fond of them—within reason, of course.”</p></li><li><p>“The girls are grown now, and Saava has been acting the fool. I’ve offered to keep her in my employ in any position she desires. She, unfortunately, has notions of becoming an entertainer. Worse yet, she has infected Hesstella’s mind with romantic notions.”</p></li><li><p>“The pair continually disobey my direct orders to give up this foolishness. They sneak out at all hours, going to ill-reputed public houses, where Saava performs for coins like a common trollop. It’s disgusting and dangerous. And Hesstella is always there at her side.”</p></li><li><p>“Five days ago, I gave Hesstella an ultimatum. If she continued to disobey me, I would disinherit her and leave her without a copper to her name. She must have known I was bluffing, for she stormed away from our estate. I have not seen her since. I’m too embarrassed to talk to the city guard, for it would show how I can’t even control my own daughter. I cannot have my partners and rivals using this knowledge against me.”</p></li><li><p>“I’ve learned Hesstella and Saava were frequenting a filthy tavern called the Stone in the Fire. If you accept my offer of employment, start your investigation there. It’s important that you retrieve her and bring her to my estate before sunrise tomorrow. And make no mention that you are under my employment. I don’t want my enemies knowing of my involvement.”</p></li></ul><p>The characters likely have questions or desire more information. Use the further bullet points below to continue the conversation:</p><ul><li><p>Hesstella is short and stout with dark skin, like her mother. She recently cut her black hair very short. Saava is a pale-skinned young woman with long red hair and slightly elven features.</p></li><li><p>If the characters ask what means they might employ to bring Hestella home, Lady Haversdown says that as long as her daughter is returned to her unharmed and in good health, she doesn’t care what the characters do.</p></li><li><p>She offers each of the characters a 50-gp payment: 10 gp now, promising the remaining 40 gp each after the characters bring Hesstella home.</p></li><li><p>The Haversdown Estate is on the northern side of the city. The characters will be allowed in by the guards at the front gate. It is vital that she be home for an important family religious ceremony that must take place exactly at dawn.</p></li><li><p>As it is now just before sundown, the characters have exactly 10 hours before dawn.</p></li></ul><h1>Behind the Scenes</h1><p>Shyllylli Villoni is pulling strings here, using this family drama to draw the characters into a situation that she hopes to control. Shyllylli manages the criminal elements that run the Stone in the Fire tavern, and she uses her influence there to keep an eye on Hesstella, knowing she is the scion of Lady Haversdown.</p><p>When she learned of the rift between Hesstella and her mother, the manipulative gnome decided this was the trap in which she could snare the characters. She sent her own informants, in the guise of concerned citizens, to reveal to Lady Haversdown where her daughter was, and even suggested the characters as the best people to hunt her down.</p><p>Now that the characters are on the case, Shyllylli plans to lead them on a merry chase, then lure them to a private, secure location where she can dispose of them quickly and quietly—and possibly frame them for criminal activities if the lethal trap fails to snag them.</p><h1>The Adventure</h1><p>The Stone in the Fire is an unremarkable alehouse and gambling den in the wrong part of town.</p><p>When the characters arrive at the tavern, read:</p><p class=\"desc\">No sign adorns this tavern. The only marker designating it as the Stone in the Fire is a blackened piece of granite resting next to the front door. The smell in the area indicates that soot isn’t the only substance covering this stone.</p><h2>Stone in the Fire Tavern</h2><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.r54XW7IT624cJjPx] scene.</p></article></div><figure class=\"w75p center\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Redeemed-with-Fire/Stone-in-the-Fire-Tavern-%5B20x20%5D-grid-only-inside-wo-ext-shadow.webp\" /></figure><p>The interior of the place is plain, the bar and furniture rough-hewn, and the crowd rowdy but peaceful. The patrons understand this tavern is under the protection of a powerful underworld figure (although they’re not sure who), and people who cause too much trouble at the Stone in the Fire end up in the fire themselves. That’s not to say there isn’t some violence, drunken foolishness, gambling, and debauchery—it’s just kept to a reasonable level and policed carefully by the staff of the tavern.</p><h3>Potash – the Manager</h3><p>The manager of the Stone in the Fire is an elderly dwarf (use <strong>bandit</strong> stat block) who goes by the nickname “@UUID[Actor.bM9b2il2qoaQdOL4]{Potash}.” She usually sits in a lone chair in the corner of the tavern, chewing a wad of stinkweed, spitting its dregs into a bucket at her feet, and watching the goings-on in her establishment like a hungry griffon looking for prey.</p><h3>Tavern Staff</h3><p>The server and the barkeep (use <span class=\"srd-npc\">thug</span> stat blocks) are siblings, a brother and sister half-orc pair called @UUID[Actor.K5XJSrUMUm32Nehi]{Uzzmund} and @UUID[Actor.ILREjVT2SvtWaeGA]{Relik}. The two prowl the tavern with purpose, putting up with no tomfoolery, delivering watered-down drinks and watered-down stew with efficiency. They keep weapons behind the bar to deal with problems.</p><p>The rest of the tavern staff are bar backs, kitchen help, and a hostile halfling cook named @UUID[Actor.7SF1Yzwitz2wf26R]{Draeno} with a cleaver for a hand and a bad attitude. They are <span class=\"srd-npc\">commoners</span> who avoid contact with the clientele if possible.</p><h3>Mood in the Tavern</h3><p>Tonight, that clientele is being “entertained” by a rather untalented minstrel who goes by the stage name “@UUID[Actor.WhsLc1FtYvV6hheD]{Delicious}.” His barely passable musical talents might be acceptable to a drunken audience on a normal night, but the regulars here have been treated to the superior creations of Saava for the past several days, so Delicious’s skills pale in comparison.</p><h2>The Entrance</h2><p>When the characters enter the tavern, set the scene:</p><p class=\"desc\">Everyone in the Stone in the Fire stares at a human standing on a large table in the corner of the common room. At first it seems the crowd is entranced by the performance; however, it quickly becomes apparent that they are stunned by the performer’s inept lute playing and singing.</p><h3>The Situation at the Tavern</h3><p>The characters enter just as mayhem is about engulf the Stone in the Fire. Incensed that amazingly talented Saava has been replaced by the tone-deaf Delicious, the unrest in the crowd begins slowly but reaches a fever pitch quickly.</p><p>The bullet points below give the order of events. The characters can, of course, intervene at any point to change the encounter. Once that happens, use your best judgement for how the encounter plays out.</p><p>In the end, the characters’ goal should be to find out where Saava and Hesstella have gone, and Potash makes sure they gain that information, but not before pretending to protect the information.</p><ul><li><p>One of the patrons, a dwarf in a white shirt and green breeches, shouts: “This is rubbish! We want Saava back!” He hurls a full tankard of ale at the minstrel, striking him squarely in the face, causing him to drop his lute and fall backward off the table.</p></li><li><p>Another patron, a heavily muscled woman in leather armor, punches the dwarf in the face, screaming, “Hey, that’s my cousin you just hit!” The dwarf topples over.</p></li><li><p>Seven patrons (use <span class=\"srd-npc\">scout</span> stat blocks) jump into the fray, fighting each other for four rounds, but no one lands any significant blows.</p></li><li><p>If the characters have involved themselves in any way, a dwarven <span class=\"srd-npc\">veteran</span> named @UUID[Actor.fNk4mhRLB1fxwVJo]{Graylin Gravestone} steps into the melee and challenges the characters.</p></li></ul><p>If the characters have not gotten involved, two drunken <span class=\"srd-npc\">@UUID[Actor.fgdmUnvJn9LIdFLX]{thugs}</span> roll out of the general melee into them, swinging their weapons.</p><p>What’s most important here isn’t how well the characters do in the combat, it’s how well they keep their composure. If they can find a way to diffuse the violence with ability checks, magic, or roleplaying, they can avoid a fight.</p><p>As long as the characters don’t kill any opponents (knocking foes unconscious is fine), they don’t face any repercussion from the authorities, who arrive as the melee ends if the characters got involved (see Town Watch below).</p><h3>Town Watch</h3><p>If the characters resort to violence, six members of the @UUID[Actor.VNMlx03ro3hgIOYw]{town watch} (use <span class=\"srd-npc\">guard</span> stat blocks) arrive to find out what’s happened. Assuming the characters didn’t kill anyone and only fought in self-defense, the guards, led by a human named @UUID[Actor.Wknp8CmKJL92cuYD]{Sergeant Elluwyn Merges}, questions them and releases them with just a warning.</p><p>Any character who struck a killing blow is arrested by the town watch—or at least they attempt an arrest. Any characters who are arrested are taken to a nearby jail and thrown into a cell, and held until dawn when a magistrate arrives to hear the case.</p><p>Incarcerated characters can escape with a successful [[/tool dex thief 10]]. They can also slip through the bars of the cell or break them with a successful [[/skill acr ath 15]] check. This allows them to get out for long enough to complete the job for Lady Haversdown, although they should have to answer to the authorities later.</p><h2>Passing Along the Information</h2><p>If the characters find a way to diffuse the tension with no (or at least very little) violence, @UUID[Actor.bM9b2il2qoaQdOL4]{Potash} hobbles over to them and thanks them for saving the tavern from further destruction. She offers free drinks and food for the evening.</p><p>If the characters mention Saava or Hesstella, Potash shakes her head and sighs, but doesn’t say anything. A successful [[/skill isn 10]] check reveals that Potash is angry and conflicted about the pair, while a successful [[/skill ins 20]] check reveals that she is simply acting like she is conflicted.</p><p>If they press, Potash finally admits that she is upset that Saava refused to continue playing at the Stone in the Fire because she got a better offer to perform at another location earlier in the week. Potash has been unable to find someone with any skill to replace her.</p><p>Potash admits she doesn’t exactly know where this other venue is, as it’s in another part of town. She only knows she couldn’t afford to match the offer, and it’s apparently a private club catering to a higher class of clientele. Of course, any class of clientele is higher than hers. She gives the characters directions to where this private club is supposed to be located, and she mentions a name she heard in passing: Flambogne (pronounced “flahm-BOH”).</p><h2>The Iron Pendant</h2><figure class=\"aftpk right w150px\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Redeemed-with-Fire/Iron-Pendant.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic black\" style=\"top:90px;left:35px\">Saava's Necklace</figcaption></figure><p>She also tells the characters that Saava left a possession of hers at the tavern, and the characters can give it back to her if they find her. Potash hands them a simple, unadorned @UUID[Item.5kg2e8q1jAq4NARn]{pendant} made of iron on a leather strap, meant to be worn as a necklace. The thing looks unremarkable; however, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{detect magic}</em> spell shows it to be magical, and a successful [[/skill arc 20]] check reveals that it contains evocation magic.</p><h3>Incriminating Evidence</h3><p>Finally, Potash tries to trade any information she provides for a worthless but easily identifiable item that a character owns. She was instructed to do this by Shyllylli, so that the item could be placed at a crime scene to implicate the character, such as the site of Saava and Hesstella’s upcoming attempted murder.</p><h2>Searching for Flambogne</h2><figure class=\"aftpk left w250px\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Redeemed-with-FIre/Flambogne.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic black\" style=\"top:410px;left:130px\">Flambogne</figcaption></figure><p>When the characters go to the part of town where Saava and Hesstella now frequent, they can ask around about them, or seek anyone with knowledge of the name Flambogne.</p><p></p><p>It doesn’t take long for the characters to learn that Flambogne is well known in this area. He moved here recently, purchasing a small building that recently acted as a minor temple. Rumor has it that Flambogne was going to turn it into a private club, but the building has remained shuttered and locked.</p><p>In reality, Flambogne is a lieutenant of Shyllylli. This tall, thin, crazed-looking human, his body covered in red flame tattoos, is a devoted follower of a fire deity. He performs acts of arson, kidnapping, and murder for Shyllylli, and she’s rewarded him with a place to call his own. The gnome mastermind encourages Flambogne to gather a flock of fire cultists to his ministry, which she can then use as her own private army to carry out grander and more dangerous crimes.</p><p>No one knows of this connection between Shyllylli and Flambogne, except for the parties directly involved. To the outside world, Flambogne is simply an eccentric club owner.</p><h2 class=\"clear\">The House of Fire</h2><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.CnFxiHICGByv6vuG] scene.</p></article></div><figure class=\"w50p center\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Redeemed-with-Fire/final-chamber---gridless-closeup.webp\" /></figure><p>The characters have no problem finding Flambogne’s building, assuming they ask the locals where it is. When they arrive at the place, use the following text to describe it.</p><p class=\"desc\">Aside from wisps of smoke emanating from the door, the building’s exterior is unremarkable. It’s made of plain gray stone, and where there were once windows, more stone has been mortared into place to seal them. An iron door is the only visible means of entrance or exit, although a small metal pipe emerging from the roof indicates a fireplace within. Smoke currently pours from the pipe.</p><p>The building is 40 feet square, and the interior ceiling is 10 feet high. The building is empty of furnishing except for an open central fireplace, 10 feet square. Although it currently rages with a magical fire, the characters must first get through the door to see the interior of the building and its occupants.</p><h3>The Smoking Door</h3><p>If the characters approach the iron door, which is set in the center of the south wall, they notice wisps of white smoke originating from faint runes etched into the door with a successful [[/skill prc 15]] check—a magic trap waiting to be sprung. The door has a locked iron handle.</p><p>If the characters touch the door or try to pick the lock before deactivating the runes, they set off the trap, which summons five <span class=\"srd-npc\">@UUID[Actor.FVrMIXW8UYM0qLx6]{magma mephits}</span>. These creatures emerge from the door and attack any creatures in the vicinity of the door.</p><p>The runes can be deactivated with a successful [[/skill arc rel 15]] check. The characters get only one chance to do so—a failed check triggers the trap. After the trap is triggered or deactivated, it remains inactive for 1 hour.</p><p>The door’s lock can be opened with a successful [[/tool dex thief 15]] check, or it can be broken with a [[/check str 20]] check. The door has 50 hit points and an AC of 12.</p><h3>The Conflagration</h3><p>Four rounds after the characters first touch the door, or as soon as they get it open, a larger conflagration springs up inside the open fireplace. When they enter, describe the scene:</p><p class=\"desc\">An open fireplace in the center of the building holds a raging fire, although no obvious fuel feeds it. Two struggling forms, fitting the descriptions of Saava and Hesstella, are chained by the wrists to two iron pillars supporting the fireplace. A human wielding a burning warhammer shouts at a pair of heavily armored figures and points at you. “Kill them!” says the figure in a voice that roars like a bonfire.</p><h3>The Foes</h3><p>@UUID[Actor.cBxORiOWhOsPJnaH]{Flambogne} is a flame priest (use <span class=\"srd-npc\">azer</span> stat block), and he commands two @UUID[Actor.arTev62AfpHFO2Lj]{flame knights} (use <span class=\"srd-npc\">animated armor</span> stat block, adding fire immunity). They all fight to the death, although the two flame knights disintegrate when Flambogne is killed.</p><h3>The Rescue</h3><p>The characters must free @UUID[Actor.6nqqDEjRE2CTVzqA]{Saava} and @UUID[Actor.myvsD0GkD6CCC2Kk]{Hesstella} within six rounds or the pair are consumed by the growing fire. Anyone entering or starting their turn in the fireplace takes [[/damage 1d8 fire average]] damage.</p><p>A character adjacent to either Saava or Hesstella can use an action to attempt a [[/skill ath 15]] check to snap the chains or a [[/tool dex thief 15]] check with thieves’ tools to unlock the chains.</p><h3>The Pendant Trap</h3><p>If a character is wearing the pendant that Potash gave them, Flambogne smiles when he sees it. As an action, he says a magic phrase in Ignan, causing the pendant to burst into flames. The person wearing it takes [[/damage 6d6 fire average]] damage, with no saving throw. Any creature within 5 feet of that explosion must make a [[/save dex 10]] saving throw, taking [[/damage 3d6 fire average]] damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.</p><p>In addition, any equipment that the characters traded Potash are hidden in the building, left as evidence that the characters were responsible for this situation.</p><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Scaling Suggestions</p><div class=\"content\"><p><strong>Weaker: </strong>Remove one of the flame knights, and add 2 rounds to the time limit before the fire consumes the hostages.</p><p><strong>Stronger: </strong>Add one flame knight, and remove 2 rounds from the time limit before the fire consumes the hostages.</p></div></div><h3>Rewards &amp; Treasure</h3><p>If the characters defeat Flambogne, they can take his @UUID[Item.HCmYovwNxqgLuhdq]{+1 warhammer}. The warhammer’s wielder can choose to deal an additional 1d6 fire damage on a successful attack 3 times per day. He also carries a @UUID[Item.wDDHPgLtEiLAjrF7]{holy symbol} of his fire god that fetches 200 gp from a collector.</p><p>If they escort Hesstella to the Haversdown Estate before dawn, Lady Haversdown supplies the promised reward, plus an extra [[/award 100gp party]] to the party if her daughter is totally uninjured.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Regardless of the outcome, the characters have made an enemy. If they failed to rescue Hesstella, Lady Haversdown is incensed—even more so if the characters fail to find and remove the evidence that Shyllylli planted in the fire temple. Her attitude might be of resentment to actively trying to see the characters’ lives ruined.</p><p>If the characters succeed, Shyllylli redoubles her efforts to bring about their downfall. The characters might return to the Stone in the Fire tavern to question Potash about her betrayal of them… only to find the old dwarf dead from the blade on an assassin. The characters had best watch their backs!</p><aside class=\"tob\"><div class=\"aside-border\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/SidebarBorder2a.webp\" /></div><div class=\"aside-text-content\"><p class=\"title\">Using Creature Codex</p><div class=\"content\"><p>Replace each magma mephit with a devil, fire im</p><p>Replace each animated armor with an agnibarra</p></div></div></aside>"

There are special homes that these poor, lost souls can retire to; places of refuge and compassion for those that might not otherwise receive it. But are these places truly a haven or is there a more sinister purpose festering within their walls?</p><p>This short adventure is designed for five 5th-level characters and features social interaction, and combat. Scaling options are provided for lower and higher-level parties.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>The Instability of Isolation takes place in any large city or area that has a regular and steady influx of adventurers. The specific location isn’t important, so long as it is someplace that makes sense to have a home for those unlucky souls who have been cursed or damaged for their good deeds.</p><p>The Sword’s Respite is a sort of retirement home for adventurers. Adventurers lead difficult lives, often with heavy consequences.</p><p>This is a place for those unable to continue adventuring to live their days. Within there is one individual, Ryland Sable, who is convinced there is more going on within the complex than meets the eye. Unfortunately for Ryland, she is living within the Sword’s Respite and is a victim of the skittering haunt that lurk beneath its halls. Having lost many of her memories, she has difficulties focusing enough to express her fears and has begun to confuse the simulacrums created by the haunt as herself. However, within Ryland’s rambling words is an ugly truth.</p><p>Dark creatures have taken up residence beneath the halls of the Sword’s Respite; feeding off the memories and souls of those that reside within the building, exacerbating the inhabitant’s conditions as they lose parts of themselves forever.</p><h1>Plot Hooks</h1><p>Because this adventure takes place within any major city, there are numerous reasons why the party is in town. Whatever the reason, once having entered the bustling town, the following options are plot hooks for visiting the Sword’s Respite:</p><ul><li><p>Someone within the party has a curse or an illness that is not easily cured. It is common knowledge that the best healers and medical practitioners reside within the compound.</p></li><li><p>Childish signs are posted throughout the town seeking adventurers to help rescue someone named Demelza’s older sister. Payment is one crusty loaf of bread and her favorite stuffed doll. The flyers indicate that she waits for those interested near the market next to the Sword’s Respite.</p></li><li><p>Someone in the party is at the end of their adventuring career and has heard about these places to help adventurers popping up around the region. They go to check it out and see if it is something they are truly interested in.</p></li><li><p>The party happens to be traveling by the Sword’s Respite just as there is a commotion outside. One of the inhabitants is angrily screaming about being ignored before being hustled back inside.</p></li><li><p>A party member has a relative that resides within the establishment and they are visiting them.</p></li></ul><p>Regardless of what hook you use, the party eventually makes their way to the Sword’s Respite and speaks to Demelza.</p><div class=\"flexrow\"><div class=\"flex1\"><h1>A Sister’s Worry</h1><p>The party stands in the market square in front of the Sword’s Respite. A wide range of goods and services are offered and the market bustles with laughter and merchants. The characters are able to purchase whatever goods and services fit this area of the world. Once they are done shopping, they meet Demelza, who waits anxiously outside on the steps of the Sword’s Respite.</p><h2>NPC</h2><p>Demelza Sable (CG female half-elf) — Demelza is a thin child of about ten winters, with wild red hair and a smattering of freckles covering her pert little nose. She anxiously grasps a small, ratty, stuffed doll and is blatantly ignored by other market-goers. The girl is sweet and surprisingly intelligent for her age though she speaks very quickly, twitching and fidgeting as if filled with a thousand bees. Demelza perks up once she sees the party and races over to them.</p><figure class=\"aftpk w100p center\" style=\"margin-top:3rem\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Instability-of-Isolation/Demelza-Sable.webp\" class=\"w100p\" /><figcaption class=\"pic black\">Demelza<br />Sable</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"flex1\"><div class=\"scaling\" style=\"width:95%;margin:auto\"><p class=\"title\">Rumors</p><div class=\"content\"><p>If the party decides to speak to the townsfolk, they pick up the following bits of information:</p><p>“A saintly group of monks and healers run the Sword’s Respite, many of whom used to be adventurers themselves. I guess they know firsthand the troubles that follow that lifestyle.”</p><p>“The Sword’s Respite is a home for those who have dedicated their life to serving others and fighting evils. This doesn’t come without cost. The Respite is for those whose afflictions can’t be cured with traditional means.”</p><p>“The Sword’s Respite is a godsend for most of those adventuring folk who live there. Some of them are a danger to themselves and others. One fellow in there has a demon arm he can’t control that constantly tries to murder people!”</p><p>“The Sword’s Respite attracts the best healers and magic users to help combat the hardest illnesses. People come from all over to study those within the Respite.”</p><p>“It concerns me having all those afflicted people living within the city. I mean, what if they have something contagious?”</p><p>“There is a little girl that has been trying to get people to rescue her sister from the Sword’s Respite. Doesn’t she know that people live there voluntarily?”</p><p>“I think they are doing unwholesome experiments on the residents of the Sword’s Respite. I mean, isn’t that what always happens to adventurers?”</p><p>“There is talk of other cities adopting something similar to the Sword’s Respite. There are lots of people who need the sort of services they offer, right?”</p><p>“The building that the Sword’s Respite uses is the oldest in town. It has had many different functions over the years, but this is the happiest.”</p></div></div></div></div><p>Demelza asks the group if they have arrived to help rescue her sister, Ryland Sable, who is held hostage in the Sword’s Respite. The girl frantically pulls out one of the hand-drawn posters that have been plastered around town to wave at the group. When given the chance, she explains that Ryland left her in the care of their aunt, who is a sweet lady but isn’t Ryland. Demelza is convinced her sister would not have left her if she had any choice and believes the Sword’s Respite is holding her sister hostage. When pressed, Demelza admits that her sister is a powerful warrior who came back home from an exciting adventure covered in black, strange, swirling marks that never seem to stop moving. If the party helps her save her big sister, she offers them all she has — a single, crusty piece of bread and her stuffed doll.</p><p>Should the party agree to seek out Ryland, Demelza suggests they speak with Pernella, as she is the head caretaker of the Respite. Demelza admits that Pernella has been kind to her and allows her onto the compound. However, the child is convinced the person that she saw was not really her sister as she acted ‘weird’ and was too quiet.</p><h1>Entering the Sword’s Respite</h1><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.4UpDjRlGUXsXnUti] scene.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.tuSCN4eRXDaYWCyb cite=false caption=false]{Entering the Sword Respite}</p><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.oWphWJu4B6XFWY8o cite=false caption=false]</p><h2>Area 1: Reception</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.tIbCFAbG7GttqQH5 caption=false cite=false]{Reception}</p><h2>Area 2: Lounge</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.8Qt9wU2vTEaNo2Xl cite=false caption=false]{Lounge}</p><h2>Area 3: Pantry</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.0XC3rHgUAYSnUl1L cite=false caption=false]{Pantry}</p><h2>Area 4: Eatery</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.Ajvz0f3hV3VPPS7K cite=false caption=false]{Eatery}</p><h2>Area 5: Kitchen</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.NUaP1w7vhaJ1sprL cite=false caption=false]{Kitchen}</p><h2>Area 6: Storage Area</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.MrQP3T43LDEgqs3D cite=false caption=false]{Storage Area}</p><h2>Area 7: Fitness Room</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.S6ba5zDDWrDQnF1K cite=false caption=false]{Fitness Room}</p><h2>Area 8: The Zoo</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.S6ba5zDDWrDQnF1K cite=false caption=false]{Fitness Room}</p><h2>Area 9 and 10: Resident Rooms</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.5HM7Z3Ndqj86jJ5D caption=false cite=false]{Resident Rooms}</p><h2>Area 11: Haunting the Hunted</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.kRtfBAx0PSp21NRE.JournalEntryPage.InKz5NG1Vyp6tpch cite=false caption=false]{Haunting the Hunted}</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Should the party defeat the skittering haunts, Demelza is very grateful and promptly pays the agreed upon reward—one crusty and slightly moldy piece of bread and her dirty doll. If the party refuses either, she is elated and gives them a hug, saying when she is a mighty druid, she’ll repay them properly.</p><p>Pernella is shocked at the discovery of the cavern below the Respite, promising that she and others of their order plan to explore the area further to make sure there is no remaining danger. Heartbroken, she states that they will immediately begin to try to find a way to repair the souls of those who fell victim to the skittering haunts. She then respectfully asks the characters to keep what transpired to themselves, explaining that since this complex is the first of its kind in the area, having such an atrocity become common knowledge could jeopardize having similar endeavors. If they agree without prompting, Pernella gives the characters an additional [[/award 5gp each]] and tells them that if they ever have any issues or ailments, she and the other monks will happily do what they can.</p><h1>Developments</h1><p>Should the GM wish to continue the adventure, the following ideas are stepping stones:</p><ul><li><p>One of the inhabitants has crucial information but this memory has been eaten by the haunt. They are the confident of a king or lord and have knowledge of some massive calamity that is about to befall the area. The characters need to find a way to return the missing memory as spells are not working.</p></li><li><p>One of the inhabitants is a clone but the haunt has eaten that memory. They are convinced that someone is going around impersonating them and asks the characters to put a stop to it.</p></li><li><p>A portion of the haunt was able to escape into some deeper tunnel complex, which the party discovers upon the monster’s defeat. What lies within this system of tunnels is anyone’s guess.</p></li><li><p>Discover the original or future purpose of the Sword’s Respite. Was it something sinister? Was it something grand that should be restored? What waring political factions have plans for this building?</p></li></ul>"

In the center of the room is a large, purple, pulsing monstrosity. Too many spindly legs jut out in all directions from is bulbous body and a bleeding gash splits its body in two. Delicate strands of an oily web shoot outwards, disappearing into various cracks and crevices of the cavern.</p><h3>General Features</h3><p>This irregular cavern chamber is 60 by 70 feet with a 100-foot tall ceiling. The area is faintly lit by small fissures in the ceiling that lead to the building complex above. The floor and the walls are smooth; a response to the creatures’ many legs running from one area to another.</p><p>The true threat is two <span class=\"pk-npc\">@UUID[Actor.gfvPZNpLexz9RX04]{skittering haunts}</span> that live underneath the building, having been accidently brought to the Sword’s Respite when they were tiny memory spiders. Once they became large enough, they slowly began feasting on the inhabitants using their web of mimicry and memory syphon abilities.</p><p>Characters that succeed on a [[/skill arc 15]] check have heard rumors of foul experiments that created highly intelligent creatures that feed off the souls and loneliness of their victims.</p><p>Once the characters are within the haunts’ range they attack, knowing that this group poses a threat to the easy and pampered living they have secured. As they fight, the creatures often use their web of mimicry to transform a web into someone the adventurers have met during their investigation. These simulacra plead with the characters to leave them alone, trying everything in their power to distract and cause confusion. They do things such as cry when hit or angrily yell, reminding the characters of any blossoming friendships.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>The summon activity of the Skittering Haunt will summon another Skittering Haunt, but the tokens are linked to the actor, like the PCs, so hitting one will also hurt the other.<br />That also means that if you try to transform the skittering haunts, or their simulacrum, by draging a creature on their sheets, all of them will be transformed.</p><p>If you prefer to be able to transform the simulacrum into other creatures, then you must unlink the skiterring haunt from its token. This is done by unclicking the \"link actor data\" on the Identity tab of the token.

On a failed save, the adventurer has disadvantage on their next attack roll.</p><p>Being highly intelligent, if things begin to go poorly for the haunts, they attempt to flee deeper into the unknown cavern complex.

We recommend reading the adventure at least once before running it.</p><h1>Important NPCs</h1><p><em><strong>Delus</strong></em> – Delar’s son. He perished in a freak rock fall accident at the rock quarry, where he worked. There are no strange events around his death. Delus purchased an insurance contract several months before his death. The contract paid his surviving wife Ositi 1,250 gp, which allows her to live comfortably for several years. It also included the disposition of the body, at no charge.</p><figure class=\"aftpk right w250px\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Spare-Parts/Delar.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic\">Delar</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>Delar</strong></em> (LN female human) – This is the first NPC met at the harbor district. Her son has passed away and she doesn’t know what happened to the body, offering a 150 gp reward for information or its return. Delar and her daughter-in-law are not close. Delar is not aware of the insurance contract Delus signed, nor of the 1,250 gp Ositi was paid.</p><p><em><strong>Ositi</strong></em> (NG female human) – Delus’s surviving spouse and Delar’s daughter-in-law. Ositi recently fell down a flight of stairs and wears a cast on her left leg. She is not concerned about Delar’s missing body. She doesn’t reveal anything about the gold or insurance policy unless persuaded or intimidated to do so. If this occurs, she may provide a copy of the signed insurance contract which lists an address in the harbor. She also explains the body disposition was included in the insurance contract and she was paid 1,250 gp.</p><p><em><strong>Dandy Hollowhair</strong></em> (LN male halfling noble) – Owner of Hollowhair Quarry and Delar’s employer. Dandy is a well-liked member of the community. He is cooperative and there is nothing out of the ordinary at the quarry. Delus’s death was an accident.</p><p><em><strong>Filee</strong></em> (NG nonbinary half-orc noble) – Filee is the administrator of the morgue. They state the body was picked up and signed for, all in accordance with Ositi’s wishes. There is nothing unusual occurring at the morgue.</p><p><em><strong>Pothus</strong></em> (CN female human thug) – The manager of Nolu Arena. Pothus purchases flesh golems and their control rings from a disguised Cantar for 250 gp. In addition, Cantar receives 20 percent of the weekly arena revenue. The flesh golem fights have been very successful. Pothus’s transactions with Cantar are legal.</p><p><span class=\"pk-npc\"><em>Cantar</em></span> (CN female gnome mage) – Cantar is the flesh golem creator and insurance dealer. She uses the bodies to create flesh golems, which she sells to Pothus for 250 gp. She also receives 20 percent of the arena’s weekly revenue. The insurance contracts are legal. Cantar uses disguise self to keep her identity secret when dealing with Pothus.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.1evHBaJvyy2eRiwF] scene.<br />The pins and legend are hidden by default for the player.

Cantar, a gnome necromancer, decided to set herself up as a supplier of flesh golems to a city that didn’t know it needed them. Pothu, manager of Nolu Arena, a small venue known for hosting blood-sport, was very interested in a venture that would increase seats at bouts. As a result, after a chance meeting with a disguised Cantar, the two became business partners.</p><p>Flesh golems don’t spring out of thin air, however, so the ever-enterprising Cantar started a side business selling life insurance with the rider that she gets the body after the policy holder dies. Things have gone well; in fact, Cantar has just collected on a policy.</p><h2>What Has Happened Until Now</h2><p>A few months after signing Cantar’s life insurance policy, Delar was killed in a natural accident, occurring at the stone quarry where he worked. Ositi viewed his body at the morgue and collected on the 1,250 gp insurance policy. Cantar, always wary of being a necromancer caught in a city, disguised herself, went to the morgue, signed for the body, and then transported it to her warehouse, where she makes flesh golems.</p><p>Pothus met with a disguised Cantar and the two struck a deal. Cantar would supply Pothus flesh golems for the arena fights, and Pothus would pay Cantar a sum of gold and a percentage of the arena’s weekly income.</p><p>Delus is upset that she has not viewed her son’s dead body. She also wants to make sure his body is being respected. Ositi has been less than helpful with these matters. Delus wants help locating Delar’s body and she wants to know what happened to it.</p><h1>Plot Hook</h1><p>Delus, a human stonewright, died on the job. When his mother arrived at the morgue to claim the body, the attendants said that the body had already been taken away. The grieving mother, Delar, hires the party to find her son’s corpse.</p><h1>Part 1: In Mourning</h1><p>The party meets @UUID[Actor.1ynHq8ImArP9jZ4Q]{Delar}, a textile broker, in her home (Area 1). Delar tells the party that her only son, Delus, died and his body went missing from a local morgue. She offers 150 gold if the party finds out what happened. She also gives the party the following information:</p><ul><li><p>There’s a rumor of flesh golems at Nolu Arena. “What if they carved him up?”</p></li><li><p>Ositi, Delus’s widow, hasn’t said anything about the body going missing. “Maybe all this is her fault.”</p></li><li><p>People have been getting kidnapped to force debt repayment. “But he could always have contacted me for help!”</p></li></ul><h2>Appeasing Delar</h2><p>Perhaps unusual in these sorts of investigations, everything that has occurred is legal. Still, Delar wants to know where her son’s body rests.</p><p>If the party tell Delar that her son’s body was acquired legally, but they have not discovered its location, Delar only offers to pay [[/award 25gp]] for the party’s time, since they didn’t locate his body.</p><p>If the party discovers that Canter has the body and they agree that it was obtained legally, they may wish to end the investigation. If they tell Delar where the body is located, and that Canter is a necromancer, Delar pays the agreed upon 150 gp. She also states that she will discuss this matter with the church.</p><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">GM Notes</p><div class=\"content\"><p>If the party goes to see Ositi, go to Part 2A.</p><p>If the party goes to the morgue where Delus’ body should have been, go to Part 2B.</p><p>If the party goes to Nolu Arena, go to Part 2C.</p><p>The optional encounter in Part 4: Gargoyles Amok! can be run at any time after the party has talked to Delar.</p></div></div><h1>Part 2a: To the Widow!</h1><p>Ositi is at home (Area 2) when the party arrives. She has recently broken her leg and wears a cast. She tells the party:</p><ul><li><p>She’s not worried about the missing body. She visited the morgue to confirm it was Delus.</p></li><li><p>She’s sad that Delar’s sad, but she and her mother-in-law were never close. She’s not invested in Delar’s happiness.</p></li></ul><p>A character succeeding on a [[/skill ins 14]] check believes Ositi is hiding something. A successful [[/skill per 14]] check convinces her to reveal:</p><ul><li><p>Delus had purchased an insurance contract three months before he died.</p></li><li><p>The insurance paid Ositi 1,250 gp and has given her financial security for a substantial time.</p></li><li><p>She didn’t want to say anything earlier about the 1,250 gp because she didn’t want Delar to hassle her about sharing the money. (“That woman doesn’t need it—she has everything already!”)</p></li><li><p>The insurance contract covered the disposition of Delus’s body. (“I didn’t have to pay the burial fee. I know it’s small, but rent keeps going up.”)</p></li></ul><p>Successful [[/skill per 14]] checks convince Ositi that the party won’t take the information back to Delar, and she shows the party the insurance contract, which includes an address of an office closer to the harbor.</p><p>If the party goes to the address near the harbor, go to Part 3: Spare Parts.</p><figure class=\"aftpk left w250px\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Spare-Parts/Filee.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic\">Filee</figcaption></figure><h1>Part 2b: Viewing Dead People</h1><p>At the local morgue (Area 3), the party is directed to @UUID[Actor.At1CG6R0dhmU624T]{Filee}, the administrator on duty, who tells the party:</p><ul style=\"margin-left:260px\"><li><p>This body was picked up and signed for, but on review, the signature was illegible.</p></li><li><p>The party is welcome to investigate if they choose. Filee calls their Personal Assistant into the office. “Qith (NG female tiefling) will show you around.”</p></li></ul><p>Note: The morgue is a two-story structure, with offices and viewing and waiting rooms on the main floor, and body cold-storage in the basement. There is nothing odd or out of place; Filee runs a tight ship.</p><h1 class=\"clear\">Part 2c: At the Arena</h1><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.aIh0T3WM6Ch9JJXA] scene.</p></article></div><figure class=\"aftpk w75p center\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Spare-Parts/Arena-Day-30x34.webp\" /></figure><p>At Nolu Arena (Area 4), the bout is close to starting when the party arrives. The manager, @UUID[Actor.Jjqogl2pyaqAS0tu]{Pothus} has the control rings for the golems, so she must be on-site during the bout. Having no time to answer questions beforehand, she offers the party free entrance to watch the match.</p><p>During the match, one of the @UUID[Actor.c47H5AX1ydqDn9Rx]{golems} goes berserk and attempts to attack the spectators, climbing the wall and entering the stands. Whether the party helps or not, after two rounds of actions, Pothus comes within range of the flesh golem and uses the control ring to contain the chaos. If the party helped, Pothus is more friendly to [[/skill per 14]] checks to get information. If the party did not help, she is distracted, and the DC increases to [[/skill per 17]]{17}. Pothus cannot be intimidated, especially since the crowd loved the entire performance, including the chaos.</p><figure class=\"aftpk right w250px\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Spare-Parts/Pothus.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic\" style=\"left:170px\">Pothus</figcaption></figure><p>After the match, Pothus tells the party:</p><ul><li><p>She is very excited to have something the other arenas don’t. “Flesh golems are the next THING!”</p></li><li><p>The creator of the golems is secretive, and wisely so, because “some people are jealous and don’t want change.”</p></li><li><p>A different person delivers the flesh golem and control ring each time she purchases a flesh golem. (Cantar uses her disguise self spell to keep her identity secret)</p></li></ul><p>Pothus has additional information, which may include:</p><ul><li><p>She purchases the flesh golems for 250 gp, plus 20 percent of the weekly arena earnings.</p></li><li><p>These battles bring in nearly 50 gp per day.</p></li><li><p>Each week, a different person comes to the arena to collect the 20 percent share of the weekly income.</p></li></ul><p>Successful [[/skill dec per 14]] checks convince Pothus that the party is serious about wanting just information, as opposed to stopping the flesh golem creation process, and in return she gives them Cantar’s warehouse address in the harbor.</p><h1>Part 2d: The Quarry</h1><p>If the party goes to Delus’ workplace (Dandy Quarry—a rock quarry to the northeast, out beyond the cannery district), the manager, Dandy Hollowhair (LN male halfling <strong>noble</strong>) is cooperative. He states there was an unexpected rockfall, and four workers died. There is nothing suspicious about the death. If the party inquires with other townsfolk, they learn Dandy is a respected individual, supplying jobs to the community and he treats his employees very well.</p><h1>Part 3: Spare Parts</h1><p>The harbor address is a warehouse (Area 5) near the water.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.h9Q19PekTXgLCMAa] scene.</p></article></div><figure class=\"aftpk w75p center\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Spare-Parts/Wharehouse-gm.webp\" /></figure><p>The office is a 20-foot-square room, with a second 10-foot-square office through a connecting door. There are paintings on the walls, as well as a large wall tapestry (both are animated, and may attack if the party attempts to enter without authorization), and a suit of armor (@UUID[Actor.5pIiWtKpg4PLoeET]{animated armor}) that serves as after-hours security in the corner opposite the main entrance. The six paintings use the flying sword stat block but deal bludgeoning damage. The tapestry is a @UUID[Actor.SOo98QNRxWVML5DC]{rug of smothering} with 55 hit points.</p><h2>Entering the Warehouse</h2><p>There are no windows and two doors; one at the front and one at the back. The front door is trapped with a glyph of @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{sleep} (casts 3rd-level sleep spell if triggered, [[/save wis 15]] saving throw to avoid). A successful [[/skill arc 14]] check disarms the trap and reveals that the door is a fake. If the entire party is trapped, Cantar’s assistant brings the party members into the warehouse. The back door is locked but not trapped.</p><p>Once inside, the 40-foot-square warehouse resembles an operating suite. Surgical tools and gurneys abound. Searching the warehouse reveals body parts in containers. A successful [[/skill prc 14]] check notices strange glyphs and symbols on the floors and walls. A character succeeding on a [[/skill arc 14]] check realizes these symbols are used by necromancers.</p><p><strong>Arriving During the Day:</strong> They find an office staffed by @UUID[Actor.VWiRp3a6I4OaD4lo]{Ella}, (LN female human noble) who informs the party that the boss is out of the office for the day, and is returning the next day. Ella answers general questions about the insurance contracts. She can’t provide a copy, but she can supply proof by way of a payment ledger that Ositi was paid 1,250 gp for her Delar’s death.</p><p><strong>Arriving at Night:</strong> Combat in this encounter is optional. If the party comes back after dark, only the animated objects pose a threat.</p><p>After resolving the combat or burglary encounter, successful [[/skill inv 14]] checks find the following:</p><ul><li><p>Hand-drawn anatomy diagrams in a locked and trapped drawer of the agent’s desk (an acid trap, [[/skill slt 14]] check to disarm; [[/save dex 14]] save halves [[/damage 3d10 acid average]]).</p></li><li><p>A blank insurance contract in the unlocked and trapped administrative assistant’s desk (a lightning trap, [[/skill arc 14]] check to disarm; [[/save dex 14]] save halves [[/damage 3d10 lightning average]] damage). The blank insurance contract uses the address of this office/location. The contract appears to be a reasonably legal document. It states who is insured, the name of the beneficiary, and the amount to be paid at death. It also includes a note that the disposition of the body is taken care of at no extra cost.</p></li></ul><figure class=\"aftpk w250px left\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Spare-Parts/Cantar.webp\" /><figcaption>Cantar</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Next Day:</strong> When the party enters, @UUID[Actor.eqlEM9e7fQHZajHz]{Cantar} is disassembling a body (Delus). There are other body parts in their respective containers. There are also two suits of @UUID[Actor.5pIiWtKpg4PLoeET]{animated armor} (which animate and come to Cantar’s assistance when called) within 30 feet of where Cantar is working.</p><p>If the party attacks, Cantar casts @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ATo0Eb63TDtnu6iA]{animate objects}, which animates several of the surgical instruments in the room, creating 10 Tiny allies appearing as pliers, knives, clamps, syringes, and needles. Also, Cantar has a personal warning device which prevents her from being surprised and gives her advantage on initiative checks. If she is killed, the device crumbles into pieces of decayed bone and sinew.</p><p>Given the opportunity, Cantar makes her case of legally obtaining the body, and offers a copy of the contract to the party. Successful [[/skill inv 14]] checks show that the contract is sound, almost as if written by a qualified and capable fiend. The party can choose to go their way with a copy of the insurance contract, buy into Cantar’s project, or any other option that makes sense.</p><p>Cantar doesn’t think about this, as her goal is to get back to work; however, if the encounter is resolved peacefully, she offers the party her staff, a @UUID[Item.xKfAcKPs5QykVwIm]{quarterstaff +1}, as a gift.</p><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Scaling Suggestions</p><div class=\"content\"><p><strong>Weaker: </strong>No animated creatures, other than the animated objects Cantar creates, join the battle.</p><p><strong>Stronger: </strong>@UUID[Actor.DaziDfSbxtVmoKRa]{Cantar} has 72 hit points, and a @UUID[Actor.oGsyQA0eVpVe4lXd]{putrid haunt} (Tome of Beasts) animates, rising from a covered gurney an fighting by Cantar’s side.</p></div></div><h1>Part 4: Gargoyles Amok!</h1><p>(Optional Combat)</p><p>In the docks area, the party sees a @UUID[Actor.tgwOFulDUphVgOYQ]{male halfling} engaged in energetic discussion with a fair-haired male human (a @UUID[Actor.h7T9rFFyWwOGJBoi]{mage}). The discussion abruptly ends when three @UUID[Actor.srkIDGzOn7PgzDPt]{gargoyles} swoop down on the halfling, taking swipes at the party along the way.</p><p><strong>Tactics:</strong> The gargoyles and the mage fight as a team with the goal of taking the halfling. He owes a debt, and they are taking payment out of his skin. If things aren’t going well, the mage attempts to escape. If killed, the mage has a ring of spell storing that has one remaining charge of acid arrow.</p><p>If rescued, the halfling mutters something about “always read the fine print” and hurriedly leaves.</p><p>@embed[Actor.eqlEM9e7fQHZajHz statblock caption=false cite=false]{Cantar}</p><p></p>"

The residents weren’t powerful enough to destroy the demon, but a prophet of the time foresaw a future where the ever-warring tribes of orcs and humans would band together to end Kazzlezan for good. Buoyed by the prospect, a human sage named Tonwin crafted an object which could imprison the demon until the prophesized time arrived. The Crown of Authority successfully bound Kazzlezan within a large ruby set in front and the crown was disassembled into three parts. The central piece with the ruby was placed inside the burial tomb of a forgotten king and the other two pieces were gifted to the rulers of the humans and orcs without explanation beyond being items of great importance. Neither side knew the other possessed a similar piece. If all three sections were ever reunited, Kazzlezan would be freed, presumably to be defeated by the combined might of humans and orcs.</p>",

It features social interaction and combat with rewards for those who don’t cross swords first and ask questions later.</p><h1>Background</h1><h2>GM Background</h2><p>Long ago, a demon known as Kazzlezan found its way from its dark pit and ravaged the countryside around where Tonwindale now stands. The residents weren’t powerful enough to destroy the demon, but a prophet of the time foresaw a future where the ever-warring tribes of orcs and humans would band together to end Kazzlezan for good. Buoyed by the prospect, a human sage named Tonwin crafted an object which could imprison the demon until the prophesized time arrived. The Crown of Authority successfully bound Kazzlezan within a large ruby set in front and the crown was disassembled into three parts. The central piece with the ruby was placed inside the burial tomb of a forgotten king and the other two pieces were gifted to the rulers of the humans and orcs without explanation beyond being items of great importance. Neither side knew the other possessed a similar piece. If all three sections were ever reunited, Kazzlezan would be freed, presumably to be defeated by the combined might of humans and orcs.</p><p>Over time, Kazzlezan’s prison has weakened to the point where the demon could subtly influence the outside world. It created a rumor regarding the pieces of the crown that, if restored, held the power to utterly destroy the opposing faction. The piece in their possession is the “key” to unlocking the one in the tomb. Both parties believe this to be true and now seek what they understand to be the “second half” of the crown within the tomb, wary of the other faction attempting to thwart their goal.</p><h2>Player Background</h2><p>War with the orcs of the Ember Hills has been a way of life for decades for the people of Tonwindale. Now, rumors surrounding an ancient relic have sparked hope that the orcs can be defeated once and for all. All that remains is finding and securing the other half of the relic. Unfortunately, these rumors have spread and it’s likely the orcs are trying to locate the object as well to keep it out of the hands of Tonwindale.</p><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Making it Your Own</p><div class=\"content\"><p>Race for the Crown is designed to fit into nearly any campaign. Simply substitute Tonwindale and the Ember Hills with two long-warring, neighboring locations in your own world. Don’t like orcs, or they don’t fit in your setting? No problem! The competing adventuring party of orcs can be any race or faction that makes sense for your setting. Just eliminate or replace the Aggressive trait in the stat blocks and you’re done!</p></div></div><h1>Plot Hooks</h1><p>The following ideas can help start the adventuring party along the path.</p><p><em><strong>For King and Country.</strong></em> If one of the characters is from Tonwindale or the vicinity, the city’s ruler beseeches them to retrieve the valuable artifact so the people of Tonwindale can finally live a life of peace.</p><p><em><strong>Cold Hard Cash.</strong></em> The leadership of Tonwindale is desperate! They’re willing to pay handsomely for a group of adventurers to retrieve an object of great value, but time is of the essence.</p><p><em><strong>Relic.</strong></em> The party comes into possession of a piece of the crown and discovers the other half is hidden in a tomb nearby.</p><h1>Adventure</h1><h2>Meeting the Leadership</h2><p>Once your desired plot hook is established, it’s time to learn the details of the mission. If the characters are unfamiliar with Tonwindale, brief them about the Player Background information above before meeting with the city’s leaders. If you are using “Relic” as your hook, skip to A Forgotten Tomb below.</p><p class=\"desc\">“Thank you for coming.” Regent Valessa Erkin sits tall on the throne while young Prince Arex fidgets in his slightly smaller seat next to hers. “I assume you’ve been briefed on the importance of your task at hand?”</p><p>If the characters aren’t familiar with the Player Background information, Regent Erkin can summarize it for them. Otherwise, she continues:</p><div class=\"desc\"><figure class=\"aftpk right w200px\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Race-for-the-Crown/Crown-Single-Piece.webp\" class=\"w100p\" /><figcaption class=\"pic black\" style=\"top:50px\">Piece of the<br />Crown of<br />Aythority</figcaption></figure><p>“Excellent.” She reaches down and pulls a golden half-circlet from beside her seat cushion. “This is our half of the Crown of Authority. While it is a priceless relic in its own right, it’s main worth right now is being the key to unlock its other half. Once united, the Crown of Authority is fabled to grant us the power to defeat our enemies and end this conflict which has gone on for far too long. Reginald Trueheart will bear this piece and accompany you to the tomb.” At this, an elderly knight steps forward from the side of the throne room and accepts the gleaming crown fragment, bowing to Regent Erkin.</p></div><p>The regent then bids the party to make haste as she believes the orcs are already plotting to thwart their efforts. She answers any questions they may have, though she seems agitated by any delays. The town provides any mundane supplies and equipment the party requires before they set off.</p><p>Reginald Trueheart was a trusted royal guard, now retired. Use the <strong>veteran</strong> stat block for him. He will defend his kingdom’s piece of the crown until his last breath and doesn’t part with it for any reason outside the tomb. Once inside, if the party has proven trustworthy, he can be persuaded with a successful [[/skill per 18]] check to pass it off to a party member for a sound reason. If he becomes aware of the orcish opposition, he advocates for combat rather than negotiation.</p><h2>A Forgotten Tomb</h2><p>The tomb lies beyond a forest, nearly a day’s journey from Tonwindale, in a series of foothills adjacent to the Ember Hills. The trip is uneventful, unless the GM chooses to have the party encounter an orcish patrol or some other wildlife along the way.</p><p class=\"desc\">As daylight begins to fade, you see some hills rise through the trees and know you are close. A booming whump you feel in your chest emanates from your objective ahead, followed shortly by a second concussive blast.</p><p>The orcs have arrived ahead of the party and set off explosives to block anyone from following them into the tomb to claim the prize.</p><p class=\"desc\">You break through the last of the trees to see the remnants of a cloud of smoke and dust billowing from a cave entrance mostly concealed by thick brush. The sound of tumbling rocks echoes within.</p><h3>Kazzlezan’s Prison</h3><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.TRFiPu7QZCtmUimg] scene.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.tHlRQ35EYCzYQLuo.JournalEntryPage.EFHFiSSE6sjVjkDm cite=false caption=false]{Kazzlezan's Prison}</p><p>@embed[JournalEntry.tHlRQ35EYCzYQLuo.JournalEntryPage.6Eod4Iq3i3JUseLW cite=false caption=false classes=\"w75p center\"]{Map}</p><h4>Area 1: Entrance</h4><p>@embed[JournalEntry.tHlRQ35EYCzYQLuo.JournalEntryPage.h6wo5r3kBrTCklYi cite=false caption=false]{Entrance}</p><h4>Area 2: Trial of Wit</h4><p>@embed[JournalEntry.tHlRQ35EYCzYQLuo.JournalEntryPage.jnnQENObQjzfuT1l cite=false caption=false]{Trial of Wit}</p><h4>Area 3: Chasm and Bridges</h4><p>@embed[JournalEntry.tHlRQ35EYCzYQLuo.JournalEntryPage.CXGUwpTspzzchn86 cite=false caption=false]{Chasm &amp; Bridges}</p><h4>Area 4: Kazzlezan’s End</h4><p>@embed[JournalEntry.tHlRQ35EYCzYQLuo.JournalEntryPage.q3RPhl8xlvLRrxOd cite=false caption=false]{Kazzlezan's End}</p><h1>Aftermath</h1><p>If the characters succeed in defeating Kazzlezan with the help of the orcs, they may have sowed the seeds for a peace between the two peoples and their efforts can be rewarded by both sides of the conflict. It is left up to the DM to decide appropriate treasure to bestow upon the party which best fits your campaign.</p><p>If they manage to defeat Kazzlezan, but also destroyed the orcs in the process, their efforts are heralded by the people of Tonwindale. The crown, however, is not what the regent had hoped for to end their conflict with the orcs.</p><p>If Kazzlezan prevailed and defeated the party or forced them to retreat, a new frightening threat has been unleashed on the land. Once the demon claws its way out of the prison complex, Kazzlezan begins wreaking havoc on anything in its path. Perhaps this, or another group of adventurers can save Tonwindale and the Ember Hills from the demon.</p><h1>Creatures</h1><h2>Orcish Party</h2><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>All different versions of the orcs within the party can be found in the Actors tab.</p></article></div><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Orcish Aggressiveness</p><div class=\"content\"><p>The orcs all share a common trait.

Scaling options are provided for weaker and stronger parties.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>The elven mage Albern, self-styled “the Ingenious,” was outlawed from his academy for unlawful experimentation with the dead. Bitter and angry, he fled to a nearby cave and vowed to continue his experiments until he could create a creature powerful enough to enact revenge upon his former colleagues.</p><p>Albern’s attempt to create a homemade zombie ettin by attaching an additional head to an ogre zombie was technically successful—but unfortunately for him, the enhanced zombie killed him in a fit of mindless rage.</p><h1>Plot Hooks</h1><p>Whether this adventure is used for a standalone session or as part of a long-term campaign, here are some suggestions for drawing the players into the action:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Bones on the Road.</strong></em> While the characters are en route to their next destination, they come across two acolytes being attacked by a group of three skeletons. More bones scattered alongside the road lead to a cave beneath the rocky cliffs.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Grotesque Glimpse.</strong></em> A goat herder approaches the characters to tell them about a large two-headed figure she’s seen prowling the hills at night. If they can make sure the monster won’t threaten her herd, she’ll offer them one of her three magical ivory goat figurines of wonderous power.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Minion Elimination.</strong></em> If the characters are bent on thwarting a particular villain, introduce a rumor than their enemy is being assisted by a necromancer reputed to live in a certain cave. If they can take down the necromancer, they’ll prevent undead reinforcements from plaguing them in the future.</p></li></ul><h1>Albern’s Cave</h1><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.O8Sy4RDqFcL5KFnB] scene.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.iHEmox7s6LydZOSf.JournalEntryPage.UW6BkNy2Xd11Z31t caption=false cite=false]{Albern's Cave}</p><p>@embed[JournalEntry.iHEmox7s6LydZOSf.JournalEntryPage.0BWnUQ0HEyVilD6E caption=false cite=false classes=\"w75p center\"]{Cave Map}</p><h2>Area 1.

Living creatures regain half the normal amount of hit points from any effects that restore hit points, and undead creatures regain 10 hit points at the start of their turns.</p><h3>Talking Head</h3><p>Although Albern was able to attach an additional head to the body of an ogre zombie, his magic was unable to animate the head—until his creation killed him, and the necromancer’s own consciousness was drawn into the extra head.</p><p>Zombies usually can’t speak, but the magic that siphoned Albern’s consciousness into the additional head allows him to talk through its relatively intact mouth.

I can’t do anything while I’m trapped in here, but just finish this brute off and put me back in my body! Hurry—before it gets you, too!</p><p>The necromancer entreats the characters to assist him, promising them magical secrets, wealth, and loyal service if they’ll kill the zombie ettin and use the <em>spell scroll of revivify</em> from the @UUID[JournalEntry.L0kQ4oRsNAXRqIlU.JournalEntryPage.10ncvUS1uFbQT1Wi#area-4.-laboratory]{laboratory} to capture his consciousness as soon as the zombie is dead.

See the Basic Rules for the rules on using spell scrolls, especially if the characters are 4th-level or lower.</p><h3>Treasure</h3><p>If Albern survives, he thanks the characters profusely—and sincerely—though he also expresses his disappointment that his “technically successful” experiment backfired so spectacularly. He offers the characters the <em>@UUID[Item.bHBItn3QnMDsCla7]{potion of resistance}</em> to poison from his laboratory (only slightly put out if they already took it) and [[/award 75gp]].</p><p>Otherwise, a pouch tied to his robes contains [[/award 90gp 120sp]].</p>"

It is set in the city of Anchorstone.</p><h1>Monsters</h1><p>The monsters in this adventure are sourced from the <em>Tome of Beasts</em> and <em>Creature Codex</em> by Kobold Press. See @UUID[JournalEntry.BRULjDHJTMRrbAWA] for stat blocks.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>Anchorstone is a prosperous city on the shores of the Twisted Sea. About a century ago, it was home to a gnome called Willima Clunkspindle, reputed to be the greatest artificer of the age, and certainly the most eccentric. Willima built an imposing stronghold in the middle of town, called the Bastion of Oil and Brass.</p><p>Willima took offense to something the burgomaster said and responded by stealing the @UUID[Item.mifX7CiLFGbNqK1D]{Mace of Ostarius}, a ceremonial item borne by the mayor since time immemorial. It is greatly valued by the townsfolk, as tradition says that Anchorstone can only prosper when the burgomaster possesses the mace.</p><p>Willima left a message stating that the item could be found somewhere in the Bastion of Oil and Brass, which only opens its doors once every 25 years, and then for a mere 25 hours. She then disappeared and was never seen in the town again.</p><h1>Synopsis</h1><p>The characters must make their way through the Bastion of Oil and Brass, solving puzzles, avoiding traps, fighting clockwork creatures, and collecting pieces of a key. If they make it to the final room and assemble the key correctly, the Mace of Ostarius is revealed.</p><h1>Getting Started</h1><p>Over the previous century, the Bastion has opened three times. Many brave souls have ventured inside but none have returned. The Bastion is due to open again next week, and the burgomaster is offering a rich prize of [[/award 800gp]] to anyone who can retrieve the Mace of Ostarius.</p><h1>The Bastion of Oil and Brass</h1><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.UKWIop9gc8fp9xLp] scene.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.bErKvtaPWMRo27WC.JournalEntryPage.YaDIjdc23ChyqiMj cite=false caption=false]{The Bastion of Oil and Brass}</p><p>@embed[JournalEntry.bErKvtaPWMRo27WC.JournalEntryPage.ayV8jvIC8ENOJa8v cite=false caption=false]{Bastion map}</p><h2>Area 1.

Headley</p></div><p class=\"time\">Estimated run-time: 2 to 3 hours</p><p>This short adventure is designed for five 6th-level characters and features social interaction, exploration, and combat.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>Alina, youngest daughter of a noble family, showed signs of magical aptitude in her early teens and was apprenticed to Master Wizard Roondar Quinnius. Over the years, the princess and her family exchanged many letters, and Alina often visited. She has served her parents and their court well, but always returned to Master Roondar to continue her studies.</p><p>A little over a year ago, Master Roondar took possession of an emerald green scrying orb. Having several such orbs already, he gave this one to Alina to study and learn the arts of divination. Unfortunately, the orb was cursed. The more Alina experimented with it, the more the curse transformed her until she became a green dragon in form as well as temperament.

Alina’s parents haven’t heard from their daughter in six months. With rumors of a dragon floating around, they have tasked the characters with bringing Alina safely home.</p><p>The heroes hear rumors of a green dragon that recently took possession of a wizard’s tower just outside the town of Howling Rock.</p><p>The heroes are passing through the town of Howling Rock and hear from the locals about the dragon menacing the area, and the missing noblewoman the townsfolk consider “their princess.” The dragon leaves the town alone except for demanding books, jewelry, and pastries but it’s also eating the local sheep, and now the town has run out of books, jewels, and flour.</p><p>The heroes witness the green dragon fly overhead, headed for a foliage-wrapped tower in the distance.</p><h1>Approaching the Tower</h1><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.b4LphVfleJ1l2U5A] scene.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.CLGsBzvBFvCgIGrx cite)false caption=false]{Approaching the Tower}</p><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.QA4sxCt1TAU44PMy cite=false caption=false]{Map}</p><h2>Area 1A The Dining Hall</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.9Z9BDNjh5ydSZp9R caption=false cite=false]{The Dining Hall}</p><h2>Area 1B The Kitchen</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.5vC0o5v1yFkwvubY cite=false caption=false]{The Kitchen}</p><h2>Area 1C The Larder</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.zossPlbrULmdz5oy cite=false caption=false]{The Larder}</p><h2>Area 2A The Entry</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.xvL623qiV4Ugnolr cite=false caption=false]{The Entry}</p><h2>Area 2B The Guest Room</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.GsmpqNFqGa4uXsJg cite=false caption=false]{The Guest Room}</p><h2>Area 2C The Bath</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.wFziF1FFeSEd9ydH cite)false caption=false]{The Bath}</p><h2>Areas 2D and 2E Empty Bedrooms</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.ydqsUNsRTwqtQ4Dj cite=false caption=false]{Empty Bedroom}</p><h2>Area 2F Alina’s Room</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.zFzLkVvuqSJI7ksG cite=false caption=false]{Alina's Bedroom}</p><h2>Area 2G Angus’s Room</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.X3JiCbahJjQYVWrr cite=false caption=false]{Angus's Room}</p><h2>2H Narisha’s Room</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.ivhwB4zKBeOAr6qa cite=false caption=false]{Narisha's Room}</p><h2>Area 2I Vincent’s Room</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.heUz2rYpHxrF5l74 cite=false caption=false]{Vincent's Room}</p><h2>Area 3A The Workroom</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.Lm2xnRtjQjbAVA8R cite=false caption=false]{The Workroom}</p><h2>Area 3B The Library</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.xNHwWMLep3a3ggCh cite=false caption=false]{The Library}</p><h2>Area 4A Master Roondar’s Casting Chamber</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.y68j5tlPik9Zc2Dm cite=false caption=false]{Master Roondar’s Casting Chamber}</p><h2>Area 4B Master Roondar’s Bedroom</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.0zrfOuDzjjga69Td cite=false caption=false]{Master Roondar’s Bedroom}</p><h2>Area 4C Master Roondar’s Private Library</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.75FyUsgi72Nk9W6l]{Master Roondar’s Private Library}</p><h2>Area 5D Showdown with the Dragon Princess</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.p601wH3ozAxr64IW.JournalEntryPage.OcMqyYbMnljbRUzD cite=false caption=false]{Showdown with the Dragon Princess}</p><h3>Rewards &amp; Treasure</h3><p>Grateful to the heroes, Alina and the students offer their meager possessions (detailed at the end of Section 2 above) and the pouch of [[/award 278gp party]]{ as reward}, which may lead to an awkward moment if the heroes have already looted the tower. They also offer their spellcasting services, one free spell per day, per hero.</p><p>The town council rewards the heroes with a feast, a guarantee of lodgings any time the heroes are in Howling Rock, and a 10% discount on all purchases. Alina’s parents also grant the heroes lodgings in Alina’s home city and [[/award 500gp each]]. They might also grant a knighthood or honorary title at the GM’s discretion.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>If the heroes destroy the <em>orb of envy</em>, Alina immediately reverts to her true form and falls unconscious. The surviving students fall unconscious as well, freed from the influence of the orb.</p><p>When Alina and the others finally wake, they remember all that has happened and all they have done. They begin to make amends by returning as many things to the town as they are able, and paying for what cannot be returned. Alina casts sending to her mother to assure her family that she is safe and well. She begins making arrangements to have Master Roondar resurrected.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, the plants around the tower return to normal, as does everyday life in the surrounding countryside.</p><p>If the heroes slay the dragon, she immediately reverts to her true form, and the curse is finally broken. The surviving students fall unconscious. If the heroes revive Alina, the adventure concludes as above. If the heroes allow Alina to die, Alina’s parents refuse to pay the gold that was promised, using the funds to pay for a resurrection spell instead.</p><p>If the heroes flee, Alina’s power grows and the curse eventually extends to the town, turning Howling Rock’s citizens into Alina’s minions. Alina’s parents, believing the dragon killed their daughter, sends a stronger group of heroes to slay the dragon.</p><p>If the heroes are defeated, Alina or one of the surviving students stabilizes any unconscious characters. The heroes wake under the influence of the orb of envy, believing they owe their allegiance to their princess, Alina. Eventually, another group of heroes will assault the tower and, hopefully, free the inhabitants from the curse.</p><h1>Developments</h1><p>If the heroes destroy the orb of envy and free Alina and the other students, the town of Howling Rock makes a great base of operations.</p><p>After Master Roondar is resurrected, the heroes can safely retreat there, rest, and regroup. Master Roondar frequently needs rare ingredients and items, and could be a source of quests for the heroes. Narisha is an accomplished adventurer and could be sent with the heroes. The Master is certainly curious about the origins of the cursed orb. As an ongoing campaign, he could enlist the heroes’s aid in discovering where the <em>orb of envy</em> came from, who created it, and why.</p>"

Speaking the command phrase, “I want to see,” allows the user to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fVbCxFRaORalHB20]{scrying}</em> on a person, place, or thing the user desires.

It is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. It is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from magical weapons, and resistant to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and radiant damage. However, it is vulnerable to thunder and force damage. Additionally, using the <em>bell of shattering</em> within 10 feet of the orb causes the orb to immediately shatter.</p><p><strong>Curse:</strong> The orb is cursed and attuning to it extends the curse to you. Each time you use the orb to scry you become more obsessed with the acquisition of precious things. What is considered precious is not necessarily valuable in terms of gold. After six attempts to use the orb, you become a green dragon who is completely absorbed with using the orb to collect more precious things. The curse is lifted only if the orb is destroyed, or if you fall to 0 hit points. Upon lifting the curse, you immediately revert to your true form, and fall unconscious for 1d4 hours.</p><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Scaling Suggestions</p><div class=\"content\"><p><strong>Weaker: </strong>Alina has an AC 17 and 100 hit points</p><p><strong>Stronger: </strong>Alina has an AC 17 and 120 hit points</p><p><strong>Very strong: </strong>Alina has an AC 18 and 145 hit points</p></div></div><figure class=\"aftpk w50p center\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Orb-of-Envy/Orby-of-Envy.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic black\">The Orb<br />of Envy</figcaption></figure>"

Omens point to those powers rising again… and to them seeking Madeleine’s bones for some dark purpose.</p><p>The ruler of the region has called for a group of adventurers with no ties to the crown to discreetly retrieve Madeleine’s remains from their resting place, as a precaution. The cemetery where she is interred is accessible only rarely—the result of ancient magics laid down to keep her safe. If the adventurers don’t succeed tonight, the cemetery sinks back underwater, inaccessible to the living—but not to the forces of darkness—for a hundred years.</p><p>By default, the ruler is Queen Chana IV, a stern and capable warrior queen, and part of a dynasty that has ruled the region for almost a millennium. Adapt or substitute this character as appropriate for your campaign.</p><h1>Plot Hook</h1><p>The characters have been hired by an agent of the crown to retrieve Madeleine’s bones from their resting place.</p><p>Alternatively, they have been hired by a power that opposes the monarch, or a group that wants to exploit the queen’s desperation, to obtain Madeleine’s bones and either keep them from the monarch’s grasp, or sell them to the queen at an extortionate price.</p><p>The appendix includes some possible NPCs to use as quest-givers, if you wish to run a prologue. To jump right in, assume that the characters arrive at Galen’s Mile at dusk, just as the cemetery rises out of Blackthorne Swamp.</p><h1>Galen’s Mile</h1><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.nmrt9vnb7KW9EDKW] scene.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.gmN4Y2cWf8jzp6gl.JournalEntryPage.ReCMhpVVza75TSaT cite=false caption=false]{Galen's Mile map}</p><h2>Area 1.

Scaling suggestions are provided for weaker or stronger parties.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>The farm village Norwal attracts a few tourists annually with the ruins of Orthive’s tower and the famous Slime Cave. The ruins are just the foundation of the semi-famous conjurer’s tower that blew up in a mysterious accident. The river that cuts through Slime Cave flows with glowing sludge that gives the caverns an eerie glow.</p><p>Anthla Tremal leads the Cult of Slugidor, the ancient deity of oozes. She brought the cult to the caves five days ago after learning Orthive’s tower was destroyed when the now-deceased wizard tried to summon Slugidor. The cult found the basement of Orthive’s tower connected to the caves and captured and questioned Orthive’s ghost. According to Orthive, the cult needs a “worthy sacrifice” to offer the demon lord. Anthla sends the minor oozes created in the slime to terrorize the people of Norwal, hoping heroes track the monsters back to Slime Cave.</p><h1>Plot Hooks</h1><p>The following plot hooks can help get the characters into the adventure:</p><ul><li><p>The characters live in Norwal and witness an attack as two @UUID[Actor.b4Qs8O60rBAnmeqS]{ochre jellies} move through the village consuming farmers. If the characters do not kill the oozes, the jellies move into the wilderness.</p></li><li><p>The characters visit Norwal and see the recent acid-scarred fields and streets of the village.</p></li><li><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.N7zc9JrVLpn6boPx.JournalEntryPage.Y8oNIlhKKcotbeqD#norwal]{Norwal} is less than a day of travel from wherever the characters are staying. A messenger rides into town, begging for help from adventurers. The messenger was sent by Constable Royla Swiftfoot (see “@UUID[JournalEntry.N7zc9JrVLpn6boPx.JournalEntryPage.Y8oNIlhKKcotbeqD#constables-offer]{Constable’s Offer}”).</p></li></ul><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Scaling Suggestions</p><div class=\"content\"><p>If you use the first plot hook, you can scale the encounter in the following ways:</p><p><strong>Weaker: </strong>Remove one ochre jelly.</p><p><strong>Stronger: </strong>Make no changes.</p></div></div><h1>Descriptive Bullet Points</h1><p>Instead of boxed text, Slime Cave uses descriptive bullet points to help DMs parse information the first time the characters enter a new area.</p><p>• <em>Text that is in italics like this can be read aloud or paraphrased to the players.</em></p><p>• (Text in parentheses like this contains information that is likely hidden from the characters when they first enter the area.)</p><h1>Norwal</h1><p>Norwal is a village of less than two hundred people. The settlement is mostly farms, though a small city center supports the area’s light tourism and includes the following points of interest:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>The Oozing Inn and Tavern.</strong></em> A gruff-but-matronly black dragonborn called Scaldy Ma (neutral good female <strong>commoner</strong>) runs this modest inn. Her menu features filling meals themed after Norwal’s tourist attractions, like Orthive’s Tower of Pancakes, Extra Oozy Eggs, and Slime Pea Soup. Scaldy Ma offers a Slimy Spa Service for 10 gp, which involves a mud bath.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Wizardly Gifts.</strong></em> The talkative Toldy Barrelsniff (chaotic good male rock gnome <strong>commoner</strong>) dresses in a blue robe and pointed hat embroidered with stars as he runs his shop, which sells small pots of slime for 1 sp each, statuettes of the Orthive’s Tower for 1 gp each, and other tourist gifts. Toldy supplements his income by also operating his shop as a general store.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Constable’s Station.</strong></em> The only authority in town is the elderly Constable Royla Swiftfoot (lawful neutral female lightfoot halfling <strong>veteran</strong>). She can normally call upon a small militia of farmers to defend the town in an emergency, but they were killed in ooze attacks.</p></li></ul><p>If the characters are from Norwal or if one of them succeeds on a [[/skill his 12]] check, relay the information in the first paragraph of the “@UUID[JournalEntry.N7zc9JrVLpn6boPx.JournalEntryPage.Y8oNIlhKKcotbeqD#background]{Background}” section of this adventure. Royla can also relay this information in “@UUID[JournalEntry.N7zc9JrVLpn6boPx.JournalEntryPage.Y8oNIlhKKcotbeqD#constables-offer]{Constable’s Offer.}”</p><h2>Constable’s Offer</h2><p>After using the plot hook of your choice, the characters meet Constable Royla Swiftfoot (see “Constable’s Station”). She gives them the following information:</p><ul><li><p>Oozes began attacking the town five days ago. The first attack was a measly gray ooze, but more and stronger oozes appeared each day since, eventually killing all Norwal’s militia.</p></li><li><p>If the characters find the source of the oozes and stop it, she promises to give them a magic shield she found during her adventuring days.</p></li><li><p>If the characters ask for more, Royla offers them each a Slimy Spa Service from the Oozing Inn and Tavern.</p></li><li><p>Royla recommends the characters begin their search by following the path of acid-scarred plants and grass the oozes leave in their wake.</p></li></ul><h1>Tracking the Oozes</h1><p>A character who succeeds on a [[/skill sur 10]] check leads the group down the astringent trail back to the entrance of the Slime Cave. A character who fails this check still finds the entrance of the cave, but four @UUID[Actor.ZTvBRvTQ6rIVZQpa]{gray oozes} attack the characters before they reach the cave.</p><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Scaling Suggestions</p><div class=\"content\"><p><strong>Weakest: </strong>Remove three gray oozes.</p><p><strong>Weaker: </strong>Remove two gray oozes.</p><p><strong>Weak: </strong>Remove one gray ooze.</p><p><strong>Stronger: </strong>Replace one gray ooze with an @UUID[Actor.b4Qs8O60rBAnmeqS]{ochre jelly}.</p></div></div><aside class=\"tob\"><div class=\"aside-border\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/SidebarBorder2a.webp\" /></div><div class=\"aside-text-content\"><p class=\"title\">Using Creature Codex</p><div class=\"content\"><p><strong>Weakest: </strong>Use one @UUID[Actor.3suJswknqe94YCai]{suppurating ooze}</p><p><strong>Weaker: </strong>Use one suppurating ooze and one gray ooze</p><p><strong>Weak: </strong>Use one suppurating ooze for every two characters</p><p><strong>Normal: </strong>Use four suppurating oozes</p><p><strong>Stronger: </strong>Use four suppurating oozes and one ochre jelly.</p></div></div></aside><h1>Approaching Slime Cave</h1><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.yVIgPrD50gUHD8ZO] scene.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.gNoFOFGsfT4izyV6.JournalEntryPage.PwjnllyFtPkXnJfT caption=false cite=false]{Approaching the Slime Cave}</p><h2>Areas of Slime Cave</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.gNoFOFGsfT4izyV6.JournalEntryPage.LIRYyy2bG3rw8PFb caption=false cite=false classes=\"w75p center\"]{Slime Cave Map}</p><p>The following encounter areas are keyed to the Slime Cave map.</p><h3>Area 1.

Scaling suggestions are included for weaker or stronger adventuring groups.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>Rhogar Drachedandion (RO-gar DRAK-uh-DAN-dee-on) was an eccentric and well-traveled dragonborn merchant who recently passed away. He spent his lifetime accumulating furnishings from around the realms and across the planes with which to decorate his mountaintop manor house.</p><p>Although he acquired a great wealth in possessions, he had a dearth of friends or even those he would call acquaintances. For in the valley below his vast estate is the little hamlet of Harborage, home to goblins who have taken refuge from hostility to resettle the area in peace. They feared the dragonborn merchant and would shutter themselves away whenever he came down from the mountain.</p><p>Upon his death, the Drachedandion Estate fell into disrepair for many years until a halfling rogue stumbled upon it. After attempting to loot the manor of some of its treasures and being met with a ghostly presence, he turned his attention to Harborage. There, he forged a property deed that transferred ownership of the estate to a tinkerer goblin for a modest sum of gold.</p><h1>Plot Hook</h1><p>The adventuring party is traveling through the area when they happen upon the remote hamlet of Harborage. An antiques shop has an “Adventurers Wanted” sign in its window.</p><h1>The Adventure</h1><p>The adventuring party can easily make out a small settlement from a mountain pass. An overgrown path branches off and leads into a valley, surrounded by steep and treacherous bluffs.</p><p class=\"desc\">Small earth shelters with grass rooftops and brick fronts dot the valley.</p><p>The houses and storefronts are proportioned appropriately for size Small creatures. Harborage is home to a population of under a hundred good-hearted goblins.</p><p>Citizens are frightened of any creature size Medium or larger and retreat into their homes if approached. As a result, an adventuring party may find the houses and shops locked up except for the antiques shop. Alternatively, wary citizens may direct them to the antique shop.</p><p class=\"desc\">A wooden sign hangs above the door, proclaiming the premises to be “Re·Store.” A tailor’s mannequin and a beautifully restored, mahogany rolltop desk sit quietly in the window display.</p><p>The door is 4 feet tall by 2 feet wide, making entry difficult for Medium or larger creatures. Inside, the ceiling is 5 feet tall and the shop takes up a modest 20-foot-square footprint filled with refurbished furniture.</p><figure class=\"aftpk left w250px\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Tinker-Tailor/Din.webp\" class=\"flipX\" /><figcaption class=\"pic\">Din, tailor and<br />shopkeep</figcaption></figure><p>Opening the door causes a bell to chime. The proprietor, @UUID[Actor.4ZF7o8oq9NK8WK4m]{Din} (CN female goblin) wears patchwork coveralls and greets the characters with cautious optimism. Din restores home furnishings and is also the local tailor. She recently purchased the Drachedandion Manor and needs able-bodied adventurers to assist in ensuring the premises are indeed clear before transporting the contents of her shop to the manor. She hasn’t visited the manor yet. The dragonborn merchant who lived there was a reclusive and she’s afraid there may be traps, or worse. No one in the village has seen the dragonborn for several months. Though he never came to the village, the goblins often saw him watching them from atop the hill.</p><p>If asked who she purchased the manor from, Din states, “His name was Ace.” Din can also share that Ace was a well-dressed halfling real estate broker who acquired the deed during an estate auction. She has never met Ace before, but he was charming and very precise with their transaction.</p><p>She offers the party a reward of [[/award 15gp]] each. Additionally, she can sew bespoke outfits for the adventuring party.</p><aside class=\"aftpk\"><p>Ace is a halfling thief who, after entering the mansion and stealing away some valuables, forged a deed and sold it to Din.</p></aside><h1>Drachedandion Manor</h1><p>@embed[JournalEntry.wHpzmZXZweSIHCf5.JournalEntryPage.ZJf0PE1Kx5Y2kXoN cite=false caption=false]{Drachedandion Manor}</p><h2>Area 1.

Otherwise, Rhogar attacks those who hurt his friends.</p><p>Rhogar’s ghost also appears if the characters attempt to leave the manor with the @UUID[Item.V4wVss1ceTdfat6W]{original deed}. In this instance, the ghost is not threatening. Rather, he asks what the characters intend to do with the deed, mansion, and his friends.</p><p>Rhogar lived a lonely existence and only ever wanted to make friends with the residents of the neighboring hamlet. He studied their cultures and cuisine but to no avail. Now he is tied to the estate in the afterlife.</p><p>The adventuring party may attempt to broker an agreement between the residents of Harborage and the ghost who offers his protection in exchange for their friendship.</p><h1>Developments</h1><p>If the hamlet befriends Rhogar Drachedandion, Din is given much work restoring items and offers her restoration and tailoring services to the adventuring party at a steep discount to cover the cost of materials only. Though she’s upset that she was fooled by the halfling thief and sold a forged deed, she’s willing to let Rhogar and his friends stay in the mansion.</p><p>She may ask the adventurers to confront Ace, asking for her money back if they stumble upon him.

Scaling options are provided for weaker and stronger parties. This adventure can begin in any empty forest in your campaign world.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>As his age grew, Dwor Methian became obsessed with avoiding death. To that end he retired into the woods and quietly devoted his fortune and all his efforts toward controlling time, hoping to manipulate his personal timeline and cease aging. Mastering arcane magic and gathering items of power, he eventually managed to capture the Vozmonzal, a fragment of living time spawned of a dead and forgotten god. Unfortunately, the magical clock that he crafted to control the creature captured him as well, leaving his isolated cabin empty… until now.</p><h1>Plot Hooks</h1><p>The characters could find their way to the cabin a number of different ways:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>On the Job:</strong></em> A decade has passed and Dwor’s distant relative Sera Yalsa has inherited the cabin. Hoping to locate his missing fortune, but worried that whatever caused his disappearance may still lair in the cabin, she hires the characters for any magic items and 25% of whatever coin they recover. If they find nothing, Sera plans to sell the land and will give the characters a share of the profits.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Relative:</strong></em> One of the characters is contacted by an advocate claiming the character is a distant relative of Dwor and that they have inherited the cabin after their distant relative’s mysterious disappearance.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>In Need of Refuge:</strong></em> While fleeing some other situation or danger, the party finds the abandoned cabin and seeks refuge inside. Unlike the other hooks where the characters have a reason to explore, this hook relies on the characters’ natural curiosity.</p></li></ul><h1>The Adventure</h1><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.Xkcwko2kdzxGlSTb] scene.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.0JQgigJAy0LbTrCI.JournalEntryPage.JgHHvMKCkengQeuj cite=false caption=false]{Abandonned Cabin}</p><div class=\"w75p center\"><p>@embed[JournalEntry.0JQgigJAy0LbTrCI.JournalEntryPage.9xx3BAC5YspEQ48x cite=false caption=false]{Map}</p></div><h2>1 - Main Room</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.0JQgigJAy0LbTrCI.JournalEntryPage.ncJDEITdAKbIxCQg cite=false caption=false]{Main Room}</p><h2>2 - Bedroom</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.0JQgigJAy0LbTrCI.JournalEntryPage.p3axFW0wiJhdHxxh cite=false caption=false]{Bedroom}</p><h2>3 - Basement</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.0JQgigJAy0LbTrCI.JournalEntryPage.loOxmeu8PidZATTR cite=false caption=false]{Basement}</p><h1>Into the Clock</h1><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.VXyZLXdwVdUnYfoG cite=false caption=false]{Into the Clock}</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.Hgwz1CQHG1SH7DKz] scene.</p></article></div><div class=\"w75p center\"><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.syhrljPyvFly8UmV cite=false caption=false]{Map}</p></div><h2>Door 0. 12:00 – The Entrance and Exit</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.9kj6YAMV08si96Mw cite=false caption=false]{The Entrance and Exit}</p><h2>Door 6. 1:05 – The Soul Batteries</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.UCEKIgWWsoElkCPD cite=false caption=false]{The Soul Batteries}</p><h2>Door 12. 2:10 – Motes of Time</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.DfsnMvlHIINLdWPg cite=false caption=false]{Motes of Time}</p><h2>Door 18. 3:15 – The Master Key</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.366kMyBDWyEF1Sgu cite=false caption=false]{The Master Key}</p><h2>Door 24. 4:20 – Sands of Time</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.i9Gp4Jscu82nwwxq cite=false caption=false]{Sands of Time}</p><h2>Door 30. 5:25 – Clockwork Laboratory</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.vBinTx08nkzJe4WR cite=false caption=false]{Clockwork Laboratory}</p><h2>Door 36. 6:30 – Brief Respite</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.SpS4Vm8ATd8Mti9f cite=false caption=false]{Brief Respite}</p><h2>Door 42. 7:35 – The Time Vault</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.LS3yx54iqxDeg8j2 cite=false caption=false]{Time Vault}</p><h2>Door 48. 8:40 – Replay Eternal</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.Q4k7bcClq3jvP3sH cite=false caption=false]{Replay Eternal}</p><h2>Door 54. 9:45 – Toll of the Bell</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.A3dyFlrDoa1zWknE cite=false caption=false]{Toll of the Bell}</p><h2>Door 60. 10:50 – The Redoubt of Dwor Methian</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.AU9SRede8P7B7Xyz cite=false caption=false]{The Redoubt of Dwor Methian}</p><h2>Door 66. 11:55 – The Prison of Vozmonzal</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.ahkW7TP48x3wJqXW.JournalEntryPage.YPYBA5eYBy9cxxbK cite=false caption=false]{The Prison of Vozmonzal}</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Having escaped the clock, it is clear that Dwor squandered his wealth on its creation—there is no grand fortune to bring back to Sera.

If she sells it, the party earns [[/award 500gp party]] in a month once she completes the sale.</p><h1>Developments</h1><p>If your campaign has a great evil, it’s possible that the clock could be used to capture other powerful beings.

Scaling options are provided for stronger and weaker parties.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>Centuries ago, the archmage Amora sought to hide her private library inside a cleverly-disguised demiplane. She constructed a library surrounded by an endless desert and called it her Athenaeum of Dust, the entrance disguised as a book of the same name. After Amora’s death, the Athenaeum of Dust began to deteriorate. With a will of its own the book began capturing all manner of creatures that crossed its path, suspending them in its demiplane library as their life-force kept the library from winking out of existence.</p><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Map Note</p><div class=\"content\"><p>Due to the size of the Athenaeum, this adventure may be better played as theater of the mind. We’ve included maps for reference, which you might be able to use during your game session.</p></div></div><h1>Plot Hook</h1><p>This adventure can occur anywhere, as the Athenaeum of Dust can appear in any book shop or collection of tomes in the world. This brown leather-bound book is unusually rough to the touch, its spine and cover stamped with its title in gold lettering.</p><p>If the characters are together when they find the book, it transports them immediately; otherwise, it might keep showing up in a character’s path or possessions until the book senses a ‘sufficient’ number of targets to draw into itself.</p><p>Read or paraphrase the following:</p><p class=\"desc\">A torrent of sand erupts from the book’s pages, buoyed upon an arid wind that sweeps the grit into a whirlwind around you. The ground drops sickeningly away as the dust obscures your vision and the cyclone sends you tumbling head over heels. You land sprawled on a warm stone floor as the sandstorm subsides.</p><p>The characters have arrived in the Athenaeum of Dust, sprawled on the floor directly in front of the circulation desk (see below).</p><h1>General Features of the Athenaeum</h1><p>The Athenaeum is a self-contained demiplane and has the following features:</p><figure class=\"aftpk w250px right\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Athenaeum-of-Dust/Book.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic black\" style=\"top:170px;left:110px\">The Athenaeum of Dust</figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>A creature in the demiplane that finishes a long rest must succeed on a [[/save con 12]] saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by 2 ([[/r 1d4]]) as the Athenaeum feeds on its life-force. A creature whose hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this effect crumbles to sand. Piles of sand can be found randomly throughout the Athenaeum, marking where previous victims succumbed to the demiplane’s effects.</p></li><li><p>There are no day or night cycles in the demiplane, only a constant warm light and a cloudless, sunless sky.</p></li><li><p>Spells or other magic used to teleport to another plane or a location other than the Athenaeum automatically fail.</p></li><li><p>There are no doors out of the Athenaeum. If a creature escapes the building, they find themselves surrounded by featureless desert. A creature walking in any direction will find themselves back at the Athenaeum in [[/r 1d4]] hours.</p></li><li><p>Creatures in the Athenaeum don’t require food or drink to survive.</p></li><li><p>The magic that preserved the library’s contents has faded over decades; most of the books are collections of blank pages with occasional legible words or diagrams. Books that leave the Athenaeum crumble to sand.</p></li></ul><h2>The Rotunda, General Features</h2><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.7tnVVlwppFGfE9dB] scene.

Any of Amora’s possessions, such as the key or robe, are left behind in the demiplane. Within 1 minute of the last creature’s escape (as determined by the GM), the book crumbles into a pile of diamond dust worth 1,200 gp. If at least one creature is still in the demiplane, the book reappears in a random suitable location on the same plane where it disappeared.</p><h1>Developments</h1><p>Creatures left behind in the Athenaeum’s demiplane could escape at a later date and confront the characters based on their interactions. Friends, family, or followers of creatures still in the demiplane could track down the players for information about the Athenaeum of Dust. Allies of powerful entities like Auntie Waxspinner or Baleblaze could rescue or resurrect these individuals, who then vow revenge on the characters for their actions.</p>"

Scaling suggestions are provided for weaker or stronger parties.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>There’s been a murder at Sable Mansion. The characters are invited to dinner at the established mansion at the behest of Mr. Sable, a well-known figure of high repute and deep pockets. Alas, when they arrive, their host is already dead, and the other guests are each determined to pin the blame on the newcomers, or each other. An evil doppelganger, the cause of the disaster, plagues the house throughout the evening.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>Mr. Sable was an eccentric elderly gentleman who lived alone at his large mansion, accompanied only by his familiar “Erskine” and a few select house staff who have dwindled with the passing of years. He’s known to have amassed a large fortune, and has a habit of making extravagant financial gifts to his dinner guests out of whimsy—to be invited to one of his dinners means you have caught his eye in some fashion. Alas, Mr. Sable was killed by a doppelganger just prior to his latest dinner. The doppelganger intends to have some deadly fun at the expense of the guests.</p><h1>Plot Hook</h1><p>The characters each receive a letter from Mr. Sable, with his distinctive panther crest seal. It contains an address, and a time (in the early evening) at which each character is invited to dine with him at Sable Mansion.</p><h1>All in Agreement</h1><p>The characters meet several guests in the house, all of whom have different opinions on what happened. All guests are highly uncomfortable, and can explain the following to anyone who cares to ask.</p><ul><li><p>There are six guests in the house already. When they arrived earlier, Mr. Sable was alive, but someone killed him shortly afterward.</p></li><li><p>None of the guests who were in the house at the time of the murder can be trusted to hold an honest investigation, but as the characters weren’t in the house at the time, they make the perfect detectives to apprehend the culprit.</p></li><li><p>The guests, Granny Vert, Lady Gules, Professor Purpure, Colonel Or, Madame Azure and Mrs. Argent, are elsewhere in the house.</p></li><li><p>The body was found in the lounge horribly brutalized, but while the guests argued about what to do, the body vanished leaving only bloody traces behind.</p></li></ul><h1>Murder Most Foul</h1><p>There is a murderer in attendance at the party. One of the guests is a @UUID[Actor.aH0Im5i4ISPv6vaF]{doppelganger}, and uses their abilities to hide from the investigators, murdering as many partygoers as they can before they are caught. Keep in mind the following:</p><ul><li><p>The doppelganger killed Mr. Sable, but the identity assumed of the doppelganger when the game starts is up to you. One of the guests present when the characters arrive is actually the doppelganger—this guest never really existed.</p></li><li><p>The doppelganger can read the surface thoughts of those around it, and change its form at will. Use these abilities, and the abundant hiding spaces around the house, to confuse and implicate all the guests in various ways.</p></li><li><p>Many of the guests have legitimate dark secrets of their own. These can be used as red herrings to the murderer’s advantage.</p></li></ul><div class=\"scaling\"><p class=\"title\">Playing the Doppelganger</p><div class=\"content\"><p>As mentioned, any of the NPC guests could be the doppelganger. For your reference, we’ve included these boxes with suggestions on how the doppelganger can be played using Lady Gules.</p></div></div><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p><strong>Using the Doppelganger in Foundry</strong></p><p>To transform the doppelganger, open it's character sheet, then drag the desired actor on it. A popup window will appear, choose the relevant option, and click transform. To change back, select the menu on the character sheet, and choose restore transformation.<br /><em><strong>Note.</strong></em> Don't forget to change the identity of the doppelganger token, otherwise it'll still say doppelganger for all to see.</p></article></div><h1>Changing Faces</h1><p>Contrary to usual adventuring practice, this adventure works best if the characters are convinced to split apart and investigate the house alone or in groups. This allows you to use both the doppelganger and the shapeshifting abilities of the other guests to drop clues something is not right to your players while keeping the characters in the dark. For instance, having the same character appear in two different rooms at the same time makes for a delightful twist, should the group meet a dead end in their investigations.</p><h1>Approaching the House</h1><figure class=\"aftpk w75p center\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Murder-at-Sable-Mansion/Sable-Mansion.webp\" class=\"w100p\" /></figure><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.IXJ9aexxh2BtcNHm]{Sable Mansion} battlemap.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.URzF3EEYjWPh7TGm cite=false caption=false]{Approaching the House}</p><h2>Area 1 – The Front Door</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.7rm7ePnVmBtW9y0V caption=false cite=false]{The Front Door}</p><h2>Area 2 – Lounge</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.P1yLctyklnyqsfK4 caption=false cite=false]{Lounge}</p><h2>Area 3 – The Dining Room</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.UMlAAgomP1Jy3ZLj cite=false caption=falsej]{The Dining Room}</p><h2>Area 4 – The Billiard Room</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.NWutgxiyzogJfSFN cite=false caption=false]{The Billiard Room}</p><h2>Area 5 – Storage</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.nSH1Rs8JuORtlfXV cite=false caption=false]{Storage}</p><h2>Area 6 – Kitchen</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.7fYyVUWZJojMwtfF caption=false cite=falsejMwtfF]{Kitchen}</p><h2>Area 7 – Pantry</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.MNc4J1Cim3b2XTHt cite=false caption=false]{Pantry}</p><h2>Area 8 – Bedroom</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.NClxlJcnE7akYbO0 caption=false cite=false]{Bedroom}</p><h2>Area 9 – Study</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.FcZEtrLiNiNsLSjw cite=false caption=false]{Study}</p><h2>Area 10 – Library</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.dqW7wmUjLqyDdGAM caption=false cite=false]{Library}</p><h2>Area 11 – The Defenestory</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.DzM5S8ShTXFykQsb cite=false caption=false]{The Defenestory}</p><h2>Area 12 – The Upstairs Closet</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.IyoB076mdJvPEGS9 caption=false cite=false]{The Upstars Closet}</p><h2>Area 13 – The Attic</h2><p>@embed[JournalEntry.1Ksq7LYdjs7X0l1G.JournalEntryPage.1g1NsrMenC0nUEV3 cite=false caption=false]{The Attic}</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The denouement to this adventure largely depends on how quickly the characters deduce the possibility of an extra party at play, conspiring against them.

Shea</p><p class=\"adv-nb\">8</p></div><p class=\"time\">Estimated run-time: 2 to 4 hours.</p><p>This adventure is intended for five 8th-level characters and focuses on exploration and combat.</p><figure class=\"aftpk right w250px\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Shattered-Grace/Annesia.webp\" /></figure><h1>Background</h1><p>Centuries ago, Annesia Arakhos was consort to a king now long forgotten. Wanting no competition for his new heirs, the king commanded Annesia and her two children to be executed. Annesia escaped the sword. Her children did not. In her grief, Annesia called to a prince of demons who transformed her into a lamia to enact her revenge.</p><p>Using her new powers, Annesia stole away the king’s heirs and devoured them. Yet this did not sate Annesia’s hunger. Every few generations the lamia continued to use her illusions to enter royal chambers, steal infant heirs, and devour them. Yet the kingdoms continued.</p><p>Many years ago, Annesia kidnapped the king’s son, a half-elf named Grayson. In a moment of precognition, Annesia did not devour the boy and instead kept him as her own child, raising him in the ways of wizardry.</p><p>Learning of Annesia’s story, Grayson convinced the lamia to follow a new course. Instead of killing the heirs, she could recondition them and send them back into the kingdom as commoners, tradesfolk, and farmers. The heirs of the kings would still live and, one day rise up, announce their bloodlines, and cause such chaos that they would shatter the monarchy forever.</p><p>Today Annesia and Grayson, along with a half-dozen hidden royal heirs, reside in the Temple of Shattered Grace, a ruined temple to a goddess of beauty. Six days ago, Annesia used her illusions to infiltrate the current king’s court and steal his two heirs: a boy and a girl.</p><h1>Plot Hooks</h1><p>King Sython Wyrmsblood (LN human male noble) needs adventurers to rescue his 8-year-old twin children (Becka and Henry) who have been kidnapped by their nursemaid, a woman named Anna. The King explains that Anna is likely to be Annesia Arakhos, a monster who gave her soul to a demon prince to seek revenge against royalty. She has taken the children to the ruins of the Temple of Shattered Grace. There she will supposedly devour the children as she has in generations past. The king offers the characters 500 gp each for the safe return of his children.</p><p>Southabee Willington (CN human male spy), a slender, smooth-talking man of ill-repute, approaches the adventures and offers them a deal. If they rescue the kidnapped children of King Sython Wyrmsblood, he is certain he can negotiate a grand reward with the king. Southabee can share information in the Background and Secrets and Clues sections.</p><p>If the adventurers successfully rescue the children and return them to Southabee, the man waits for them with an army of 11 bandits and one bandit captain. Southabee plans to ransom the children himself.</p><h1>The Adventure Begins</h1><p>This adventure begins as the characters are summoned to the royal chambers of King Sython Wyrmsblood. The king describes the kidnapping of his two children, Becca and Henry; his desire to have them returned; and his desire to have the lamia who stole them killed.</p><p>The king’s advisor, Corwin Nightwhisperer, gives the characters directions to the Temple of Shattered Grace where the lamia lairs. The king worries that sending a larger force may put his children’s lives in danger.</p><h2>Secrets and Clues</h2><p>The characters can spend time in the king’s court or in the neighboring village to learn more of the history of the king and the lamia. During their investigation they may learn one of the following clues:</p><p>• Centuries ago, the king executed the children of his consort in order to ensure the royal line of his heirs.</p><p>• Their mother, the king’s consort, made a pact with a demon prince for revenge. The demon prince cursed the mother, turning her into a lamia.</p><p>• The lamia used illusions and beguiling charms to work her way back into the court of the king where she kidnapped and devoured the king’s heirs.</p><p>• The lamia has kidnapped and devoured the heirs of dozens of kings in the centuries since.</p><p>• The lamia resides in the Temple of Shattered Grace, a ruined temple to the goddess of beauty that lies three days out of town.</p><p>• The ruined temple now floats in broken earthmotes above a crater that sits where the temple once stood.</p><p>• Hoping to destroy the lamia, a mad king hired a cabal of wizards to blow up the temple. The spells backfired, killing the wizards and freezing the temple in a half-destroyed state.</p><p>• Annesia has beguiled a tribe of gnolls who worship the same demon prince she does to protect her lair.</p><p>• The lamia has children of noble blood protecting her in the ruins of the floating temple.</p><p>• One cannot simply approach the Temple of Shattered Grace. Illusions steer travelers wayward. Only one of Annesia’s amulets can show the way.</p><p>• Annesia’s gnoll chieftain in Area 6 has one of the amulets of shattered grace that allow passage through Annesia’s illusions.</p><h1>The Temple of Shattered Grace</h1><p>A guild of wizards hired by the local king roughly two centuries ago attempted to destroy this temple. They failed and died in the attempt. The temple indeed exploded but it froze in place, parts of it floating and rotating in mid-air, while the remaining energy roared back into the wizards and destroyed them. To this day the ruined temple floats above a large crater in the shattered ground below it.</p><p>A tribe of gnolls has a lair built within the rock walls of the crater. Rope ladders and bridges connect the shattered remains of the temple to its ruined central sanctum. This sanctum looks pristine, an illusion kept up by Annesia. In her sanctum, royal children, now grown up, guard their adopted mother.</p><h2>The Amulet of Shattered Grace</h2><figure class=\"aftpk left w250px\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Shattered-Grace/Amulet-Shattered-Grace.webp\" /><figcaption class=\"pic black\" style=\"top:90px\">An Amulet of<br />Shattered Grace</figcaption></figure><p>Annesia’s illusions make it impossible to either climb or fly up to the temple. Those that attempt it find themselves landing on earthmotes that don’t exist, being attacked by flying monstrosities, or becoming hopelessly lost in the mists.</p><p>Annesia has gifted a number of amulets featuring a cracked visage of the goddess of beauty. The amulet creates a 20-foot-radius bubble. Each creature within this radius can see past Annesia’s illusions, allowing them to see the rope ladders dangling from the guard tower earthmotes in Areas 7 and 8.</p><p>Timing This Adventure</p><p>You can use the location of the amulet of Shattered Grace to change the length of this adventure. For a shorter adventure, Corwin Nightwhisperer can give the characters the amulet at the beginning and let them skip the gnolls completely. For a longer adventure, acquiring the amulet may be more difficult, requiring clearing out or dealing with the gnolls.</p><h2>Approaching Shattered Grace</h2><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kob-adv-potbellied-kobold/assets/Journals/AftPK-Logo-BW.webp\" class=\"round\" /></figure><article><p>This location use the @UUID[Scene.W0OkTLjDQcGj304U] scene.</p></article></div><p>@embed[JournalEntry.DRECJ33kj8RAaNXy.JournalEntryPage.AJmefJCFNDoCbQLq cite=false caption=false]{Approaching}</p><h2>Area 1.

They are considered heroes and well compensated for their effort. They may instead choose to leave the temple without the children and release the information contained in Grayson’s book revealing the broken lineages of the local kings.
