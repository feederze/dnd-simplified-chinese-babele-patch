They are far-travelling aberrations, each developing extremely specific obsessions such as light, words, or bones. Astral hermits study their area of interest in meticulous detail, using it as a medium through which to learn more of the world.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Corporeal Forms.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">A male astral hermit is made up of two bodies: his heart and his hearth. An astral hermit’s hearth is a maze-like construction at the centre of which is a portal to the Astral Plane. The astral hermit’s heart is how he presents himself to the world. Usually, this is in a form that is inviting to creatures of that plane, a tactic which ensures plentiful trade.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Reproduction.</strong></em></span><span class=\"None\"> Male and female astral hermits lead two very different existences. A male astral hermit’s hearth is his bower, and his heart can never travel further than a few hundred feet from it. The abundance and richness of its treasures (which to the common person may appear as worthless relics) help to impress females of the species, which flit through the Astral Plane searching for portals into the hearth’s of other hermits. When a union is formed, eggs are produced and jettisoned into the astral expanse.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Crafters and Enchanters.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">Astral hermits are innately magical beings, able to imbue items or creatures with enchantments shaped by their subject of obsession. Unable to travel far from their hearths, astral hermits create reputations of skill with enchanting and use that as the currency with which they trade for relics that further fuel their obsession.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2 _idGenParaOverride-1\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Bonemonger.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">The bonemonger’s obsession is bones. Fossilised, inscribed, splintered, or fresh, the bonemonger can read the history of every bone that passes him, learning much of the creatures to which they once belonged. The bonemonger has also learnt to animate these bones with his necromantic magic, allowing them to act as guards, workers, and scouts. The bonemonger chooses the form of a tiny white rabbit as his heart, an unassuming form that is nevertheless extremely deadly when threatened.</span></p>",

An astral hermit’s hearth is a maze-like construction at the centre of which is a portal to the Astral Plane. The astral hermit’s heart is how he presents himself to the world. Usually, this is in a form that is inviting to creatures of that plane, a tactic which ensures plentiful trade.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Reproduction.</strong></em></span><span class=\"None\"> Male and female astral hermits lead two very different existences. A male astral hermit’s hearth is his bower, and his heart can never travel further than a few hundred feet from it. The abundance and richness of its treasures (which to the common person may appear as worthless relics) help to impress females of the species, which flit through the Astral Plane searching for portals into the hearth’s of other hermits. When a union is formed, eggs are produced and jettisoned into the astral expanse.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Crafters and Enchanters.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">Astral hermits are innately magical beings, able to imbue items or creatures with enchantments shaped by their subject of obsession.

They are far-travelling aberrations, each developing extremely specific obsessions such as light, words, or bones. Astral hermits study their area of interest in meticulous detail, using it as a medium through which to learn more of the world.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Corporeal Forms.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">A male astral hermit is made up of two bodies: his heart and his hearth. An astral hermit’s hearth is a maze-like construction at the centre of which is a portal to the Astral Plane. The astral hermit’s heart is how he presents himself to the world. Usually, this is in a form that is inviting to creatures of that plane, a tactic which ensures plentiful trade.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Reproduction.</strong></em></span><span class=\"None\"> Male and female astral hermits lead two very different existences. A male astral hermit’s hearth is his bower, and his heart can never travel further than a few hundred feet from it. The abundance and richness of its treasures (which to the common person may appear as worthless relics) help to impress females of the species, which flit through the Astral Plane searching for portals into the hearth’s of other hermits. When a union is formed, eggs are produced and jettisoned into the astral expanse.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Crafters and Enchanters.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">Astral hermits are innately magical beings, able to imbue items or creatures with enchantments shaped by their subject of obsession. Unable to travel far from their hearths, astral hermits create reputations of skill with enchanting and use that as the currency with which they trade for relics that further fuel their obsession.</span></p><p class=\"Heliana-Book-1-Styles_Paragraph-Texts_Para-2 _idGenParaOverride-1\"><span class=\"Bold-Italic-8\"><em><strong>Bonemonger.</strong></em> </span><span class=\"None\">The bonemonger’s obsession is bones. Fossilised, inscribed, splintered, or fresh, the bonemonger can read the history of every bone that passes him, learning much of the creatures to which they once belonged. The bonemonger has also learnt to animate these bones with his necromantic magic, allowing them to act as guards, workers, and scouts. The bonemonger chooses the form of a tiny white rabbit as his heart, an unassuming form that is nevertheless extremely deadly when threatened.</span></p>",
