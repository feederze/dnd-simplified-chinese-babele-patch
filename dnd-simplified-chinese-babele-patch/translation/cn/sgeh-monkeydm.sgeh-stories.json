      "description": "<p>Echoes of Madness is a Fifth Edition adventure designed for <strong>three to five characters of 11th to 12th level</strong> and optimized for four characters with an average party level (APL) of 12. The original site of the Obitus Scholare's communion with their god turned into a horror-filled temple of abominations. The Church sealed their past away, but it was only a matter of time before others discovered the darkness lurking beneath Luyarnha. Now the eldritch creatures are making their way out into the world, and the religious group's dark past is laid bare.</p><p>This adventure takes place beneath the city of Luyarnha in Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt. It can be modified to fit any horror campaign with a secret religious sect that deals with eldritch beings.</p><p><strong>GM Note</strong>. This adventure references powerful, ambiguous eldritch beings with motivations and methods that no one truly understands.</p>",

Father Hauke speaks with a strong and confident voice, but his eyes\n\t\t\treveal a hint of doubt and uncertainty. He is a priest of the Radiant Church and a man of faith who has recently\n\t\t\tgrown doubtful in the face of how bad Geistnacht has turned out.

Their bodies morphed and changed into feral creatures. Brayden fared better than his comrades in retaining most of his sanity, but couldn't stop the change into the specter-like being he had become.

The hilt and guard resemble those of a hunter's longsword, often ornately adorned with the markings of the hunter's faction, symbols of the Radiant Church, or grim skulls that embody the dominion over death of the Scions. From this hilt extends the true terror of the weapon: a broad, straight blade constructed from dozens of razor-sharp, silvered teeth arranged in a looped chain. When wielded, these teeth whirr into a blur of destructive motion, capable of rending flesh, bone, and even the thick hide of beasts with horrifying ease. A powerful generator housed within the hilt infuses the gnashing teeth with crackling energy, adding a galvanizing quality to each cut and rip.</p><p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"5jekvvlv1jd\">Trick Weapon. <span class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"743o1jh65d3\">This longsword has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to pull the trigger under the blade to transform and infuse it with electricity for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until you use a bonus action to stop the current. This weapon regains 1 charge for each 10 minutes that it spends inside a miniature Galespire Coil (often found inside hunter's workshops).</span></p><p data-bkit-id=\"udtnhbvalgn\">This silvered longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against creatures not wearing metal armor, as long as the sword has at least 1 charge.</p><p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"uw270n1z8n\">Untransformed. <span class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"youaux34qb\">When a melee attack that you can see would hit you, you can use your reaction to parry the attack, adding a bonus to your AC equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack. If this causes the attack to miss you and it was made with a nonmagical weapon, the weapon is destroyed by the teeth of the sawblade.</span></p><p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"jfy49icvi0j\">Transformed. <span class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"5ozrwt0cz4j\">The surge of electricity causes the blade to rev faster, requiring both hands to control it. If you use one hand to attack with this sword while it is transformed, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with it. While transformed, the longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing and 1d6 lightning damage. In addition, the momentum generated from it propels you. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</span></p></div>",

              "text": "<p data-bkit-id=\"ve3zb1g0be\">With the defeat of Vargas and gaining access to the eldritch husk, the characters have\n\t\tseveral options available to them. While the full impact of their decisions can cause ramifications outside the\n\t\tscope of this adventure, here are a few possible outcomes that could occur:</p>\n\t<p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"vgduso7uq1e\">Burning the Brewery.<span data-bkit-id=\"zlb35b6w1kl\">\n\t\t Seeing as how both the church and nobility\n\t\t\tcannot be entrusted with the being's remains, burning the brewery down is an option that Maddon recommends if\n\t\t\tthe characters do not come up with it on their own. This partially destroys the production of the tonics and\n\t\t\tends the husk's influence on the moon for a brief time. However, it does not reverse the effects already caused\n\t\t\tby imbibing the elixirs; without the husk, an antidote will be near impossible to create.\n\t</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"t6zw63xgj9\">Siding with the Church.<span data-bkit-id=\"q297ao8x7s\">\n\t\t If the characters hand the husk over to\n\t\t\tthe church, the clerics retake possession and use their knowledge to try to craft an antidote that removes the\n\t\t\tmadness effects. However, they choose to keep using the tonics as the miracle cure, bereft of a better solution\n\t\t\tfor now. They keep the husk for research, and the moon remains cursed, though it begins cycling again. Thomathin\n\t\t\tis framed for the brewery operation and is forced to flee, swearing vengeance on the characters while he still\n\t\t\tdraws breath.\n\t</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"f1yhfglm5a\">Siding with Thomathin.<span data-bkit-id=\"pznzhjk4vr\">\n\t\t The eager noble happily exposes the\n\t\t\tchurch for tinkering with the eldritch remains, and the clergy swiftly shifts the blame on the Vicar, declaring\n\t\t\thim a black sheep amongst their ranks. The populace believes their denials and continues to consume their\n\t\t\ttonics. Thomathin pays the promised rewards and takes the husk to be quarantined in a secret location with his\n\t\t\talchemists, who can study it in hopes of devising a cure.\n\t</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"keyword-detail\" data-bkit-id=\"rpfc6yb8f58\">Going Rogue.<span data-bkit-id=\"zazlmwo0ubo\">\n\t\t The characters push the Vicar over the edge if\n\t\t\tthey confront him about his involvement, threaten to out him, or choose to side with anyone other than the\n\t\t\tchurch. He'll lose his humanity entirely and turn into a @UUID[Actor.QzVw1Nb7m286PRjv]{Soul-snatching Aranea}. A foe far beyond their\n\t\t\tpower.
