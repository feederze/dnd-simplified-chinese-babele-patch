But in Eberron (and perhaps other settings), characters might establish a permanent base of operations that isn’t linked to a fixed location—maybe on a sailing ship, a lightning rail cart, or even an airship. The DM decides whether to allow characters to establish a mobile Bastion, which uses the following alterations to the normal Bastion rules.</p><p>A mobile Bastion has two basic requirements: it must be built in a vehicle form, and one of its special facilities must allow for propulsion. (The @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaBastionsinKho.JournalEntryPage.RBNyY6dfn2QFW0g2]{Lyrandar Helm}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaBastionsinKho.JournalEntryPage.Sn4PMLbooEXCg16h]{Navigator’s Helm}, and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaBastionsinKho.JournalEntryPage.b2U378P21NWhtaGh]{Orien Helm} described in this chapter fulfill that requirement.) If multiple characters combine their Bastions into a single vehicle, each Bastion must include the same kind of special facility that allows for propulsion, and in order for the vehicle to travel, the characters must all issue the Empower order to those facilities at the same time. In this case, however, the combined Bastion can travel more than 8 hours per day; the facility hirelings can operate the vehicle in shifts. Thus, a combined Bastion with at least three Navigator’s Helm facilities can sail for 24 hours a day as the three hirelings trade off navigation in 8-hour shifts.</p><p>If characters are traveling with their mobile Bastions, they can also have encounters and face obstacles just as if they were traveling away from their Bastions. When the DM is planning obstacles for such a journey (as described in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>), a potential consequence of an encounter or obstacle is the temporary loss of access to one or more of the Bastion’s facilities, including the facility that allows propulsion.</p><p>Players and the DM should work together to create a Bastion map that fits within the chosen vehicle. Facilities can be slightly larger or smaller than the rules in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> specify, at the DM’s discretion, in order to fit. A mobile Bastion can’t have defensive walls.</p>"

Sites near Stormreach, built in the midst of a ruined giant city, have become the best-known ruins in Xen’drik.</p><p><em><strong>Bazek Mohl.</strong></em> Ancient giants built their so-called “City of Shadows” underground, in a manifest zone linked to the plane of Mabar, the realm of eternal night. The only indication on the surface of the city’s presence far below is a toppled tower in the jungle, its shattered walls of purplish granite infused with shadow magic. Ancient texts in the archives of @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.x7UXmArWl7X0vL6j]{House Phiarlan} suggest a connection between the ancestors of that house and Bazek Mohl, leading scholars to believe that the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.options.Item.efaMarkShadow000]{Mark of Shadow} might relate to the shadow magic of this place.</p><p><em><strong>Mel-Aqat.</strong></em> For many years, people considered Mel-Aqat mere legend. Mentioned in a variety of ancient texts, this site was supposedly the prison for a mighty fiendish overlord. Until only a few years ago, most scholars had abandoned hope of finding it. Then it was unearthed by a group of adventurers led by the scholar Janik Martell. Fiendish power suffuses the ruins, but Celestial forces are at work there as well, and the Church of the Silver Flame is interested in supporting further expeditions there.</p><p><em><strong>Obsidian City. </strong></em>The Obsidian City is a ruined giant city now inhabited by a group of drow called the Sulatar (“firebinders”). It lies at least eight hundred miles upriver from Stormreach.</p><p><em><strong>Pra’xirek. </strong></em>Pra’xirek is a ruined giant city near one of the heads (sources) of the Hydra—the great sound that divides the Skyfall Peninsula from the rest of the continent. Two groups of giants still inhabit the ruins, as does a group of drow.</p><p><em><strong>Pyramid of Ebon Flame.</strong></em> The Pyramid of Ebon Flame is one of several scattered creations of the giant wizard-king Addis-Ro, a necromancer who experimented with powers drawn from the depths of Khyber. This huge monolith formed of unbreakable black glass supposedly marks the passage through which the wizard-king journeyed into the deeps.</p><p><em><strong>Ring of Storms. </strong></em>The Ring of Storms, according to legend, was the mountain refuge of a sect of powerful drow spellcasters during the Age of Giants. The fall of an enormous dragonshard from the Ring of Siberys destroyed this sect.</p><p><em><strong>Tharkgun Dhak. </strong></em>A cliffside fortress built by giants in the northern Fangs of Argarak, Tharkgun Dhak is a gateway to the depths of Khyber. Ogres control this site, now infested with Aberrations.</p><p><em><strong>Throne Gate Ruins. </strong></em>Aside from the ruins beneath Stormreach, the Throne Gate Ruins are the closest ruins to the city, about four hundred miles up the Rachi River. This site served as a temple and arcane laboratory at the height of the giant empire.</p>"

Each house’s test is different, but they all involve some danger designed to evoke the power of the house’s mark. Usually, a dragonmark appears during the test, if it ever manifests at all, but heirs sometimes manifest their marks years after failing the Test of Siberys.</p><h2>Distant Offshoot</h2><p>You are a distant offshoot of a dragonmarked family line, sharing the species that most commonly manifests the mark but unencumbered by ties to its house. For example, you could be a Halfling with the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.options.Item.efaMarkHealing00]{Mark of Healing} but with no ties to House Jorasco.

It might be a direct mark of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaIntroduction0.JournalEntryPage.xl0uAlpKzPB2SpIr]{Draconic Prophecy}, or it could be an aberrant mark that happens to duplicate an established one.

With your DM’s permission, you can alter some of the background’s proficiencies to better reflect your character’s origin.</p><h2>Aberrant Mark</h2><p>You bear an aberrant dragonmark. These rare marks appear on members of all species. Aberrant dragonmarks disturb the houses—you would be wise to avoid their attention. The @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.options.Item.efaAberrantHeir0]{Aberrant Heir} background is the best way to build a character with an aberrant mark.

Each crew station has its own Armor Class and Hit Points separate from the airship. If a crew station is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it becomes inoperable, and crew members can no longer access any of its actions. If a crew station is the target of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplDispelMagi]{Dispel Magic}</em> spell, it becomes inoperable for 1 minute.</p><p>Some crew stations may require the crew member operating it to have a specific dragonmark. Other stations don’t require them but afford benefits if their operators bear certain dragonmarks. This represents a dragonmarked crew member channeling their unique talents to bolster a ship’s abilities.</p><p>Every airship has the following crew station.</p><hr /><h4>Helm</h4><p><em>Small Object</em></p><p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 15 <strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20</p><p><em><strong>Drive (Requires Mark of Storm).</strong></em> The ship moves up to its Fly Speed in any direction.</p><p><em><strong>Shift Engine (Requires Mark of Storm).</strong></em> The ship’s elemental core is suppressed or reengaged.</p><p>The helm of an airship consists of a specialized wheel, levers, and other controls. One creature can operate this station at a time.</p><p>The pilot (the crew member operating an airship’s Helm) must have the Mark of Storm to interface with the controls. While operating the Helm, a crew member can take the station’s Drive and Shift Engine actions.</p><p><em><strong>Tilt and Roll.</strong></em> When taking the Helm’s Drive action, a crew member can spend an amount of movement equal to half the ship’s Fly Speed to invert the ship on its axis, either turning it upside down or righting it. All creatures and objects on the ship that aren’t anchored fall when the ship moves in this way. A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw can grab a fixed object within reach to avoid falling.</p><section class=\"notable\"><h4>Piloting without a Dragonmark</h4><p>Helming an airship that typically requires a dragonmarked pilot is difficult—but not impossible. At your DM’s discretion, you can use the following rules for piloting a ship without a dragonmark.</p><p>On its turn, a creature without the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.options.Item.efaMarkStorm0000]{Mark of Storm} occupying the Helm can attempt to take the Drive or Shift Engine action and make a [[/skill 20 arc]] or [[/skill 20 skill=itm/per]] check to command the engine’s elemental spirit. On a successful check, the action happens. On a failed check, nothing happens, and the creature’s action is wasted.</p><p>Magic can make an airship’s elemental spirit more receptive to commands. Casting <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplCharmMonst]{Charm Monster}</em> targeting the elemental spirit gives you Advantage on checks made to command the spirit for the spell’s duration. If you instead cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplDominateMo]{Dominate Monster} </em>targeting the elemental spirit, any checks you make to command the spirit for the spell’s duration automatically succeed. The elemental spirit automatically fails its saving throw against these spells, and you do not need to see the spirit to target it if you’re occupying the Helm.</p></section>"

          "text": "<p>Airships are powered by an elemental spirit bound to a core carved from a Khyber dragonshard. This core is placed into a heavily fortified containment chamber connected to an arcane matrix spanning—and powering—the whole ship. When the elemental spirit within the core is activated, its elemental energy flows through the matrix’s arteries and the ship’s binding struts, forming the distinctive ring attached to every airship. The appearance of a ring depends on the type of elemental spirit bound to the core; for example, a fire elemental spirit generates a blazing ring of orange flames, while an air elemental spirit creates a ring of lightning and occasionally sends jagged lightning bolts streaking across the ship’s surface.</p><h2>Suppressing the Elemental Core</h2><p>At the command of the airship’s pilot, the elemental core can be suppressed, causing the elemental energy to disappear and flow back into the Khyber dragonshard core.</p><p>An airship’s elemental core and connecting arcane matrix are magical effects. If a section of an airship enters an area of antimagic, such as that produced by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplAntimagicF]{Antimagic Field}</em> spell, the weapons and other services in that section of the ship are inoperable.</p><p>If the ship’s elemental core enters an area of antimagic, the elemental core is automatically suppressed and can’t be reengaged until the core leaves the area of antimagic. If the elemental core is the target of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplDispelMagi]{Dispel Magic}</em> spell, the core is suppressed for 1 minute and can’t be reengaged for the duration.</p><p>While the elemental core is suppressed, the airship’s Fly Speed is reduced to 5 feet, though it can still hover. The airship’s Helm is still operable, but crew station actions that require the elemental core can’t be used while it is suppressed.</p><h2>Breaking the Elemental Core</h2><p>Shattering the core’s Khyber dragonshard releases the elemental spirit bound to it. The shard has AC 17; HP 10; and Immunity to Piercing, Poison, Psychic, and Slashing damage. If an airship’s elemental core is broken, the ship ceases to move (though it continues to hover if airborne), and crew station actions that require the elemental core are disabled.</p><p>To prevent such catastrophic sabotage, most airships keep their elemental cores inside heavily fortified and guarded containment chambers. Each ship has unique protections for its elemental core; one ship might have its core sealed in a trapped adamantine chest inside a hidden room, while another ship might guard its core with an arcane glyph alarm.</p><h2>Wind Wards</h2><p>In addition to powering an airship’s movement and crew stations, the elemental engine also fuels the wind wards that surround the ship as it travels. These wind wards help provide a comfortable travel atmosphere aboard the ship.</p><p>While the wind wards are active, creatures aboard the airship can breathe normally and the deck is free from winds. In addition, creatures on the ship have Advantage on saving throws to avoid being pushed off the deck of the ship, as the wind wards provide a buffer. If the elemental core is suppressed or destroyed, creatures aboard the airship might suffer the effects of high altitude and strong wind (see the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>).</p>"

If the characters concentrate on fighting the monsters, the other people inside the inn can extinguish the flames.</p><p><em><strong>Panic Outside.</strong></em> Outside the burning inn, eight <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaDaaskRaider00]{Daask Raiders}</strong> (gnolls whose stat blocks appear in this chapter) are attacking terrified people fleeing from the fire as well as those trying to help put it out. Each gnoll tries to flee when Bloodied.</p><p><em><strong>No Great Mystery.</strong></em> Identifying the gnolls as agents of Daask isn’t difficult—it’s the conclusion most people jump to when they see gnolls involved in violence, and a number of clues back up that assumption:</p><p><strong>Interrogating the Gnolls.</strong> If any of the gnolls are captured alive (or questioned via <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplSpeakwithD]{Speak with Dead}</em>), they freely admit their involvement with Daask and growl slogans about throwing off the yoke of “the manged”—a term they use to describe furless Humanoids.</p><p><strong>Boromar Witness.</strong> A halfling named Gressie Gorben (<strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaBoromarSmuggl]{Boromar Smuggler}</strong>)—was attacked by a gnoll that called her a “filthy Boromar.” Gressie denies any ties to the Boromar Clan, but she admits to knowing that Daask and the Boromar Clan are involved in a long-running feud.</p><p><strong>Freight Inquiries.</strong> Inquiring with freight companies in Lower Tavick’s Landing reveals that a pair of gnolls brought a massive iron crate, large enough to hold the hell hounds, into the city from Graywall in Droaam the day before the incident. The gnolls’ papers gave their residence as a tenement in Malleon’s Gate, a district where Daask is very active.</p><p><em><strong>Boromar Connection.</strong></em> In addition to Gressie Gorben’s testimony, several clues point to a connection between the Gold Dragon Inn and the Boromar Clan:</p><p><strong>Irida d’Ghallanda.</strong> The innkeeper, who hired the characters to investigate the attack, denies any involvement with the Boromar Clan. However, widespread rumors claim that she is a frequent guest of Bestan ir’Tonn, Upper Tavick Landing’s representative on the Sharn Council—who is a known ally of the Boromar Clan.</p><p><strong>Business Records.</strong> Prying deeper into the inn’s business reveals that it receives many deliveries from a warehouse in the nearby district of Cogsgate—a warehouse owned by the Boromar Clan.</p><p><strong>Contraband.</strong> A careful search of the inn (without Irida’s knowledge) reveals that it offers contraband items to its guests, including Aundairian wine and discreet deliveries of the dreamlily drug.</p><p><em><strong>Watch Involvement.</strong></em> The Sharn Watch seems unusually eager to cooperate with the inquisitives, as long as the characters’ attention is focused on Daask and not on any connection between the inn and the Boromar Clan. If they ask about Boromar ties, their Watch contacts urge them to focus on Daask.</p><p><em><strong>Daask Hideout.</strong></em> The characters’ inquiries about Daask lead them to a hideout where some gang members await their next instructions. They include an <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaOgre000000000]{Ogre}</strong>, two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaHarpy00000000]{Harpies}</strong>, and four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaDaaskRaider00]{Daask Raiders}</strong> (they include any survivors from the inn incident).

          "text": "<p>Inquisitive agencies run the gamut from a handful of private investigators working together to networks of detectives supported by dragonmarked houses. If the characters want to establish their own inquisitive agency, they should consider two key factors: where to locate the agency, and whether to associate with an established guild.</p><h3>Agency Location</h3><p>Depending on what levels of the City of Towers an inquisitive agency focuses on, its members might get involved in very different sorts of investigations. Lower Sharn means poor clients and lawless streets. Middle Sharn means merchant rivalries and better pay. Upper Sharn means uncovering the secrets hidden behind the veneer of respectability. See the “Sharn Neighborhoods” section later in this chapter for more details about the quarters where characters might establish their headquarters.</p><h3>Guild Affiliation</h3><p>Whether or not any of the characters possess dragonmarks, their agency can choose to affiliate with either House Tharashk’s Finders Guild or House Medani’s Warning Guild. The choice can influence the kinds of cases the characters take and the attitude the Sharn Watch takes toward their activities.</p><p>A dragonmarked house’s seal of approval, whether it comes from House Tharashk’s Finders Guild or House Medani’s Warning Guild, promises a certain standard of quality and professional ethics. However, that guarantee comes at a price: most guild-sponsored inquisitives charge at least 2 GP per day, plus expenses—and the use of magic can increase that cost significantly.</p><p>The inquisitives best at finding lost people and things belong to the Finders Guild of House Tharashk. Finders Guild agencies often end up as rivals to the Sharn Watch and can rarely count on the Watch for support.</p><p>Inquisitives of House Medani’s Warning Guild detect and disrupt the theft of goods and information from their clients. They often partner with law enforcement agencies across Khorvaire, deploying training in keen observation and logical deduction. Though the Sharn Watch calls on these agencies to consult in difficult cases, members of the Watch tend to find Medani mind games infuriating and their idealism naive. Medani inquisitives also serve as bodyguards and sentries, focusing on protection against imminent threats.</p><p>The characters’ agency need not affiliate with either guild; going independent is always an option. For the many people who can’t afford the fees of the guild-sponsored agencies, independent inquisitives offer a cheaper alternative.</p><section class=\"notable\"><h3>Finders Guild and Warning Guild</h3><p>Four Tharashk inquisitives with the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.options.Item.efaMarkFinding00]{Mark of Finding} each lead a Finders Guild agency in a different part of the city. The dragonmarked heads of these agencies generally work on only the most important or difficult cases, but their staffs are known as the best inquisitives in the business. These agencies are described in the “@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaSharnNeighbor]{Sharn Neighborhoods}” section.</p><p>The Warning Guild keeps a lower profile in Sharn than Tharashk’s Finders Guild. Only one notable agency readily accepts walk-in clients: the Watchful Eye, located in Redstone (in @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaSharnNeighbor.JournalEntryPage.QvXDVktlEGpkGPOm]{Upper Dura}). This agency’s principal is Brina d’Medani, a Khoravar who settled in Sharn after running afoul of the Emerald Claw on a mission in Karrnath. Other members of the Warning Guild rely primarily on wealthy clients referred to them directly by House Medani.</p></section><h3>Other Details</h3><p>Players can use the information about inquisitive agencies in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em> to flesh out more details about their agency, including allies, enemies, contacts, roles for each character in the agency, type of work, a signature case, and clientele.</p>"

        "Daask": {
          "name": "Daask",
          "text": "<p>Daask is a violent gang of muggers, extortionists, looters, cultists, and drug dealers supported by such monsters as harpies, medusas, minotaurs, ogres, and trolls. It seems like a simple criminal gang engaged in a battle for territory and power against the Boromar Clan and the forces of law and order—but the truth is more complicated. In fact, the members of Daask take their orders from Sora Katra, one of the three hags (the Daughters of Sora Kell) who rule the nation of Droaam. Daask’s operations in Sharn are only a small part of a much larger scheme.</p><h2>Goals of Daask</h2><p>The goals of Daask, like those of the Daughters of Sora Kell, are shrouded in mystery. As described in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, the reason for Daask’s existence depends on the path you choose for the Daughters of Sora Kell—whether they seek peace and stability for their young nation of mistrusted monsters, desire to end humanity’s dominance over Khorvaire and let monsters rule, or merely follow the visions of Sora Teraza wherever they lead. Regardless of Daask’s larger purpose, however, one immediate goal remains: to eliminate the Boromar Clan, or at least break its hold on Sharn’s criminal underworld. Its methods range from street violence—mugging, armed robbery, and even pillaging—to extortion and trade in drugs.</p><h2>A Daask Arc</h2><p>The conflict between inquisitives and Daask might follow this broad outline.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 1–4.</strong></em> The characters investigate crimes perpetrated by Daask against businesses they eventually discover are affiliated with the Boromar Clan. The Sharn Watch might hire the characters to help bring a Daask gang to justice, but the inquisitives eventually learn that the Boromar Clan seeks to use the Watch and the characters to strike back at Daask.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 5–10.</strong></em> What seems like a routine case of a wealthy noble disappearing into a drug den while looking for thrills leads the characters to dig into Daask’s trade in dragon’s blood, a mysterious and dangerous new drug. The investigation drives the characters into conflict with increasingly powerful monsters affiliated with the gang.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 11–16.</strong></em> Daask operatives kidnap a prominent figure in Sharn, but the freed “victim” turns out to be a doppelganger. The characters are hired to retrieve the real victim, who is undergoing a ritual that will eventually transform them into a hag.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 17–20.</strong></em> While Daask stirs up riots in the Cogs and Malleon’s Gate, the characters discover that the gang has also planted arcane explosives across the city. The characters must find the explosives before Sharn is thrown into utter chaos.</p><h2>Daask Enforcers</h2><p>Daask’s agents in Sharn include changelings, goblins, humans, and shifters recruited in the city, as well as monsters that have come to Sharn from Droaam: gnolls, harpies, medusas, minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and an oni leader named Cavallah. Droaam’s gnolls are untainted by the demonic influence of Yeenoghu; many such enforcers use the stat blocks presented here.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaDaaskBruiser0]{Daask Bruiser}.</strong></em> Intimidating and powerful, bruisers lead Daask operations when more violent and decisive shows of force are needed. These enforcers relish the brutality of their work.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaDaaskRaider00]{Daask Raider}.</strong></em> Raiders use guerrilla tactics to ambush warehouses and beat down opponents.

        "The Dreaming Dark": {
          "name": "The Dreaming Dark",
          "text": "<p>The sinister and mysterious Dreaming Dark—a metaphysical force trying to prolong the current age of despair and violence—seeks to extend its reach toward Khorvaire. Over a century ago, the Dreaming Dark compromised House Deneith’s enclave in Upper Tavick’s Landing. Although the enclave seems normal to outsiders, and even to many in House Deneith, it is now a stronghold of shadows. Under the tutelage of the Dreaming Dark, the Sharn Deneith have become masters of intrigue and subtlety. They carefully conceal their psionic power from outsiders while using it to gather information from the wealthy citizens they ostensibly guard.</p><p>While the enclave serves the Dreaming Dark, most of its members have no idea they are in league with the Inspired. Over a century of indoctrination, the Inspired dominator Tirashana has taught the Sharn Deneith to see themselves as superior because of their dragonmarks and raised above the other dragonmarked houses by their psionic abilities. Even members of the house who work directly with the Inspired believe that the Inspired consider them equal partners, but in fact the Inspired view them merely as useful pawns. Now quori spirits have possessed fifteen members of the house.</p><p>In addition to the leaders of House Deneith in Sharn, the Dreaming Dark has agents strategically planted throughout the City of Towers. They include one member of the Sharn Council (Bestan ir’Tonn, who also has close ties to the Boromar Clan) and a leader in the Sharn Watch (Warden Maira ir’Talan of the Blackened Book). The Dreaming Dark also commands the allegiance of the Riedran ambassadors in Sharn.</p><h2>Goals of the Dreaming Dark</h2><p>Building from the description in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, the Dreaming Dark has three objectives in the City of Towers:</p><ul><li>To cause chaos and strife by undermining what little faith in law enforcement exists in Sharn—turning the forces of law and order against one another, fueling the feuds between criminal organizations, and spreading fear among the populace.</li><li>To promote their chosen champions, which in Sharn means the subverted and possessed agents of House Deneith.</li><li>To undermine the kalashtar throughout the city—especially in the Overlook district of Upper Dura and its Path of Light temple.</li></ul><h2>A Dreaming Dark Arc</h2><p>The Dreaming Dark poses a significant threat, which might not manifest fully until the characters can handle the danger. The conflict could play out according to this outline.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 1–4.</strong></em> Early in their adventures, the inquisitives have vivid dreams that reveal key details about cases they’re working on—easily interpreted as subconscious insights bringing overlooked information to light. (The discussion of the Dreaming Dark in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em> includes suggestions for incorporating dreams into your game.)</p><p><em><strong>Levels 5–10.</strong></em> Investigating a series of grisly crimes, the characters are aided by a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaSentinelMarsh]{Sentinel Marshal}</strong> of House Deneith (see stat block in chapter 5). When captured, the criminal insists that recurring dreams led to the crimes. The Sentinel Marshal dismisses this claim. If the inquisitives investigate further, they find themselves drawn into a nightmare scenario involving a quori. In the course of that adventure, they glean clues that the Sentinel Marshal played a more sinister part in events than previously suspected.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 11–16.</strong></em> The characters experience increasingly frequent nightmares, individually and as a group. Meanwhile, the Sentinel Marshals and other members of House Deneith interfere with their investigations.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 17–20.</strong></em> The inquisitives uncover the corruption at the heart of the House Deneith enclave in Sharn, which reaches all the way to its lord, Sadran d’Deneith—a human man possessed by a powerful quori spirit. Their investigations lead to confrontations with Deneith leaders in the waking world, but eventually the inquisitives must fight the quori in the dream world of Dal Quor.</p><h2>Dreaming Dark Agents</h2><p>Anyone can be seduced into the service of the Dreaming Dark, and a normal person possessed by a quori (see the quori stat blocks in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>) uses their normal stat block. The two agents presented here are Inspired agents of the Dark who wield terrifying psionic power.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaDreamingDarkI]{Dreaming Dark Infiltrator}.</strong></em> Dreaming Dark infiltrators are spies sent to gather intelligence. They plant psychic seeds in their minds of their foes that enhance the infiltrators’ combat prowess against those enemies.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaDreamingDarkM]{Dreaming Dark Mindkiller}.</strong></em> Mindkillers are the assassins of the Dreaming Dark, sent to terrify their foes before striking to kill. Mindkillers force foes to attack their own allies, causing physical and emotional devastation to grow the power of the Dreaming Dark.</p>"

        "The Boromar Clan": {
          "name": "The Boromar Clan",
          "text": "<p>The Boromar Clan is the most powerful criminal organization in Sharn, with a reach that includes the city council, the Sharn Watch, @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.DkRwxorlErfUQ2GM]{House Jorasco}, the elite social circles of @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaSharnNeighbor.JournalEntryPage.pIU6y8YM3h4FdB04]{Skyway}, the shipping trade, and a wide array of illegal activity to boot—particularly extortion, gambling, smuggling, and thievery. The clan began as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains, and its headquarters and key holdings lie in the Little Plains district of Middle Menthis, where many such migrants dwell.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaArtHandouts00.JournalEntryPage.f5YIC1q5pbxdZzRo]</p><h2>Goals of the Boromar Clan</h2><p>For generations, the goals of the Boromar Clan have been simple: to maintain an iron grip on shady and illegal activities in Sharn. The Boromars extend their influence into places of power and bribe officials of the Sharn Watch, all to maximize profits and power. Short-term goals come and go in service of these overarching objectives—blackmailing a councilor here, purchasing a shipping company there. But with the rise of Daask, the Boromars have the new and urgent goal of eliminating their upstart rival once and for all.</p><p>The fierce enmity between the Boromar Clan and Daask creates interesting options for inquisitive characters who stand (at least nominally) on the side of the law against both criminal organizations. Will they accept help from the Boromars against the much more obviously dangerous Daask? Or might they disregard Daask operations clearly meant to undermine the Boromars? The inquisitives might even find a way to ensure the conflict between the two criminal groups weakens them both, making Sharn safer in the process.</p><h2>A Boromar Clan Arc</h2><p>The conflict between inquisitives and the Boromar Clan might follow this broad outline.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 1–4.</strong></em> The characters investigate petty crimes—pickpocketing, burglary, blackmail, and such—and help bring several Boromar Clan members to justice. The inquisitives find the Sharn Watch unhelpful in dealing with these criminals, though, and some legitimate businesses and law-abiding citizens start shunning or insulting the characters, angry at their interference with the “hometown heroes” of the Boromar Clan.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 5–10.</strong></em> Ostensibly trying to mend the poor relationship between the Sharn Watch and the inquisitives, a Watch officer recruits the characters to bring a Daask gang to justice. The Watch helps, and the characters catch several Daask criminals. However, the characters’ Watch allies don’t seem concerned about whether any Daask members are hurt or killed in the final confrontation. Indeed, it turns out that the Boromar Clan arranged the operation to remove a dangerous group of rivals.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 11–16.</strong></em> Boromar leaders try to recruit the characters to their side, offering exorbitant fees and extravagant gifts as payment for simple jobs. If bribery doesn’t work, the gang tries to coerce the characters into helping them, using friends, family members, or contacts as leverage. Along the way, the characters learn that a trusted NPC ally is firmly in the pocket of the Boromar Clan.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 17–20.</strong></em> Assuming the characters haven’t joined the Boromars, the clan leadership tries to eliminate them. The Boromars can’t muster a physical threat to challenge characters of this level, so they wield their political power instead. Under pressure from Boromar leaders, the city council declares the adventurers a threat to Sharn’s safety and security. Officials revoke their inquisitive agency’s operations permit and ask the characters to leave Sharn.</p><h2>Boromar Operatives</h2><p>The Boromar Clan began as a single family of halflings. Though its influence has expanded widely, its key operatives are still family members. Boromar operatives prefer deception and bribery over outright violence, though they defend their interests when necessary. Besides those described here, other Boromar operatives include bandits, commoners, spies, toughs, and warriors (see the <em>Monster Manual</em>).</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaBoromarSmuggl]{Boromar Smuggler}.</strong></em> Smugglers employed by the Boromar Clan (mostly halflings) are notoriously hard to catch. These speedy criminals traffic everything from narcotics to illegal arcane weaponry across Sharn.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaBoromarUnderb]{Boromar Underboss}.</strong></em> Underbosses supervise larger clan operations, such as gambling halls and warehouses of smuggled goods awaiting transport. Accustomed to the criminal lifestyle, these hardy individuals (mostly halflings) dismiss and dispose of threats with calculated ease.</p>"

        "The Draconic Prophecy": {
          "name": "The Draconic Prophecy",
          "text": "<p>The language of the Draconic Prophecy is richly symbolic and largely conditional. Rather than laying out a predetermined series of events, it explores causation and consequences—it describes what might happen in one arena of existence if something changes in another.</p><p>Scholars sometimes approach the Draconic Prophecy as a puzzle, where solving it is its own reward. They look at each individual fragment of the Prophecy as a self-contained challenge, and they explore how a certain series of actions might fulfill the Prophecy.</p><p>The immortal beings who are truly invested in the Prophecy, however—primarily the dragons of the Chamber and the fiendish Lords of Dust—view each fragment as a tiny piece of a much larger whole. From this broader perspective, one fragment or verse cascades into another, acting out a drama that unfolds over decades, centuries, or even millennia. Every verse will be fulfilled in time, these immortals believe, and their goal is simply to tilt the direction of destiny to one side or another.</p><p>The verse of the Prophecy that begins this introduction is typical, in that each line is open to multiple interpretations. Consider these possibilities:</p><p><strong>“The gorgon’s breath.”</strong> These words could refer to a literal gorgon, perhaps one magically altered or infused with radiant energy so its breath restores health, brings the dead back to life, or animates objects. Or they could refer to House Cannith, whose symbol is a gorgon. (Members of the Chamber, in particular, believe that mortals’ dragonmarks appeared on flesh in order to involve these people in the story of the Prophecy.) The words could refer to Cannith artificers “breathing life” into their warforged creations.</p><p><strong>“When fires create.”</strong> These words could easily refer to the fires of a smith’s forge, especially when connected to House Cannith as the gorgon in the previous line. Or they could refer to the birth of a new thing from the ashes of the old, or to mortal passions (the fires of the heart) being turned to creative pursuits after years of violence in the Last War.</p><p><strong>“When towers rise from rubble.”</strong> These words could be a general reference to buildings rebuilt after a disaster, or perhaps a specific reference to a building project in the Fallen district of Sharn (where the wreckage of a fallen tower still dominates the neighborhood). Or it might refer to a resurgence in a family line, with notable scions arising from a family in decline; their “reaching to the sky” could reflect their lofty aspirations or their literal piloting of an airship.</p><p><strong>“Embers spring to life.”</strong> Hope kindling in the midst of despair is one obvious reading of these words. However, the reference to fires earlier in the verse doesn’t require that the embers here be positive—this could refer to a new, destructive fire raging to life after long lying dormant, or perhaps even the hatching of a red dragon’s egg.</p><p><strong>“Five shall rise to cause a dragon’s fall.”</strong> The best way to read this line is as a reference to the characters in your campaign (if there are more or fewer than five characters, you can adjust the number). That’s especially fitting if a dragon is a major antagonist in your campaign—or a dragonmarked house, a tyrannical ruler, or anything else easily symbolized as a dragon.</p><h2>Using the Prophecy</h2><p>Using this fragment of the Prophecy as an example, how might you as the Dungeon Master incorporate it into an Eberron campaign?</p><p>Start at the end. Assume the last line refers to the characters in your campaign bringing about the fall of one of your campaign’s major antagonists. If you’re using one of the campaign models in this book, the dragon’s fall might refer to one of these antagonists:</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaSharnInquisit]{Sharn Inquisitives} (See Chapter 4).</strong> Daask, whose trade in the dangerous drug called dragon’s blood is harming Sharn’s population, or a powerful villain whose use of dragon’s blood has brought about a draconic transformation.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaDragonmarkedI]{Dragonmarked Intrigue} (See Chapter 5).</strong> A dragon connected with the Chamber, or the leader of a dragonmarked house.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaMorgraveExped]{Morgrave Expeditions} (See Chapter 6).</strong> Lady Illmarrow, leader of the Order of the Emerald Claw (detailed in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>), who has draconic blood, or a fiendish overlord with a draconic form (perhaps Rak Tulkhesh, also detailed in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>).</p><p>With that climactic campaign end in mind, plot out a simple campaign arc—a series of four apparently unconnected events, each one reflecting a line of the Prophecy fragment. At each step of the way, the characters might encounter others trying to steer the fulfillment of the Prophecy in various directions. Some of these figures might want the characters to topple the dragon who is the antagonist of the campaign; others might want the characters to bring about a different dragon’s fall. Still others might hope for the five-headed dragon god Tiamat to rise and cause the fall of all the dragonmarked houses in fulfillment of the fragment’s last line.</p>"

The Airship Travel Conditions table shows typical encounter distances for different sky conditions.</p><table><caption>Airship Travel Conditions</caption><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\"><p>Conditions</p></th><th scope=\"col\"><p>Encounter Distance</p></th><th scope=\"col\"><p>Navigation DC</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Day, clear skies</p></td><td><p>1,000 ft.</p></td><td><p>[[/check sur 10 format=long]]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Day, light precipitation</p></td><td><p>500 ft.</p></td><td><p>[[/check sur 13 format=long]]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Day, heavy precipitation</p></td><td><p>250 ft.</p></td><td><p>[[/check sur 15 format=long]]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Night, clear skies</p></td><td><p>500 ft.</p></td><td><p>[[/check sur 10 format=long]]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Night, light precipitation</p></td><td><p>250 ft.</p></td><td><p>[[/check sur 15 format=long]]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Night, heavy precipitation</p></td><td><p>[[/gmr 6d6*10]]{6d6 × 10 ft.}</p></td><td><p>[[/check sur 20 format=long]]</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Encounters at 250 feet or more might stretch the definition of an encounter. Bear in mind the range at which most spells and weapons are effective:</p><p><strong>250 feet</strong> is long range for a Ballista and most Ranged weapons and beyond the range of most spells.</p><p><strong>500 feet</strong> is long range for a Mangonel or a Longbow and beyond the range of most Ranged weapons.</p><p><strong>1,000 feet</strong> is long range for a Cannon and beyond the range of most siege equipment and crew stations.</p><p>The <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> includes suggestions for tracking distances between creatures (or airships) when an encounter begins at very long range. It’s often best to wait until the two parties in an encounter are closer together before rolling Initiative for individual creatures; in the meantime, let the whole ship and its crew act at once, taking turns with whatever the ship encounters.</p><p><em><strong>Random Encounters.</strong></em> You may use the following table to generate random encounters as adventurers navigate the skies. @Embed[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.tables.RollTable.efaAirborneEncou inline rollable resultLabel=\"Airborne Encounter\"]</p><h3>Navigation</h3><p>Guiding an airship through the sky is often as difficult as charting an oceangoing vessel’s journey across the seas. Seasoned airship captains know how to use a combination of maps and other navigational tools, the moons’ and stars’ positions, and the bird’s-eye view of the landscape to ensure their vessel stays its course. Even so, inclement weather interferes with vision, and distinguishing landmarks from high in the air isn’t always easy.</p><p>When an airship is at risk of getting lost—such as when traveling through dense fog or over unfamiliar land—the crew member operating the ship’s Helm makes a [[/check sur format=long]]; the DC for this check is determined by the Airship Travel Conditions table. Another crew member who has proficiency in the Survival skill can take the Help action to assist this check as normal.</p><p>On a failed check, the ship goes off course. The DM decides what the final consequences of this are, but at base, the airship’s journey is extended by [[/gmr 1d4]] days.</p><h3>Weather Hazards</h3><p>With no terrain obstacles to worry about, the most significant obstacles in airship travel are environmental effects caused by weather. The Environmental Hazards table suggests obstacles an airship might have to overcome.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.tables.RollTable.efaEnvironmental rollable inline resultLabel=\"Environmental Hazards: Encounter\"]</p><h3>Searches</h3><p>As with a journey on the ground, sometimes characters spend part of their journey searching for something—usually something on the ground. When characters are searching the ground from the air, use the Search DC for the terrain on the ground from the Travel Terrain table in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>, but feel free to give characters Advantage on [[/check skill=prc]] checks if their aerial vantage point makes it easier for them to see what they’re looking for.</p>"

Significant rivalries also exist within some houses.</p><p><strong>House Tarkanan.</strong> Though it appears as nothing more than an ordinary criminal organization, House Tarkanan—which is made up of people who carry aberrant dragonmarks—can threaten all dragonmarked characters and the continued existence of their houses.</p><p><strong>The Chamber.</strong> As dragonmarks are thought to be an expression of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaIntroduction0.JournalEntryPage.xl0uAlpKzPB2SpIr]{Draconic Prophecy}, the Chamber—a secretive group of dragons interested in studying and manipulating the Prophecy—could easily become involved in interhouse intrigue.</p><p>You can replace one or more of these conflicts with others from <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em> or ones of your own devising.

As tremendously powerful magical and mercantile forces, the houses seek economic dominance, which often comes at the expense of other houses and sometimes with little concern for ethics. Ambitious forces within the houses—if not the houses as a whole—can lead them to endanger both people and property.</p><h2>Goals of Rival Houses</h2><p>Rivalries among the dragonmarked houses are described below.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.6D2R7HspEWKaFHTm]{Cannith} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.FQ9oqb5T47a8vzWL]{Tharashk}.</strong></em> In its interactions with the other houses, House Cannith has a reputation for being domineering and openly advocating for a position of privilege. No one resents that attitude more than House Tharashk. These two houses clash not over competing economic interests but to gain political influence within the Twelve and over Khorvaire as a whole. To complicate matters, Cannith relies on the dragonshards mined by Tharashk—and Tharashk doesn’t want to lose its best customer.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.6D2R7HspEWKaFHTm]{Cannith} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.DA56kUbeSlEzCLAU]{Vadalis}.</strong></em> Though they have much in common as producers of goods, House Cannith and House Vadalis remain philosophically, temperamentally, and morally opposed. Members of House Vadalis distrust the city folk of House Cannith, whose machines (including the warforged) threaten to replace magebred animals entirely.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.rFrWeww81qLmXkE8]{Deneith} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.2yaK26tBczRCrzvj]{Medani}.</strong></em> House Deneith and House Medani both offer personal protection services. Extremely wealthy individuals have been known to hire bodyguards from both houses, but even then, house agents often compete to prove their services the more valuable.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.rFrWeww81qLmXkE8]{Deneith} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.FQ9oqb5T47a8vzWL]{Tharashk}.</strong></em> House Tharashk has been encroaching on House Deneith’s economic territory by recruiting the monstrous residents of Droaam to serve as mercenaries.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.EspmHTPFM83HUQd7]{Ghallanda} and Everyone.</strong></em> Many people underestimate the subtle influence of House Ghallanda. The House of Hospitality has spent centuries building connections in all the cities of the Five Nations. A Ghallanda concierge knows ways to get whatever a client needs. But the house also knows about the other houses’ rivalries and schemes. It tugs on these strings more than other houses realize.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.2452LoZrTD4bdg7d]{Kundarak} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.Yp9x9PDM99jaxCSL]{Thuranni}.</strong></em> The enmity between House Kundarak and House Thuranni dates back to the Shadow Schism. Elar d’Thuranni claimed that the Paelion line of House Phiarlan were traitors engaged in a diabolical plot, and the Thuranni and their allies assassinated the entire family line. Baron Morrikan d’Kundarak and Lord Tolar Paelion were blood brothers, and Morrikan refuses to believe the accusations made against the Paelions. He has sworn to uncover the truth and avenge his friend. To this end, he has assigned the Ghorad’din—the “Manticore’s Tail,” the secret assassins of House Kundarak—to dog the heels of Thuranni and its Shadow Network.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.J3QVUTy7PizIrbIA]{Lyrandar} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.wmgaB4naJseKvF69]{Orien}.</strong></em> Before the airship’s invention, House Orien had a monopoly on travel across Khorvaire. Lyrandar’s expansion into air travel threatens that dominance.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.2yaK26tBczRCrzvj]{Medani} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.FQ9oqb5T47a8vzWL]{Tharashk}.</strong></em> House Medani and House Tharashk both operate guilds of inquisitives, vying for a limited field of business. Each house has its specialties, but the inquisitives of both houses compete fiercely for customers.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.x7UXmArWl7X0vL6j]{Phiarlan} and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.Yp9x9PDM99jaxCSL]{Thuranni}.</strong></em> The two houses that carry the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.options.Item.efaMarkShadow000]{Mark of Shadow} separated less than thirty years ago, and tensions remain high between them. They generally avoid open conflict by operating in distinct territories. When their agents cross paths, rivalries can trigger confrontation—which manifests in artistic competitions or duels between assassins.</p><h2>Internal Tensions</h2><p>The schism of House Phiarlan and House Thuranni marks the first time a house has split among family lines, but it might not be the last. Tensions within a single dragonmarked house can provide campaign conflicts, especially if the characters in your campaign all belong to the same house. The following houses have significant internal conflicts.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.6D2R7HspEWKaFHTm]{Cannith}.</strong></em> The leaders of House Cannith perished in the Mourning, and three powerful barons now vie for control. Each one wants to unite the house under their own leadership, but it’s entirely possible the house could fracture as House Phiarlan did.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.FQG4JLbxTiCtGqC9]{Sivis}.</strong></em> House Sivis is known for its neutrality in struggles between nations and dragonmarked houses alike—it often helps settle disputes and maintain order when two houses differ. But its own internal affairs involve a tremendous amount of family rivalry. The house’s twelve families include the Corralyns, Lyrrimans, Santors, Severins, Syrralans, and Torralyns. Only because of her expertise at games of intrigue has Doyenne Lysse Lyrriman d’Sivis managed to head the house for ninety years.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.FQ9oqb5T47a8vzWL]{Tharashk}.</strong></em> An ancient conflict lies hidden within the foundations of House Tharashk. The powerful Torrn clan has ties to the Gatekeeper druids, while the Aashta clan aligns with the Cults of the Dragon Below. Most modern heirs have only a casual knowledge of these traditions, but zealous factions within the clans pursue esoteric agendas that sometimes boil out into conflict within the house.</p><h2>A Rival Houses Arc</h2><p>This example arc presupposes that the characters generally stay neutral in disputes among the dragonmarked houses. The characters might act as agents of the Twelve, House Sivis, or some other group or patron that pursues peace among the houses. Or the characters might represent different houses; their prior relationship to each other motivates them to maintain peace. If the characters belong to a single house, you can adapt this example by using their house as one of the rival factions.</p><p>Based on that initial assumption, the conflict among rival dragonmarked houses might unfold according to this broad outline.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 1–4.</strong></em> As prominent but not yet powerful figures in the dragonmarked landscape, the characters become the targets of two rival houses. Both houses try to befriend and influence them, perhaps hiring them for various missions. Meanwhile, the conflict between the houses simmers on a back burner.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 5–10.</strong></em> The conflict between the two rival houses erupts into a trade war, a concerted effort to take over business from each other, or even violent conflict. With the characters now emerging as a force to be reckoned with, both houses call on them for help, trying to force the characters to choose sides.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 11–16.</strong></em> As the conflict between the two houses rages on, a third group gets involved, hoping to take advantage of the warring parties’ distraction or weakness. Figures both within and outside the houses plead with the characters to help end the conflict before it engulfs other houses or even nations.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 17–20.</strong></em> The chaos spreads, and the characters have a choice to make. They can work to restore the delicate balance of power among the houses, as well as between the houses and the Five Nations. Or they can try to reshape the world order according to a different pattern.</p>"

Most members have no higher aspirations than using their aberrant dragonmarks to profit from a criminal lifestyle. But the gang’s leaders seek to amplify their dragonmarks’ power to the world-shaking level of the aberrant champions of the War of the Mark, Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague. With such awesome power at their disposal, they plan to reawaken the ancient conflict over aberrant dragonmarks and topple the dragonmarked houses from their position of power.</p><p>Thora Tarkanan (still known about town under her original name, Thora Tavin), who founded the gang, recently stepped aside from its leadership, ceding power to a mysterious figure called the Son of Khyber. Little is known about him, but he bears the strongest aberrant mark seen in modern times along with the skills of a military commander. Some call him Halas Tarkanan born again, believing he is mustering an aberrant army to lead into battle against the dragonmarked houses. Thora remains the Son of Khyber’s second-in-command and the public face of the gang.</p><h2>A House Tarkanan Arc</h2><p>The conflict between adventurers and House Tarkanan might follow this broad outline.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 1–4.</strong></em> A patron asks the characters to get involved in a criminal investigation into a rash of murders in Sharn because all the victims have dragonmarks. Both the Sharn Watch and one or more private inquisitives already squabble over access to evidence and witnesses—the characters’ attempt to get involved merely heightens the tension. The perpetrators turn out to be members of House Tarkanan, whom the characters must bring to justice.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 5–10.</strong></em> After the characters’ success in dealing with the Tarkanan killers, the Watch comes to them for additional help. Petty thieves belonging to the gang have offered inside information into House Tarkanan’s plans in exchange for leniency in their sentencing. These thieves don’t share their leaders’ delusions of grandeur or hatred of the dragonmarked houses. The information points to a gathering of aberrant heirs deep below Sharn.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 11–16.</strong></em> After the characters disrupt House Tarkanan’s schemes in the depths of Sharn, the gang sends powerful assassins with fearsome aberrant dragonmarks after the party.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 17–20.</strong></em> The Son of Khyber leads a small army of aberrant-marked warriors and assassins to challenge the leadership of Sharn—and plots to conjure a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmBlobOfAnnihila]{Blob of Annihilation}</strong> to level the city’s skyscraping towers.</p><h2>Aberrant Heirs</h2><p>House Tarkanan incorporates members with a wide variety of aberrant dragonmarks. Any Humanoid in the <em>Monster Manual</em> or another source could be a House Tarkanan agent with a mark that doesn’t affect the creature’s use in combat or that is reflected in the creature’s existing abilities. For example, a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmVampireFamilia]{Vampire Familiar}</strong> might gain its unique abilities from an aberrant mark rather than from any connection to a vampire, and a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmBanditDeceiver]{Bandit Deceiver}</strong>’s spellcasting could derive from such a mark. On the other hand, an ordinary <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmBandit00000000]{Bandit}</strong> or <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-monster-manual.actors.Actor.mmTough000000000]{Tough}</strong> might have an aberrant mark that allows the NPC to cast <em>Disguise Self</em>, <em>Silent Image</em>, or a similar spell with little impact on the NPC’s combat abilities.</p><p>The two stat blocks presented here, along with the <strong>Tarkanan Assassin</strong> in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, illustrate members of House Tarkanan who wield the power of their aberrant marks in combat.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaTarkananMarau]{Tarkanan Marauder}.</strong></em> This powerful assassin relies on teleportation to catch targets unaware and deal out rapid death.</p><p><em><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaTarkananRuffi]{Tarkanan Ruffian}.</strong></em> This rank-and-file gang member, recruited off the streets of Sharn, uses sinister lightning powers to supplement ordinary weaponry.</p>"

On any day where no character succeeds on this check, they have another encounter from the Jungle Mishaps table. (Reroll a repeated result of 8 on the table.) After 3 days where at least one character succeeded on this check, the party at last discovers the Crab Temple.</p><p><em><strong>Racing Rivals.</strong></em> The party’s rivals more or less keep pace with them through most of the journey. You might give the characters a chance to interact with their rivals in Stormreach, in Last Chance, or in the jungle (particularly if you roll an 8 on the Jungle Mishaps table). Depending on how these interactions go, you can decide whether the rivals reach the temple before or after the characters, or perhaps fail in their mission entirely. Or you can assume that the rivals find the temple 11 days after leaving Last Chance, and compare that to the time the party spends to determine who wins the race.</p><p><em><strong>Crab Temple.</strong></em> The temple is a partially flooded ruin crafted by drow shortly after the fall of the empire of giants. Its name comes from a statue of a humanoid figure outside the ruins; someone removed the statue’s head at one point, and a large crab’s shell became lodged on its shoulders. Use the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.scenes.Scene.efaDragonsLair00]{Dragon’s Lair} map in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> to represent the temple. (The statue on a dais in the northeast corner of the ruins gives the temple its name.) The temple rises slightly out of a lake, so everything below level 1 is submerged, including the stairs leading down to level 2.</p><p><em><strong>Ruin Denizens.</strong></em> A band of kuo-toa (one <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoaMonitor]{Kuo-toa Monitor}</strong>, two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoaWhip000]{Kuo-toa Whips}</strong>, and five <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoa0000000]{Kuo-toa}</strong>) inhabits level 2 of the ruin. They swim quickly to level 1 and initiate combat if anything disturbs the water at the top of the stairs.</p><p><em><strong>Plundering the Ruins.</strong></em> By diving into the lower levels of the temple, the characters can find abundant ancient relics to make their expedition a success:</p><ul><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">[[/award 10PP 100GP]]</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaIridescentCon]{Iridescent conch shell}, carved with Giant runes, that echoes with the sounds of a maelstrom (worth 250 GP)</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaGiantsGoldRin]{Giant-size gold ring} set with turquoise (worth 250 GP)</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Waterproof case holding a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaPeriaptOfWoun]{Periapt of Wound Closure}</em>, a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaPotOfAwakenin]{Pot of Awakening}</em>, and a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.items.Item.efaSpellScrollTa]{Spell Scroll of Tasha’s Hideous Laughter}</em></li></ul><p><em><strong>Optional: Temple Depths.</strong></em> You can add this encounter in level 3 of the ruins if the characters can cooperate with their rivals to overcome it. In this case, the rivals come prepared with <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPotionOfWater]{Potions of Water Breathing}</em> for themselves and have enough extra to share with the party (for a price). On the bottom level of the ruin, the combined parties encounter a <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoaArchpri]{Kuo-toa Archpriest}</strong>, two <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaKuotoa0000000]{Kuo-toa}</strong>, and four <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.actors.Actor.efaGiantCrab0000]{Giant Crabs}</strong>.

As a result of this unity, each member of your party can grant &amp;Reference[Advantage] to a &amp;Reference[D20 Test] made by another member of the party. To grant Advantage in this way, you and your target must be able to see or hear each other, and neither can have the &amp;Reference[Incapacitated] condition. After granting this Advantage, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.</p><h2>Compensation</h2><p>The university pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment influences how you are paid. On average, the university pays each member of your group [[/award 1GP]] per day (enough to sustain a Modest lifestyle). Or you might be paid a bounty (at least [[/award 250GP]]) for each ancient relic you bring back from your adventures and give to the university.</p><h2>Documentation</h2><p>Each member of your group has identification papers noting their affiliation with Morgrave University, which carries clout in academic circles. The university also acquires documentation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers for you if your work requires them. Finally, if your adventures take you to @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaDangerousDest.JournalEntryPage.XendrikbcA9LjhOd]{Xen’drik}, the university secures the necessary letters of marque issued by the king of Breland, which grant you permission to explore the ruins there.</p><h2>Research</h2><p>The university has abundant resources to facilitate any research your mission requires. Whenever your group takes a Bastion turn, you can (as a group) issue the Research order to the university as if it were a @UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.bastions.Item.dmgLibrary000000]{Library} special facility in your Bastion. Once your group reaches level 13, you instead can issue the Research order to the university as if it were an @UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.bastions.Item.dmgArchive000000]{Archive}.</p><h2>Resources</h2><p>Morgrave University has extensive libraries and museums. You can call in a favor to gain access to resources that are generally not on exhibit: dangerous relics, magic items, spellbooks, and the like. Additionally, you can consult with experts in various fields among the university faculty—so long as you can coax them away from their work.</p><h2>Training</h2><p>You have access to continuing education at no cost. You can spend 30 days in classes to gain one of the following benefits:</p><ul><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You gain proficiency in the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skill. You can gain proficiency in only one skill in this way.</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You gain proficiency with a tool.</li><li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You learn a language.</li></ul>"

If the characters are altruistic researchers seeking to expand the frontiers of knowledge, their rivals should be greedy, selfish, and ruthless—the worst representatives of Morgrave’s bad reputation. They seek fame, wealth, and power by plundering the secrets of ancient civilizations and claiming the magic and money they find for themselves.</p><p>On the other hand, if the characters seem motivated by greed, choose as their rivals high-minded scholars from Wynarn.

Seeing the adventurers’ growing success, unscrupulous adversaries might engage in sabotage, theft, and similar escalating (but not violent) attacks. Or the characters might use such tactics themselves as their rivals enjoy a series of lucky finds and major successes.

The adventurers might set out explicitly to prevent the Emerald Claw from acquiring powerful magic, or the two groups might be searching for the same sites and treasures. But the Claw agents seem to have inside information on the characters’ activities and plans!</p><p><em><strong>Levels 11–16.</strong></em> The spy at Morgrave University is uncovered and emerges as a powerful villain—perhaps a mighty necromancer or a vampire—who takes center stage through middle to high levels. Now the Emerald Claw primarily works to get the adventurers out of the way so they can’t foil Lady Illmarrow’s greater schemes.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 17–20.</strong></em> The characters or the Emerald Claw agents acquire information about the Mark of Death, attracting Lady Illmarrow’s attention. The would-be Queen of the Dead plans an elaborate ritual in the heart of Shae Mordai, the elven City of the Dead. The rite will destroy the islands of Aerenal and elevate Lady Illmarrow to divinity—unless the characters stop her first.</p><h2>Emerald Claw Agents</h2><p>Agents of the Order of the Emerald Claw are soldiers whose obedience to the order and their superiors is absolute.

For example, because the overlord Rak Tulkhesh embodies war, his minions work to cause strife across the world. And Sul Khatesh feeds on the fear evoked by the sinister magic of warlocks and evil wizards, so her minions entice cruel folk to enter into pacts with the Queen of Shadows.</p><p>The Lords of Dust work toward the long-term goal of releasing the overlords from imprisonment by manipulating world events to conform to their interpretations of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaIntroduction0.JournalEntryPage.xl0uAlpKzPB2SpIr]{Draconic Prophecy}.

A demon flies into a rage at the sight of a dragonmarked character and attacks only that character. A mysterious figure in disguise tries to hire the characters to carry out a bizarre mission in a very specific way. The characters find their path through a dungeon cleared out ahead of them, with mangled monster corpses left in the wake of whatever horror preceded them—but the ancient relic they seek there is undisturbed.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 11–16.</strong></em> The Lords of Dust try to manipulate the characters to use the ancient relic to kill a dragon, prominent dragonmarked individual, or political figure. The Lords believe that the characters using the relic in this way will fulfill part of the Draconic Prophecy and serve as an important step toward the overlords’ release. At some point, an evil dragon (an agent of @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efaMarkedConflic.JournalEntryPage.HpYa8dxAB7eqWpIq]{the Chamber}) warns the characters against this manipulation, explaining the nature and goals of the Lords of Dust to them. If the characters refuse to cooperate with the lords, powerful Fiends attack them to claim the relic and place it in the hands of more pliable adventurers.</p><p><em><strong>Levels 17–20.</strong></em> Apparently by coincidence, the adventurers’ latest expedition—the crowning achievement of their careers—leads to the discovery of an Underdark site where an overlord lies imprisoned. A horde of demons appears and attacks, each one throwing itself on the overlord’s prison when it is slain. As each creature’s ichor spills over the prison, cracks appear in the stone surface. Can the adventurers fend off the demons and the ever-increasing manifestations of evil without freeing the overlord and unleashing destruction on the world?</p>"

Some thirty years ago, Jorlanna had a star-crossed romance with an heir of @UUID[Compendium.dnd-forge-artificer.book.JournalEntry.efamarkedHouses0.JournalEntryPage.rFrWeww81qLmXkE8]{House Deneith}—an affair forbidden by the protocols of the dragonmarked houses that date back to the War of the Mark. Though the relationship ended quickly, and rumors of a child have never been proven, Jorlanna’s reputation for poor judgment haunts her. Despite that, her strong vision for a united house, her allies among the Twelve, and her personal magnetism make her a powerful contender for control of the house. Under her leadership, Cannith West conducts investigations in enclaves and magical sites across Aundair, Thrane, and the Eldeen Reaches.
