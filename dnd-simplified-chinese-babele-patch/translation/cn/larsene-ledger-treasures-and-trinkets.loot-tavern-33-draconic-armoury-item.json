When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><em><strong>Ammunition.</strong></em> You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.

Releasing a toxic torrent from each crop of toadstools, the spore-filled salvo produces effects reminiscent of the debilitating deep dragons of The Low.</p><p><em><strong>Toxic Shot.</strong></em> As an action while holding this firearm, you can release a burst of toxic spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/r 8d6]] poison damage and is <span id=\"was-tagged\">poisoned</span> for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't <span id=\"was-tagged\">poisoned</span>. A <span id=\"was-tagged\">poisoned</span> creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this property of the firearm has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><em><strong>Sludge Shot.</strong></em> As an action while holding this firearm, you can release thick, sticky sludge in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the sludge. A creature can use its action to make a DC 16 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within 5 feet of it on a success. Once this property of the firearm has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><em><strong>Torpor Shot.</strong></em> As an action while holding this firearm, you can release a cloud of addling spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or come under the effect of the slow spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this property of the firearm has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p>An inaccurate rifle that deals [[/r 1d10]] piercing damage on a hit.

If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.</p><p><em><strong>Range.</strong></em> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><em><strong>Ammunition.</strong></em> You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p><p><em><strong>Loud (X).</strong></em> The sound of the weapon discharging alerts all hearing creatures within a number of feet as specified by the number in parentheses after the loud property. This range is doubled in echoey locations, such as cave systems, and where sound travels faster, such as underwater.</p><p><em><strong>Reload (X).</strong></em> A limited number of shots, specified by the number in parentheses after the reload property, can be made with this weapon. A character must then reload it using an action.</p><p><em><strong>Two-Handed.</strong></em> This weapon requires two hands to use.

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you succeeds on a saving throw against one of your spells or effects and you are holding this axe, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to force it to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as hot air surrounds the target. The creature takes [[/r 3d6]] fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><i><b>Heavy.</b></i> Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.</p><p><i><b>Two-Handed.</b></i> This weapon requires two hands to use.

Releasing a toxic torrent from each crop of toadstools, the spore-filled salvo produces effects reminiscent of the debilitating deep dragons of The Low.</p><p><em><strong>Toxic Shot.</strong></em> As an action while holding this firearm, you can release a burst of toxic spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/r 7d6]] poison damage and is <span id=\"was-tagged\">poisoned</span> for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't <span id=\"was-tagged\">poisoned</span>. A <span id=\"was-tagged\">poisoned</span> creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this property of the firearm has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><em><strong>Sludge Shot.</strong></em> As an action while holding this firearm, you can release thick, sticky sludge in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the sludge. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within 5 feet of it on a success. Once this property of the firearm has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><em><strong>Torpor Shot.</strong></em> As an action while holding this firearm, you can release a cloud of addling spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or come under the effect of the slow spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this property of the firearm has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p>The longest range of all the firearms, typically equipped with a multi-bullet magazine, it deals [[/r 1d12]] piercing damage on a hit. It has the Ammunition (range 120/480), Loud (500), Reload (6), and Two-handed properties.</p><p><em><strong>Extra Reloads.</strong></em> More expensive models of magitech firearms have a self-reloading mechanism that harnesses the arcanomagnetic engine to re-cock the weapon. If you wish, you can increase the magazine capacity of a magitech firearm up to a maximum of 6, ensuring that the price increases proportionally. For example, a pistol typically costs 200 gp and has reload (2). If you increased this to reload (6), you would multiply the price by 3 for a new cost of 600 gp.</p><p><em><strong>Range.</strong></em> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><em><strong>Ammunition.</strong></em> You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p><p><em><strong>Loud (X).</strong></em> The sound of the weapon discharging alerts all hearing creatures within a number of feet as specified by the number in parentheses after the loud property. This range is doubled in echoey locations, such as cave systems, and where sound travels faster, such as underwater.</p><p><em><strong>Reload (X).</strong></em> A limited number of shots, specified by the number in parentheses after the reload property, can be made with this weapon. A character must then reload it using an action.</p><p><em><strong>Two-Handed.</strong></em> This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.</p>"

They produce a soft, soothing hum when gliding through the air.</p><p>The armour has 10 charges and regains [[/r 1d8+4]] expended charges daily at dawn.</p><p><i><b>Aerial Dash.</b></i> The armour's large wings propel its wearer through the air, but can only remain active for short periods of time. As a bonus action while wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to gain a flying speed of 60 feet until the end of your turn.</p><p><i><b>Trick of the Flight.</b></i> The wings can be deployed at a moment's notice. When you make a Dexterity saving throw while wearing this armour, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charges in order to fly up to 20 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. If this movement takes you out of the area of the effect that triggered the saving throw, you gain advantage on the saving throw and, if you would take half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage on a success.</p><p><i><b>Safe Landing.</b></i> When you would take damage from falling, you can use your reaction to try and use the wings to avoid the impact at the last second. Make a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a success, you take no damage from the fall.</p><p>The wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (<span id=\"was-tagged\">Stealth</span>) checks.</p><p>If the wearer has a Strength score lower than 13, their speed is reduced by 10 feet.</p>",
