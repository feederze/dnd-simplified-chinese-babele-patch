While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:</p><ul><li><p>You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of –30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.<br /></p></li><li>You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: @UUID[Compendium.dnd-tomb-annihilation.items.Item.DEHllCkN9GLW7cNF]{Bigby’s hand} (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.RpKjTlYASrfqUPVA]{cone of cold} (2 charges), <em>flesh to ice</em> (3 charges; as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.kozNy29b0X6exFhY]{flesh to stone} except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WN2LWEljYU6QqnRH]{ice storm} (2 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MImfWCzEPRMYD3Xp]{Otiluke’s freezing sphere} (3 charges), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.dhqBY4TvVjxVmOZd]{sleet storm} (1 charge), @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.9gYGkrL6qFTsE6fw]{spike growth} (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.fzZnVKLmBMo2f5up]{wall of ice} (2 charges).</li><li>You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can’t have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: &amp;Reference[charmed apply=false], &amp;Reference[exhaustion apply=false], &amp;Reference[frightened apply=false], &amp;Reference[paralyzed apply=false], &amp;Reference[petrified apply=false], and &amp;Reference[poisoned apply=false]. The ice creature obeys only its creator’s commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses [[/damage 1d10 average]]hit points per minute as it melts. Use the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.t6scHTmpmHBTZGTX.JournalEntryPage.3RM2KPMlMrSXngN3]{guidelines} in chapter 8 of the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Other Properties.</strong></em> The [[lookup @item.name]] is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can’t break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as a mighty ice primordial named Cryonax.</p><p><em><strong>Destroying the Ring.</strong></em> The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever.</p></details><p></p>",
