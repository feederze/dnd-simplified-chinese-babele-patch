The parasite burrows through your flesh, dealing [[/r 3d8]] necrotic damage to you. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

You automatically fail if you roll a 1 on the [[/r d20]]. Once you have ten additional eyes, you become completely overwhelmed by the parasite and are no longer in control of your actions.</p><p><em><strong>Removal.</strong></em> Over the course of an hour, a creature can perform an operation to remove the parasite from a willing creature. The operating creature must make two <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (</strong><span id=\"was-tagged\"><strong>Medicine</strong></span><strong> or surgeon's tools) checks</strong>. If the creature succeeds on both checks, the scleraworm is removed and can be bottled. If only one is successful, there is no change. If the creature fails both checks, both patient and the scleraworm is killed.</p>",
