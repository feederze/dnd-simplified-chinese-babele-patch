This ability to sustain themselves on almost anything, even on dust and soil, earned them their current name, given by the fiends that employ them, after their original name was long forgotten. A typical eater of dust is 7 feet tall and weighs more than 350 pounds. While an eater of dust cannot speak, it can telepathically communicate.</p><p><strong>Mercenary Companies</strong>. Eaters of dust—or yakat-shi as they are sometimes called in ancient planar texts—roam the lower planes selling their services to arch-devils, demon lords, and other fiendish rulers for the chance to sample new flavors and morsels. Eaters of dust feel only contempt for most other life forms. They attack and eat their non-eater allies at the first sign of weakness. Because of this, eaters of dust often operate in small, deadly units of eaters led by a powerful leader, styled the yakat-norog. </p><p><strong>Armor Shell</strong>. While many sages confuse eaters of dust for some obscure variety of fiend, they are aberrations escaped from a far-flung dimension of madness and nightmares. Indeed, their armor is not armor at all, but a secreted resin that hardens into a shell as strong as steel. When cracked, it exudes a nacreous blood, and the resulting scar resembles mother-of-pearl.

Arboreal grapplers use their long limbs to snatch and drag prey behind them as they use their powerful forelimbs to ascend to the highest canopy. Victims are constricted until their struggles cease and then are devoured. The grapplers’ flexible tentacles are ill-suited for terrestrial movement; they must drag themselves clumsily across open ground too wide to swing across. </p><p><strong>Clans in the Canopy</strong>. Arboreal grappler tribes build family nests decorated with bones and prized relics of past hunts. These nests are built high in the jungle canopy, typically 80 feet or more above the ground. Clans of 40 or more spread across crude villages atop the trees; in such large settlements, a third of the population are juveniles. These nests are difficult to spot from the ground; a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required. A creature observing an arboreal grappler as it climbs into or out of a nest has advantage on the check. </p><p><strong>Carnivorous Elf Hunters</strong>. Grapplers are carnivorous and prefer humanoid flesh, elves in particular. Scholars suggest this arises from hatred as much as from hunger, citing records of various humanoids hunting arboreal grapplers millennia ago.</p>",

These constructs understand and obey simple commands that relate to the removal of garbage.

Instead, it controls a dozen humanoids shuffling about aimlessly, paying little attention to their surroundings. </p><p><strong>Starfish Puppet Masters</strong>.

The mordant snare prefers intelligent food and hunts until an area is empty of sustenance. A village can suffer tremendous losses or even be wiped out before discovering the cause. However, a mordant snare is intelligent enough to know that escaped victims may come back with friends, shovels, and weapons, ready for battle. When this occurs, the snare abandons its puppets, burrows deeper underground, and seeks a new home.</p><p><strong>Cooperative Killers</strong>. Mordant snares are few in number and cannot reproduce. Since the secret of their creation was lost long ago, eventually they will disappear. Until then, they cooperate with each other when in the same areas, using puppets to lure victims to one another. </p>",

Long ago when Odin brokered the truce that brought peace among the gods, the wily deity magically created the ravenfolk from feathers plucked from his ravens Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory). He placed this new race into the world alongside elves, dwarves, humans, and others to be his eyes and ears.</p><p><strong>Odin’s Children</strong>. To this day, the ravenfolk are Odin’s agents and embody his thought and memory. They are thieves of objects, yes, but primarily, they are thieves of secrets. Their black feathers and long beaks are spotted on the road from place to place, trading information or helping to hatch plots. They are widely viewed as spies, informers, thieves, and troublemakers, but when the ravenfolk swear an oath, they abide by it. Odin grants the best of his ravenfolk magical runespears and runestaves, weapons enchanted to serve his messengers. The ravenfolk consider them special tokens meant for their use, and no one else’s.</p><p><strong>Flightless But Bold</strong>. Though they have no wings and normally cannot fly, the physiology of ravenfolk is strikingly similar to that of true avians. They stand roughly 5 feet tall and, because of their hollow bones, weigh just 95–105 pounds. Albino ravenfolk are often found in southern climates. Ravenfolk eat almost anything, but they prefer raw meat and field grains, such as corn, soy, and alfalfa. They even scavenge days-old carrion, a practice that repulses most other humanoids.</p><p><strong>Feather Speech</strong>. The ravenfolk have two languages: a verbal language full of croaks and whistles and a language of feathers. Ravenfolk can communicate volumes without speaking a word through the dyeing, arrangement, preening, and rustling of their plumage. This language is inherent to ravenfolk, and though others may use magic to understand it, it can’t be used by creatures without feathers.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Ravenfolk in Midgard</h3><p>If the ravenfolk of Midgard have a homeland, it is Beldestan to the East, on a branch of Wotan’s tree in the North, or a high cliff of Horus’ hidden temple in the South.

Many jungle clans believe the dipsa is an eyeless snake, but it is a tubular ooze with a lethal, poisonous bite. The dipsa’s venom has an anesthetic quality that allows the ooze to cling to creatures and slowly turn their innards to jelly without being noticed until the victim falls down dead. Once the poison’s numbing property wears off, however, victims report an agonizing sense of burning from the inside out. </p><p><strong>Tiny Fangs</strong>. A dipsa’s undulating movement evokes that of a snake as much as its serpentine form, but close examination reveals that it has neither bones nor internal organs, only tiny fangs of the same color and substance as the rest of its body. A dipsa never exceeds 1 foot in length. Its coloration oscillates between sickly hues of yellow or green. </p><p><strong>Gelatinous Eggs</strong>. Dipsas are hermaphroditic. When two dipsas breed, they leave behind a hundred gelatinous eggs in a small puddle of highly acidic milt. A dozen become fertilized and survive long enough to hatch, after which they immediately devour the others.</p>",

They target a group when desperate or when there’s more than one myling in the pack. They shadow a target until after dark, then jump onto the target’s back and demand to be carried to their chosen burial ground. They cling tightly to a victim with arms and legs locked around the victim’s shoulders and midsection, begging, threatening, and biting until the victim gives in to their demands. Mylings bite victims to death if the victim is unable or unwilling to carry them, or if a victim moves too slowly.</p><p><strong>Ungrateful Rest</strong>.

      "description": "<blockquote><p>This aquamarine dragon has a shark’s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Divine Dragons</strong>. Sea dragons are the children of the ocean and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they might be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea. Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.</p><p><strong>Shipwreck Art</strong>. Sea dragons love collecting treasure. They especially prize the sunken, treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.</p><p><strong>Sunken Memorials</strong>. A sea dragon’s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.</p><h2>A Sea Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Sea dragons dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral. Whatever the place, it’s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.</p><p>The sky surrounding a sea dragon’s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Create Coral Wall</strong>. The dragon creates an opaque wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature in its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space on whichever side of the wall it wants, and it must make a [[/save dex 15 format=long]], taking [[/damage 4d8 slashing average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While the wall remains, any creature that touches the wall must also make the saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hp, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to poison damage and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invoke the Sea’s Calm</strong>. The currents around up to four creatures in the water and that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it work against the creatures. Each target must succeed on a [[/save str 15 format=long]] or it can’t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make more than one attack on its turn until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Whirlpools</strong>. Four vortexes of water appear centered on points underwater or on the water’s surface that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each vortex takes the shape of a cylinder that is 30 feet tall with a 5-foot radius. Each creature that enters a vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a [[/save str 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained}. A creature, including a restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 15 format=long]]. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary sea dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chill of the Deeps</strong>. Water temperatures drop sharply within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair, turning the water frigid and endangering swimming creatures not accustomed to arctic waters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tempestuous Weather</strong>. Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thriving Waterways</strong>. Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Priests of Seggotan</h3><p>Every sea dragon is devoted to the dragon god of the sea. As a result, many sea dragons use the innate spellcasting variant. Sea dragons favor spells that manipulate water or the weather, emulate storms, deal lightning or cold damage, divine the future, or conjure sea creatures to fight alongside the dragon.</p></article></div><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Sea Dragons in Midgard</h3><p>Sea dragons are the offspring of Seggotan, the dragon god of time and the sea. A sea dragon shares its god’s idea that everything in the sea is the property of Seggotan, and they expect lesser beings to respect that truth.</p><p>The sea dragons are among the most powerful allies of the Mharoti Empire, securing seaways and acting as a communion point for the tidal priests. Thankfully for the Empire’s enemies, the most ancient sea dragons are too consumed with contemplation of time and their inscrutable duties in the depths of the ocean to make war.</p></article></div>",

These fiends sprang from the dark imagination of Hell’s Prince of Swarms, Arbeyach, who twisted them into being from lemures and scorpions. Arbeyach shaped the koralk to be not only annihilators in battle, but to gather souls from the fallen, bypassing typical soul collection methods to feed his war machine more quickly. Because of this, they are sometimes called “harvester devils.”</p><p><strong>Transforming Poison</strong>. Poison from the koralk’s stingers liquefies the victim’s insides in an agonizing transformation. The creature swells as its organs, muscles, and skeleton rapidly break down and reform, transforming the creature into a lemure in a burst of fiendish goo. The new lemure is subject to the will of more powerful devils, and its fate from that moment on is the same as any lemure’s. Astoundingly, the koralk’s poison can work this transformation on demons, giving Arbeyach’s armies a unique edge.</p><p><strong>Infernal Mounts</strong>. A koralk is strong enough for many devils to ride. They prefer to allow only powerful devils as riders, but they obey their superiors and carry even the lowest of devils into battle if directed. Arbeyach often rides an especially large specimen into battle, called the Grand Annihilator by his devilish troops.</p>",

    "Ancient Flame Dragon": {
      "name": "Ancient Flame Dragon",
      "tokenName": "Ancient Flame Dragon",
      "description": "<blockquote><p>The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw.</p></blockquote><p>Flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse often used by the foolish.</p><p><strong>Taunting Others</strong>. The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.</p><p><strong>Malevolent Purpose</strong>. The results of a flame dragon’s schemes are secondary to the enjoyment it derives from pursuing a nebulous and ever-changing goal. Some flame dragons spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into dire insults. The vengeance itself is secondary to an excuse for hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge. Each is a delightful hobby. Any disruption in their game kindles a terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.</p><p><strong>Fond of Souvenirs</strong>. Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.</p><p><strong>Vengeful Brethren</strong>. Nothing is safe from a flame dragon’s scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided attention for generations. Wiser still, is to remove all trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.</p><h2>A Flame Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Flame dragons dwell near ever-burning fires: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, it must serve as a showcase for all the dragon’s trophies. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the area, sometimes protected behind crystal walls. This display feeds the dragon’s vanity and pride, and it serves as a lure for adventurers. Many of these lairs also feature a huge, reflective surface, as a flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Blinding Smoke</strong>. A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners, and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[blinded]{blinded} for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li><li><p><strong>Curtain of Fire</strong>. A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and is opaque. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or take [[/damage 6d6 fire average]] damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes [[/damage 6d6 fire average]] damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Volcanic Debris</strong>. The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or be knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone} and buried under rock and debris. The buried creature is restrained and can’t breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take an action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 15 format=long]].</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary flame dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Extreme Heat</strong>. Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair, causing most water sources to dry up and all but the hardiest plants to wither.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fiery Tempers</strong>. Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.</p></li><li><p><strong>Superheated Fumaroles</strong>. Sulfur geysers dot the landscape within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair, making the area inhospitable for most plants and creatures.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, Fiery Tempers disappears immediately, and temperatures return to normal within [[/r 1d10]] days. Any geysers remain where they are.</p>",

      "description": "<blockquote><p>These mounted knights wield great weapons as swift as dawn, as bright as the blazing sun, and as cold as the grave. The white horseman is a young rider full of promise, the red rider a man in his prime, and the black rider a scarred and bearded fellow, his eyes dark and his mouth set in a grim frown. They ride with purpose on powerful steeds.</p></blockquote><p>Baba Yaga’s three horsemen are legends in their own right. Bright Day, Red Sun, and Black Night (also known as the White, Red, and Black horsemen) are her faithful emissaries, scouts, and warriors abroad. The three horsemen change over time, but they are typically male, human warriors. Their appearance is distinctive: each horseman dresses in colors and lacquered armor and trappings to suit their name, with their magical horses colored to match. Their roles appear to coincide with their appointed offices, although their precise relationship to Baba Yaga is the source of much speculation.</p><p><strong>Varied Origin</strong>. They may be serving Grandmother Winter for a time in exchange for a favor or bargain, or they may be cursed to replace a previous horseman they slew. In either case, Baba Yaga is the source of their power. The horsemen are innately connected to the domain of time; each represents part of the day, as measured by the sun. Bright Day is bound to and governs dawn to mid-day, Red Sun from mid-day to sundown, and Black Night rules until daybreak. While Baba Yaga herself is wily and capricious, her three horsemen are bound to cosmological forces that are uniform and constant, which is reflected in their alignment and demeanor.</p><p><strong>One Rises, Two Set</strong>. The horsemen never co-exist with one another except within the confines of their mistresses’ Dancing Hut and the fenced yard around it. Each one must yield his presence on the Material Plane to his successor in rotation (this varies on other planes, depending on intervals of day and night). Forcing two horsemen to co-exist on the Material Plane places a perilous strain on reality. Bringing all three together could trigger a primal magical event or chronal catastrophe.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Baba Yaga’s Horsemen in Midgard</h3><p>The great witch Baba Yaga is a power to be reckoned with in Midgard, always plotting with her daughters, the @UUID[Compendium.kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023.tob-1-2023-creatures.Actor.degnu3X7o8BrbrKu]{vila} (see page 386), and seeking to gobble up the vile gnomes whose souls she claims are rightfully hers. Baba Yaga rules over great ley line magic and commands the elements and enchantments with ease, but she cannot be everywhere at once.</p><p>Three of her most faithful servants are the White Horseman, the Red Horseman and the Black Horseman—embodied forms of the times of day and a symbol of Baba Yaga’s mastery of time itself. She uses nicknames for them, calling them “My Bright Dawn, my Red Sun, and my Dark Midnight” because they are bound by time (and some believe, because they control dawn, noon, and sunset). She has many servants, but the horsemen, her dancing hut, and the sorcerer Koshchei the Deathless are the greatest.</p><h3>The Three Horsemen</h3><p>All three horsemen use the statistics presented here, but each has a few unique characteristics from his brethren, as defined below.</p><p>Bright Day. This horseman has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and resistance to cold damage and fire damage.</p><p>Red Sun. This horseman is immune to being blinded, charmed, and frightened and has immunity to fire damage.</p><p>Black Night. This horseman has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and magical darkness doesn’t impede his darkvision. In addition, he has immunity to cold damage.</p><h3>Encounters with Baba Yaga’s Horsemen</h3><p>The horsemen make good foes for the long term; their power is great enough that they can ignore considerable danger when serving their mistress. Here are some possible encounters involving them:</p><p>Red Sun burns down a village while the PCs are sleeping at the inn. If questioned or challenged, he says nothing, but provides a scroll from Baba Yaga ordering the village’s destruction. Red Sun rides off into the dawn.</p><p>Black Night bears a similar scroll, asking an elvish character to provide Baba Yaga with a pint of blood; if the request is granted, Black Night leaves without incident, but if he is denied, a young human boy is found outside the party’s sleeping chambers, drained of all blood.</p><p>At noon, Bright Day leads a parade of strange creatures, everything from shadow fey duelists and enchantresses to a glowing will-o’-wisp and a bright malakbel demon (see page 85), burning so bright it sets fire to crops and thatched huts near it. The fey mention Bright Day is going to pay Baba Yaga’s respects to the River King. If the party chooses to join the procession, they can’t leave it until sunset—and may find their company is not entirely welcome.</p></article></div>",

A vicious mouth lined with glistening teeth graces each head, and its green scales gleam in the fleeting sunlight.</p></blockquote><p>Hunting beneath the canopy of the forest, lurking below the surfaces of lakes, and guarding caves concealing great treasure and mystery, the zmey has two roles—vicious terror and nature’s protector.</p><p><strong>Claws of the Forest</strong>. Single-mindedly destructive, the zmey keeps the heart of the forest free from interlopers. Rumors suggest the heart of an ancient forest itself can control the actions of these lesser dragons, while others believe zmeys have pacts with certain druid circles.</p><p><strong>Solitary Hunters</strong>. Zmeys avoid their own kind, seeking out isolated hunting grounds. They eat any organic matter, but they favor the fresh meat of large birds and mammals. They consider alseids (see page 15), halflings, and gnomes especially succulent.</p><p><strong>Three-Headed Rage</strong>. Green scales cover this enormous beast, and its three towering necks are each topped with an identical, menacing head. Its heads feature spiny, frilled membranes, and forked tongues flicker across long, pale teeth.</p><p><strong>Voracious Headlings</strong>. A zmey’s head doesn’t die when severed from its body. Instead, the head rapidly sprouts a stunted body and two vestigial claws with which it can fight and drag itself across the ground. Within days, it develops into a complete, miniature zmey. After two months, it becomes a full-grown zmey with three heads. This rapid growth is fueled by a voracious appetite, and the headling eats everything it can. Coating the head or headling with a pound of salt within its first month of life prevents this growth.</p><h2>A Zmey’s Lair</h2><p>Zmeys make their lairs in the deepest, darkest parts of the forest, where the canopy of trees overhead is almost like a cave. They create nests from fallen trees. They plant and grow trees into satellite “rooms” within their lair, designating different tree-rooms for treasure, food, and leisure.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the zmey takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hinder Movement</strong>. One hostile creature the zmey can see within 120 feet of it has its speed halved until initiative count 20 on the next round, as roots trip up walking and hanging branches and vines dangle in the way of flight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invigorate Headlings</strong>. One severed zmey head the zmey can see within 120 feet of it immediately grows into a zmey headling, or one slain zmey headling the zmey can see within 120 feet of it regains 10 hp and becomes active again. A severed head or zmey headling smeared in a pound of salt can’t be affected by this lair action.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spread Forest’s Gloom</strong>. Light reduces in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the zmey can see within 120 feet of it. Bright light becomes dim light, dim light becomes darkness, and darkness becomes magical darkness in the sphere. The sphere lasts until the zmey dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing the zmey’s lair is warped by the link between the creature and its forest home, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fear and Rage</strong>. Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel constantly on the verge of an overwhelming fight-or-flight response, keeping them on edge and making their sleep fitful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unfriendly Forest</strong>. The forest within 6 miles of the lair is as uninviting as possible to those not native to it: unattended fires go out mysteriously and new fires are hard to start, the meat and hides of caught game or the flesh of foraged edible plants and mushrooms seem to be somehow already spoiled, the local wildlife seems especially hostile, paths seem to be overgrown and hard to pass, and similar.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unnerving Presence</strong>. Creatures within 3 miles of the lair are unsettled by the forest, as if sensing a powerful and malignant presence all around them. They find themselves frequently distracted by phantom chattering, tricks of the light, and other rogue sensations.</p></li></ul><p>If the zmey dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

      "description": "<h1 class=\"noborder\">Fey Lords and Ladies</h1><p>Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.</p><p><strong>Heads of State</strong>. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble’s domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler’s word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that’s no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.</p><p><strong>Vacant Thrones</strong>. When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court’s vacant throne.</p><h1 class=\"noborder\">Queen of Witches (Fey Lady)</h1><p>This statuesque woman towers over any tall man and most ogres. Her hair falls in a cascade of curls and looks as if it is spun from copper. Her eyes are the color of moss beds, with no iris or pupil. A billowy robe of forest green enshrouds her body, and she grasps a great ring of etched silver in one massive fist.</p><p>Nicnevin, the Queen of Witches, is the Mountain Ogress, Lady of Copper and Crystal, and the Moon Weaver. She is not what one usually imagines in a fey lady, but she has an imposing figure of mass and power. Her stature speaks to great physical strength and the stalwart defiance of the mountain itself, but her true power is in her command of magic.</p><p><strong>Pact Patron</strong>. The Queen of Witches is one of the foremost patrons of those who seek power through a pact. Many hag covens offer her loyalty and tribute. She rules from beneath her mountain, attended by a court of fey witches, hags, and mortal supplicants. Her favor is highly sought after, and it is said that a single hair from her coppery head contains all the power a mortal might ever desire.</p><h2>The Queen of Witches’s Lair</h2><p>The Queen of Witches makes her lair in a cavern deep beneath a windswept, rocky mountain. Near the mountain’s peak is an enormous quartz crystal that grows down to the lair. This crystal channels the light of the moon into the Queen’s home when she doesn’t emerge into the night sky. Her hags and attendant witches perform powerful rites in this magic-saturated sanctum.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Queen of Witches takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Conjure Crystal Wall</strong>. A wall of softly glowing crystal springs up from a solid surface the Queen can see within 120 feet of her. The wall is 60 feet long, 10 feet high, 5 feet thick, blocks line of sight, and sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants, and must succeed on a [[/save dex 20 format=long]] or take [[/save 4d6 radiant average]] damage. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 15, 10 hp, vulnerability to thunder damage, resistance to fire, slashing, and piercing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The wall remains until the Queen uses this lair action again, until she dismisses it as a bonus action, or until she dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disrupt Spellcasting</strong>. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, each creature, other than fey, that casts a spell while within 60 feet of the Queen must succeed on a [[/save con 20 format=long]] or the spell fails, expending the spell slot.</p></li><li><p><strong>Moonlight Blast</strong>. A searing flare of moonlight bursts from a point the Queen can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must succeed on a [[/save dex 20 format=long]], taking [[/damage 3d8 radiant average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature not in its true form has disadvantage on the saving throw, and if it fails, it reverts to its true form.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing the Queen of Witches’s lair is warped by the queen’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lunar Constancy</strong>. Despite the weather, the moon is always visible for most of the night within 10 miles of the lair. Cloud cover has many breaks, or the moon’s light sharply penetrates the clouds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Moonlit Audience</strong>. Calling the Queen of Witches’s name under the light of the moon within 3 miles of her lair draws her attention. She can choose to teleport to the supplicant and hear their request. For 24 hours after the invocation, even if the Queen never teleported to the supplicant, she has a connection to the area where the supplicant called for her and can teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of it or back to her lair as an action.</p></li><li><p><strong>Susurrating Fog</strong>. Silvery fog is common within 10 miles of the lair, and strange whispers are heard within the mist.</p></li></ul><p>If the Queen of Witches dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

When they hatch, they attack each other, until a few survivors remain. </p><p><strong>Ornery Steeds</strong>. While not very smart and exceedingly violent, caustic chargers can be persuaded to partner with smaller creatures that might not provide much nourishment but can offer a bounty of prey.

      "description": "<h1 class=\"noborder\">Fey Lords and Ladies</h1><p>Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.</p><p><strong>Heads of State</strong>. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble’s domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler’s word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that’s no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.</p><p><strong>Vacant Thrones</strong>. When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court’s vacant throne.</p><h1 class=\"noborder\">Snow Queen (Fey Lady)</h1><blockquote><p>This severe elf has pale, almost white skin and tightly braided blond hair. Her gown is exquisite, fashioned of luminous blue fabric that catches light and shines from within. Lacy ice crystals accent the gown, and a snow-white mantle cascades from her shoulders. Icicles radiate in a crownlike halo behind her head, drifting gracefully through the air.</p></blockquote><p>Her Crystalline Majesty, Morrinn, is the cold-hearted Snow Queen, Daughter of Boreas. The Snow Queen rules a northern kingdom in the remote, frozen reaches of the world. Perpetually shrouded in snow and ice, her domain is inhospitable to outsiders. She rules from a castle of delicate spires carved entirely out of ice. The dwelling catches and reflects even the faintest glimmer of light, shining like a beacon and enticing travelers to risk the dangerous winter realm.</p><p><strong>Queen of Giants</strong>. The Snow Queen is proud and cruel to any who cross her. Her daughters, the ice maidens (see page 238), roam her kingdom with ease. Travelers who can’t give a good reason to be moving through the Queen’s territory meet a quick end in the maidens’ chilly embrace. The Snow Queen commands the loyalty of winter-born tribes of fraughashar (see page 192), ogres, frost giants, thursir giants (see page 210), and trollkin (see page 371). She is said to have mocked both Thor and Loki and often leads their priests astray into winter storms.</p><h2>The Snow Queen’s Lair</h2><p>The Snow Queen’s lair is a castle made of ice. Sunlight and moonlight flash through the delicate spires and translucent walls, setting the palace agleam even in the deepest night. The castle reflects its mistress: beautiful, cold, and unforgivingly deadly.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Snow Queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Snow Queen can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Induce Snow Blindness</strong>. The snow and ice of the lair shimmer and gleam, catching the light and flashing it into the eyes of the Snow Queen’s foes. Each hostile creature within 30 feet of the Snow Queen has disadvantage on attack rolls against her until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Isolated Blizzard</strong>. A blast of wintry weather and heavy snow falls in a 30-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the Snow Queen can see within 120 feet of her. The area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a [[/save 18 str format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[restrained apply=false]{restrained} by the snow. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 18 format=long]]. The snow melts away when the Queen uses this lair action again or when the Queen dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snow Wall</strong>. A wall of dense snow erupts on a solid surface within 120 feet of the Snow Queen. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must succeed on a [[/save dex 18 format=long]] or take [[/damage 4d6 cold average]] damage and be pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, though the wall is filled with freezing snow. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. A creature that starts its turn in the wall or enters the wall’s space for the first time on a turn must make a [[/save con 18 format=long]], taking [[/damage 4d6 cold average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 15 hp, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall melts when the Queen uses this lair action again or when she dies.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing the Snow Queen’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Concealing Flurries</strong>. Light snowfall or swirling powder blown by the wind lightly obscures the area within 5 miles of the lair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Permafrost</strong>. Within 10 miles of the lair, snow and ice resist melting, doing so only after prolonged contact with fire or other major source of heat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snow-Covered Land</strong>. Deep snow and frequent snowfall make the area within 3 miles of the lair difficult terrain for Medium and smaller creatures.</p></li></ul><p>If the Snow Queen dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

Treacles feed on blood but lack the natural weapons or acid of larger slimes. To survive, prey must welcome and embrace them, unaware of the threat.

Once they have assumed a nonthreatening form, treacles mewl, sing, or make pitiful noises to attract attention. Once they’re in contact with a potential victim, treacles drain blood slowly, ideally while their prey sleeps. If threatened or injured, treacles flee.

Certainly, the earliest hounds were built for work and war, but recent varieties also include some that are deceptively big-eyed and painted as children’s toys or to match a young aristocrat’s favorite outfit.</p><p><strong>Serve the Rulers</strong>. Despite this brief flirtation with fashion, most clockwork hounds continue to serve town watches, royal huntsmen, road wardens, moneylenders, and criminal gangs as loyal trackers and guards.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Clockworks in Midgard</h3><p>Clockwork magic in Midgard is common in the Free City of Zobeck and other advanced towns and cities.

Shifting between the past, present, and future, chronalmentals are formed from temporal energy. They flow like sand in an hourglass and exist between the ticks of a clock. The first chronalmentals were forged from extra time left over from the beginning of the universe. Many served as shock troopers in unfathomable wars between angels and fiends or gods and ancient titans. Most were lost between seconds or abandoned to drift in the Astral Plane or in the void between the stars.</p><p><strong>Stewards of Calamity</strong>. Locations of historical significance—both past and future—attract chronalmentals. They have a fondness for battlefields and other sites of strife. Because they are drawn to noteworthy places, chronalmentals have a reputation as harbingers of calamity, and their presence may incite panic among scholars, priests, and sages.</p><p><strong>Environmental Chaos</strong>. Whatever the terrain, the environment behaves strangely around the chronalmental. Collapsed walls might suddenly rise, seedlings become massive trees, and fallen soldiers relive their dying moments.

They marched without stopping; dozens, even hundreds, bringing fresh earth to the white-fungus trees of the great forests. Their claws skittered with a sound like horseshoes slipping on stone, but their multiple legs ensured they never fell. The air around them singed the nostrils with the taint of acid.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Beasts of Burden and War</strong>. Carrion beetles are powerful beasts of burden with strong jaws and the ability to both climb and burrow. With a wide back, serrated, spiky forelegs, and a narrow head, the carrion beetle is too large to ride on comfortably, but it makes an excellent platform for ballistae and howdahs. Its thick exoskeleton varies from drab brown, tan, and black to shimmering blue green, purple-green, and a highly prized yellow-orange. The largest carrion beetles make a distinctive wheezing sound when their spiracles are stressed; this noise creates a hum when multiple beetles run or charge on the field of battle. </p><p><strong>Devour Fungi and Carrion</strong>. Carrion beetles rarely gather in groups larger than a breeding pair and a small cluster of offspring in the wild. Domesticated varieties travel in herds of 20–40 to feed on fungal forests, scavenge battlefields, devour cave lichen, and scour sewage pits. When breeding season hits, carrion beetles feast on the bodies of large animals. They are often found in symbiotic relationships with deathcap myconids, darakhul, and related species. Many species in the deep underworld consider carrion beetles food and use their exoskeletons to fashion shields and armor (though their chitin is too brittle for weaponry). Purple worms are their major predators. The worms swallow entire caravans when they find the beetles within. </p><p><strong>Domesticated by Ghouls</strong>. Domesticated by the darakhul, the carrion beetles live a more complex life. They begin as simple pack animals, with the strongest being trained as war beetles. War beetles often carry ballistae and harpoons fitted with lines for use against flying foes. In late life, the beetles are used as excavators, scouring out tunnels with their acid. After death, their exoskeletons are used both as animated scouting vehicles (ghouls hide within the shell to approach hostile territory) and as armored undead platforms packed with archers and spellcasters.</p>",

Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.</p></blockquote><p>Apex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.</p><p><strong>Born to Darkness</strong>. Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages, which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight. Cave dragon hide is more like eel skin than reptilian scales, and it grows mottled with brown and black as it ages.</p><p><strong>Ravenous Marauders</strong>. Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. Alliances they make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically fail. Cave dragons do form alliances with peoples of the underworld, joining them in battle against enemies, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.</p><p><strong>A Hard Life</strong>. Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest tend to die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. Their nigh-endless hunger leaves the ancients the most likely of cave dragons to form alliances, especially with allies that promise—and deliver—food. On occasion, cave dragons climb to the surface to feed, but their earthbound, plodding pace leaves them outcompeted by other predators or unable to keep up with swift or flying prey. They prefer tight tunnels where they can ambush and outmaneuver prey.</p><p><strong>Edible Hoards and Vertical Lairs</strong>. Due to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon’s hoard may consist largely of food sources: bat colonies, enormous beetles, carcasses in states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn’t immediately devour. Cave dragons are fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, arranged like artful ossuaries. Large vertical chimneys serve as nesting sites for eggs and are popular resting places when a cave dragon sleeps within its lair. Chimneys just wide enough to hold young cave dragons make preferred ambush sites, as the dragons’ tough spikes help hold them in position until prey passes beneath. The oldest cave dragons also retreat to vertical chimneys near nesting sites or within their lairs to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.</p>",

      "description": "<blockquote><p>The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw.</p></blockquote><p>Flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse often used by the foolish.</p><p><strong>Taunting Others</strong>. The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.</p><p><strong>Malevolent Purpose</strong>. The results of a flame dragon’s schemes are secondary to the enjoyment it derives from pursuing a nebulous and ever-changing goal. Some flame dragons spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into dire insults. The vengeance itself is secondary to an excuse for hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge. Each is a delightful hobby. Any disruption in their game kindles a terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.</p><p><strong>Fond of Souvenirs</strong>. Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.</p><p><strong>Vengeful Brethren</strong>. Nothing is safe from a flame dragon’s scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided attention for generations. Wiser still, is to remove all trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.</p>",

The depths of the jungle are filled with beautiful-but-lethal wildlife, and prismatic beetles are superlative examples of this. These flesh-eating, venomous insects distract and subdue their prey with sparkling beauty even as they devour it alive. Individual prismatic beetles sparkle like precious gems in the light. Tosculi (see page 365) traders, gnolls, and humans often incorporate their carapaces into decorative jewelry or use them as special components in enchantment and illusion spells and items. </p><p><strong>Hypno-Paralytic</strong>. When swarming in the thousands, these beautiful bugs create a hypnotic cascade of glimmering hues capable of enthralling creatures. As they descend on their dazed prey, the beetles’ bites slowly paralyze their victims while their toxins distract the mind with feelings of euphoria and delight. </p><p><strong>Predator Partners</strong>. Although carnivorous, prismatic beetles are not overly aggressive; they attack other creatures only when hungry or threatened. Even when they’re not attacking, however, they can be a threat. More than one unwary traveler has stopped to admire what they thought was a docile swarm of prismatic beetles and became captivated. The unfortunates are often killed and eaten by a lurking jungle predator, as such animals know the beetles can attract prey.</p>",

      "description": "<blockquote><p>Blood flows up the slain man’s body, defying gravity as it makes its way into the skin and fanged maw of this wild-haired vampire.</p></blockquote><p>Pact warlocks are warlocks who seek transformation into a vampire while blessed by a patron of blood, destruction, or undead. The pact vampire’s thirst for blood is so all-consuming that it can draw the blood of others through the air to its open maw.</p><p><strong>Blood Line</strong>. The patron’s blessing frees the warlock from some of a vampire’s weaknesses, but it also secures a magical line of blood and life energy between the warlock and the patron. This drives the warlock to wantonly shed and drink blood, fueling the patron with each drop. A pact vampire must feed blood to its patron weekly by shedding the blood of other creatures and absorbing that blood into its body. A pact vampire that forgets or refuses to shed blood for its patron begins to lose vitality, steadily becoming more gaunt until it withers into a mindless, skin-covered skeleton under the patron’s control.</p><p><strong>Transformed Vampires</strong>. Not all pact vampires start as living warlocks. Some vampires choose to make a pact with a foul power to diminish some of its weaknesses and to gain more control over its own blood and the blood of others. Such vampires transform into pact vampires, giving up some of their autonomy for greater power and safety from running water and sunlight. Regardless of how it initially transformed, a pact vampire can’t change its form like a standard vampire, relying on its followers and its patron’s power to ensure its safe exit from dangerous situations.</p><p><strong>Poisonous Blood</strong>. A pact vampire’s blood is tainted by its enhanced magical connection to its patron, and when introduced to living creatures, the vampire’s blood causes the creature’s blood to flow more freely. Pact vampires coat their claws in this blood to better subdue and sup from bleeding victims. Particularly brave alchemists have attempted to harvest pact vampire blood for use in treating diseases related to thick or sluggish blood, but few survive the attempt.</p><h2>A Pact Vampire’s Lair</h2><p>Needing to be near civilization for ready access to the blood its patron craves, a pact vampire dwells in a city’s catacombs, sewers, or other underground complex with easy access to the city’s streets at night. Pact vampires often lead secret cults within the city, building its patron’s followers while drinking in the blood of the victims the cult brings to it. Due to the pact vampire’s more direct link to the patron than many warlocks, the lair takes on aspects of the patron and is subtly shaped by the patron’s will, filling the lair with hellish heat, eldritch lights, sourceless screams, and similar effects pleasing to that particular patron.</p><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a pact vampire’s lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hemophilia</strong>. Creatures bleed more easily within 3 miles of the lair, causing even the slightest scratch to bleed a little longer than usual.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overcast Skies</strong>. The area within 6 miles of the lair is perpetually overcast with bits of moonlight peeking through the thick clouds on nights important to the vampire or its patron.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thinned Veil</strong>. The veil between the Material Plane within 1 mile of the lair and the vampire’s patron’s home plane is thinned. Conjuration spells that pull from the patron’s home plane are more potent and last longer, and planar travel between the Material Plane and the patron’s home plane is easier.</p></li></ul><p>If the pact vampire dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>A Pact of a Different Color</h3><p>The pact vampire represented here is based on the Fiend patron. Not all patrons, especially those of good alignment, would condone their warlocks seeking transformation into an especially bloodthirsty vampire. Those patrons who are associated with blood, destruction, or undeath, however, take special glee in aiding such a transformation, reveling in the blood shed by the warlock and sending their minions to assist in the mayhem.</p><p>If you want to bring a pact vampire into play from a different patron, consider some changes. Damage resistances, immunities, and actions like Children of the Lower Planes can be changed to reflect a different pact, such as resistance to damage from weapons not made with cold iron for a pact vampire whose patron is one of the fey lords or ladies (see page 172) or magically calling mephits and other minor elementals for a pact vampire whose patron is a genie lord.</p></article></div>",

A bane or savior to every bartender and innkeeper, alehouse drakes enjoy pushing patrons’ emotions, driving crowds to ecstatic cheers or bloody bar fights. They make their homes in cities and towns, though older drakes settle down in roadside coaching inns. In the former situations, they are often troublemakers or pranksters, but in the latter circumstances, they usually befriend the proprietor and help manage flared tempers and weepy drinkers in return for living space and a generous tab.</p><p><strong>Relentless Gossips</strong>. Alehouse drakes gossip endlessly. Perched in hiding places throughout busy taverns, they overhear many stories, and trade in information, making them good sources for news about town. More devious and ill-mannered alehouse drakes resort to blackmail, but this usually occurs only to secure a comfortable spot in their chosen tavern.</p><p><strong>Family Heirlooms</strong>. Alehouse drakes are one to two feet long and weigh about eighteen pounds with a plump belly. Their scales are deep amber with cream or white highlights, and they possess glittering, light-colored eyes. The oldest recorded alehouse drake lived just past 400 years. Because of their longevity, some drakes are beloved by innkeeping families and treated a bit like family heirlooms.</p>",

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p><p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p><p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.</p><p><em><strong>Explosive Runes.</strong></em> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [[/r 5d8]] acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong></em> You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.</p>",

Using her ability to disguise herself as a living person, she silently beckons victims from afar, acting as if in danger of drowning. When a victim is within range, the maiden uses her hair to pull her victim close enough to drain its strength with a magical kiss. Victims soon weaken and drown. The victim’s final vision is the drowned maiden’s tearful lament over the loss of life.</p><p><strong>Death to Betrayers</strong>. Desperate individuals may bargain with drowned maidens. Sometimes maidens release pleading victims who promise to return to her lair with the person who caused the maiden’s death. Embracing and drowning her betrayer releases the maiden from undeath.</p>",

Mindrot fungus is an intelligent hive-mind parasite that consumes creatures from the inside out. When inhaled, mindrot spores enter the brain through the bloodstream. As the fungus grows, it dissolves the host’s body and slowly replaces the creature’s flesh with its own. The fungus’s first target is the motor function of the brain. It takes control of the creature’s movement while the victim is still alive and conscious, leaving the victim trapped within its own body. Indeed, sensory awareness may be the last function that the fungus attacks. Eventually, even the victim’s skin and muscle are replaced with fungal fibers. At that point, the affected creature no longer looks like its former self. Such a newly born mindrot thrall conceals its alarming appearance under heavy robes or cloaks so it can travel without causing alarm.</p><p><strong>Spore Blisters</strong>. A thrall’s skin is taut and waxy. Blisters form just beneath the surface, and when they grow as large as a child’s fist they burst, releasing a spray of spores. It seeks to infect as many new victims as possible during the few weeks that it survives in humanoid form. At the end of that time, the thrall shrivels to a dried, vaguely humanoid husk. Even a dead mindrot thrall remains dangerous. Its half-formed spore blisters can remain infectious for months.</p><p><strong>Dimensional Horrors</strong>. Wizards hypothesize the fungus was brought to the mortal world’s wastelands by a shambling horror crossing through a dimensional portal. The remoteness of the wasteland is likely why the mindrot fungus hasn’t destroyed whole cities, though someday it might find a more fertile breeding ground.</p>",

Its tiny wings folded flush against its body open like a fan and expose shimmering, diaphanous membranes. Its narrow head, with bare slits for its eyes and nostrils, sits at the end of a slender neck atop an impossibly thin frame.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Rage in Youth</strong>. Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to acquire a worthy hoard, though they are less likely to kill for sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, mithral dragons are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life pursuing interesting goals.</p><p><strong>Peacemakers</strong>. Adult and older mithral dragons are diplomats and arbitrators by temperament (some dragons cynically call them referees). They enjoy bringing some peace to warring factions. Among all dragons, their strict neutrality and ability to negate magic make them well suited to these vital roles.</p><h2>A Mithral Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Mithral dragons are attracted to lairs near humanoid civilization, where petitioners can reach them if their diplomatic services are needed. Unlike other dragons, mithral dragons forsake lairing upon remote natural caverns or cliffs, preferring to dwell in impressive structures of metal and stone—with a particular fondness for towers. More than once, a mithral dragon has accepted the deed to a fortress, palace, or castle as payment for brokering peace between warring factions.</p><p>Curiously, mithral dragons don’t hoard coins and precious metals as most dragons do. Other curiosities fill their lair, like fine paintings, marble statues, rare tomes, stained glass, and anything made of mithral—rare treasures procured over a lifetime of interacting with mortal creatures.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Impaling Spikes</strong>. Metallic spikes sprout from the ground beneath one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The target must make a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes [[/damage 3d6 piercing average]] damage and is &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained} as it is impaled on the magical spikes. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t restrained. A creature, including the restrained target, can take its action to free the restrained target by succeeding on a [[/check str 15 format=long]] to break the spikes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shimmering Scales</strong>. Light within the lair bends toward the dragon, reflecting brilliantly off its scales. Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon and that can see it must succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[]blinded{blinded} until the end of its next turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wave of Peace</strong>. A pulse of calming energy washes over the lair. Each hostile creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a [[/save cha 15 format=long]] or become indifferent about creatures of the dragon’s choice that it is hostile toward for 1 minute. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the effect ends, the creature can choose to become hostile again.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary mithral dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Calming Air</strong>. Humanoids within 6 miles of the lair experience feelings of peace and are less prone to mood swings. Dragons within 6 miles of the lair experience the opposite effect, becoming plagued by anxiety and general irritability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Peaceful Realm</strong>. When a Dragon or Humanoid within 3 miles of the lair attempts to commit an act of violence against a Dragon or Humanoid and that act of violence isn’t in self-defense, that creature must succeed on a [[/save wis 13 format=long]] or be unable to commit acts of violence, other than self-defense, for 1 minute. The dragon can choose to suppress this effect for any creature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shining Mithral</strong>. Objects made from metals other than mithril appear dull and feel heavy while within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Mithral Dragons in Midgard</h3><p>Mithral dragons are rebellious dragons who once sought to make peace between chromatic and metallic dragons.

Long ago when Odin brokered the truce that brought peace among the gods, the wily deity magically created the ravenfolk from feathers plucked from his ravens Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory). He placed this new race into the world alongside elves, dwarves, humans, and others to be his eyes and ears.</p><p><strong>Odin’s Children</strong>. To this day, the ravenfolk are Odin’s agents and embody his thought and memory. They are thieves of objects, yes, but primarily, they are thieves of secrets. Their black feathers and long beaks are spotted on the road from place to place, trading information or helping to hatch plots. They are widely viewed as spies, informers, thieves, and troublemakers, but when the ravenfolk swear an oath, they abide by it. Odin grants the best of his ravenfolk magical runespears and runestaves, weapons enchanted to serve his messengers. The ravenfolk consider them special tokens meant for their use, and no one else’s.</p><p><strong>Flightless But Bold</strong>. Though they have no wings and normally cannot fly, the physiology of ravenfolk is strikingly similar to that of true avians. They stand roughly 5 feet tall and, because of their hollow bones, weigh just 95–105 pounds. Albino ravenfolk are often found in southern climates. Ravenfolk eat almost anything, but they prefer raw meat and field grains, such as corn, soy, and alfalfa. They even scavenge days-old carrion, a practice that repulses most other humanoids.</p><p><strong>Feather Speech</strong>. The ravenfolk have two languages: a verbal language full of croaks and whistles and a language of feathers. Ravenfolk can communicate volumes without speaking a word through the dyeing, arrangement, preening, and rustling of their plumage. This language is inherent to ravenfolk, and though others may use magic to understand it, it can’t be used by creatures without feathers.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Ravenfolk in Midgard</h3><p>If the ravenfolk of Midgard have a homeland, it is Beldestan to the East, on a branch of Wotan’s tree in the North, or a high cliff of Horus’ hidden temple in the South. They have settlements in Trollheim, Vidim, Domovogrod, Zobeck, Nuria Natal, and the Dragon Empire, but none are large.</p><p>They avoid the West and the Seven Cities most of the time and are highly honored in Nuria Natal, where they serve the temples of Horus as sworn guardians, assassins, and seekers of forgotten arcana.

In the chest is a rabbit, which immediately tries to flee if the chest is opened. If the rabbit is killed, a duck flies out from the chest and tries to escape (use hawk statistics, can’t attack). If the duck dies it lays a green egg, inside of which is a golden needle that contains Koschei’s soul. As long as his soul is safely hidden away, time and death slide past the undying king.</p><h2>Koschei’s Lair</h2><p>Koschei’s lair is the crumbling remains of his ancient castle. Though there are still finery and riches contained within the structure, Koschei seems oblivious to the march of time threatening to demolish his home.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Koschei takes a lair action to cause one of the effects listed in its Features; Koschei can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.</p><ul><li><p>Koschei creates a whirlwind centered on a point he can see within 100 feet. The whirlwind is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet tall. A creature in the area of the whirlwind when it’s created, or who enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a [[/save str 15 format=long]]. On a failed save, the creature is &amp;Reference[restrained apply=false]{restrained} and takes [[/damage 4d8 bludgeoning average]] damage from the buffeting wind. A restrained creature can escape from the whirlwind by using its action to repeat the saving throw; on a success, it moves 5 feet outside the area of the whirlwind. The whirlwind lasts until Koschei uses this action again or dies.</p></li><li><p>Tortured spirits appear and attack up to three creatures Koschei can see within the lair. One attack is made against each targeted creature; each attack has [[/attack +8]] to hit and does [[/damage 3d6 necrotic average]] damage.</p></li></ul><h3>Regional Effects</h3><p>The region containing Koschei’s lair is warped by Koschei’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li>Rabbits, ducks, and other game animals become hostile toward intruders within 5 miles of the lair. They behave aggressively, but only attack if cornered. Foraging for food by hunting is difficult and only yields half the normal amount of food.</li><li>Wind and snowstorms are common within 5 miles of the lair.</li><li>Koschei is aware of any spell cast within 5 miles of his lair. He knows the source of the magic (innate, the caster’s class, or a magic item) and knows the direction to the caster.</li></ul><p>If Koschei dies, conditions in the area surrounding his lair return to normal over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

Powerful dreamers attract both the attention and the protection of sandmen: children, madmen, would-be tyrants, and heroes.

To them, all dreams are vital and good, be they uplifting or terrifying. Although they bring horrific nightmares as well as idyllic dreams, sandmen are not specifically baneful. Their actions are motivated by their connection to the dream realm, not by concerns over good and evil.</p><p><strong>Ethereal Dreamscapes</strong>.

The cry becomes an avian shriek, and the giant’s form melts into that of a massive bird whose wings blot out the sky.</p></blockquote><p>A giant with divine blood in his veins, Hraesvelgr the Corpse Swallower is powerfully muscled. His skin is a pale bronze, his eyes are violet, and his hair is the color of storm clouds.</p><p><strong>Roc Form</strong>. When he takes his alternate form, Hraesvelgr becomes a tremendous roc, with massive wings that stir the wind across the sky. His eyes remain the same violet and these roc-form feathers match the color of his hair, sparkling with specks of color here and there, like jewels set in steel.</p><p><strong>Birth of the Wind</strong>. Hraesvelgr dwells on the fringe of the world itself. From atop the peak of his home, he creates the wind and sends it across the globe. As befits a creature of such primal power, Hraesvelgr doesn’t take kindly to intruders. He gluts himself on the bodies of fools who test his might in search of the fabled riches in his home.</p><h2>Hraesvelgr’s Lair</h2><p>Hraesvelgr’s lair is a windswept crag of gray stone at the edge of the world. At the highest pinnacle rests a massive cottage hewn from the mountainside. A great nest made from the splintered trunks of immense trees rests on the flat roof of the cottage, and the wind constantly howls.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Hraesvelgr takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Hraesvelgr can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pillar of Wind</strong>. One creature within 60 feet that Hraesvelgr can see must succeed on a [[/save str 19 format=long]] or be swept up in a pillar of wind. The creature is &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained} and suspended 15 feet off the ground. A creature can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 19 format=long]]. If the restrained creature has a way to pull itself out of the air, it can free itself in the same way. If the restrained creature has a flying speed, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, this effect lasts until Hraesvelgr uses this lair action again or until he dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Powerful Exhale</strong>. Hraesvelgr unleashes a blast of wind in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a [[/save dex 19 format=long]] or be knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone}.</p></li><li><p><strong>Terrifying Utterance</strong>. Hraesvelgr lets out a thunderous bellow. Each creature within 30 feet of him and that can hear him must succeed on a [[/save con 19 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[frightened]{frightened} for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing Hraesvelgr’s lair is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Active Weather</strong>. Strong windstorms are common within 6 miles of the lair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roosting Rocs</strong>. Within 3 miles of the lair, giant avian Beasts are more populous and fiercely defend the area against intruders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stench of Decay</strong>. The wind within 10 miles of the lair bears a pungent carrion stench.</p></li></ul><p>If Hraesvelgr dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

Leaves and plant matter provide much of the millitaur diet, but they also are good hunters and supplement with squirrel, monkey, gnome, and goblin. </p><p><strong>Poisonous Drool</strong>. As formidable as they appear, millitaurs are the preferred prey of some dragons and jungle giants, and tosculi (see page 365) often hunt them for use as slaves and pack animals. In defense, they’ve developed a mild poison. Millitaur handaxes often drip with this substance, smeared on from the beast’s mandibles. They use their axes for breaking up mulch for easier digestion, as well as for hunting and self-defense.</p><p><strong>Alchemists and Brewers</strong>. Millitaurs are capable alchemists and brew their own unique beverages, potions, and alchemical substances, using the various materials and substances provided by the plants and animals found in their jungle homes. When away from their burrows, millitaurs carry a handful of flasks for self defense, to ward off intruders, or to trade with respectful humanoids traveling near their territory. </p><p><strong>Clicking Speech</strong>. Millitaurs communicate via body language, antennae movements, scent, and clicking sounds. Although they have no voice boxes, millitaurs can make sounds by artfully clicking and grinding their mandibles, and they mimic the sounds of Common in a peculiar popping tone. They can be good sources for local information so long as they are treated with respect and their territory is not encroached.</p>",

In some places, they operate only on the command of the secret police, hunting down persons of interest wanted for questioning. Huntsmen may operate alone, but usually they seek their quarry in a group of two or three. Because they are unsleeping and tireless, few can hide from them long without magical assistance.</p><p><strong>Despised Machines</strong>.

Common folk detest them; all but their keepers and commanders shun them.</p><p><strong>Obedient to Orders</strong>. Bound with specific instructions, clockwork huntsmen patrol, stand sentry, or remain unmoving as ordered, always paying attention, alert to their surroundings.

    "Adult Flame Dragon": {

      "tokenName": "Adult Flame Dragon",
      "description": "<blockquote><p>The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw.</p></blockquote><p>Flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse often used by the foolish.</p><p><strong>Taunting Others</strong>. The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.</p><p><strong>Malevolent Purpose</strong>. The results of a flame dragon’s schemes are secondary to the enjoyment it derives from pursuing a nebulous and ever-changing goal. Some flame dragons spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into dire insults. The vengeance itself is secondary to an excuse for hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge. Each is a delightful hobby. Any disruption in their game kindles a terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.</p><p><strong>Fond of Souvenirs</strong>. Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.</p><p><strong>Vengeful Brethren</strong>. Nothing is safe from a flame dragon’s scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided attention for generations. Wiser still, is to remove all trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.</p><h2>A Flame Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Flame dragons dwell near ever-burning fires: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, it must serve as a showcase for all the dragon’s trophies. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the area, sometimes protected behind crystal walls. This display feeds the dragon’s vanity and pride, and it serves as a lure for adventurers. Many of these lairs also feature a huge, reflective surface, as a flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Blinding Smoke</strong>. A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners, and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[blinded]{blinded} for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li><li><p><strong>Curtain of Fire</strong>. A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and is opaque. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or take [[/damage 6d6 fire average]] damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes [[/damage 6d6 fire average]] damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Volcanic Debris</strong>. The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or be knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone} and buried under rock and debris. The buried creature is restrained and can’t breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take an action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 15 format=long]].</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary flame dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Extreme Heat</strong>. Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair, causing most water sources to dry up and all but the hardiest plants to wither.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fiery Tempers</strong>. Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.</p></li><li><p><strong>Superheated Fumaroles</strong>. Sulfur geysers dot the landscape within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair, making the area inhospitable for most plants and creatures.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, Fiery Tempers disappears immediately, and temperatures return to normal within [[/r 1d10]] days. Any geysers remain where they are.</p>",

The Prince of Swarms is the slow creep of decay; the worm and the locust that feed on life and death alike. He is the disinterested order that stamps out all voices that dare speak against the customs of the hive. Even among the unyielding denizens of the Hells, Arbeyach is exceptionally rigid. He finds disorder painful and disobedience enraging. His lairs and his minions all follow the model of the hive, with each and every member obeying a specific function.</p><p><strong>Born of Flies</strong>. Arbeyach was created by Beelzebub when the Lord of Lies and Flies spat forth a cloud of vermin, that they might consume for him the first mortal soul to arrive in the Hells. The cloud’s essence melded with those souls and became something unique: a being of terrible power that called itself Arbeyach. The self-styled Prince of Swarms has little interest in mortals, viewing the Material Plane not as a source of souls but as a chaos to be wiped clean and set to order.</p><p><strong>A Fading Power</strong>. As the eons passed, Arbeyach’s interests and ambitions deviated further from those of the Hellish lords around him. He grows ever more unyielding, ever more alien. Eventually, those below and those above him expelled the Prince of Swarms from power; none can say whether Arbeyach allowed himself to be deposed. He was once nearly as powerful as the Arch-Dukes, but time and habit have weakened him so that now he is scarcely greater than the pit fiends. If he fails to molt and shed his carapace of familiar habits, his many foes need only wait for an opportune moment to destroy him forever.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Arbeyach in Midgard</h3><p>In the Southlands, the insectoid tosculi still revere the Great Hivelord Arbeyach, and their hive-cities reflect their patron’s philosophy of clear functionality and unyielding order.

Long ago when Odin brokered the truce that brought peace among the gods, the wily deity magically created the ravenfolk from feathers plucked from his ravens Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory). He placed this new race into the world alongside elves, dwarves, humans, and others to be his eyes and ears.</p><p><strong>Odin’s Children</strong>. To this day, the ravenfolk are Odin’s agents and embody his thought and memory. They are thieves of objects, yes, but primarily, they are thieves of secrets. Their black feathers and long beaks are spotted on the road from place to place, trading information or helping to hatch plots. They are widely viewed as spies, informers, thieves, and troublemakers, but when the ravenfolk swear an oath, they abide by it. Odin grants the best of his ravenfolk magical runespears and runestaves, weapons enchanted to serve his messengers. The ravenfolk consider them special tokens meant for their use, and no one else’s.</p><p><strong>Flightless But Bold</strong>. Though they have no wings and normally cannot fly, the physiology of ravenfolk is strikingly similar to that of true avians. They stand roughly 5 feet tall and, because of their hollow bones, weigh just 95–105 pounds. Albino ravenfolk are often found in southern climates. Ravenfolk eat almost anything, but they prefer raw meat and field grains, such as corn, soy, and alfalfa. They even scavenge days-old carrion, a practice that repulses most other humanoids.</p><p><strong>Feather Speech</strong>. The ravenfolk have two languages: a verbal language full of croaks and whistles and a language of feathers. Ravenfolk can communicate volumes without speaking a word through the dyeing, arrangement, preening, and rustling of their plumage. This language is inherent to ravenfolk, and though others may use magic to understand it, it can’t be used by creatures without feathers.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Ravenfolk in Midgard</h3><p>If the ravenfolk of Midgard have a homeland, it is Beldestan to the East, on a branch of Wotan’s tree in the North, or a high cliff of Horus’ hidden temple in the South. They have settlements in Trollheim, Vidim, Domovogrod, Zobeck, Nuria Natal, and the Dragon Empire, but none are large.</p><p>They avoid the West and the Seven Cities most of the time and are highly honored in Nuria Natal, where they serve the temples of Horus as sworn guardians, assassins, and seekers of forgotten arcana. Some are said to be members of the Emerald Order, a society devoted to arcane mysteries.</p></article></div>",

Also called a “spooklight,” a witchlight is a wizard’s servant created from a tiny piece of quartz. It appears as a floating ball of flickering light similar to a will-o’-wisp. The hue of quartz used during the creature’s creation determines the color of each witchlight’s illumination. After the quartz is prepared, it is animated through an extended magical ritual cast under a full moon and a clear, starry sky. Consequently, they are extremely rare.</p><p><strong>Flashing Light Code</strong>. A witchlight always shares the same alignment as its creator. Although it cannot speak, a witchlight understands the languages of its creator, and many spellcasters have taught their witchlights a coded cipher, allowing it to spell out words by flaring and dimming its light. When necessary, a witchlight can spell words in the air by flying so quickly that its trail of light forms letters.</p><p><strong>Free Roaming</strong>. If the witchlight’s master dies within one mile of the witchlight, it explodes in a brilliant but harmless flash of light. If it loses its master under any other circumstance, it becomes masterless. While masterless, it’s free to do as it pleases. Evil masterless witchlights can be surprisingly cruel, not unlike will-o’-wisps. They seek to lure lost travelers into swamps or traps by using their glow to imitate the light of a safe haven. Conversely, good masterless witchlights guide travelers to places of safety or along safe paths, and they are prized by pilots and guides.

More than one “wizard’s staff” is just an impressive-looking stick with a witchlight perched on top.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Witchlight Familiars</h3><p>Some witchlights are willing to serve spellcasters as a familiar.

      "description": "<blockquote><p>A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon’s body.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Children of the Stars</strong>. Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world and wander between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons barely notice.</p><p><strong>Witnesses to the Void</strong>. Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures. But they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the Void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing takes a toll. Void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.</p><p><strong>Voracious Scholars</strong>. Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, Void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.</p><h2>A Void Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>The true lair of a Void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless space between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the Void dragon’s lair rests in the great Void of space.</p><p>When a Void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to its treasure hoard hidden in the Void. That connection has repercussions, of course. The most powerful Void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.</p><p>When encountered in its lair, an adult Void dragon has a challenge rating of 17 (18,000 XP), and the ancient Void dragon has a challenge rating of 25 (75,000 XP).</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Orb of the Void</strong>. The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The sphere spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a [[/save con 15 format=long]], taking [[/damage 3d6 cold average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes [[/damage 3d6 cold average]] damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spatial Anomaly</strong>. The lair’s connection to the Void briefly rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist at the same point in space and time. The laws of reality repel the creatures back to their original positions as reality resets. The targets aren’t actually moved, but reality’s reset forces each target to make a [[/save str 15 format=long]]. On a failure, the creature takes [[/damage 3d10 force average]] damage and is knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone}. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Zero Gravity</strong>. Gravity stops working in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that cylinder drifts 10 feet away from the ground and must succeed on a [[/save str 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained}. A flying creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw, but its speed is halved unless it can hover or flies magically. This effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary Void dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dark of the Void</strong>. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light within 6 miles of the lair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Torn Veil</strong>. Within 3 miles of the lair, disembodied voices whisper in the night. Celestials, Fey, and Fiends with a challenge rating of 2 or lower can choose to slip into the Material Plane from their native planes or vice versa.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uncovered Knowledge</strong>. Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

These magnificent trees are imbued with some characteristics of their draconic masters. While most groves consist of only one type of dragonleaf tree, dragons sometimes make gifts of them to cement a pact or as a show of fealty. The dragon giving the tree relinquishes command of the plant as part of the deal. This accounts for mixed groves belonging to especially powerful dragon lords.</p><p><strong>Silent Guardians</strong>. Dragonleaf trees use fairly simple tactics to deter potential intruders into their masters’ lairs. They remain motionless or allow the breeze to jostle their leaves to appear inconspicuous. Once enough intruders enter the grove, the trees fire razor sharp leaves or rain elemental energies upon the intruders, adjusting their position to make better use of their weapons.</p><p><strong>Long Memories</strong>. Dragonleaf trees live up to 1,000 years. They stand 15 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds, but ancient specimens can reach heights of 45 feet. Growing a new dragonleaf tree requires a cutting from an existing tree at least 50 years old, which the tree’s draconic master imbues with power, sacrificing the use of its breath weapon for a month.

Deep drakes are 12 feet long, plus a three-foot long tail, and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Their coloration makes them ideal predators in the subterranean dark.

They avoid sunlight and are strictly nocturnal when on the surface.</p><p><strong>Few in Number</strong>. A deep drake mates for life with another deep drake when two of these rare creatures meet. A hermaphroditic creature, the drake assumes a gender until it finds a mate, at which time it may change. Once every 10–20 years, the drakes reproduce, resulting in three or four three-foot long, rubbery eggs. Occasionally, subterranean undead or aberrations take these eggs to their cities to train the young drakes.

Devious, manipulative, and mischievous, they toy with their prey before killing it. They rarely enjoy a stand-up fight, instead coalescing in and out of the fog to harass victims and cut large groups into smaller, more manageable morsels.</p><p><strong>Dreary Marshlands</strong>. Their tactics have earned vapor lynxes a nasty reputation and the occasional bounty on their heads. Additionally, their magical nature makes them valuable to practitioners of the magical arts, and their beautiful, thick coats tempt many a furrier into hunts they may not be prepared to handle. For these reasons, vapor lynxes avoid civilization, fearing organized reprisal. Instead, they haunt marshes and swamps, where natural fog makes hunting easier. If an intelligent humanoid passes their way, they are happy for a change in diet.</p><p><strong>Chatty with Dinner</strong>. Although reclusive, vapor lynxes are intelligent, speaking both Common and Sylvan. They are particularly prideful and take joy in bantering with potential meals to belittle and frighten them. Survivors of vapor lynx encounters invariably mention their needling and self-aggrandizement.</p>",

Living wicks are obedient wax statues brought to life by an enchanted wick that runs from the nape of their neck to their lower back. When new, a living wick looks and moves like a human. However, as the wick burns, the wax features melt, and the statue takes on a twisted, hunchbacked appearance.</p><p><strong>Short-Lived as a Candle</strong>. Living wicks are powered by flames, and therefore they have a predetermined life cycle. They are typically reduced to formless lumps in a month, but some say a living wick’s affordability more than makes up for its inevitable obsolescence. Individuals looking to quickly construct a building or fortification without the expense of paid labor or the questionable ethics of necromancy find living wicks obedient and efficient, as do those needing an army for a single battle. They are active only when their wicks are lit, and they respond only to the commands of whoever lit them. This makes it easy to transfer living wicks between owners, even those not well-versed in the use of magic.</p><p><strong>Explosive Ends</strong>. The amount of magical energy contained within a living wick, paired with the manner in which it is released, gives them a remarkable capability for self-destruction. If their controller demands it, all living wicks can release the magic contained within their form all at once, engulfing themselves and anyone nearby in flames. This can make storing them a gamble, but many see it as an asset, especially those seeking to destroy evidence or anonymously attack their enemies.</p>",

      "name": "Red Sun (Baba Yaga’s Horsemen)",
      "tokenName": "Red Sun",
      "description": "<blockquote><p>These mounted knights wield great weapons as swift as dawn, as bright as the blazing sun, and as cold as the grave. The white horseman is a young rider full of promise, the red rider a man in his prime, and the black rider a scarred and bearded fellow, his eyes dark and his mouth set in a grim frown. They ride with purpose on powerful steeds.</p></blockquote><p>Baba Yaga’s three horsemen are legends in their own right. Bright Day, Red Sun, and Black Night (also known as the White, Red, and Black horsemen) are her faithful emissaries, scouts, and warriors abroad. The three horsemen change over time, but they are typically male, human warriors. Their appearance is distinctive: each horseman dresses in colors and lacquered armor and trappings to suit their name, with their magical horses colored to match. Their roles appear to coincide with their appointed offices, although their precise relationship to Baba Yaga is the source of much speculation.</p><p><strong>Varied Origin</strong>. They may be serving Grandmother Winter for a time in exchange for a favor or bargain, or they may be cursed to replace a previous horseman they slew. In either case, Baba Yaga is the source of their power. The horsemen are innately connected to the domain of time; each represents part of the day, as measured by the sun. Bright Day is bound to and governs dawn to mid-day, Red Sun from mid-day to sundown, and Black Night rules until daybreak. While Baba Yaga herself is wily and capricious, her three horsemen are bound to cosmological forces that are uniform and constant, which is reflected in their alignment and demeanor.</p><p><strong>One Rises, Two Set</strong>. The horsemen never co-exist with one another except within the confines of their mistresses’ Dancing Hut and the fenced yard around it. Each one must yield his presence on the Material Plane to his successor in rotation (this varies on other planes, depending on intervals of day and night). Forcing two horsemen to co-exist on the Material Plane places a perilous strain on reality. Bringing all three together could trigger a primal magical event or chronal catastrophe.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Baba Yaga’s Horsemen in Midgard</h3><p>The great witch Baba Yaga is a power to be reckoned with in Midgard, always plotting with her daughters, the @UUID[Compendium.kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023.tob-1-2023-creatures.Actor.degnu3X7o8BrbrKu]{vila} (see page 386), and seeking to gobble up the vile gnomes whose souls she claims are rightfully hers. Baba Yaga rules over great ley line magic and commands the elements and enchantments with ease, but she cannot be everywhere at once.</p><p>Three of her most faithful servants are the White Horseman, the Red Horseman and the Black Horseman—embodied forms of the times of day and a symbol of Baba Yaga’s mastery of time itself. She uses nicknames for them, calling them “My Bright Dawn, my Red Sun, and my Dark Midnight” because they are bound by time (and some believe, because they control dawn, noon, and sunset). She has many servants, but the horsemen, her dancing hut, and the sorcerer Koshchei the Deathless are the greatest.</p><h3>The Three Horsemen</h3><p>All three horsemen use the statistics presented here, but each has a few unique characteristics from his brethren, as defined below.</p><p>Bright Day. This horseman has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and resistance to cold damage and fire damage.</p><p>Red Sun. This horseman is immune to being blinded, charmed, and frightened and has immunity to fire damage.</p><p>Black Night. This horseman has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and magical darkness doesn’t impede his darkvision. In addition, he has immunity to cold damage.</p><h3>Encounters with Baba Yaga’s Horsemen</h3><p>The horsemen make good foes for the long term; their power is great enough that they can ignore considerable danger when serving their mistress. Here are some possible encounters involving them:</p><p>Red Sun burns down a village while the PCs are sleeping at the inn. If questioned or challenged, he says nothing, but provides a scroll from Baba Yaga ordering the village’s destruction. Red Sun rides off into the dawn.</p><p>Black Night bears a similar scroll, asking an elvish character to provide Baba Yaga with a pint of blood; if the request is granted, Black Night leaves without incident, but if he is denied, a young human boy is found outside the party’s sleeping chambers, drained of all blood.</p><p>At noon, Bright Day leads a parade of strange creatures, everything from shadow fey duelists and enchantresses to a glowing will-o’-wisp and a bright malakbel demon (see page 85), burning so bright it sets fire to crops and thatched huts near it. The fey mention Bright Day is going to pay Baba Yaga’s respects to the River King. If the party chooses to join the procession, they can’t leave it until sunset—and may find their company is not entirely welcome.</p></article></div>",

Its presence seeps into the world of mortals via the trails of worms and maggots through rotting flesh. The demon lord views all things that live, or once lived, as its property in the making. Everything becomes its food eventually.</p><p><strong>Fiendish Worm</strong>. An impossibly massive, pale-fleshed worm, Qorgeth’s segmented body is road-mapped with pale veins of pink and blue. When it opens its massive maw, it reveals a writhing mass of smaller worms, many of which are adorned with wailing or enraged humanoid heads.</p><h2>Qorgeth’s Lair</h2><p>Qorgeth’s lair is a tangled labyrinth of tunnels in the heart of its dark realm. The tunnels seem to twist and burrow through space itself rather than just the rock and soil surrounding them.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Qorgeth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Qorgeth can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Collapse Passage</strong>. A section of ceiling in the lair collapses, raining debris onto a point Qorgeth can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a [[/save dex 21 format=long]] or take [[/damage 4d8 bludgeoning average]] damage and be restrained by the debris. A creature, including the restrained creature, can use an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 21 format=long]].</p></li><li><p><strong>Warp Reality</strong>. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, Qorgeth twists space through the tunnels of its lair. A creature that isn’t a demon that tries to move must succeed on a [[/save cha 21 format=long]] or move half its speed in a random direction before getting its bearings; it can then finish moving as it wants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Worm Infestation</strong>. Thick tangles of demonic worms erupt from the floor, wall, or ceiling near up to three creatures Qorgeth can see within 60 feet of it. Qorgeth commands the tangles to make one melee attack roll ([[/attack +11]]) against each target before disappearing. On a hit, the target takes [[/damage 4d6 piercing average]] damage.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing Qorgeth’s lair is warped by the demon lord’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rapid Rot</strong>. Dead bodies within 1 mile of the lair decay quickly. Any corpse is reduced to bones in 24 hours. Magic that prevents decay staves off this decomposition normally. Anointing the body with holy water prevents decomposition for 1 day but no longer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spoiled Supplies</strong>. Within 1 mile of the lair, food rots and spontaneously erupts with maggots. One day’s worth of food carried by creatures spoils every 24 hours the creature remains in the area. Creatures can’t forage for food in this area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wormhome</strong>. Tunnels within 5 miles of the lair attract all manner of worms and vermin, including purple worms. These creatures are ravenous and violent.</p></li></ul><p>If Qorgeth dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>",

Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter.</p><p><strong>Braggarts and Bullies</strong>. Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants of mortal creatures. The sometimes-foolhardy creatures take offense at any perceived challenge and pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance—they perceive mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for their loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of that life in the first place.</p><p><strong>Lords of the Far Horizons</strong>. Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust and roam far from their thrones. They return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.</p><p><strong>Perpetual Infighting</strong>. These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus, their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.</p><p><strong>Portable Hoards</strong>. Wind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a small number of notable trophies or unique historic items—often quite portable.</p>",

Like a piece of moving coral, this drake’s coloration and scale patterns change to match nearby anemones, corals, seaweed, and sea urchins. This adaptation allows the creature considerable stealth in its natural habitat. It avoids combat if it can, preferring to hide and protect its young. Long serrated spines stretch from the coral drake’s body, waving in brilliant colors against a blue sea. </p><p><strong>All Spikes and Needles</strong>. An array of spikes and slender protrusions form a jagged crown above the creature’s narrow face, while a long snout stretches out in front. Inside its mouth, serrated teeth form multiple ringed ridges where its young feed on leftover scraps of food and small parasites. Needle-thin talons spring from finned appendages, and a stinger frilled with tiny barbs curves at the end of its slender tail. </p><p>A coral drake measures seven feet from the tip of its snout to its barbed, stinging tail. Thin and agile, the beast weighs less than 100 pounds. Both male and female coral drakes gestate their delicate eggs inside sacks within their mouths and throats. This oral incubation protects the vulnerable eggs, but only a handful ever reach maturity, as the parents use their ravenous spawn for defense.</p><p><strong>Poisonous Lairs</strong>. Coral drakes live in warm waters near great coral reefs. They hollow out small lairs and protect their meager hoards with the aid of the area’s natural inhabitants. Because they are immune to poison, coral drakes often choose lairs nestled in forests of poisonous sea urchins, stinging anemones, and toxic corals. Aside from humankind, the coral drake harbors a great rivalry with dragon turtles. These beasts prize the same hunting grounds and nests and fight for supremacy in the richest reefs.</p>",

Their eyes can spot prey miles away, and the distance they climb into the sky hides their enormous size. The pale gypsosphinx shines in the desert sun and stands out in underground tombs and caverns, yet it can conceal itself when it flies in moonlit clouds. Gypsosphinxes are found anywhere bodies are buried or left to rot, and they harvest corpses from battlefields of warring desert tribes.</p><p><strong>Gossips and Riddlers</strong>. Gypsosphinxes converse with intelligent undead, priests of death gods, and with other sphinxes, but they rarely gather among their own kind. They guard their territory jealously, typically claiming a necropolis as the heart of their region. Like all sphinxes, gypsosphinxes enjoy riddles. They rely on magic to solve challenging riddles they can’t solve on their own.</p><p><strong>Night Flyers</strong>. Gypsosphinxes are gifted fliers capable of diving steeply from the night sky to snatch carrion or a sleeping camel. The stroke of midnight has a special but unknown significance for them.</p><p><strong>Foretell Doom</strong>. Occasionally, a paranoid noble seeks out a gypsosphinx and entreats the creature to reveal the time and place of his or her death, hoping to cheat fate. A gypsosphinx demands a high price for such a service, including payment in corpses of humans, unusual creatures, or near-extinct species. Even if paid, the gypsosphinx rarely honors its side of the bargain; instead, it turns its death magic against the supplicant, bringing about his or her death then and there.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h2>Gypsophinx Temples and Riddles</h2><p>Accompanied by flocks of vultures and often served by packs of gnolls, ogres, and hyenas, gypsosphinxes living in deserts, plains, hills, and even mountainous terrain often acquire a large number of followers and would-be helpers. This eventually leads a gypsosphinx to anger, as it requires some solitude and peace, and (depending on its mood) it either abandons its entourage or turns them into a hearty meal. In either case, survivors sometimes tell the tale of the creature’s wrath, discouraging others from following a gypsosphinx in search of wisdom.</p><p>Gypsosphinx temples are another matter; there the sphinx is served by an order of priests who understand its hunger, entertain it with discussions of philosophy, butchery, and gossip, and know when to withdraw and leave their patron to silent contemplation. Such temples are often quite rich, as the gypsosphinx at its heart demands its priests live well, the better to reflect its own importance and status.</p><h3>11 Riddles</h3><p>The best riddles are ones you create yourself. However, here are a few easy and a few more difficult ones for a gypsosphinx.</p><ul><li><p>It is light as a feather yet no one can hold it for long. What is it?

Broodikens are crude servants created by humanoid spellcasters willing to grow the creatures within their own bodies. Broodikens resemble their creators in the most obvious ways, with the same number of limbs and basic features, but all broodikens stand one foot tall with overly large heads and heavily fanged mouths. Those born to humanoids with wings or horns have ineffective, decorative versions that do not help the creature fly or fight.</p><p><strong>Emotional Echoes</strong>. Broodikens have little personality of their own and respond to their creators’ emotions, growling when their creators feel anger and babbling happily when their creators feel joy. When their creators are more than 100 feet away, they cry loudly with a sound that resembles children of the creator’s own species. If discovered crying by anyone other than their creator, they attack. When their creators focus their anger on specific individuals, the broodikens attack as a group, using stealth to get close and overwhelm single opponents.</p><p><strong>Born With Daggers</strong>. Broodikens are created by eating the heart of a dead broodiken. Once this “seed” is consumed, 2d4 broodikens grow inside of the “mother” or creator. Nurturing the growing brood requires consuming specific muds, ashes, and plants, which cost 50 gp per day for each incubating broodiken. The incubation period requires one month and takes a toll on the creator’s health. During this time, the creator becomes fatigued after four hours without eight hours’ rest. If the creator is not a spellcaster, a spellcaster must supervise the incubation and birth. Most spellcasters birth the broodiken using a dagger before the broodiken tears its way out. A “mother” can control only one brood of broodiken at a time. Incubating a second brood makes the first brood furiously jealous, and they turn on their own creator.</p>",

      "description": "<h1 class=\"noborder\">Fey Lords and Ladies</h1><p>Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.</p><p><strong>Heads of State</strong>. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble’s domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler’s word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that’s no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.</p><p><strong>Vacant Thrones</strong>. When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court’s vacant throne.</p><h1 class=\"noborder\">River King (Fey Lord)</h1><blockquote><p>This powerfully muscled elf lord wears a cloak of foam-trimmed dark blue and a vest of woven green reeds and willow branches. His crown shines like the sun on a lake, and his flowing hair curls and moves even when there is no wind. An orb of blue light that ripples like water circles his hand.</p></blockquote><p>His Rippling Majesty, Ulorian the River King, also bears the titles Defender of the Pearl Tower and Master of the Deep Forest. A lean elf noble with whipcord muscles and flowing grace, the River King rules over the Rippling Court and ultimately all the river elves of the forest. His court resides just beyond the river’s reflection, in a realm of fey glamour and silty water.</p><p><strong>A Fickle Friend</strong>. The River King is a stern ruler with a great love for his people and a quick temper for those who threaten his domain. As much a force of nature as he is a monarch, the River King is known to sometimes forget promises that were made in sincerity, and dealing with him can be perilous at the best of times. “The river may change its course when it wills” is the usual expression among his court when His Rippling Majesty has had a sudden change of heart.</p><h2>The River King’s Lair</h2><p>The Court of the River King is a pair of small islands in the middle of a wide, swift river that flows from the mortal realm through a dimension of fey magic. The western keep houses servants, and the eastern is built above the Great Rippling Hall. The Great Rippling Hall is a bubble whose walls and ceiling are the river itself. A driftwood throne dominates the main hall.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the River King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the River King can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Flash Flooding</strong>. The fey river swells and rushes over the land, or the walls of the Hall buckle and allow the torrent in. A 60-foot line of water that is 10 feet wide rushes from a point on a wall the River King can see within 60 feet of him. Each creature in the line must succeed on a [[/save str 18 format=long]] or be pushed up to 20 feet away from the point on the wall, in the direction of the water’s flow, and take [[/damage 2d8 bludgeoning average]] damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invoke Drowning</strong>. River water fills the mouth and throat of one creature the River King can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a [[/save con 18 format=long]] or begin suffocating. A suffocating but conscious target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any creature can take an action to force the water from the target’s lungs by succeeding on a [[/check med 15 format=long]], ending the effect. Otherwise, the effect lasts until the River King uses this lair action again or until the River King dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Imperial Impression</strong>. The River King’s commanding and elegant presence in his magnificent lair overwhelms one creature he can see within 120 feet. The target must succeed on a [[/save cha 18 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[charmed]{charmed} by the River King until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing the River King’s lair is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rushing Rapids</strong>. The currents of rivers and streams within 3 miles of the lair become strong and erratic. Each creature swimming in these rivers and streams has disadvantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to swim, unless it has a swimming speed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stormy Weather</strong>. Rain and thunderstorms are common within 6 miles of the lair, and they often build to torrential downpours that obscure vision and cause waterways to overflow their banks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Well-Stocked Waterways</strong>. Lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams within 10 miles of the lair teem with fish and other wildlife.</p></li></ul><p>If the River King dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p><p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.</p><p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.</p><p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>",

Ash drakes clog chimney flues and delight in dusting crowds with thick, choking ash and soot, while the drakes laugh with sneering, wheezing tones. To placate the creatures, owners of smelters and smithies leave large piles of ash for the drakes to play in, with the hope they leave the shop and workers alone. Anyone hunting ash drakes finds them difficult to attack in their cramped lairs because the creatures blend in with the surroundings. Ash drakes often befriend kobolds, who have little trouble appeasing the drakes and appreciate the added security they bring.</p><p><strong>Hunt Strays and Pets</strong>. Ash drakes eat rats and stray animals, although few can resist snatching an unattended pet. Contrary to popular opinion, this drake doesn’t consume ash, but enjoys a pile of ash like a cat would catnip, rolling around in it and becoming wild-eyed. Anyone who disrupts such play becomes the target of the creature’s intensely hot, sooty breath weapon.</p><p><strong>Slender Dragons</strong>. While an ash drake is three feet long with a four-foot-long tail that seems to trail off into smoke, it weighs less than one might expect—approximately ten pounds. Every third winter, when chimneys are active, a male drake leaves his lair to find a mate. The resulting eggs are left in a suitable chimney, and one of the parents protects the young until they leave the nest at two years of age.</p><p><strong>Volcanic Haunts</strong>. Ash drakes outside a city live in or near volcanic plateaus and mutter about the lack of neighbors to bully. In the wild, an ash drake may partner with a red dragon or flame dragon (see page 116), since the dragon provides its lesser cousin with plenty of ash.</p>",

Even seasoned soldiers are wise enough to fear the claws of a lake troll; a person with no weapon facing the creature is doomed. Lake trolls delight in splintering wood and twisting metal with their talons and in shrugging off the deadliest of blows with their tough hide. They often prioritize wielders of grand weapons because they delight in the horror brought on by dulling their prey’s weapons with a few strokes of their powerful claws. Lake trolls are cunning ambushers. They make use of the water to cover their attack and to protect themselves from the flames of would-be troll hunters.</p><p><strong>Hard to Kill</strong>. A lake troll’s regeneration is shut down only by cold and fire damage at nearly the same time, making them tricky to fight and exceedingly difficult to kill.

The spinosaurus is a special saurian bred for size and loyalty by lizardfolk. Lizardfolk prize them like prime warhorses, and lavish them with food and care. As spinosauruses age slowly, most large lizardfolk tribes have several young spinosauruses and one adult spinosaurus in their care, reserving the massive adult for major engagements or when the entire tribe must move at once.</p><p><strong>Enormous Size and Color</strong>. This immense saurian has a long, tooth-filled maw, powerful claws, and colorful spines running the length of its back. An adult spinosaurus is 70 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds or more, while a young spinosaurus is a mere 20 feet long, weighing 6,000 pounds or more.</p><p><strong>Swift Predator</strong>. A spinosaurus is at home on both land and water, chasing prey from one to the other when necessary. Though they are carnivores, they have an affinity for lizardfolk and other reptilian humanoids, eating such creatures only if the creatures horribly mistreat them or if they experience extreme starvation with such creatures as the only option for food.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Spinosauruses in the Southlands</h3><p>The lizardfolk of Veles-Sa in the Southlands use spinosauruses as a mode of transportation. The creatures are large enough to pull barges or to carry a crew of raiders anywhere on the rivers, and they are swift overland. Lizardfolk scouts are especially fond of these enormous reptiles, as they are powerful combatants and can carry a dozen lizardfolk warriors.</p><p>In addition to their role as trained raiders in Veles-Sa, some spinosauruses live in or along most of the major river systems of the Southlands—including the River Nuria. There they are also called “river dragons” or sometimes “river walkers,” and they are frequently associated with the worship of Baal-Hotep and Set. They are kept as sacred animals in several river temples, where they are fed regular meals and have been known to grow to enormous size and strength.</p><p>Finally, along the Spice Coast, spinosauruses carry high-value spice cargoes along the coast when banditry is rife or when a lizardfolk mercenary company is available to guard materials going north toward Mhalmet, Nuria, or Ishadia. These Spice Coast beasts are often especially bred for gaudy coloration: green-and-orange, blue-and-gold, and even red-and-black bloodlines have been spotted in the Spice Coast harbors.</p><h3>Spinosauruses as Mounts</h3><p>Spinosauruses mate each year in the winter. A male spinosaurus brings food and helps build an enormous nest of reeds, sticks, and mud. Then the male departs, leaving the female to lay and care for the eggs. Spinosaurus eggs are typically found in nests along riversides or deep in marshes. They are sometimes stolen and sold, generally to lizardfolk and sometimes to daring humans with a knack for training animals. These eggs are worth as much as 2,000 gp apiece; live young are worth twice that. Characters eager for spinosaurus mounts, however, should note that buying or domesticating such an enormous carnivore requires vast quantities of food and patience. They do not take easily to domestication.</p><p>Before it can be ridden in combat, a spinosaurus must practice bearing the weight of its trainer and passengers. They rarely master more than a handful of tricks, but they are extremely comfortable in the water and can be trained to be are aware that some of their riders may not breathe water.</p><p>An adult spinosaurus can carry up to six tons as cargo. Riding a spinosaurus requires an exotic saddle, riding platform, or howdah.</p></article></div>",

Others say that the water itself must be tainted with murder or some great evil spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>Near Water</strong>. Rusalkas dwell in the water where they died, emerging only at night. Some climb a nearby tree, dangle their feet in the water, and sing alluring songs. Others sit on the bank, combing their wet tresses and awaiting prey. They must, however, remain in or near the water where they died, as part of their curse. However, during a full moon, the rusalki can leave the water to dance along the shore or the riverbank, singing all night long and inviting young men to join them.</p>\n<p><strong>Songs and Poetry</strong>. Rusalkas mesmerize and seduce passersby with song and dance and poetry. Young men are their usual victims, but they also prey on curious children, lonely older men, and other heartbroken women. When a potential victim comes near enough, the rusalki entangles the person with her hair and drags him or her beneath the water to drown.</p>\n<p><strong>Lover’s Walks</strong>. A rusalka cannot pass for human on any but the darkest night, but she might claim to be a lonely tree spirit or a benevolent nymph willing to grant a wish in exchange for a kiss. She may part the water of a lake and coax her victim toward the center with the promise of a kiss—delivered as her hair entraps the victim and the water rushes around him. Alternatively, she may use water walk so she and the victim can stroll across the surface of the water, reward him with a long kiss (to prevent him from catching a deep breath), then end the spell over deep water and drag him to the bottom.</p>\n<p><strong>Undead Nature</strong>.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p><p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.</p><p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.</p><p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>",

While the fire of a red dragon’s breath is the most common source of ashwalkers, they can be created from any dragon’s breath. The magical infusion of the dragon’s breath that kills the individual leaves residual energy of a similar type in the remains. For example, an ashwalker killed by poison breath often exudes some of the noxious clouds as it walks the wastelands of its destroyed home. </p><p><strong>Unlived Dreams</strong>. Ashwalkers have no purpose in undeath and rarely serve a master. Sometimes they carry on a sad mimicry of their former life, acting out the final hours before their demise, not fully aware of what happened. Some ashwalkers even return to the site of their homes and lay down in the dirt to sleep, although sleep never comes. Adventurers who seek the riches of lost civilizations leveled by dragon fire have reported seeing smoldering corpses milling about marketplaces or theatre spaces until a living soul snaps them from their reverie, often driving them into maddened rages.</p>",

Much like an enormous hermit crab, bone crabs inhabit the remains of large fish, humanoids, and other creatures. A bone crab’s spiny, ivory-white legs blend in perfectly with bones and pale driftwood. When lacking bones, these crabs gnaw cavities into chunks of driftwood or coral to make a shelter, cementing bits of shell and debris to their portable homes. They drag aquatic prey above the high tide line and leave it to fester in the hot sun. The crabs can pick corpses clean in a few hours, and their hunting grounds are littered with cracked and sun-bleached bones—the perfect hiding place for these littoral predators.</p><p><strong>Scavengers of Memory</strong>. Bone crabs are voracious scavengers. They live in seaside crags and coves, where they use their specialized chelae to crack open skulls and feast on the brains. Some crabs retain fragments of memory from those they devour, and these crabs recognize friends or attack the foes of those whose skulls they wear. </p><p><strong>Pack Hunters</strong>. Bone crabs hunt in packs, preying on seabirds and creatures stranded in tidal pools. Centuries of feeding on brains has left the crabs with a rudimentary intelligence and a psychic connection with fellow packmates. They use this to alert each other to danger, potential prey, or a threat to their territory. Although bone crabs cannot be domesticated, they can be convinced to nest in particular areas, attacking intruders while ignoring the area’s regulars.</p><p><strong>White Ghost Shivers</strong>. Because they eat carrion, bone crabs carry a dangerous disease known as white ghost shivers. This disease wracks victims with fever and delirium.

      "description": "<blockquote><p>Covered in black spikes, the dragon’s eyeless head swings from side to side. Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.</p></blockquote><p>Apex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.</p><p><strong>Born to Darkness</strong>. Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages, which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight. Cave dragon hide is more like eel skin than reptilian scales, and it grows mottled with brown and black as it ages.</p><p><strong>Ravenous Marauders</strong>. Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. Alliances they make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically fail. Cave dragons do form alliances with peoples of the underworld, joining them in battle against enemies, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.</p><p><strong>A Hard Life</strong>. Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest tend to die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. Their nigh-endless hunger leaves the ancients the most likely of cave dragons to form alliances, especially with allies that promise—and deliver—food. On occasion, cave dragons climb to the surface to feed, but their earthbound, plodding pace leaves them outcompeted by other predators or unable to keep up with swift or flying prey. They prefer tight tunnels where they can ambush and outmaneuver prey.</p><p><strong>Edible Hoards and Vertical Lairs</strong>. Due to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon’s hoard may consist largely of food sources: bat colonies, enormous beetles, carcasses in states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn’t immediately devour. Cave dragons are fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, arranged like artful ossuaries. Large vertical chimneys serve as nesting sites for eggs and are popular resting places when a cave dragon sleeps within its lair. Chimneys just wide enough to hold young cave dragons make preferred ambush sites, as the dragons’ tough spikes help hold them in position until prey passes beneath. The oldest cave dragons also retreat to vertical chimneys near nesting sites or within their lairs to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.</p><h2>A Cave Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Labyrinthine systems of tunnels, caverns, and chasms make up the world of cave dragons. They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cave-In</strong>. The ceiling collapses above one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must make a [[/save dex 15 format=long]]. On a failure, a creature takes [[/damage 3d6 bludgeoning average]] damage and is knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone} and buried. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone or buried. A buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take an action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 15 format=long]].</p></li><li><p><strong>Release the Vermin</strong>. A 20-foot radius sphere of insects appears centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. When a creature enters the cloud of insects for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a [[/save con 15 format=long]], taking [[/damage 2d10 piercing average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cloud of insects lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Split the Earth</strong>. A crack appears in the ground within 120 feet of the dragon that is 10 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 20 feet deep. Each creature standing on a spot where the crack opens must succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or fall in, taking falling damage. A creature that successfully saves moves with the crack’s edge as it opens. The crack remains open for 1 minute, until the dragon uses this lair action again, or until the dragon dies</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary cave dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Flight of the Beetles</strong>. Swarms of vermin within 1 mile of the lair increase in both size and number as their populations try to survive the dragon’s undiscriminating hunger.</p></li><li><p><strong>Toxic Air</strong>. Once each hour, poisonous and odorless gases fill random passages and caverns for 1 minute, and just as quickly disperse, within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Water Underground</strong>. Each time the dragon’s temper flares, but no more often than once every 30 days, flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within 6 miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

Forest folk rarely speak when sutureflies dart through the trees, because these creatures listen for lies and sew any offender’s mouth, nose, and eyes shut. Some say the old woods hide nothing but liars, and that is why the deepest forest is shrouded in silence. Others say that the forest uses sutureflies to smother those who break its covenants or reveal its secrets. Adventurers see a suturefly’s handiwork more often than they glimpse one of the creatures directly: corpses with mouths and noses stitched shut lie in the underbrush, mysterious people whose mouths are ringed with black puncture marks observe intruders from afar, and dryads step from trees, their eyes sewn shut against the evils of civilization.</p><p><strong>Seek Out Curses</strong>. Numerous suturefly varieties exist. Some attack based on verbal triggers other than lies. Black-banded sutureflies, for instance, detect curses and religious blasphemies. When attacking, sutureflies dart from hiding to surprise opponents. Once they sew someone’s mouth closed, they target the same victim’s nose, unless threatened by another opponent. Sutureflies attack until they have sewn all of their opponents’ mouths, eyes and noses closed or until they’re destroyed.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Sutureflies in Midgard</h3><p>In the Mistwallows of the deep Margreve, a green and gold variety of suturefly attacks briar folk, hags, and any others who allow magic to escape their lips.

Despite being fey, they are distantly related to true trolls.

They are most active during nighttime and on heavily overcast days, because of their mortal dread of sunlight. A shellycoat’s favored tactic is to lie in wait under the water, ice, or bridge and surprise its prey. It strikes outward or upward from its hiding place to snatch passersby, livestock, and lone travelers or fishermen. Prey is dragged down to the shadows and water to be robbed and devoured. </p><p><strong>Shining Garments</strong>.

Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.</p></blockquote><p>Apex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.</p><p><strong>Born to Darkness</strong>. Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages, which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight. Cave dragon hide is more like eel skin than reptilian scales, and it grows mottled with brown and black as it ages.</p><p><strong>Ravenous Marauders</strong>. Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. Alliances they make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically fail. Cave dragons do form alliances with peoples of the underworld, joining them in battle against enemies, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.</p><p><strong>A Hard Life</strong>. Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest tend to die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. Their nigh-endless hunger leaves the ancients the most likely of cave dragons to form alliances, especially with allies that promise—and deliver—food. On occasion, cave dragons climb to the surface to feed, but their earthbound, plodding pace leaves them outcompeted by other predators or unable to keep up with swift or flying prey. They prefer tight tunnels where they can ambush and outmaneuver prey.</p><p><strong>Edible Hoards and Vertical Lairs</strong>. Due to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon’s hoard may consist largely of food sources: bat colonies, enormous beetles, carcasses in states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn’t immediately devour. Cave dragons are fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, arranged like artful ossuaries. Large vertical chimneys serve as nesting sites for eggs and are popular resting places when a cave dragon sleeps within its lair. Chimneys just wide enough to hold young cave dragons make preferred ambush sites, as the dragons’ tough spikes help hold them in position until prey passes beneath. The oldest cave dragons also retreat to vertical chimneys near nesting sites or within their lairs to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.</p>",

      "description": "<h1 class=\"noborder\">Fey Lords and Ladies</h1><p>Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.</p><p><strong>Heads of State</strong>. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble’s domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler’s word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that’s no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.</p><p><strong>Vacant Thrones</strong>. When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court’s vacant throne.</p><h1 class=\"noborder\">Lord of the Hunt (Fey Lord)</h1><blockquote><p>Astride a midnight horse sits a shirtless elven huntsman. His broad chest is thickly muscled and sports tattooed knot work. Great stag antlers crest the huntsman’s head, curving above his rich brown hair. The pale green glow that shines from his eyes obscures the elf’s strong features, and a massive spear twined with glowing green vines drives forward in his clenched fist.</p></blockquote><p>The baying of shadow hounds, the thundering of hoof beats, and a brassy horn note; the Wild Hunt is coming, and pity its quarry. The Lord of the Hunt is an enigma among the fey nobles. His true identity beyond title and position as master of the Wild Hunt is unknown, but he has some connection to the Black Prince of the shadow fey—while also answering to elvish druids and consorting with powerful hags and dryads.</p><p><strong>The Wild Hunt</strong>. The Lord’s court is the Wild Hunt itself, a group of huntsmen, revelers, intelligent hounds, and poor souls they sweep up in their frenzy. His home, if he has any permanent dwelling, is as mysterious as his true identity. He and his Hunt constantly move between the Plane of Shadow and the most ancient forests.</p><h2>The Lord of the Hunt’s Lair</h2><p>If the Lord of the Hunt has any permanent lair, it is unknown to all but his closest confidants. While the Wild Hunt is a thing of beautiful and deadly grace on the move, the Lord’s encampment becomes his lair when the Hunt settles for any length of time. Tents and pavilions house the Lord and his Hunt, and great, roaring fires roast the day’s kills. The hours pass with revelry, feasting, physical contests, and strong drink.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Lord of the Hunt takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Lord of the Hunt can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cry Havoc</strong>. The Wild Hunt echoes with an otherworldly war cry. One creature the Lord of the Hunt can see within 120 feet of him must succeed on a [[/save wis 19 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[frightened]{frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encourage Undergrowth</strong>. Plants erupt from a point on the ground the Lord of the Hunt can see within 120 feet of him. The area within 20 feet of that point is difficult terrain. A creature that enters the difficult terrain for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a [[/save dex 19 format=long]] or take [[/damage 2d8 poison average]] damage and be &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained} by vines. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 19 format=long]]. The plants remain until the Lord of the Hunt uses this lair action again or until he dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mark Prey</strong>. One creature the Lord of the Hunt can see within 120 feet of him must succeed on a [[/save wis 19 format=long]] or be magically marked until initiative count 20 on the next round. The Lord has advantage on attack rolls against the marked target. </p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing the Lord of the Hunt’s encampment is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Game Preserve</strong>. Game animals become plentiful within 3 miles of the lair. Wisdom (Survival) checks to hunt for food are made with advantage, but patrols from the Wild Hunt don’t take kindly to poachers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hunting Grounds</strong>. Areas of natural terrain within 3 miles of the lair subtly rearrange themselves to create game trails through even the densest wilderness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spooked Animals</strong>. Domesticated animals within 3 miles of the lair become skittish and fearful. They are more difficult to handle and flee the area if left to their own devices.</p></li></ul><p>When the Lord of the Hunt breaks camp or dies, these effects end immediately.</p>",

When a bagiennik is alone, it spends its time bathing in local springs, rivers, and marshes. The creature sifts through the muck and silt, extracting substances that enhance its oily secretions. If anything disturbs the creature during its languorous bathing sessions, it angrily retaliates. Once a bagiennik has bathed for four hours, it seeks a target for mischief or charity. </p><p><strong>Unpredictable Moods</strong>. One never knows what to expect with a bagiennik. The same creature might aid an injured traveler one day, smear that person with corrosive, acidic oil the next day, and then extend tender care to the burned victim of its own psychotic behavior. If the creature feels beneficent, it heals injured animals or even diseased or injured villagers. If a bagiennik visits a settlement, the ill and infirm approach it cautiously while everyone else hides to avoid provoking its wrath. When a bagiennik leaves its bath in an angry mood, it raves and seeks out animals or humanoids to coat with its acidic oil. If a victim falls, the foul-tempered bagiennik often applies healing oil to stabilize them, grumbling all the while.</p><p><strong>Acid Oils</strong>. Collecting a dead bagiennik’s black oils must be done within an hour of the creature’s death. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check yields one vial of acid, or two vials if the result was 20 or higher. A bagiennik can use these chemicals either to heal or to harm, but no alchemist or healer has figured out how to reproduce the healing effects. Other than their acidic effect, the secretions lose all potency within moments of being removed from a bagiennik.</p>",

Although it requires great effort to call up these homely birds, the magic is surprisingly common, known among peasants and townsfolk as well as mages. Once summoned, they remain faithful to their masters until death. While cikavaks don’t speak, they comprehend the Common tongue and can speak with animals to help their master. They often magically silence the cries of more melodious birds.</p><p><strong>Potion Pouches</strong>. Cikavaks possess another odd ability: when fully distended, their ventral pouches hold up to half a gallon of almost any liquid. These resilient pouches take little or no damage from their contents, holding potions without ingesting them or even carrying acid without injury. Thieves make use of this ability, directing the birds to siphon up liquids, stealing honey from neighbors’ beehives, as well as milk, beer, and wine. The most audacious thieves send their birds into magicians’ towers, alchemists’ shops, or the local apothecary to seize mercury, phlogiston, and more exotic substances. The cikavaks carry these stolen fluids back to their owners in their pouches. While normally strong flyers, when laden with liquids, their flight is clumsy at best.</p><p><strong>Folk Conjuration</strong>. To call a cikavak with folk magic rituals, a character must gather an egg from a black hen as well as 30 gp worth of herbs and colored chalks. Cast at sunset, the folk ritual requires half an hour and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The material components can be used multiple times, until the ritual succeeds. The hen’s egg must then be carried and kept warm for 40 days. During this time, the ritual’s caster must not bathe or be subject to any spell effects. The ritual’s feeble magic is immediately dispelled if the ritual’s caster uses any other sort of magic item or casts a spell while incubating the egg.</p>",

Kikimoras are devious house spirits who torment those in their domain. They delight in harassing homeowners with their illusions, making a house look much filthier than it actually is.

They then convince the house’s residents to leave gifts as enticement for making repairs in the night.</p><p><strong>Brownie Hunters</strong>. Kikimoras hate brownies (see <em>Tome of Beasts 3</em>).

The asanbosam diet includes iron in red meat, poultry, fish, and leaf vegetables, and—in times of desperation—grinding iron filings off their own hooks to slake their cravings.

Ancient and powerful beings across the multiverse grant magical knowledge to mortals through dangerous pacts. Those bound to these pacts become warlocks, but the will and force of their patron is borne by more than just those who strike bargains for sorcerous power. A fext is a former warlock who has become wholly dedicated to their patron—mind, body, and soul—and functions as enforcer, bodyguard, and assassin. They are powerful undead slaves to the will of their otherworldly patron.</p><p><strong>Linked to a Master</strong>. Each fext is a unique servant of their patron and exhibits the physical traits of its master. The eyes of every fext are tied directly to their patron’s mind, who can see what the fext sees at any time. The fext also possesses a telepathic link to its patron. The process a warlock undergoes to become a fext is horrendous. The warlock is emptied of whatever morality and humanity he or she had as wine from a jug, and the patron imbues the empty vessel with its corruption and unearthly will. Whatever life the fext led before is completely gone. They exist only to serve.</p><p><strong>Outdoing Rivals</strong>. Scholars have debated about how many fext a patron can command. The more powerful and well-established have at least 100, while others have only a handful. Where there is more than one fext, however, they maneuver amongst themselves to curry favor with their powerful patron. Each fext is bound to obey commands, but they attempt to carry out the commands to the detriment of their competitors. Scheming is common and rampant among them, and each fext tries to work without the aid of other fext as much as possible.</p>",

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it.

Given their size and power, they might be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea. Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.</p><p><strong>Shipwreck Art</strong>. Sea dragons love collecting treasure. They especially prize the sunken, treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate  all wealth, they prefer hardy items that stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.</p><p><strong>Sunken Memorials</strong>. A sea dragon’s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Priests of Seggotan</h3><p>Every sea dragon is devoted to the dragon god of the sea.

      "description": "<h1 class=\"noborder\">Fey Lords and Ladies</h1><p>Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.</p><p><strong>Heads of State</strong>. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble’s domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler’s word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that’s no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.</p><p><strong>Vacant Thrones</strong>. When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court’s vacant throne.</p><h1 class=\"noborder\">Queen of Night and Magic</h1><blockquote><p>A fey lady of stunning beauty with hair the color of midnight stands before a shining field of stars. A gown seemingly woven from the night sky drapes her flawless ivory skin. Bright lights glitter like diamonds in her crown and raiment, and some drift about her body and dance near her hand.</p></blockquote><p>Her Celestial and Royal Majesty, Sarastra Aestruum, Queen of Night and Magic, is also Duchess of the Heavens, Mistress of Air and Darkness, Lady of the Summer Palace, and Bride of Shadows. The Queen rules the court of the shadow fey with grace and majesty—most of the time. Queen Sarastra is the head of the Summer Court, which rules the shadow fey in its season. On the rare occasion when the courtly season turns, Sarastra steps aside in favor of her husband and rival, the Moonlit King, who is head of the Winter Court.</p><p><strong>Shadow Sorceress</strong>. The Queen of Night and Magic does not bear her moniker lightly. She is a devastatingly potent sorceress, augmented with command over the stuff of shadows. Though her nature is undeniably dark, Queen Sarastra is hardly unreasonable. She is quick to recognize the value in any supplicant, mortal or fey, who catches her royal eye. She is never one to ignore an opportunity to further her agenda or to gain further power over the Moonlit King.</p><h2>The Queen of Night and Magic’s Lair (Fey Lady)</h2><p>The Queen of Night and Magic makes her home in the Plane of Shadows in the ancient halls of the courts of the shadow fey. Her lair is a great castle of delicate spires and graceful bridges with sprawling wings that house various members of the court.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Queen of Night and Magic takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Queen of Night and Magic can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Demoralizing Assault</strong>. Visions of hopelessness and despair assail the mind of one creature the Queen can see within 60 feet of her. The creature must succeed on a [[/save wis 23 format=long]] throw or be &amp;Reference[stunned apply=false]{stunned} until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Extinguish Light</strong>. Each source of magical or nonmagical bright light within 60 feet of the Queen becomes dim light, and each source of magical or nonmagical dim light within 60 feet of her becomes darkness. This effect lasts until the Queen uses this lair action again, until she dismisses it as a bonus action, or until she dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wall of Shadow</strong>. An opaque wall of writhing shadows springs up from a solid surface within 120 feet of the Queen. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must succeed on a [[/save dex 23 format=long]] or take [[/damage 4d8 necrotic average]] damage. Creatures in the wall’s space are pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall they choose. A creature can move through the wall, but the semi-material shadow resists intrusion. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. A creature that starts its turn in the wall or enters the wall’s space for the first time on a turn must make a [[/save con 23 format=long]], taking [[/damage 4d8 necrotic average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The wall dissipates when the Queen uses this lair action again or when she dies.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing the Queen of Night and Magic’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Constant Surveillance</strong>. The Queen of Night and Magic can cast her senses to any area containing darkness, dim light, or shadows within 6 miles of her lair. This effect works like the clairvoyance spell, except its range is 6 miles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Living Shadow</strong>. Shadows come to life within 6 miles of the Queen’s lair. Most of the time these living shadows are unnerving and nothing more, but when a creature acts against the interests of the Queen, the shadows can interfere and cause the creature to have disadvantage on ability checks made to act against her interests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magically Active</strong>. Magic saturates the area within 6 miles of the lair, causing temporary, minor, and harmless magical effects, like random aromas wafting through the air, sudden chills, spontaneous motes of light dancing in the sky, and similar.</p></li></ul><p>If the Queen of Night and Magic dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

In addition to their stealthy natures and physical prowess, kot bayun have the ability to put prey to sleep with song. They carefully stalk victims for a time, learning the victim’s strengths and weaknesses before making their attack. They lie in wait until their prey is vulnerable and then begin their song. Those resisting the call to slumber are always the kot bayun’s first victims as the predator launches from cover and attempts to disembowel its prey. In forests with a thick canopy, a kot bayun stealthily creeps among tree limbs, tracking the movement of its prey below.</p><p><strong>Healing Poetry</strong>. If discovered by intelligent prey, a kot bayun opens with a parley instead of claws. In rare cases, a kot bayun finds something in its prey it likes, and cold predation turns to a lukewarm association. Befriending a kot bayun has benefits, as the creature’s poems, tales, and sagas have healing power. A kot bayun tells its stories in the form of strange epics and poetry, ranging from simple rhyming folk poems to complex sonnets, and it heals listeners only at the end of the poem.</p>",

Since then, the secret of hoard golem construction has emerged, and rich nobles have followed suit, enchanting their wealth to defend itself from thieves.</p><p><strong>Patient Homebodies</strong>. As constructs, hoard golems are mindless, lying in wait for anyone other than their creator to come within striking distance. In the case of evil dragons, this may include the wyrmlings of dragon parents looking to establish dominance in the family. Hoard golems fight to the death, but they rarely leave the rooms they inhabit for fear that clever treasure hunters might trick the hoard into walking itself right out of the owner’s den.</p><p><strong>Silent and Wealthy</strong>. Hoard golems cannot speak. A hoard golem is 25 feet tall and weighs 20,000 pounds. A hoard golem’s body is composed of items — copper, silver, gold, works of art, armor, weapons, and magical items — worth at least 5,000 gp.</p>",

With the creak of long-unused limbs, this towering figure in ancient armor raises its weapons once more.</p></blockquote><p>Ushabtis are placed in tombs as servants in the afterlife for those buried there—as both a laborer in the kingdom of the dead and a guardian in the kingdom of the living. These sentinels tend to the physical work and maintenance required after death that is beyond the abilities of those of flesh and blood. Dressed in ceremonial regalia, they are sometimes mistaken for living beings by those who would intrude upon their domain, but careful examination reveals faintly glowing hieroglyphs graven into their garments and bodies.</p><p><strong>Tomb Guardians</strong>. Ushabtis are most commonly encountered as guardians—a function they fulfill effectively, fiercely attacking anything that threatens their sworn charge. An ushabti is sometimes obvious from the blood of its victims staining its form. Some ceaselessly babble ancient scriptures or invocations to the gods of death. Tombs are often littered with bones of tomb robbers an ushabti has dispatched.</p><p><strong>Serene Repose</strong>. Most ushabtis have human faces and proportions, with features resembling a death mask. When at rest, they stand or lie with arms folded across their chests, clutching their ceremonial weapons. Many variations have been found, however, including some that are animal-headed, completely monstrous, or have abstract or fanciful designs, such as a sun-sphere head or a body made of papyrus scrolls.</p><p><strong>Sacrificial Corruptions</strong>. Some dark practitioners use sacrifices—willing or not—as undying servants of their god-kings and god-queens. Generals, trusted advisors, and close allies have willingly accompanied their dying lords into the afterlife through this horrifying transformation. The sacrifices are tightly bound in linens and sealed within a sarcophagus among a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs that, over a period of days to weeks, fully consume their bodies. The servant’s devotion to their task and the anguish of their passing transforms the scarab colony and animates the funerary wrappings to carry on with the sacred duty. Most view this as a corruption of the process for creating ushabtis, reducing the time and cost of construction with blood and resulting in a weaker, uncontrollable guardian. Though a corrupted ushabti fulfills its duties to protect its dead charges, it views living creatures as meals for the scarab colony within its wrappings, regardless of that creature’s identity.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Ushabti in Midgard</h3><p>In Midgard, ushabtis are common in the Southlands as funerary figures.

The victim’s angry spirit returns, looking for retribution against those involved in its death—whether that death was wrongful murder or justified execution. These spirits inflict punishment on the living with the rage that animates them, and they mete out their revenge in poetic fashion.</p><p><strong>Varied Vengeance</strong>. A vengeful spirit is defined by its means of death.

This spirit was burned at the stake, perished in a building set alight by angry villagers, or similarly killed by fire. An immolated vengeful spirit has immunity to fire damage, and its Decapitation action is renamed to Conflagration. Conflagration can target any creature, and it deals fire damage instead of slashing damage. In addition, a target that fails the saving throw is ignited, instead of losing its head, and takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each turn until another creature takes an action to douse the fire.</p><p><strong>Strangled</strong>. This spirit was the victim of strangulation or an ill-performed hanging. Its Decapitation action is renamed to Asphyxiation. Asphyxiation can target only a creature that needs to breathe, and it deals bludgeoning damage instead of slashing damage. In addition, a target that fails the saving throw is suffocating, instead of losing its head, until the spirit dies or until lifted by the <em>remove curse</em> or <em>dispel magic</em> (DC 13) spell.</p></article></div>",

Stuhacs weave new ligaments into their clutters while their still-living victims watch.

      "description": "<blockquote><p>This aquamarine dragon has a shark’s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Divine Dragons</strong>. Sea dragons are the children of the ocean and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they might be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea. Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.</p><p><strong>Shipwreck Art</strong>. Sea dragons love collecting treasure. They especially prize the sunken, treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.</p><p><strong>Sunken Memorials</strong>. A sea dragon’s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.</p><h2>A Sea Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Sea dragons dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral. Whatever the place, it’s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.</p><p>The sky surrounding a sea dragon’s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Create Coral Wall</strong>. The dragon creates an opaque wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature in its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space on whichever side of the wall it wants, and it must make a [[/save dex 15 format=long]], taking [[/damage 4d8 slashing average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While the wall remains, any creature that touches the wall must also make the saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hp, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to poison damage and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invoke the Sea’s Calm</strong>. The currents around up to four creatures in the water and that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it work against the creatures. Each target must succeed on a [[/save str 15 format=long]] or it can’t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make more than one attack on its turn until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Whirlpools</strong>. Four vortexes of water appear centered on points underwater or on the water’s surface that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each vortex takes the shape of a cylinder that is 30 feet tall with a 5-foot radius. Each creature that enters a vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a [[/save str 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained}. A creature, including a restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 15 format=long]]. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary sea dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Chill of the Deeps</strong>. Water temperatures drop sharply within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair, turning the water frigid and endangering swimming creatures not accustomed to arctic waters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tempestuous Weather</strong>. Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thriving Waterways</strong>. Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Priests of Seggotan</h3><p>Every sea dragon is devoted to the dragon god of the sea. As a result, many sea dragons use the innate spellcasting variant.

When the treant dies, the ala is born in a black whirlwind. </p></blockquote><p><strong>Daughters of the Whirlwind</strong>. Alas have windblown hair and wear smoky black rags, but their true form is that of a whirlwind, which can always be seen by šestaci, those men and women with six digits on each hand. In flight or in battle, an ala takes on a form with the upper body of a hag and a whirling vortex of air in place of hips and legs. When an ala enters a house in human form, the whole building groans in protest, as if it had been struck by a powerful storm wind. Alas live in the hollows of trees that were struck by lightning. They are most active when thunder rocks the forest, and when they travel, hail or thunderstorms spawn around them. </p><p><strong>Enormous Appetites</strong>. The huge-mouthed alas have voracious appetites. In the wild, they devour wolves, bears, and badgers. They prefer to hunt in settled areas, however, because they favor the taste of innocents above all else. Unsavory humanoids may beg an ala’s favor (or divert its wrath) with gifts of bound captives.</p><p><strong>Energized by Storms</strong>. In battle, an ala is constantly on the move, weaving between foes like the wind. It tears at its foes with claws and a poisonous bite, or throws wicked lightning bolts and hailstorms from afar. Woe betides the hero who confronts an ala while a storm rages overhead—such storms energize the ala and make its lightning stronger. Because alas wield lightning with such mastery, some sages associate them with the god of lightning.</p>",

Desert giants subsist in the scorching wastes by moving from oasis to oasis. They follow herds of desert animals that they cultivate for milk, meat, and hides, and they shun most contact with settled people.

Over time, wandering desert giants amass vast knowledge of ruins and relics scattered across and beneath their homeland. On rare occasions that the tribes require something of outsiders, this information is their most valuable commodity. Relics of the past, or simply the location of unplundered ruins, can purchase great advantage for the tribe. The designs the giants painstakingly inscribe on their bodies tell a tale that, if woven together correctly, reveals an entire tribe’s collected discoveries. For this reason, the desert giants hold the bodies of their dead in sacred esteem.

Long arms end in cruel claws, and the air around him shimmers with waves of intense heat.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Underworld Bat Lord</strong>. Camazotz, the Lord of Bats and Fire, is a being of pure savagery and hatred—a vile demon that holds sway over bats, vampires, and the lightless places of the underworld. In the deep recesses of the earth and the caves connecting to the surface, he waits restlessly until the slow creep of night engulfs the land, releasing him to feed and spread terror.</p><p><strong>New Fiery Mantle</strong>. Recently, Camazotz stole the fire aspect of the decrepit Huhueteotl, Lord of the Hearth and the Fire of Life. With his new prestige, Camazotz has attracted new followers, served notice to the gods of his ascendancy, and solidified his place in the Abyss as a power to be respected. Cults of derro, goblins, and humans praise his name in the darkness.</p><p><strong>Emerging from Darkness</strong>. Like the bats he commands, Camazotz much prefers darkness to light, but with his new ability to play with fire and light, he grows increasingly confident in daylight.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Camazotz in the Real World</h3><p>A cult dedicated to an anthropomorphic deity with the body of a human and the head of a bat emerged around 100 BCE with the Zapotec Indians of southwest Mexico. This god was associated with night, death, and sacrifice. In time, the veneration of Camazotz, or Cama Zotz (translated as “death bat” or “snatch bat”), found its way into Maya lore.</p><p>In older editions of the world’s greatest roleplaying game, there was some debate as to whether Zotzilaha was another name for Camazotz, but in Central American lore, there was no debate. The Popol Vuh, a sacred Maya text, clearly identifies Zotzilaha as the cavernous “house of bats” where Camazotz resides, not an entity.</p><p>The Camazotz myth may have sprung from a real creature. Fossil records found in Central and South America dating back approximately 2,000 years reveal the existence of an abnormally large bat with a wingspan of as much as 10 feet! This super-bat, called Desmodus draculae, may have co-existed with the early Zapotecs and been the source of their Camazotz legends.</p><p>Belief in bat demons is widespread throughout Mesoamerica: Hik’al, or “neck-slitter,” of Chiapas; Socouyant of Trinidad; and Tin Tin of Ecuador. Cryptozoologists believe that those monstrous bats may still be alive today, as reports of giant, bat-like creatures occasionally surface throughout Latin America, from the Rio Grande Valley in Texas to Brazil, from Puerto Rico to Mexico.</p></article></div>",

As ages passed, memories of those who departed slowly faded from the minds of those aboleth who remained behind. Those few aboleth who did remember that long ago some of their kin had gone plane-wandering assumed that the wanderers died in distant hells or paradises.</p><p><strong>Changed by Planar Wandering</strong>. The plane-wanderers hadn’t died. Instead, their eons-long exposure to alien realms and the space between changed them, restructuring their life force, making them into something even more nightmarish—but better able to withstand both strange hells and golden realms of eldritch delight. They returned even more corrupt and powerful than when left, and these wandering nihileths returned to the mortal world intent on spreading the influence of the Void and the utter evil they found in the vast darkness between worlds.</p><p><strong>Undead Servitors</strong>. Humanoids, giants, and monstrosities that succumb to the nihileth’s disease transform into servitors for the twisted aboleths. Most humanoids transform into @UUID[Compendium.kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023.tob-1-2023-creatures.Actor.nxIF7dD1BdAx8QxO]{nihilethic zombies}, while the larger giants and monstrosities transform into @UUID[Compendium.kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023.tob-1-2023-creatures.Actor.W3W4zy0sVW1VEZNe]{nihilethic dominator}}. While the creatures retain much of the general shape they had in life, these servitors have translucent and slimy skin, and are adept swimmers, able to function in water or on land in service to their nihileth masters.</p><h2>A Nihileth’s Lair</h2><p>While aboleths create their lairs underwater, spending most of their time submerged, a nihileth can create a lair outside the water, often in a cave or a ruined, abandoned city. Nihileth lairs on land typically contain several pools of water and are often within at least 1 mile of a large body of water, as the nihileth’s ability to fully function outside of water is limited.</p><h2>Lair Actions</h2><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nihileth can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the nihileth can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Open the Void</strong></em>. Up to three points in water the nihileth can see within 90 feet of it become conduits to the Void. Each creature within 10 feet of a point must succeed on a [[/save wis 15 format=long]] or take [[/damage 2d6 necrotic average]] damage.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Void Absorbance</strong></em>. The nihileth can pull the life force from nearby nihilethic zombies and dominators to replenish its own life. Nihilethic dominators and zombies within 30 feet of the nihileth take a total of [[/damage 6d6 psychic average]] damage, divided evenly between them, and the nihileth regains hp equal to that amount. If a zombie or dominator is reduced to 0 hp from this damage, it is destroyed.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Void Shuffle</strong></em>. The nihileth calls on the power of the Void within its lair to rearrange its servitors. The nihileth can teleport each nihilethic dominator and zombie it can see within 60 feet of it to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the target’s starting location.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a nihileth’s lair is corrupted by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Befouled Water</strong></em>. Water sources within 1 mile of a nihileth’s lair are not only supernaturally fouled but can spread the nihileth’s disease. A creature that drinks such water must succeed on a [[/save con 11 format=long]] or become infected with the <em>nihilethic rot</em> disease (see the Nihilethic Rot trait).</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Thinned Veil</strong></em>. The veil between the Material Plane and the Void is thinner within 1 mile of the nihileth’s lair. Beasts born or hatched in the area often have additional vestigial limbs, protoeyes, black or sludge-like blood, or similar signs of the corrupting influence of the Void.</p></li></ul>",

During the flood season, however, subek become violent and territorial, ruthlessly killing and consuming all trespassers.</p><p><strong>Riverbank Homes</strong>. Subek are crocodilian humanoids that dwell along the banks of great rivers. They are tailless, possessing muscular physiques, surprisingly dexterous hands, and a frightening maw of sharp teeth. They are 9 feet tall, average 700 pounds, and can live up to 300 years. During the dry season, subek are friendly and thoughtful scholars, historians, and artisans.</p><p><strong>Flood Fever</strong>. Subek are well aware of their destructive and violent nature. When the waters rise, they distance themselves from other cultures, warning locals to keep away until the river recedes. Most migrate up or down river to an area with few inhabitants; some even construct underground prisons or cages and pay brave retainers to keep them locked up and fed during their time of savagery. During flood fever, subek do not recognize friends or colleagues. They discard all trappings of civilization and kill non-subek creatures indiscriminately. Once the fever clears, they remember nothing of their actions, though they are surrounded by undeniable, grisly reminders.</p><p><strong>Keep Their Distance</strong>. Despite the danger, subek are tolerated and even prized for their skill as engineers, historians, and teachers. They live on the outskirts of many human towns, maintaining a cautious distance from their neighbors. Subek marriage is pragmatic; they live with a mate long enough to foster a single egg and raise the hatchling for a decade before parting ways.</p><p><strong>Curious Duality</strong>. Subek scholars and oracles debate their duality. Some believe it to be an ancient curse, a shared ancestry with an ancient savage people, or some loathsome and primitive part of their soul exerting control. A rare few—shamans and oracles, mostly—embrace their duality and choose to live year-round in remote regions far from civilization.</p>",

It has massive, muscular arms tipped with razor-sharp claws, a slavering jaw filled with huge fangs, and tusks that curl back almost to its blue cheeks.</p></blockquote><p>Towering around 25 feet tall, Mechuiti, Lord of Cannibal Apes, can stand erect like a human or walk on his knuckles, like a great ape.</p><p><strong>Bloodskull Island</strong>. After being expelled from the sweltering jungles and deadly swamps of the Hell of Cannibals, Mechuiti was coughed out of a volcanic portal onto an island now called Bloodskull. Here, he schemes and plots his revenge while breeding demonic minions.</p><p><strong>Corruptor of the Behtu</strong>. When Mechuiti first arrived on the Material Plane, he enthralled a group of jungle-dwelling simians, known as the behtu (see page 34), by visiting their leaders and priests in dreams and nightmares. After convincing these leaders to come to his volcanic home, he infected them with his demonic ichor, transforming them in mind and body, and taught them tattoo magic to give them fiendish power and strength. They returned to their people with this new power and knowledge of the ritual for transforming the rest of their people.</p><p><strong>Bound But Dangerous</strong>. Only with the most powerful magic and technology did the ancient people bind him within Bloodskull Island’s volcano—the best they could accomplish, since they couldn’t destroy him. Despite imprisonment, Mechuiti has remained a terror through the ages. The behtu have not found the key to their master’s release, but they still torture and ensorcel unlucky explorers who stumble into their abode, hoping to find someone who can unlock their master’s prison.</p><p><strong>Commander of Monsters</strong>. Mechuiti commands the behtu to breed fiendish beasts and lizards with his blood: dire apes, fiery giant lizards, and even demonic spiders. He has raised generations of flame dragons (see page 116), which lair in the volcano’s caldera, to guard his temple-fane and deal with threats beyond the behtus’ reach.</p><h2>Mechuiti’s Lair</h2><p>Mechuiti is trapped within the volcano in his island prison. However, imprisonment hasn’t prevented Mechuiti from mustering an army and turning his confinement into a nightmarish bastion.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mechuiti takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Mechuiti can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Searing Torment</strong>. The pain of all creatures other than demons within 120 feet of Mechuiti is intensified. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, each time a creature within 120 feet of Mechuiti takes damage, it must succeed on a [[/save con 24 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[stunned]{stunned} until the end of its next turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Split the Earth</strong>. A small fissure of lava opens beneath one creature Mechuiti can see within 120 feet of him. The target must make a [[/save dex 24 format=long]] , taking [[/damage average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Toxic Gases</strong>. Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Mechuiti can see within 120 feet of him. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a [[/save con 24 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[poisoned]{poisoned} until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tremor</strong>. The whole volcano trembles and shakes. Each creature that isn’t a demon and that is on a solid surface must succeed on a [[/save dex 24 format=long]] or be knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone}. All ground in the volcano becomes difficult terrain for creatures that aren’t demons until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing Mechuiti’s lair is warped by his presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dream Calling</strong>. When a creature with an Intelligence score of 10 or higher sleeps within 3 miles of the lair, it dreams of Mechuiti. The creature must succeed on a [[/save wis 15 format=long]] when it wakes or be compelled to seek out Mechuiti’s cult.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pyroclastic Venting</strong>. Mechuiti can make the volcano erupt no more than every 7 days. When he does, a cloud of hot ashes and smoke covers the area within 6 miles of the volcano, and magma flows from the volcano’s cone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unpotable Water</strong>. Water within 1 mile of the lair carries disease. A creature that isn’t a demon or behtu that drinks the water must succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]] or become infected with a &amp;Reference[disease]{disease} and be &amp;Reference[poisoned]{poisoned} until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hp maximum by [[/damage average]] on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0.</p></li></ul><p>If Mechuiti dies, these effects fade immediately.</p>",

    "Black Night (Baba Yaga’s Horsemen)": {
      "name": "Black Night (Baba Yaga’s Horsemen)",
      "tokenName": "Black Night",
      "description": "<blockquote><p>These mounted knights wield great weapons as swift as dawn, as bright as the blazing sun, and as cold as the grave. The white horseman is a young rider full of promise, the red rider a man in his prime, and the black rider a scarred and bearded fellow, his eyes dark and his mouth set in a grim frown. They ride with purpose on powerful steeds.</p></blockquote><p>Baba Yaga’s three horsemen are legends in their own right. Bright Day, Red Sun, and Black Night (also known as the White, Red, and Black horsemen) are her faithful emissaries, scouts, and warriors abroad. The three horsemen change over time, but they are typically male, human warriors. Their appearance is distinctive: each horseman dresses in colors and lacquered armor and trappings to suit their name, with their magical horses colored to match. Their roles appear to coincide with their appointed offices, although their precise relationship to Baba Yaga is the source of much speculation.</p><p><strong>Varied Origin</strong>. They may be serving Grandmother Winter for a time in exchange for a favor or bargain, or they may be cursed to replace a previous horseman they slew. In either case, Baba Yaga is the source of their power. The horsemen are innately connected to the domain of time; each represents part of the day, as measured by the sun. Bright Day is bound to and governs dawn to mid-day, Red Sun from mid-day to sundown, and Black Night rules until daybreak. While Baba Yaga herself is wily and capricious, her three horsemen are bound to cosmological forces that are uniform and constant, which is reflected in their alignment and demeanor.</p><p><strong>One Rises, Two Set</strong>. The horsemen never co-exist with one another except within the confines of their mistresses’ Dancing Hut and the fenced yard around it. Each one must yield his presence on the Material Plane to his successor in rotation (this varies on other planes, depending on intervals of day and night). Forcing two horsemen to co-exist on the Material Plane places a perilous strain on reality. Bringing all three together could trigger a primal magical event or chronal catastrophe.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Baba Yaga’s Horsemen in Midgard</h3><p>The great witch Baba Yaga is a power to be reckoned with in Midgard, always plotting with her daughters, the @UUID[Compendium.kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023.tob-1-2023-creatures.Actor.degnu3X7o8BrbrKu]{vila} (see page 386), and seeking to gobble up the vile gnomes whose souls she claims are rightfully hers. Baba Yaga rules over great ley line magic and commands the elements and enchantments with ease, but she cannot be everywhere at once.</p><p>Three of her most faithful servants are the White Horseman, the Red Horseman and the Black Horseman—embodied forms of the times of day and a symbol of Baba Yaga’s mastery of time itself. She uses nicknames for them, calling them “My Bright Dawn, my Red Sun, and my Dark Midnight” because they are bound by time (and some believe, because they control dawn, noon, and sunset). She has many servants, but the horsemen, her dancing hut, and the sorcerer Koshchei the Deathless are the greatest.</p><h3>The Three Horsemen</h3><p>All three horsemen use the statistics presented here, but each has a few unique characteristics from his brethren, as defined below.</p><p>Bright Day. This horseman has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and resistance to cold damage and fire damage.</p><p>Red Sun. This horseman is immune to being blinded, charmed, and frightened and has immunity to fire damage.</p><p>Black Night. This horseman has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and magical darkness doesn’t impede his darkvision. In addition, he has immunity to cold damage.</p><h3>Encounters with Baba Yaga’s Horsemen</h3><p>The horsemen make good foes for the long term; their power is great enough that they can ignore considerable danger when serving their mistress. Here are some possible encounters involving them:</p><p>Red Sun burns down a village while the PCs are sleeping at the inn. If questioned or challenged, he says nothing, but provides a scroll from Baba Yaga ordering the village’s destruction. Red Sun rides off into the dawn.</p><p>Black Night bears a similar scroll, asking an elvish character to provide Baba Yaga with a pint of blood; if the request is granted, Black Night leaves without incident, but if he is denied, a young human boy is found outside the party’s sleeping chambers, drained of all blood.</p><p>At noon, Bright Day leads a parade of strange creatures, everything from shadow fey duelists and enchantresses to a glowing will-o’-wisp and a bright malakbel demon (see page 85), burning so bright it sets fire to crops and thatched huts near it. The fey mention Bright Day is going to pay Baba Yaga’s respects to the River King. If the party chooses to join the procession, they can’t leave it until sunset—and may find their company is not entirely welcome.</p></article></div>",

Tamed ychen bannogs can haul entire communities, or even small castles, and a clever dwarf with a ychen bannog at its disposal can carve out enormous riverbeds, haul enormous stones, or reshape entire valleys with ease.</p><p><strong>Ychen Warships</strong>. Giants have a particular affinity with the ychen bannogs. In times of war, giants sometimes build complex siege platforms atop these beasts, making effective transport for small armies of giants. Thankfully, ychen bannogs are rare enough that even seeing one in an army is a tale to be told for generations. </p><p><strong>Louder Than Thunder</strong>. When riled, an ychen bannog can bellow loudly enough to shatter stones and knock down walls.</p>",

He has a bushy beard and wears a rumpled, red overcoat over a dirty white shirt and knee-length red trousers with blue stockings and silver-buckled shoes. A cap made from leaves stitched together with gold thread slouches atop his head, and he reeks of stale beer and wine.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Drunks in the Cellar</strong>. Clurichauns are mean-spirited, alcohol-loving fey that plague butteries and wine cellars. These drunken fey were once leprechauns, but they long ago forsook a life of toil for one of solitary debauchery. Now they spend every night drinking, warbling off-key, and tormenting their hapless hosts with cruel pranks. However, if the clurichaun’s host keeps him or her well supplied with a favorite libation and otherwise leaves him or her alone, the clurichaun protects their wine cellars from thieves, drunkards, or worse—becoming quite vigorous when they feel the security of the cellars is threatened in any way. They have a particular hatred for @UUID[Compendium.kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023.tob-1-2023-creatures.Actor.4EapkZUsBZQ8Icyi]{rum gremlins} (see page 223) and for other clurichauns.</p><p><strong>Contest Evictions</strong>. Most people can’t tolerate or afford a clurichaun’s presence for long. Unfortunately, attempts to drive them off usually result in the spiteful clurichaun going on a destructive rampage and spoiling any remaining wine. The best way to evict a clurichaun is to challenge him or her to a drinking contest. A clurichaun can’t abide losing to a mortal and if defeated by one, slinks away in shame, never to be seen again. This is a risky option, because clurichauns can drink prodigiously with little ill effect.</p><p><strong>Small Brawlers</strong>. While clurichauns aren’t averse to an old-fashioned tavern brawl, they rely mainly on their magic to protect themselves. Creatures under a clurichaun’s spell feel and act as if they were intoxicated, complete with hangovers the next morning!</p>",

Alquam delights in music, though his favorite songs are said to grate mortal sanity to shreds. His huffed breath reeks of carrion.</p>\n<p>Alquam is composed mostly of darkness, with some features of a monstrous owl. He stands over 15 feet tall, and dark gray feathers with lighter speckles and bands cover his body. His head is that of a great owl with back-swept horns and massive, bulbous eyes that gleam yellow. His body is thin and such a deep black that it drinks in light. His feathery wings are long enough to wrap around his whole body.</p>\n<h2>Alquam’s Lair</h2>\n<p>Alquam’s lair is an immense tree in the center of a lightless layer of the Abyss.

If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

Gbahali hide changes color to match its surroundings so perfectly that it becomes nearly invisible.

Their thick hide can be made into hide or leather armor, and with the proper alchemical techniques it retains some of its color-shifting properties.</p><p><strong>Strong Hunters</strong>. Gbahalis are powerful predators, challenged only by rivals too large for a gbahali to take down or by predators that hunt in packs and prides, such as lions and gnolls. Gbahalis live solitary lives except during the fall, when males seek out females in their territory. Females lay eggs in the spring and guard the nest until the eggs hatch, but the young gbahali are abandoned to their own devices. Killing an adult gbahali is a sign of bravery and skill for many plains hunters.</p><p><strong>Sentries and Stragglers</strong>. In combat, a gbahali relies on its camouflaging hide to ambush prey.

Loxodas live in small herds of two to three extended families. Several of these communities will usually cluster together, allowing members to move between groups as they get older. They have no permanent settlements, and instead loxoda families travel to new areas when they deplete the available food. Voracious omnivores, a family of loxodas will quickly strip trees bare of leaves, or hunt and cook an entire elephant. </p><p><strong>Often Underestimated</strong>. Many people assume that loxodas are as dull witted as the ogres they resemble. This is often a fatal mistake, as the loxoda are quite intelligent. Their simple equipment and straightforward living come not from a lack of skill or knowledge, but their own isolationism and xenophobia. Their immense size and quadruped body make it difficult for them to mine metal ore, and they violently reject communications and trade with other people. The little metal they can gather is either taken from the bodies of their prey or stolen in raids on dwarven, human, or gnoll settlements. </p><p><strong>Vestigial Tusks</strong>. All loxodas have curved tusks. While they are too small for use in even ritual combat, they are often decorated with intricate carvings or inlays or are dyed in a pattern developed by their family. Each individual also adapts the patterns with their own individual marks, often inspired by important events in their lives. Some loxodas put golden rings or jeweled bracelets stolen from humanoids onto their tusks as trophies. A loxoda matriarch may have long, dangling chains of such ornaments, indicating her high status and long life. </p>",

Quick and canny, a chort devil delights in enticing mortals to make terrible bargains, but it revels in its obvious devilishness. A chort wants its victim to know it is dealing with a devil. The relative straightforwardness of this approach enables the creature to better deceive victims. After all, the chort affirms, if the victims weren’t so desperate, they wouldn’t be bargaining with a devil. If necessary, an implied threat of immolation gives it greater bargaining power, but the devil is careful not to torture or otherwise harm its patsy, as that voids any potential contract.</p><p><strong>Recitation of Contracts</strong>. Occasionally, some poor fool believes he can trick a chort and escape a legal bargain. The devil appears and recites the entirety of the contract its victim signed, replete with embarrassing details about a dispatched rival, the ensnarement of a lover, and other disclosures. A chort ensures all those entangled in its victim’s affairs are present to hear the recitation, and it disappears once all the victim’s dark secrets have been revealed.</p><p><strong>Smear Tactics</strong>. An opponent of the chort often finds itself the victim of its own hubris, as the devil digs up or creates vile tales about the opponent. A chort enjoys tarnishing the reputation of tools of good. For example, it may steal a paladin’s sword and use it to murder an especially pious person, leaving the sword in the victim. Thus, a chort dispatches a foe resistant to its manipulations, brings suspicion to another potential foe, and taints a weapon—at least in reputation—which might be used against it.</p>",

You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p><p>You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p><p>A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, Alignment, or beliefs.

The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p><p>A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).</p>",

      "description": "<h1 class=\"noborder\">Fey Lords and Ladies</h1><p>Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.</p><p><strong>Heads of State</strong>. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble’s domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler’s word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that’s no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.</p><p><strong>Vacant Thrones</strong>. When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court’s vacant throne.</p><h1 class=\"noborder\">Moonlit King (Fey Lord)</h1><blockquote><p>Dressed in archaic nobleman’s finery, this elf lord has wildly unkempt bluish hair and pale, almost luminous skin. His eyes bulge slightly from their sockets as they stare vacantly. The lord’s shadow moves slightly out of sync with his body, which appears solid in some portions and nearly transparent in others.</p></blockquote><p>His Lunar and Royal Majesty, Ludomir Imbrium the XVI, is also known as the Moonlit King of the Shadow Fey, Lord of Shadows, Duke of the Elves, and Master of the Winter Palace. A creature consumed by madness, the Moonlit King is an ephemeral vestige of greatness lost. He barely lives in reality anymore, and he is beset by phantoms from his own mind conjured from shadows and regret.</p><p><strong>Dwindling Power</strong>. The Moonlit King lost the favor of his wife, the Queen of Night and Magic (see page 178), long ago. When he fell from power, the Queen exiled him, banishing him from his seat in the courts of the shadow fey. Now he endures in the crumbling, far-flung Tower of the Moon. The King has sunk deep into madness during his isolation and has turned to bargains with demons and devils in a desperate bid to regain freedom.</p><h2>Moonlit King’s Lair</h2><p>The Moonlit King’s lair is the Tower of the Moon, which is hidden in a spiral labyrinth deep within the Plane of Shadows. The tower is a run-down, forlorn place filled with false whispers and shadow ghosts of the mad fey lord’s own creation.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Moonlit King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Moonlit King can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Frightful Whispers</strong>. Disembodied whispers speaking of despair and failure erupt from a point the Moonlit King can see within 120 feet of him. Each non-Fiend creature within 15 feet of that point must succeed on a [[/save wis 19 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[frightened]{frightened} until the end of its next turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maddening Hallucinations</strong>. Shadows and moonlight dance around up to three creatures the Moonlit King can see within 60 feet of him. Each target must succeed on a [[/save wis 19 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[incapacitated]{incapacitated} until the end of its next turn as hallucinations fill its mind. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target suffers @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables.RollTable.ypk2L9feVwTx0QVj]{short-term madness}.</p></li><li><p><strong>Moonlit Illumination</strong>. Four beams of moonlight appear on points the Moonlit King can see within 120 feet of him. Each beam sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius centered on a point. The moon beams last until the Moonlit King uses this lair action again or until he dies.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing the Moonlit King’s lair is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Constant Moonlight</strong>. Weather conditions don’t inhibit moonlight shining within 10 miles of the lair—clouds part, rain seems to channel moonbeams, and snow takes on a luminous silver glow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stryx Network</strong>. The area within 5 miles of the Moonlit King’s lair attracts hundreds of stryxes (see page 350) and owls. The King can choose to see or hear through the senses of any stryx or owl in this area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Waking Dreams</strong>. Dreams and fears take on a life of their own. Minor visual and auditory hallucinations plague creatures within 3 miles of the lair.</p></li></ul><p>If the Moonlit King dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.</p><p><strong>Heads of State</strong>. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble’s domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler’s word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that’s no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.</p><p><strong>Vacant Thrones</strong>. When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court’s vacant throne.</p><h1 class=\"noborder\">Bear King (Fey Lord)</h1><blockquote><p>Dressed in hunting leathers with a thick bearskin cloak around his shoulders, the bearded king sits upon a throne carved from a whole tree trunk. A crown of holly leaves wreathes his head, and a blackened maul rests near his hand. An ornate clay pot filled with honey hangs at his hip.</p></blockquote><p>Mesikammen the Bear King, called “Old Honey Paws,” rules the northern Kingdom of the Bear. Its forests are thick with bears, and bearfolk (see page 33) and werebears are common among its people.</p><p><strong>Abuzz with Bees</strong>. The country’s chief product and export, thanks to the Bear King’s insatiable appetite for sweets, is honey. The Bear King’s hive-keepers harvest rich, blossom-sweet honey from the hives of giant bees they tend. The land’s brewers use the honey to create the finest mead, and the most potent brews are infused with fey glamour.</p><p><strong>Boisterous Revels</strong>. The Bear King and his court of bear jarls, witches, and oracles spend most of their time hunting in the hills, feasting, brawling, and drinking mead. Old Honey Paws maintains his rulership over this court by besting all rivals in a yearly series of challenges. The challenges are open to anyone, but the Bear King has defeated all comers since he rose to the throne.</p><h2>Bear King’s Lair</h2><p>The Bear King’s fortress thrusts up from the foothills of a mountain range like a petrified wave. The lair is riddled with caves and tunnels and contains the court of the Bear King.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Bear King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Bear King can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Quake</strong>. A minor quake starts on a point the Bear King can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a [[/save str 17 format=long]] or take [[/damage 2d6 bludgeoning average]] damage and fall &amp;Reference[prone]{prone}.</p></li><li><p><strong>Summon Bees</strong>. The lair’s denizens rise up to defend their king, causing [[/r 2d4]] giant bees (see <em>Tome of Beasts 2</em> or use the statistics of a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.4tl0s2SnaLjkoDiI]{giant wasp}) to appear in unoccupied spaces of the Bear King’s choice within 60 feet of him. The bees act on initiative count 20, are allies of the Bear King, and obey his spoken commands. The bees remain until the Bear King dies or until he dismisses them as a bonus action. The Bear King can have no more than eight giant bees under his control at one time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ursine Transformation</strong>. One creature the Bear King can see within 30 feet of him must succeed on a [[/save con 17 format=long]] or transform into a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.omcDpBoB69esCXeM]{brown bear} as if the creature had failed a saving throw against the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.04nMsTWkIFvkbXlY]{polymorph}</em> spell. While transformed, the creature must move to and attack a target chosen by the Bear King on each of its turns. The transformation lasts until the Bear King dies or until he uses this lair action again. The transformed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the transformation on itself on a success.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region surrounding the Bear King’s lair is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Angry Bees</strong>. Bees within 10 miles of the Bear King’s lair are easily agitated and quick to attack Humanoids that aren’t bearfolk or werebears.</p></li><li><p><strong>Call of the Bear King</strong>. Within 5 miles of the Bear King’s lair, creatures have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid contracting lycanthropy from a werebear.</p></li><li><p><strong>Heightened Passions</strong>. Emotions within 10 miles of the Bear King’s lair run high. Arguments quickly descend into physical scuffles and enjoyable get-togethers are likely to become raucous carousing.</p></li></ul><p>If the Bear King dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

A maw of needle-sharp teeth and a wicked straight razor at his side are clear warnings that his enemies should hasten their footsteps.</p></blockquote><p>Vile barbers are sadistic fey who move through the shadows to execute their bloody, malevolent wills. Known as barbers for both the use of wicked blades and their proclivity for slashing the necks of their victims, these insidious fey are found lurking in dark and harrowed places like back-alley streets or abandoned, deep-shaded cemeteries.</p><p><strong>Fey Punishers</strong>. Called the siabhra (pronounced she-uvh-ra) among the fey courts, vile barbers are fickle creatures. They are sent to punish those who have offended the fey lords and ladies (see page 172), and their cruelty and cunning help them write messages in blood and skin. They scar those who have spoken ill of the fey, and they slowly bleed out those who have harmed or murdered the fey. Some of these deaths are made quite public to reinforce the power of the barber’s lord.</p><p><strong>Slippery Fighters</strong>. Vile barbers can slip through shadows, catching foes off guard or escaping a foe that has the upper hand. They delight in close combat and in inflicting wounds that terrify onlookers.</p><p><strong>Assassins and Envoys</strong>. Vile barbers frequently consort with hags and prowl the places these wicked crones cannot go as emissaries and assassins. Information on the vile barbers is scant; most adventurers who meet them don’t live to share the findings or to see the vile barber lick its bloody blade clean.</p>",

Natural diggers at heart, erinas live in shallow networks of tunnels and chambers they excavate themselves. Enemies who attack the peaceful erinas become confused and lost in the mazelike tunnels. On their own ground, the erinas can easily evade, outmaneuver, or surround invaders. They lure intruders into choke points where the enemy can be delayed while noncombatants and valuables are hustled to safety through other tunnels. Such choke points are often protected or held by erina defenders, the largest and hardiest of their kind.</p><p><strong>Scroungers and Gatherers</strong>. Erinas are naturally curious. They tend to explore an area by tunneling beneath it and popping up at interesting points. They dislike farming and live mainly on the bounty of the land surrounding their homes. In cities, they subsist on what they can find, and they have a knack for finding whatever they need. Sometimes they are called thieves, but they aren’t greedy or malicious.

Flashing blades sing in each of her four clawed hands, and the air around her shimmers with magical dust. Dozens more humanoid wasps in a variety of iridescent colors surround her, weapons raised protectively.</p></blockquote><p>The tosculi are waspfolk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places.</p><p><strong>Hive Queen</strong>. The hive queen is the nerve center of a tosculi hive-city, simultaneously one of a hive’s greatest strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>The queen serves as a unifying force. She binds her swarm with an ironclad sense of purpose through a psychic web, known as the Golden Song, that links all tosculi within a hive.</p><p>When the hive queen nears the end of her life, she selects the most promising of her immature heirs and feeds the heir a special concoction. This speeds the heir’s maturation and makes her ready to become a full-fledged hive queen. The daughter’s first action upon her metamorphosis is to devour her mother and all her sisters, absorbing and becoming the emitter of that hive’s song.</p><p>If a hive queen dies with no heir to anchor the hive mind or if the daughter’s accession is disrupted, the hive-city plunges into chaos. Tosculi bereft of the hive-mind go berserk.</p><p>A few fortunate ones might escape and become lone renegades, but their existence without the comforting presence of the hive is miserable and short. Unless one of the hive-queen’s surviving daughters is mature enough and ruthless enough to step in and assert control, the hive is doomed.</p><h2>A Tosculi Hive Queen’s Lair</h2><p>Hive queens make their lairs deep within the most protected part of the hive. Dozens of corridors lead to her lair, allowing the hive’s tosculi to reach their queen at a moment’s notice should she need it. This is also the place where tosculi eggs hatch, making it a critical location for the survival of the hive. When encountered in her lair, the tosculi hive queen has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP).</p><h2>Lair Actions</h2><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the hive queen can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Biting Brood</strong>. Hundreds of biting and stinging insects erupt from a point on the ground the hive queen can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a [[/save dex 17 format=long]], taking [[/damage 4d4 piercing average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Healing Pheromones</strong>. Each tosculi within 60 feet of the hive queen (including the hive queen) regains [[/heal 3d6 average]].</p></li><li><p><strong>Restraining Resin</strong>. The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must succeed on a [[/save dex 17 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[restrained apply=false]{restrained} by rapidly-hardening resin. A creature, including the target, can take its action to free the restrained target by succeeding on a [[/check str 17 format=long]]. If the creature is still restrained by the resin on initiative count 20 of the next round, the resin fully hardens, and the target is petrified in amber until freed or until the hive queen uses this lair action again. The resin can be attacked and destroyed (AC 15; 20 hp; vulnerability to bludgeoning damage; immunity to piercing, poison, and psychic damage), freeing the target.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a tosculi hive queen’s lair is warped by her presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Aggressive Wildlife</strong>. Beasts within 6 miles of the lair are more violent than usual and prone to acts of aggression.</p></li><li><p><strong>Buzzing Migraine</strong>. Creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or higher within 3 miles of the lair frequently suffer headaches brought on by an insectile buzzing in their minds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eyes and Ears Everywhere</strong>. The hive queen can choose to see or hear through the senses of any tosculi within 10 miles of her lair, provided the tosculi is a member of her hive.</p></li></ul>",

      "description": "<blockquote><p>The eye sockets of the funerary figure’s ornate death mask suddenly ignite with a golden radiance. With the creak of long-unused limbs, this towering figure in ancient armor raises its weapons once more.</p></blockquote><p>Ushabtis are placed in tombs as servants in the afterlife for those buried there—as both a laborer in the kingdom of the dead and a guardian in the kingdom of the living. These sentinels tend to the physical work and maintenance required after death that is beyond the abilities of those of flesh and blood. Dressed in ceremonial regalia, they are sometimes mistaken for living beings by those who would intrude upon their domain, but careful examination reveals faintly glowing hieroglyphs graven into their garments and bodies.</p><p><strong>Tomb Guardians</strong>. Ushabtis are most commonly encountered as guardians—a function they fulfill effectively, fiercely attacking anything that threatens their sworn charge. An ushabti is sometimes obvious from the blood of its victims staining its form. Some ceaselessly babble ancient scriptures or invocations to the gods of death. Tombs are often littered with bones of tomb robbers an ushabti has dispatched.</p><p><strong>Serene Repose</strong>. Most ushabtis have human faces and proportions, with features resembling a death mask. When at rest, they stand or lie with arms folded across their chests, clutching their ceremonial weapons. Many variations have been found, however, including some that are animal-headed, completely monstrous, or have abstract or fanciful designs, such as a sun-sphere head or a body made of papyrus scrolls.</p><p><strong>Sacrificial Corruptions</strong>. Some dark practitioners use sacrifices—willing or not—as undying servants of their god-kings and god-queens. Generals, trusted advisors, and close allies have willingly accompanied their dying lords into the afterlife through this horrifying transformation. The sacrifices are tightly bound in linens and sealed within a sarcophagus among a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs that, over a period of days to weeks, fully consume their bodies. The servant’s devotion to their task and the anguish of their passing transforms the scarab colony and animates the funerary wrappings to carry on with the sacred duty. Most view this as a corruption of the process for creating ushabtis, reducing the time and cost of construction with blood and resulting in a weaker, uncontrollable guardian. Though a corrupted ushabti fulfills its duties to protect its dead charges, it views living creatures as meals for the scarab colony within its wrappings, regardless of that creature’s identity.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Ushabti in Midgard</h3><p>In Midgard, ushabtis are common in the Southlands as funerary figures. Originally gifted to his faithful by the wise god Eshu—whether this was truly as a gift or as trickery depends on the scholar telling the tale—these constructs gained near universal usage among the priests of other faiths. In Nuria Natal, they take on many more utilitarian roles for the living, not being confined to merely serving the dead, such as by protecting travelers and offerings at roadside shrines and as bodyguards and servants for the living god‑kings and other important figures.</p><p>Of note, a corrupted ushabti is viewed with some esteem in Nuria Natal, assuming the sacrifice was willing. These ushabti are sometimes called imy-ut ushabtis.</p></article></div>",

When attacking, the creature’s toothy mouth reveals its horrible, juicy gullet. During the first stage of its life, the citrullus grows from sunlight, water, and the nutrients from decaying animals and plants. Once it reaches a few feet in size, these elements are no longer enough to sustain its hunger for growth, and it turns to living prey. </p><p><strong>Pest Control</strong>. The first citrullus was created by a wizard with a keen interest in magical gardening. This wizard discovered that as her garden grew lush with enchanted fruits and vegetables, local wildlife began eating the magical plants before she could harvest them. Over time, she created a fruit that would defend itself and the other plants against these pets. Her creation was such a success, that she eventually fell prey to its ravenous hunger. As the citrullus’s flowers bloomed and withered, it spread its seeds far and wide. Some daring farmers still use this tactic today—but with far more caution.</p><p><strong>Juicy Demise</strong>. Unlike many sentient plants, which use vines to trap prey, the citrullus has a sticker solution. It can spew an adhesive, seed-filled fluid at creatures it considers to be an easy meal. Once a creature is trapped, the seeds sprout small creepers that drag the creature back to the maw of the citrullus. Many people believe that eating the seeds of the citrullus causes the plant to grow in the stomach of the consumer, but this rumor has been debunked by alchemists who use the seeds to craft antacid cocktails for upset stomachs and potions of acid resistance. </p>",

Goblins, kobolds, and some humans use them rather than cats to control a mouse or rat infestation, and they make reasonably good pets if they’re kept well-fed.

      "name": "Ancient Mithral Dragon",
      "tokenName": "Ancient Mithral Dragon",
      "description": "<blockquote><p>Light glints off the dragon’s glossy scales, shining silver-white. Its tiny wings folded flush against its body open like a fan and expose shimmering, diaphanous membranes. Its narrow head, with bare slits for its eyes and nostrils, sits at the end of a slender neck atop an impossibly thin frame.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Rage in Youth</strong>. Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to acquire a worthy hoard, though they are less likely to kill for sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, mithral dragons are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life pursuing interesting goals.</p><p><strong>Peacemakers</strong>. Adult and older mithral dragons are diplomats and arbitrators by temperament (some dragons cynically call them referees). They enjoy bringing some peace to warring factions. Among all dragons, their strict neutrality and ability to negate magic make them well suited to these vital roles.</p><h2>A Mithral Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Mithral dragons are attracted to lairs near humanoid civilization, where petitioners can reach them if their diplomatic services are needed. Unlike other dragons, mithral dragons forsake lairing upon remote natural caverns or cliffs, preferring to dwell in impressive structures of metal and stone—with a particular fondness for towers. More than once, a mithral dragon has accepted the deed to a fortress, palace, or castle as payment for brokering peace between warring factions.</p><p>Curiously, mithral dragons don’t hoard coins and precious metals as most dragons do. Other curiosities fill their lair, like fine paintings, marble statues, rare tomes, stained glass, and anything made of mithral—rare treasures procured over a lifetime of interacting with mortal creatures.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Impaling Spikes</strong>. Metallic spikes sprout from the ground beneath one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The target must make a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes [[/damage 3d6 piercing average]] damage and is &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained} as it is impaled on the magical spikes. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t restrained. A creature, including the restrained target, can take its action to free the restrained target by succeeding on a [[/check str 15 format=long]] to break the spikes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shimmering Scales</strong>. Light within the lair bends toward the dragon, reflecting brilliantly off its scales. Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon and that can see it must succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[]blinded{blinded} until the end of its next turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wave of Peace</strong>. A pulse of calming energy washes over the lair. Each hostile creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a [[/save cha 15 format=long]] or become indifferent about creatures of the dragon’s choice that it is hostile toward for 1 minute. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the effect ends, the creature can choose to become hostile again.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary mithral dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Calming Air</strong>. Humanoids within 6 miles of the lair experience feelings of peace and are less prone to mood swings. Dragons within 6 miles of the lair experience the opposite effect, becoming plagued by anxiety and general irritability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Peaceful Realm</strong>. When a Dragon or Humanoid within 3 miles of the lair attempts to commit an act of violence against a Dragon or Humanoid and that act of violence isn’t in self-defense, that creature must succeed on a [[/save wis 13 format=long]] or be unable to commit acts of violence, other than self-defense, for 1 minute. The dragon can choose to suppress this effect for any creature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shining Mithral</strong>. Objects made from metals other than mithril appear dull and feel heavy while within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Mithral Dragons in Midgard</h3><p>Mithral dragons are rebellious dragons who once sought to make peace between chromatic and metallic dragons.

The placid surfaces of forest lakes and ponds hide many lethal threats, among them the bukavac. While not amphibious, the creature can hold its breath for minutes at a time as it lurks under the surface in wait for prey. A bukavac is 11 feet long, including its foot-long horns, stands four feet tall, and weighs 4,000 lb. The creature has a natural lifespan of 40 years, but its noise and proclivity to ambush intelligent prey attracts the attention of hunting parties, which considerably shortens the life expectancy of most bukavac.</p><p><strong>Enormous Roar</strong>. A ravenous bukavac lives to hunt and devour prey, preferring intelligent prey to animals, and usually ambushes its victims. Due to its size, the beast must find deep ponds or lakes to hide in, but it can flatten itself comfortably to rest in two feet of water. It leads with its wicked horns before grabbing hold of its target or another nearby foe and hanging on as it claws its victim to death. The creature relishes the feel of its victim’s struggles to escape its embrace and reserves its roar, which sounds like a cross between a toad’s croak and lion’s roar emanating from a creature the size of a dragon, for organized foes or against overwhelming numbers. If a bukavac’s devastating sonic attack routs its foes, it picks off remaining stragglers; otherwise, it retreats to its underwater hiding spot.</p><p><strong>Clamorous Mating</strong>. Solitary hunters by nature, bukavacs pair up briefly in the spring. Male bukavacs travel to a female’s lair and demonstrate their prowess by unleashing their most powerful bellows. Villages ten miles away from the lair often hear these howls for a week and pray that the creatures don’t attack. Later, the female finds a secluded, shallow lake in which to bury eggs. A bukavac reaches maturity in five years, during which time it and its siblings hunt together. After the bukavacs mature, each finds its own lair.</p>",

Unlike doppelgangers, morphoi can’t mimic specific individuals or read thoughts. Instead, they create intriguing backgrounds to go along with their disguises.</p><p><strong>Four Eyes Always</strong>. No matter what form they shift into, morphoi always have four eyes, never two. They can relocate their eyes to anywhere on their bodies, however, and they try to keep the second pair of eyes on the back of the head or neck (concealed by long hair or a tall collar), or the backs of the hands (under gloves but useful to peer around corners).</p><h2>Morphoi in Midgard</h2><p>Morphoi in Midgard serve and venerate Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory.

Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter.</p><p><strong>Braggarts and Bullies</strong>. Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants of mortal creatures. The sometimes-foolhardy creatures take offense at any perceived challenge and pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance—they perceive mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for their loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of that life in the first place.</p><p><strong>Lords of the Far Horizons</strong>. Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust and roam far from their thrones. They return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.</p><p><strong>Perpetual Infighting</strong>. These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus, their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.</p><p><strong>Portable Hoards</strong>. Wind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a small number of notable trophies or unique historic items—often quite portable.</p><h2>A Wind Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Wind dragons make their lairs where they can overlook and dominate their claims, but the location must be remote enough that inhabitants can’t pester them with requests for protection or justice. As they have little to fear from the elements, a shallow cave high on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs. They perch in the howling wind and catch updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through canyons and tearing across crags.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Air Blast</strong>. A torrent of wind blasts outward in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a [[/save str 15 format=long]] or be knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone} and &amp;Reference[stunned]{stunned} until the end of its next turn. Flying creatures, other than wind dragons, have disadvantage on the saving throw.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blinding Wind</strong>. Sand and dust swirls up from the ground in a cylinder that is 30 feet tall with a 20-foot radius, centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The area within the cylinder is &amp;Reference[difficult terrain]. A creature that enters the cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[blinded]{blinded} until the end of its next turn. The cylinder of sand and dust lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gale Force Smash</strong>. A blast of wind slams into a surface of the lair and sends fragments of ice and stone flying out from a point on the ground, wall, or ceiling the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] taking [[/damage 4d8 bludgeoning average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></li></ul>",

An owl harpy is a queen among her kind, possessing superior grace and intelligence and an owl’s predatory instinct and savage appetite. Owl harpies never grow hair, only feathers, which often wreathe their faces and crown their heads like a headdress. Their taloned feet are strong and razor sharp. They are much stronger fliers than lesser harpies; they swoop and hover in mid-air with ease to tear their prey apart. They are found in temperate climates as well as in deserts and jungles.</p><p><strong>Nocturnal Magic</strong>. Owl harpies practice a rare, potent magic associated with darkness and the night. They can counter most light sources easily. So refined is their hearing that neither darkness nor invisibility detracts from their ability to hunt their quarry. Their acute hearing also means that thunderous noises distress them.</p><p><strong>Servants of Darkness</strong>. Owl harpies are natural bards thanks to their sharp wits, and most are zealous followers of deities and demon lords of darkness and night. Less common but not unheard of are owl harpy oracles, scholars, and collectors. These savants are known to exchange their knowledge and insights for companionship or for unusual gifts and treasures.</p>",

Only the long, jagged bones lining their backs are exposed. These bones resemble a sun-bleached ribcage so perfectly that it attracts carrion birds—and curious travelers. When prey passes between the “ribs,” the sandwyrm snaps the rows of bone tightly over its prey. Once its victim is restrained, the sandwyrm paralyzes its meal with repeated stings before carrying it away.</p><p><strong>Torpid and Slow</strong>. Sandwyrms sometimes wait for weeks in torpid hibernation before footsteps on the sand alert it to a fresh meal approaching. To guard against lean weeks, sandwyrms store excess prey in subterranean lairs. They’re not above eating carrion if fresh meat isn’t available. When outmatched in a fight, sandwyrms retreat to their lairs with their paralyzed prey. </p><p><strong>Peculiar Drakes</strong>. Sandwyrms evolved as an offshoot to drakes or wyverns rather than from true dragons; their anatomy suggests they were originally four-limbed creatures and that their forearms are recent additions to the animal’s body.

The Arch-Devil of Greed rarely has to try to corrupt souls—they willingly cast themselves onto his counting room floor.</p>\n<p>Befitting his appetites, Mammon is a rotund devil, and massively tall.

If Mammon wants something badly enough, he spares no expense to get it, and even the lowliest supplicant can leverage that desire to his gain. Damned souls can be rescued from the Halls of Avarice by trading some unique bauble that has escaped Mammon’s collection, or by offering to deliver an even more valuable soul in their place.

A creature that saves successfully is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The effect can be removed by a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.</li>\n<li>Any naturally occurring treasure in Mammon’s home plane reverts to worthless junk if removed from the plane. Similarly, any mundane item left behind transforms into something fantastically valuable, as long as it remains on the plane.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Mammon dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.</p>",

Known for creating mass destruction and death on a whim, Boreas is a devouring spirit of the north who frequently tampers with the mortal world. His worldly avatar resides in a palace of blue ice and white marble on Thule’s highest peak, and he styles himself lord of all the North. Boreas suffers no disrespect and demands yearly tribute of gold, goods, and horses. He has a deep and abiding hatred of the three other Wind Lords.</p><p><strong>Easily Angered</strong>. When displeased, he bombards his “subjects” with snow, lightning storms, and gale-force winds, or buries them in avalanches by blowing his greater horn of blasting. When particularly displeased, he sends his various servants to descend upon a tribe or settlement without mercy.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Legends of Boreas</h3><p>All hail the Devourer, for tales and kennings of Boreas are as common as a spring gale or a winter’s blast. Called the Hail Thrower, the Snowy Rager, and the Father of the Snow Mares, Boreas is said to have been one of four brothers who lived far to the south, before a bitter struggle between Boreas and his three younger brothers led to him cursing the others and leaving them to suffer forever in empty quarters of sand and dust, while he took the rich forests and cool northern climes for his own.</p><p>Stories tell of that Boreas lives in a great tower in the Utmost North, served by frost giants, thuellai, and ice maidens. There he plots Ragnarok with Loki and the giants, but he has another wish—to woo and win the hand of a worthy wife, and he is bold enough to woo two by turns, Oluffa, the Queen of the Frost Giants and Nicnevin, Fey Queen of Witches.</p><p>His daughter, the Snow Queen Morrinn of Grokeheim, is not fond of this wild romance, and she strives to keep her father far from the Witch-Queen’s affections and further still from Loki and the giants. To do this, she sometimes employs mortal heroes to steal a treasure from her father’s tower, to rustle away with his finest winter wolves, or to bring sweet spring air into his court, thereby provoking him into a rage, and turning his careful wooing of powerful beauties into an occasion for raw tempers and abject apologies.</p></article></div>",

With the creak of long-unused limbs, this towering figure in ancient armor raises its weapons once more.</p></blockquote><p>Ushabtis are placed in tombs as servants in the afterlife for those buried there—as both a laborer in the kingdom of the dead and a guardian in the kingdom of the living. These sentinels tend to the physical work and maintenance required after death that is beyond the abilities of those of flesh and blood. Dressed in ceremonial regalia, they are sometimes mistaken for living beings by those who would intrude upon their domain, but careful examination reveals faintly glowing hieroglyphs graven into their garments and bodies.</p><p><strong>Tomb Guardians</strong>. Ushabtis are most commonly encountered as guardians—a function they fulfill effectively, fiercely attacking anything that threatens their sworn charge. An ushabti is sometimes obvious from the blood of its victims staining its form. Some ceaselessly babble ancient scriptures or invocations to the gods of death. Tombs are often littered with bones of tomb robbers an ushabti has dispatched.</p><p><strong>Serene Repose</strong>. Most ushabtis have human faces and proportions, with features resembling a death mask. When at rest, they stand or lie with arms folded across their chests, clutching their ceremonial weapons. Many variations have been found, however, including some that are animal-headed, completely monstrous, or have abstract or fanciful designs, such as a sun-sphere head or a body made of papyrus scrolls.</p><p><strong>Sacrificial Corruptions</strong>. Some dark practitioners use sacrifices—willing or not—as undying servants of their god-kings and god-queens. Generals, trusted advisors, and close allies have willingly accompanied their dying lords into the afterlife through this horrifying transformation. The sacrifices are tightly bound in linens and sealed within a sarcophagus among a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs that, over a period of days to weeks, fully consume their bodies. The servant’s devotion to their task and the anguish of their passing transforms the scarab colony and animates the funerary wrappings to carry on with the sacred duty. Most view this as a corruption of the process for creating ushabtis, reducing the time and cost of construction with blood and resulting in a weaker, uncontrollable guardian. Though a corrupted ushabti fulfills its duties to protect its dead charges, it views living creatures as meals for the scarab colony within its wrappings, regardless of that creature’s identity.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Ushabti in Midgard</h3><p>In Midgard, ushabtis are common in the Southlands as funerary figures. Originally gifted to his faithful by the wise god Eshu—whether this was truly as a gift or as trickery depends on the scholar telling the tale—these constructs gained near universal usage among the priests of other faiths. In Nuria Natal, they take on many more utilitarian roles for the living, not being confined to merely serving the dead, such as by protecting travelers and offerings at roadside shrines and as bodyguards and servants for the living god‑kings and other important figures.</p><p>Of note, a corrupted ushabti is viewed with some esteem in Nuria Natal, assuming the sacrifice was willing.

The spinosaurus is a special saurian bred for size and loyalty by lizardfolk. Lizardfolk prize them like prime warhorses, and lavish them with food and care. As spinosauruses age slowly, most large lizardfolk tribes have several young spinosauruses and one adult spinosaurus in their care, reserving the massive adult for major engagements or when the entire tribe must move at once.</p><p><strong>Enormous Size and Color</strong>. This immense saurian has a long, tooth-filled maw, powerful claws, and colorful spines running the length of its back. An adult spinosaurus is 70 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds or more, while a young spinosaurus is a mere 20 feet long, weighing 6,000 pounds or more.</p><p><strong>Swift Predator</strong>. A spinosaurus is at home on both land and water, chasing prey from one to the other when necessary. Though they are carnivores, they have an affinity for lizardfolk and other reptilian humanoids, eating such creatures only if the creatures horribly mistreat them or if they experience extreme starvation with such creatures as the only option for food.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Spinosauruses in the Southlands</h3><p>The lizardfolk of Veles-Sa in the Southlands use spinosauruses as a mode of transportation. The creatures are large enough to pull barges or to carry a crew of raiders anywhere on the rivers, and they are swift overland. Lizardfolk scouts are especially fond of these enormous reptiles, as they are powerful combatants and can carry a dozen lizardfolk warriors.</p><p>In addition to their role as trained raiders in Veles-Sa, some spinosauruses live in or along most of the major river systems of the Southlands—including the River Nuria. There they are also called “river dragons” or sometimes “river walkers,” and they are frequently associated with the worship of Baal-Hotep and Set. They are kept as sacred animals in several river temples, where they are fed regular meals and have been known to grow to enormous size and strength.</p><p>Finally, along the Spice Coast, spinosauruses carry high-value spice cargoes along the coast when banditry is rife or when a lizardfolk mercenary company is available to guard materials going north toward Mhalmet, Nuria, or Ishadia. These Spice Coast beasts are often especially bred for gaudy coloration: green-and-orange, blue-and-gold, and even red-and-black bloodlines have been spotted in the Spice Coast harbors.</p><h3>Spinosauruses as Mounts</h3><p>Spinosauruses mate each year in the winter. A male spinosaurus brings food and helps build an enormous nest of reeds, sticks, and mud. Then the male departs, leaving the female to lay and care for the eggs. Spinosaurus eggs are typically found in nests along riversides or deep in marshes. They are sometimes stolen and sold, generally to lizardfolk and sometimes to daring humans with a knack for training animals. These eggs are worth as much as 2,000 gp apiece; live young are worth twice that. Characters eager for spinosaurus mounts, however, should note that buying or domesticating such an enormous carnivore requires vast quantities of food and patience. They do not take easily to domestication.</p><p>Before it can be ridden in combat, a spinosaurus must practice bearing the weight of its trainer and passengers. They rarely master more than a handful of tricks, but they are extremely comfortable in the water and can be trained to be are aware that some of their riders may not breathe water.</p><p>An adult spinosaurus can carry up to six tons as cargo. Riding a spinosaurus requires an exotic saddle, riding platform, or howdah.</p></article></div>",

      "description": "<blockquote><p>The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw.</p></blockquote><p>Flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse often used by the foolish.</p><p><strong>Taunting Others</strong>. The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.</p><p><strong>Malevolent Purpose</strong>. The results of a flame dragon’s schemes are secondary to the enjoyment it derives from pursuing a nebulous and ever-changing goal. Some flame dragons spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into dire insults. The vengeance itself is secondary to an excuse for hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge. Each is a delightful hobby. Any disruption in their game kindles a terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.</p><p><strong>Fond of Souvenirs</strong>. Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.</p><p><strong>Vengeful Brethren</strong>. Nothing is safe from a flame dragon’s scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided attention for generations. Wiser still, is to remove all trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.</p>",

      "description": "<blockquote><p>Covered in black spikes, the dragon’s eyeless head swings from side to side. Darkness creeps from its strange, eel-like hide, spreading like ink in water.</p></blockquote><p>Apex predators of the underworld, cave dragons are the stuff of nightmare for creatures with little else to fear. They can speak, but they value silence, speaking rarely except when bargaining for food.</p><p><strong>Born to Darkness</strong>. Eyeless, these dragons have long, thin spikes that help them navigate tunnels or seal passages around them, preventing foes from outflanking them. Their stunted wings are little more than feelers, useful in rushing down tunnels. Their narrow snouts poke into tight passages, which their tongues scour free of bats and vermin. Young cave dragons and wyrmlings can fly, poorly, but older specimens lose the gift of flight. Cave dragon hide is more like eel skin than reptilian scales, and it grows mottled with brown and black as it ages.</p><p><strong>Ravenous Marauders</strong>. Cave dragons are always hungry and ready to eat everything. They devour undead, plant creatures, or anything organic. When feeding, they treat all nearby creatures as both a threat and the next course. Alliances they make only last so long as their allies make themselves scarce when the dragon feeds. They can be bribed with food as easily as with gold, but other attempts at diplomacy typically fail. Cave dragons do form alliances with peoples of the underworld, joining them in battle against enemies, but there is always a price to be paid in flesh, bone, and marrow. Wise allies keep a cave dragon well fed.</p><p><strong>A Hard Life</strong>. Limited food underground makes truly ancient cave dragons almost unheard of. The eldest tend to die of starvation after stripping their territory bare of prey. Their nigh-endless hunger leaves the ancients the most likely of cave dragons to form alliances, especially with allies that promise—and deliver—food. On occasion, cave dragons climb to the surface to feed, but their earthbound, plodding pace leaves them outcompeted by other predators or unable to keep up with swift or flying prey. They prefer tight tunnels where they can ambush and outmaneuver prey.</p><p><strong>Edible Hoards and Vertical Lairs</strong>. Due to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon’s hoard may consist largely of food sources: bat colonies, enormous beetles, carcasses in states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn’t immediately devour. Cave dragons are fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, arranged like artful ossuaries. Large vertical chimneys serve as nesting sites for eggs and are popular resting places when a cave dragon sleeps within its lair. Chimneys just wide enough to hold young cave dragons make preferred ambush sites, as the dragons’ tough spikes help hold them in position until prey passes beneath. The oldest cave dragons also retreat to vertical chimneys near nesting sites or within their lairs to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.</p><h2>A Cave Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Labyrinthine systems of tunnels, caverns, and chasms make up the world of cave dragons. They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Cave-In</strong>. The ceiling collapses above one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must make a [[/save dex 15 format=long]]. On a failure, a creature takes [[/damage 3d6 bludgeoning average]] damage and is knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone} and buried. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone or buried. A buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take an action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a [[/check str 15 format=long]].</p></li><li><p><strong>Release the Vermin</strong>. A 20-foot radius sphere of insects appears centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. When a creature enters the cloud of insects for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a [[/save con 15 format=long]], taking [[/damage 2d10 piercing average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cloud of insects lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Split the Earth</strong>. A crack appears in the ground within 120 feet of the dragon that is 10 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 20 feet deep. Each creature standing on a spot where the crack opens must succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or fall in, taking falling damage. A creature that successfully saves moves with the crack’s edge as it opens. The crack remains open for 1 minute, until the dragon uses this lair action again, or until the dragon dies</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary cave dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Flight of the Beetles</strong>. Swarms of vermin within 1 mile of the lair increase in both size and number as their populations try to survive the dragon’s undiscriminating hunger.</p></li><li><p><strong>Toxic Air</strong>. Once each hour, poisonous and odorless gases fill random passages and caverns for 1 minute, and just as quickly disperse, within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Water Underground</strong>. Each time the dragon’s temper flares, but no more often than once every 30 days, flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within 6 miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

The fires within a tophet’s bronze body are largely magical and fueled by sacrifices. They don’t require more than a symbolic amount of wood or coal to keep burning, but they do require sacrifices of food, cloth, and living creatures to keep them under control. A tophet that is not granted a sacrifice when it demands one might go on a fiery rampage, burning down buildings, granaries, or barns until its hunger is satisfied.</p>",

      "description": "<blockquote><p>Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat.</p></blockquote><p>Wind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter.</p><p><strong>Braggarts and Bullies</strong>. Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants of mortal creatures. The sometimes-foolhardy creatures take offense at any perceived challenge and pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance—they perceive mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for their loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of that life in the first place.</p><p><strong>Lords of the Far Horizons</strong>. Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust and roam far from their thrones. They return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.</p><p><strong>Perpetual Infighting</strong>. These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus, their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.</p><p><strong>Portable Hoards</strong>. Wind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a small number of notable trophies or unique historic items—often quite portable.</p><h2>A Wind Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>Wind dragons make their lairs where they can overlook and dominate their claims, but the location must be remote enough that inhabitants can’t pester them with requests for protection or justice. As they have little to fear from the elements, a shallow cave high on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs. They perch in the howling wind and catch updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through canyons and tearing across crags.</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Air Blast</strong>. A torrent of wind blasts outward in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a [[/save str 15 format=long]] or be knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone} and &amp;Reference[stunned]{stunned} until the end of its next turn. Flying creatures, other than wind dragons, have disadvantage on the saving throw.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blinding Wind</strong>. Sand and dust swirls up from the ground in a cylinder that is 30 feet tall with a 20-foot radius, centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The area within the cylinder is &amp;Reference[difficult terrain]. A creature that enters the cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[blinded]{blinded} until the end of its next turn. The cylinder of sand and dust lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gale Force Smash</strong>. A blast of wind slams into a surface of the lair and sends fragments of ice and stone flying out from a point on the ground, wall, or ceiling the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a [[/save dex 15 format=long]] taking [[/damage 4d8 bludgeoning average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p></li></ul>",

Unofficial embassies exist in Zobeck, the Ironcrag Cantons, Krakova, and Magdar. Other hidden outposts may lurk below the Seven Cities, Illyria, or beyond.</p><p>Their patience and willingness to convert enemies into followers makes lasting victories against the darakhul difficult. Three full legions of ghouls serve Emperor Nicoforus directly, and a dozen more legions of varying quality press the fight to other races of the Underworld.</p><h3>Lords Subterranean</h3><p>Deep under the tiny duchy of Morgau and Doresh lies the heart of a dark empire: the Empire of the Ghouls, flesh-eating and blasphemous worshippers of the Gods of Death, Hunger, and Darkness who visit surface only to feed. Their empire rose long ago with the first darakhul to answer a diabolist’s summons.</p><p>The darakhul were born of strange magic: ghouls with intelligence, with necromantic power, and with the ambition to rule everything below the earth. Some say the first of them became undead through sheer will and boundless depravity. Others say that the darakhul are the children of a mythical ghoul-dragon named Darrakh, who still roams the grey wastelands between life and death.</p><p>The truth is lost; the first centuries before the ghoul empire rose are largely hidden from history. The darakhul may have been smarter, stronger, and more ruthless than ghasts or common ghouls, but they were also fewer in number. Each darakhul sought power over his fellows, creating an endless line of petty kings, hunger cults led by charismatic death priests, and necromantic kingdoms founded on the back of a single eldritch master. Nothing came of them but more effective looting of the tombs and cemeteries. When the early kingdoms are remembered at all among the darakhul, it is as the Time of Warring Kings.</p><p>The true birth of darakhul power begins with their emperors. The Dread and Endless Imperium of the Darakhul is an undead civilization buried deep beneath the earth, feeding on flesh and always extending its power, fighting an eternal war against all that lives and breathes. Well-hidden, it grown in strength, in knowledge, and in numbers.</p><p>Speed and ferocity carried the darakhul to their first conquests. Cunning magic and ruthless rage have kept their empire together. Their emperor’s plan and his followers’ unwavering loyalty will propel the empire ever forward.</p><h3>Ghoul Emperors</h3><p>Four great emperors ruled the ghouls, each giving homage to the Death God Anu-Akma and to Mordiggian, the Demon Lord of Ghouls, also called Vardesain. To honor these gods, each emperor expanded the empire below the earth through conquest. Ghouls have few friends, and their violent empire is constantly at war. For the most part, their wars have been successful ones.</p><p>The first emperor, Tonderil the Bonebreaker, worked for 23 years to unite the scattered darakhul lords and petty kings under his command, and indeed he destroyed them all or forced them to swear allegiance to him. The ghouls measure time from the year when his greatest foes bowed to him. With their fealty, his former foes were granted titles and offices; they became the founders of the Temple of the Hunger God, the Fane of the Necrophagi, and the general of the Royal Bastards Legion. The best title went to the victor, of course, as Tonderil crowned himself emperor.</p><p>His rule did not last. Tonderil was destroyed in battle, leading the charge that broke the defending lines at the lost derro city of Gonderif. He had ruled just nine years as emperor of all the ghouls, but he laid the foundation for everything that was to come: their magic, their legions, and their aristocracy of rival dukes, priests, and marquises.</p><p>His first victories against the dark elves and the deep dwarves destroyed entire cities of the Spider Goddess and the Forge God Volund, bringing thousands of slaves into the flesh markets. The pattern of expansion was set, using the ghoul’s magic of feeding and frenzy, of shadows and death. The darakhul necromancers grew more powerful than any known on the surface world. Their unceasing toil made them strong. Their armies created new soldiers with each victory.</p><p>Second to sit the throne was one of Tonderil’s spawn. Empress Haresha Winterblood’s power derived from her fortune in battle: she was the only surviving general at Gonderif, so she returned home in triumph and claimed the throne. Though a powerful priest of Anu-Akma and an able strategist, she failed to keep an eye on her closest followers, dying twelve years later in a coup.</p><p>Vermesail the Gravedancer, the general who staged the coup, was paranoid and suspicious because of how he seized power. He turned many darakhul generals, priests, and necromancers against one another rather than turning outward to seize new territory. The empire shrank during his reign, and Vermesail died in magical combat against drow assassins who were devoured by masses of guards shortly after they cut Vermesail down.</p><p>Vermesail’s chosen successor died at his side. In the interregnum, almost all the Dukes declared themselves emperor, including a “Beggar King.” When Duke Nicoforus’ legions marched into the White City, the Beggar King was put to flight.</p><p>Since that day, the fourth emperor, Nicoforus the Pale, has ruled for 20 years with cunning and relentless cruelty. He recently took revenge on the drow for his predecessor’s death, first sending a bone collective to assassinate the drow high priestess, then destroying their city utterly, taking all dark elves prisoner, eating the weak and transforming the strongest. Under Nicoforus’ rule, the necrophagi prosper, for he trusts the arcane powers more than the divine ones of the various high priests. Demons claim that Vardesain, the Demon Lord of Ghouls, has grown in stature in the Abyss with the empire’s successes.</p></article></div><p> </p>",

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter.</p><p><strong>Braggarts and Bullies</strong>. Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants of mortal creatures. The sometimes-foolhardy creatures take offense at any perceived challenge and pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance—they perceive mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for their loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of that life in the first place.</p><p><strong>Lords of the Far Horizons</strong>. Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust and roam far from their thrones. They return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.</p><p><strong>Perpetual Infighting</strong>. These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus, their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.</p><p><strong>Portable Hoards</strong>. Wind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a small number of notable trophies or unique historic items—often quite portable.</p>",

A few larvae survive by adhering to the clothing or equipment of someone who escaped from a full-grown mimic’s attack.

It gives a friendly smile, revealing small fangs.</p></blockquote><p>To most, the shadow fey are little more than a dancing shadow among the leaves. To savants, they are the creatures that taught the shadowdancers all they know—and kept many secrets to themselves. They were once elves like all others, dwelling in mortal lands beneath the sun. An ancient catastrophe drove them to darkness, and now they are creatures of the shadow. Though they can be found on the Material Plane, they are inextricably tied to the Plane of Shadow, and that is the seat of their power and culture. Their bond with darkness allows the shadow fey to slip through distant spaces, traversing darkness itself from one place to another.</p><p><strong>Shadow Elves</strong>. Shadow fey superficially resemble other elves, but they’re rarely mistaken for their light-bound cousins. Skin tones among the shadow fey range from alabaster white to ebony black, with shades of gray in between, but they otherwise lack color. A few have a scintillating shimmer to their skin. Many shadow fey grow horns that sweep out from their hair, varying in size from subtle nubs to obvious spikes. Others have shocking sets of teeth.</p><p><strong>Dual Natured</strong>. The shadow fey are contradictory beings. They boast some of the best features of elves, tempered by aspects of a fouler nature. They can be deliberate and purposeful, but they’re also given to perplexing whimsy. Mortal creatures trying to fathom shadow fey motivations are in for a maddening experience; they are often illogical, capricious, and seemingly thrive on annoying others. </p><p><strong>Split Rulership</strong>. The Summer Court and Winter Court each rule the shadow fey in the appropriate season. The turning of these seasons follows no clear calendar or schedule, though it is skewed toward summer. The Queen of Night and Magic and the Moonlit King each claim dominion in turn, ruling over the Summer and Winter courts respectively.</p>",

Its large fins double as wings.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Divine Dragons</strong>. Sea dragons are the children of the ocean and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they might be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea. Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.</p><p><strong>Shipwreck Art</strong>. Sea dragons love collecting treasure. They especially prize the sunken, treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate  all wealth, they prefer hardy items that stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.</p><p><strong>Sunken Memorials</strong>. A sea dragon’s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Priests of Seggotan</h3><p>Every sea dragon is devoted to the dragon god of the sea. As a result, many sea dragons use the innate spellcasting variant.

      "description": "<blockquote><p>A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon’s body.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Children of the Stars</strong>. Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world and wander between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons barely notice.</p><p><strong>Witnesses to the Void</strong>. Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures. But they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the Void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing takes a toll. Void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.</p><p><strong>Voracious Scholars</strong>. Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, Void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.</p><h2>A Void Dragon’s Lair</h2><p>The true lair of a Void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless space between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the Void dragon’s lair rests in the great Void of space.</p><p>When a Void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to its treasure hoard hidden in the Void. That connection has repercussions, of course. The most powerful Void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.</p><p>When encountered in its lair, an adult Void dragon has a challenge rating of 17 (18,000 XP), and the ancient Void dragon has a challenge rating of 25 (75,000 XP).</p><h3>Lair Actions</h3><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Orb of the Void</strong>. The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The sphere spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a [[/save con 15 format=long]], taking [[/damage 3d6 cold average]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes [[/damage 3d6 cold average]] damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spatial Anomaly</strong>. The lair’s connection to the Void briefly rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist at the same point in space and time. The laws of reality repel the creatures back to their original positions as reality resets. The targets aren’t actually moved, but reality’s reset forces each target to make a [[/save str 15 format=long]]. On a failure, the creature takes [[/damage 3d10 force average]] damage and is knocked &amp;Reference[prone]{prone}. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Zero Gravity</strong>. Gravity stops working in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that cylinder drifts 10 feet away from the ground and must succeed on a [[/save str 15 format=long]] or be &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained}. A flying creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw, but its speed is halved unless it can hover or flies magically. This effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p></li></ul><h2>Regional Effects</h2><p>The region containing a legendary Void dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dark of the Void</strong>. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light within 6 miles of the lair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Torn Veil</strong>. Within 3 miles of the lair, disembodied voices whisper in the night. Celestials, Fey, and Fiends with a challenge rating of 2 or lower can choose to slip into the Material Plane from their native planes or vice versa.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uncovered Knowledge</strong>. Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.</p></li></ul><p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>",

Many traditional tales tell of jaculi in the southern forests working as teams to separate merchants and other travelers from their wealth, figuring out ways to abscond with gems and jewelry before the owners even know they’ve been robbed.

Burrowlings work together at every task: digging tunnels, foraging, and rearing their young. They are omnivorous, eating roots, berries, insects, and reptiles—and they consider snakes a particular delicacy. The most advanced burrowling towns set up rudimentary farms, where they grow the fruits and vegetables they usually find in the wild.</p><p><strong>Safe Warrens.</strong> Some towns have domesticated prairie dogs, which burrowlings train to stand watch alongside their masters. Pairs of adults stand watch around the town perimeter and sound a warning when they spot a foe. An alerted town retreats to the safety of its warrens, while the strongest creatures add more tunnels if necessary, and close access from the surface until the threat has passed. In combat, burrowlings stand together in defense of the helpless young and fight with crude slings or their sharp teeth and claws.</p><p><strong>Die of Loneliness</strong>. If separated from its coterie, a burrowling becomes despondent, crying for others of its kind. A lone burrowling usually dies of loneliness within a week, unless it can find its way back to its town or discover another burrowling town. Rarely, a solitary creature makes its way to a non-burrowling settlement where it attempts to assist its new community. This frustrates the creature and those it interacts with as it tries to anticipate what its companions want. It may join an adventuring party in the hope of returning to a settlement. After spending at least six months with a party, the burrowling can use its Burrow Awareness with its new allies. Burrowlings live up to 15 years and can have a litter of pups up to twice a year. A burrowling pup reaches adulthood in a year.</p><div class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"modules/kp-tome-of-beasts-1-2023/artwork/branding/Kobold-Press-Mascot.webp\" /></figure><article><h3>Burrowlings in Midgard</h3><p>Burrowling towns are found in the Western Wastes, where their greatest enemies are dust goblins.
