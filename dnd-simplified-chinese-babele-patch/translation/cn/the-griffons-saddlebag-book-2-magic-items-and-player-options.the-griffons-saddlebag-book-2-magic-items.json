It was so loud I feared the warriors would hear it as clearly as I was. One of the warriors, a woman in a lion's mask, sniffed the air and turned to the old pine under which we sat. She said something to her companions and walked to where we hid, holding her spear in one hand and something else in the other.</em></p>\n<p><em>She walked to the tree and placed a mask on the ground: a mule's. Without a word, she returned to the rest of the group and vanished as easily as they had come.</em></p>\n<p><em>—excerpt from the diary of Garold, the soldier</em></p>",

If you are a warlock, you also gain a +3 bonus to your spell attack rolls and saving throw DCs of your warlock spells while holding the rod.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>An eerie, green flame erupts from the head of this rod when you hold it, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While holding the rod, you can use a bonus action to mentally snuff out or relight the flames. While the flames are lit, you can use an action to make a ranged spell attack with it, using your spell attack bonus, out to a range of 30 feet. When you do, the flaming rod emits a phantasmal skull that flies out to attack the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. The skull disappears immediately after the attack.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> <em>Morath, Scepter of the Soul Vortex</em> has the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n<li>1 major detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em></em> The rod has 8 charges and regains [[/r 1d3 + 1 #Morath, Scepter of the Soul Vortex - regain charges]] expended charges daily at dawn. When you reduce a humanoid to 0 hit points, the rod regains 1 expended charge. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell attack bonus and spell save DC: @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Bestow Curse]{bestow curse} (1 charge), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Circle of Death]{circle of death} (4 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Confusion]{confusion} (2 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Insect Plague]{insect plague} (3 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Ray of Enfeeblement]{ray of enfeeblement} (1 charge), or @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Speak with Dead]{speak with dead} (1 charge).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><em><strong>Bestow Greater Curse</strong></em></em><strong>.</strong> When you cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Bestow Curse]{bestow curse} spell while holding the rod using either the rod or a spell slot, you can choose to force the creature to make the saving throw with disadvantage.

Once the rod has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> Morath, Scepter of the Soul Vortex</em> is a sentient chaotic evil rod with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 13, and Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The rod communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. While you are attuned to it, it also understands every language you know. It can choose to communicate with other creatures by manifesting the phantasmal skull above the rod and using it to speak.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em></em> The rod is possessed by Morath, the first human to ever die, and is an independent spirit from within the Thousand Voices, the largest collection of discordant lost souls found within the multiverse. Morath's time on the Material Plane was short, but filled with pain and confusion. As a result, Morath seeks to experience humankind's most base desires vicariously through the actions of the rod's wielder, often attempting to compel the wielder to give in to such urges in moments of weakness.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em></em> The rod bears a curse that affects any non-human that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. When you die while cursed in this way, you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spell save DC. On a failed save, or if the rod is more than 100 feet away from you when you die, your soul is immediately siphoned into and becomes a part of the Thousand Voices, leaving your body a vacant husk and unable to return to life by any means short of a wish spell. On a successful save, your soul leaves your body and enters the rod, as if you had cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Majic Jar]{magic jar} spell, using the rod as a container. You can only return to your body if it's holding the rod, but can otherwise gain the benefits of the spell as normal. If your soul returns to your body, you return to life with 1 hit point. While your soul is detached from your body in this way, your attunement to the rod is carried over to any other creature you possess for the duration.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Scepter.</strong></em> The only way to destroy the rod is to destroy Morath while your soul is contained within the rod. When you do, use your original body's statistics and abilities for your soul, with the exception that your hit point maximum is halved. Use the archmage stat block for Morath's soul. From outside the rod, this combat resolves instantaneously, regardless of how much time passed within the rod during the battle. If you die while within the rod in this way, your soul is lost to the Thousand Voices. If Morath dies, the rod is destroyed and you return to your body with 1 hit point, regardless of where your body is at the time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flavour:</strong> <em>My soul is one of an infinite number of lost lives.

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to attach a number of magical strings equal to the charges spent to a humanoid that you can see within 60 feet of you. You can attach 1 string to each of the creature's limbs, including its head. For example, a humanoid with two legs, two arms, and only one head could have a maximum of 5 strings attached to it. The strings are invisible, but can be seen by a creature with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Dealing 10 slashing damage with a magical weapon attack to one of the strings (AC 10) causes it to detach and disappear. At the end of each of its turns, a strung creature can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, breaking free of and destroying any number of the strings connected to it on a success. The strings break early if the creature is more than 100 feet away from you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While a creature has a string attached to one or more of its limbs, the following effects occur depending on the location of the strings:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Arm or Hand.</strong></em> A creature with a string attached to one of its arms or hands must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw each time it attempts to use it, such as making a weapon attack, climbing a wall, or using an item. On a failed save, the action, attack, check, or saving throw fails and is lost. If an action requires multiple arms and only one of the creature's arms has a string attached, it makes this saving throw with advantage. If the strung arm is holding a shield, the creature doesn't gain the benefits of holding it for the duration. In addition, you can use an action to force the creature to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, dropping any number of items it's holding with the strung arms or hands on a failure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Head.</strong></em> A creature with a string attached to its head has disadvantage on Intelligence checks, Wisdom (Perception) checks, and Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell when it takes damage. You can use an action to force the creature to speak on your turn, saying a word or phrase no longer than twenty-five words.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Leg.</strong></em> A creature with a string attached to one or more of its legs (or similar limbs) has its speed reduced by 15 feet for each strung limb. If a flying creature's speed is reduced to 0 in this way, it falls to the ground at a rate of 60 feet per round and takes no falling damage when it lands.

You can twist the handles again as an action to return the vehicle to its rod form. The vehicle can appear underneath you, with you standing astride it, or in an empty space within 5 feet of you (your choice). The vehicle is a Medium magical object, called a magicycle, and has the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The vehicle has AC 14, 40 hit points, and a speed of 60 feet. While moving, its AC becomes 17. When underwater, it ceases to function and immediately reverts to its rod form.</li>\n<li>The vehicle weighs 200 pounds. If it falls prone, it can't right itself until a creature within reach pulls it upright as an action.</li>\n<li>One Small or Medium creature drives and steers the vehicle. It can carry up to 300 pounds and comfortably fits either one Medium creature or two smaller ones.</li>\n<li>If the vehicle moves in a straight line for 600 feet, its speed increases to 100 feet until the next time it makes a significant turn or until it slows down or comes to a stop.</li>\n<li>For every uninterrupted period of 8 hours that the vehicle is in its rod form or goes unmoved, it regains 1d8 hit points. If it drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its rod form and can't be used again until 5 days have passed.</li>\n<li>When you make a Dexterity saving throw while riding the vehicle, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. On a successful save, you can drive the vehicle up to 20 feet as part of the reaction. If moving in this way causes you to no longer be in the triggering effect's area, such as an ancient red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell, you instead take no damage, instead of half damage, from the effect.
