When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra [[/r 3d6[Cold] #Quiver of Elemental Chaos - Ice Ammunition]] cold damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. On a success, the target's speed is halved until the end of its next turn. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw. A paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect ends early if the paralyzed target takes fire damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Magma Ammunition.</strong></em> This special piece of glimmering ammunition is warm to the touch and flakes off in sooty pieces. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra [[/r 3d6[Fire] #Quiver of Elemental Chaos - Magma Ammunition]] fire damage. Hit or miss, the area in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact becomes unbearably hot until the end of the turn. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion from the sudden flash of heat. A creature with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Ooze Ammunition.</strong></em> This special piece of sticky ammunition gives off a faint, alchemical odor. This ammunition creates a unique @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Grease]{grease} spell (save DC 15) at the point of impact.

While attuned to the armor, you gain the following flaw: “I am duty-bound to lay out the perfect plan for every situation. Uncertainty is unacceptable.” In addition, if you are attuned to the armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or your GM determine who this person is. You consider this person your field commander and put their plans ahead of your own and trust them implicitly. You can't attune to the <em>Red Queen's burden</em> or the <em>Violet King's promise</em>. If you're already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your field commander, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the <em>Red Queen's burden</em> or <em>Violet King's promise</em> without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Greater Restoration]{greater restoration} spell, but not while you are attuned to the armor.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flavour:</strong> <em>The yellow of the royal scouts' armor was well known throughout their lands.

You can only have one spell readied at a time in this way.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Emergency Spell.</strong></em> When a creature hits you with an attack or you take damage, you can use your reaction and spend 6 sorcery points to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action or bonus action.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Expanded Spell.</strong></em> When you cast a spell that affects an area such as a line, cone, or sphere, you can spend 2 sorcery points to increase its area of affect. A line's length increases by 15 feet, a cone's size increases by 5 feet, a cube's size increases by 5 feet on a side, a sphere's radius increases by 5 feet, and a cylinder's diameter or height increases by 5 feet or 10 feet, respectively (your choice).</p>\n<hr /><p><strong>Flavour:</strong>\n<em>Sream brushed the sand from her scarlet robes, taking care not to scuff the careful golden trim.

Her pilgrimage across the dunes had taught her more about herself than the books she'd read in her youth, and led her to find the magic deep inside of her. She felt it stirring inside of her, this magic, with earnest recognition.

In addition, you can feed one piece of paper to the hat using an action, destroying the paper. The hat happily accepts any paper it's fed and wiggles about as the page is chewed and swallowed. If you're wearing the hat, you immediately know any information that was contained on the piece of paper as if you had read it. If the paper or its contents were magical, it's immediately spat back out by the hat.

When the hat communicates with you in this way, it can only transmit simple emotions and images. While you are attuned to it, the hat understands every language you know.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The hat loves nothing more than being worn and eating bits of paper and is easily befriended by creatures who pet it. The hat's button eyes can't move, but it uses its cloth folds to change its expression at will.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flavour:</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"It likes poetry more than love letters, and fiction more than historical documents.

Immediately after you roll a 12 on a d12 damage die in this way, each creature within 5 feet of the greatclub (other than yourself) must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d12 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, as the weapon's crystals explode into shrapnel. Once the crystal explodes, the weapon's damage die becomes a d8 again.</p>\n<hr /><p><strong>Flavour:</strong>\n<em>Deep in the Direstone mines, cave trolls linger and carefully collects trinkets from the neighboring dwarven city.

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Run over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

His chariot was trailed closely by a retinue of pale figures most familiar to us. Our fathers &amp; mothers. Our grandfathers &amp; grandmothers. Our great grandfathers &amp; great grandmothers.

When it finds a patch of particularly rich soil, the ball rolls around in it to incorporate the dirt into its form. The ball carries captured moisture inside itself, allowing it to make its form either dusty or clay-like in texture, as well as hard or soft to the touch. A friendly <em>ball of wild earth</em> can magically reshape the dirt it's covered in to form a variety of shapes at will, such as a tiny figurine or a large die, provided that the dirt continues to cover the pebble at its center by doing so.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <em>ball of wild earth</em> is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a speed of 10 feet and can only move by rolling across the ground. It has AC 10, 15 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The ball regains all its hit points if it's left buried underground for at least 1 hour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>ball of wild earth</em> is a sentient neutral item with an Intelligence of 2, a Wisdom of 6, and a Charisma of 4. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can't speak or read, but understands Common and Terran.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The <em>ball of wild earth</em> is most happy when rolling through rich, healthy soil. Most can be found, at least initially, in mountainous farmlands, but even urban ones can enjoy the dust and traces of weird, foreign dirt that are ever-present in well-traveled cities. The quickest way to make a <em>ball of wild earth happy</em> is to give it gemstone dust to roll in, whereas removing the dirt and mud that surround its central pebble is certain to upset it. By reforming the dirt covering its form, the ball can make vague facial expressions based on the emotions its seen other creatures make.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flavour:</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Who's a dirty little marble?
