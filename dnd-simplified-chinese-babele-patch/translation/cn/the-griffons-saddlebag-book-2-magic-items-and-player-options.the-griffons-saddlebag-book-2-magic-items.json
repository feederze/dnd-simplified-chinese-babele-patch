This version of the spell causes the summoned weapon to take the form of a bow that shares your space and moves with you, as opposed to moving independently. The bow makes ranged spell attacks, instead of melee ones, with spectral arrows that have a range of 30 feet. Once the armor has been used to cast this spell, it can't cast it again until the next dawn. Additionally, when you stabilize a creature using this armor's command word, roll a d20. On a 20, the creature regains 1 hit point.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This armor is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Remove Curse]{remove curse} spell. While cursed, your legs magically change shape to become hooved and equine, unless they already are, and you take a –5 penalty to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In addition, while cursed, the distance you can jump without a running start is halved.</p>\n<hr /><p><strong>Flavour:</strong>\n<em>Those that take the oath know the risks.

While attuned to the armor, you gain the following flaw: “I am duty-bound to lay out the perfect plan for every situation. Uncertainty is unacceptable.” In addition, if you are attuned to the armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or your GM determine who this person is. You consider this person your field commander and put their plans ahead of your own and trust them implicitly. You can't attune to the <em>Red Queen's burden</em> or the <em>Violet King's promise</em>.

The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your field commander, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the <em>Red Queen's burden</em> or <em>Violet King's promise</em> without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found.

The elemental is in the form of a fox and can't move farther than 100 feet from the fire in which its charm is kept. The elemental's singular goal is to supply this fire with fuel.

Believed by some to be a demigod of pocket dimensions and craftsmen everywhere, the griffon is a patron of artificers and creators across the multiverse. The griffon creates magical items in its great forge using materials collected from various planes of existence to add to its collection. While no one knows exactly how to contact the griffon, it has a knack for knowing what items are needed by whom.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Superior Holding.</strong></em> This 1-foot-wide bag always weighs 3 pounds, regardless of what’s inside it. It functions as a <em>bag of holding</em> that can only be pierced by another artifact. Placing a <em>bag of holding,</em> <em>handy haversack</em>, <em>portable hole</em>, or similar item inside the extradimensional space created by the saddlebag, or vice versa, destroys the extradimensional item but leaves the saddlebag unharmed. Any item stored within the other extradimensional space is magically moved to the space within the saddlebag instead. If doing so overloads the bag, random contents from either space are scattered in the Astral Plane.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Magic Courier.</strong></em> At the GM’s discretion, the saddlebag’s beak opens up to reveal a letter. The magical script can be read by all creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. The note is a delivery request or similar that includes the name of an item as well as either specific or vague descriptions of a person or place. At the bottom of the letter is a price listed in coins or other form of payment, as well as a date or time depending on its urgency.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the saddlebag is brought to the described person or place within the allotted time, it dispenses the magical item into the hand of the appropriate recipient. If the payment isn’t received by the bag within 1 hour of dispensing the magic item, the item vanishes and is lost. After receiving the payment for an item in this way, the bag’s beak reopens to dispense a reward for the courier.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Sell Magic Items.</strong></em> The saddlebag has a connection to the griffon’s forge on the Astral Plane. Depending on the magic item, you can sell a magic item to the saddlebag for half the cost of its base price.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> The saddlebag has 8 charges and regains [[/r 1d6 + 2 #The Griffon's Saddlebag - recharges expended charges]] expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the saddlebag, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it: @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Detect Magic]{detect magic} (1 charge), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Identify]{identify} (1 charge), or @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Legend Lore]{legend lore} (5 charges).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Additional Spells.</strong></em> At the GM’s discretion, such as after reaching certain milestones or completing Magic Courier quests, the saddlebag may offer the following additional spells that can be cast from it: @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Blink]{blink} (3 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Dimension Door]{dimension door} (4 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Divination]{divination} (4 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Etherealness]{etherealness} (7 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Fly]{fly} (3 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Magnificent Mansion]{magnificent mansion} (7 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Plane Shift]{plane shift} (7 charges), or @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Secret Chest]{secret chest} (4 charges).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The saddlebag is a sentient chaotic neutral bag with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The bag can speak, read, and understand Common. When in the presence of only creatures it trusts, the bag’s beak moves when it speaks. Otherwise, the bag communicates telepathically with its wearer. The bag can speak and communicate with griffons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The bag’s purpose is to carry, collect, and deliver magic items. Different bags have different personalities, but they are for the most part largely pleasant to talk to. Their voices are bird-like and are filled with occasional coos and squawks, and their stitched eyes widen, squint, and move expressively.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If the bag’s wearer or allies fail to fulfill Magic Courier quests, it may stop offering its magic to them. If it does, their items may be lost or inaccessible within the bag, or potentially spat out. While the bag provides the names of item recipients and delivery locations, it doesn’t know any more information than what was provided to it by the astral griffon. Regardless, it does its best to help its wearer and allies find the specified person or location on the letter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Griffon’s Saddlebag.</strong></em> While there is no way to permanently destroy the saddlebag, piercing it with an artifact returns it to its place of origin for repair before it’s returned to the multiverse in a new location. Placing a <em>Griffon’s Saddlebag</em> inside the extradimensional space created by another <em>Griffon’s Saddlebag</em> returns both items to their place of origin and sends all the items stored within them to the griffon’s forge on the Astral Plane.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flavour:</strong> <em>\"So what do you think it is?\"</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>The half-elf held a bag in his hands.

Her compassion for the daily struggles of common folk was made clear by her visits to local markets and fisheries, as well as the unsupervised nights spent in the local taverns. Raised by a single stalwart father, a pegasus knight without a trace of nobility, she was given the perspective of two worlds: one of the mundane dangers of average life, and the real dangers of martial law.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>At the age of 15, her father was killed by a rampaging dragon in the line of duty. Wracked with anger and spite for the people who led him to his death, it was only then that she realized the impact he had on the royal family. The sitting king and queen, as well as their son, paid her a visit to offer their sympathy and support: an early act of kindness that would shape her growth from her father's loss.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Moved to noble studies and quarters, she grew to befriend the young prince. Time passed, and as is typical in stories such as this, the two fell in love. Set to become the future queen of Orostead, she spent her days studying the nobility, law, and history of the city. Using her meager upbringing as context for her opinion, she could see that many generations of corruption and ill-practiced law threatened to consume the city and leave it a husk of its former glory.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>But the prince grew sick before their coronation. Too sick. One night after reading to him in their bed, she fell asleep. She tossed and turned with nightmares of plague and ruin. Just when she could feel the last of her hope begin to slip away, a light broke through to rid her of the darkness: a shimmering pegasus with the horn of a unicorn.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>It was there that she bargained with the spirit. In exchange for some of its divine power, she would ward off the darkness that threatened to consume them. When she awoke, she found a feather and horn clutched in her hands.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>From then on, the would-be queen nursed her prince back to health, learning the extent of her magic as she went. The prince survived, although his legs would no longer serve him. The two were crowned king and queen, and while the king could often be found in his study or poring over new laws or the grievances of his people, the queen became the voice of the city and its people.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>​</em></p>",

Uncertainty is unacceptable.” In addition, if you are attuned to the armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or your GM determine who this person is. You consider this person your field commander and put their plans ahead of your own and trust them implicitly. You can't attune to the <em>Red Queen's burden</em> or the <em>Violet King's promise</em>.

When you do, each affected creature, including yourself, has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature only benefits from this effect if it remains within 30 feet of you.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The armor has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to use one of the following properties:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>\"At Arrow's Length!\"</strong></em> When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you uses its reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the armor's charges to summon a spectral arrow from the air above it. The arrow flies harmlessly in front of the attacking creature and disappears, distracting them from the attack and causing the roll to be made with disadvantage. If the attacking creature has blindsight, this property has no effect. If you're concentrating on the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Hunter's Mark]{hunter's mark} spell, you can choose to move your mark to this creature as part of your reaction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alternatively, if a hostile creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to immediately move up to half your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>\"From Sky to Earth!\"</strong></em> As an action, you can expend 4 charges from the armor to summon a volley of spectral arrows from the sky, choosing a point that you can see within 120 feet of you when you do. The arrows fall in a 30-foot radius, 60-foot high cylinder centered on that point and then disappear. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>\"There Is No Escape!\"</strong></em> You can use a bonus action to expend up to 3 of the armor's charges to cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Hunter's Mark]{hunter's mark} spell from it. If you choose to expend 2 charges, you cast the spell at 3rd level, or 5th level if you choose to expend 3.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Flaw.</strong></em> The <em>Yellow Harbinger’s path</em> compels its wearer to be cautious and overprepared. While attuned to the armor, you gain the following flaw: “I am duty-bound to lay out the perfect plan for every situation. Uncertainty is unacceptable.” In addition, if you are attuned to the armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or your GM determine who this person is. You consider this person your field commander and put their plans ahead of your own and trust them implicitly. You can't attune to the <em>Red Queen's burden</em> or the <em>Violet King's promise</em>. If you're already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your field commander, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the <em>Red Queen's burden</em> or <em>Violet King's promise</em> without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Greater Restoration]{greater restoration} spell, but not while you are attuned to the armor.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flavour:</strong> <em>The yellow of the royal scouts' armor was well known throughout their lands.

You can only have one spell readied at a time in this way.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Emergency Spell.</strong></em> When a creature hits you with an attack or you take damage, you can use your reaction and spend 6 sorcery points to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action or bonus action.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Expanded Spell.</strong></em> When you cast a spell that affects an area such as a line, cone, or sphere, you can spend 2 sorcery points to increase its area of affect. A line's length increases by 15 feet, a cone's size increases by 5 feet, a cube's size increases by 5 feet on a side, a sphere's radius increases by 5 feet, and a cylinder's diameter or height increases by 5 feet or 10 feet, respectively (your choice).</p>\n<hr /><p><strong>Flavour:</strong>\n<em>Sream brushed the sand from her scarlet robes, taking care not to scuff the careful golden trim.

Her pilgrimage across the dunes had taught her more about herself than the books she'd read in her youth, and led her to find the magic deep inside of her. She felt it stirring inside of her, this magic, with earnest recognition.

In addition, you can feed one piece of paper to the hat using an action, destroying the paper. The hat happily accepts any paper it's fed and wiggles about as the page is chewed and swallowed. If you're wearing the hat, you immediately know any information that was contained on the piece of paper as if you had read it. If the paper or its contents were magical, it's immediately spat back out by the hat.

When the hat communicates with you in this way, it can only transmit simple emotions and images. While you are attuned to it, the hat understands every language you know.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The hat loves nothing more than being worn and eating bits of paper and is easily befriended by creatures who pet it. The hat's button eyes can't move, but it uses its cloth folds to change its expression at will.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flavour:</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"It likes poetry more than love letters, and fiction more than historical documents.

Immediately after you roll a 12 on a d12 damage die in this way, each creature within 5 feet of the greatclub (other than yourself) must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d12 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, as the weapon's crystals explode into shrapnel. Once the crystal explodes, the weapon's damage die becomes a d8 again.</p>\n<hr /><p><strong>Flavour:</strong>\n<em>Deep in the Direstone mines, cave trolls linger and carefully collects trinkets from the neighboring dwarven city.

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Run over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

His chariot was trailed closely by a retinue of pale figures most familiar to us. Our fathers &amp; mothers. Our grandfathers &amp; grandmothers. Our great grandfathers &amp; great grandmothers.

When it finds a patch of particularly rich soil, the ball rolls around in it to incorporate the dirt into its form. The ball carries captured moisture inside itself, allowing it to make its form either dusty or clay-like in texture, as well as hard or soft to the touch. A friendly <em>ball of wild earth</em> can magically reshape the dirt it's covered in to form a variety of shapes at will, such as a tiny figurine or a large die, provided that the dirt continues to cover the pebble at its center by doing so.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The <em>ball of wild earth</em> is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a speed of 10 feet and can only move by rolling across the ground. It has AC 10, 15 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The ball regains all its hit points if it's left buried underground for at least 1 hour.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The <em>ball of wild earth</em> is a sentient neutral item with an Intelligence of 2, a Wisdom of 6, and a Charisma of 4. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can't speak or read, but understands Common and Terran.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>Personality.</em></strong> The <em>ball of wild earth</em> is most happy when rolling through rich, healthy soil. Most can be found, at least initially, in mountainous farmlands, but even urban ones can enjoy the dust and traces of weird, foreign dirt that are ever-present in well-traveled cities. The quickest way to make a <em>ball of wild earth happy</em> is to give it gemstone dust to roll in, whereas removing the dirt and mud that surround its central pebble is certain to upset it. By reforming the dirt covering its form, the ball can make vague facial expressions based on the emotions its seen other creatures make.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Flavour:</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Who's a dirty little marble?

In addition, the first time each day you're struck by a critical hit, the armor's panels splinter into countless shards of painful, wooden shrapnel. Other creatures within 10 feet of you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this happens, the armor's wooden panels are cracked until the following dawn, at which point they magically regrow. Until the panels regrow, the armor can't be splintered again and suffers a –2 penalty to the AC it offers. The panels can't be repaired by magical or mundane means, but a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.Plant Growth]{plant growth} spell can cause the panels to regrow early once before each dawn.</p><p></p><p>If you're attuned to this armor, you're considered proficient with it, and you don't suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make as a result of wearing it.
